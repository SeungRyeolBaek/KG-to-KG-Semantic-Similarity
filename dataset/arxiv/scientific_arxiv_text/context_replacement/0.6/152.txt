recent developments of the ##ics have confirmed the seemingly simple truth that the electron surface of cuprate superconductors is precisely the surface corresponding to lda band structure with the net effect of the change to the p - type state being a large scale distortion of the band structure . the existence of the ` charge carriers ' @ xcite , the temperature dependence pseudogap of the underdoped state @ xcite and the high temperature dependence of the observed band structure @ xcite leave no doubt that a simple one - dimensional model is not entirely adequate for these phenomena . however , recent studies of one - dimensional ( 1d ) metal structures @ xcite have revealed several interesting properties of the spin states . the very apparent nonobservation of these states in the cuprate superconductors at this energy level goes against the seemingly simple truth , namely that the electron surface observed in the cuprates is precisely that of the ` spinons ' in the first state of the tomonaga - luttinger theory ( tll ) , at 1d . inspired by these results , we have performed a rigorous , mathematical analysis of the electron spin states of the 1d and 2d @ xmath0 @ x##math1 @ xmath2 @ . this expression is @ xmath7 . , the ` spin ' spin dependence are written as @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 and the spin dependence on to @ xmath10 . the range @ xmath11 is for all pairs of nearest neighbors in the 1d or 2d crystal lattice . + the spin wave function is written as @ xmath12 , the ground state state and wave function . for large n values , this expression can be calculated directly by means of the lanczos algoritm @ xcite . + for 1d the @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 model is solved to - ansatz in the limit @ xmath2 @ xmath13 @ xmath14 @ xcite , but even for this case the evaluation of the - ansatz solution requires the use of ordinary wave equations . for the closely related lattice model in the limit @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 the non - ansatz solutions are @ xcite , and an exact evaluation of the wave function is given @ xcite. in all these cases lanczos method is the best way to obtain numerical results for @ xmath18 @ xcite . + in order to obtain our numerical results , we also need to get an exact understanding of the physical properties of the charged particles in 1d , which may turn out to be useful even in theory . it has been shown by ogata and shiba @ xcite that for @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 the wave function can be derived from functions of a spinless charge wave function , which depends only on the sequence of the holes , and a momentum wave function , which depends only on the sequence of holes . a simple explanation for this physical phenomenon is the ` splitting ' of a molecule , in a nel - like state into an excited spin - like domain wall , and a charged spinless domain wall . however , since it is the exchange energy @ xmath19 @ xmath0 which moves the spin - like domain walls , whereas the exchange energy @ xmath19 @ xmath2 moves the spin - like domain walls , we can see that the two types of domain walls have different energy levels . since the splitting ofthe spin parts of the wave function ( i . e . , the ` holons ' ) have @ xmath0 as their energy scale , whereas those of the spin part ( i . e . , the ` spinons ' ) have @ xmath2 as their energy scale . + the low - energy spectrum of 1d @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 * , indicates that the majority of the spin states have excitation energies of the form @ xmath20 @ xcite , which indicates the presence of many different spin states with different energy scales . + strangely , the low energy spectrum of the cluster model has the same scale factor of the spin part as in 1d @ xcite , which seems to indicate the presence of both types of spin and charge , if not in equilibrium , in this model . the following properties indicate , however , that these two types of particles do not exist as ` free particles ' : the resulting spin wave function , which corresponds to the ` spin - spin coupling ' of holons and to the spin energy spectrum of 1d @ xcite is nearly linear in scale and has almost zero energylow energy spin @ xcite . the removal spectrum in 2d has an extremely low energy state with large spin @ xmath2 @ xcite - which is quite important for the wave function of the spin , which acts only on the spin degrees of freedom . there is also very strong experimental evidence @ xcite that the hole - like low energy states can be described to a good extent by spin @ xmath21 ` black holes ' @ xcite - i . e . , electrons surrounded only by a dense network of # ##ons . + to obtain more information about similarities and differences between 1d and 2d , and in addition to the experimental data , we have made a direct comparison of the electron removal spectra in both directions . as they are compared , there are some similarities , but also some differences . we find that the main difference between 1d and 2d is a very weak interaction between ` spinon ' and ` holon ' in 2d , which leads to a band of bound states , formed out of the interaction of the spinon and holon states . this band of bound states - which are massive but weak spin @ xmath21 as compared to the free states - then gives the energyfor the low energy state of the state , i . e . , no electron - hole coupling even in 1d states occurs . we start with a description of the 1d state of half - filled . figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the electron capture mechanism for the @ xmath22 - excited state . let us first consider the first step , where energies are given in units of @ xmath2 . here , we can classify the groups of peaks according to their scaling scales with @ xmath0 : there exists a ` band ' of peaks ( denoted as the half - band ) whose energy corresponding to the single - shell ground state at @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 is held constant on the scale of @ xmath0 , i . e . , these peaks with @ xmath2 on their scaling scales . as a direct result , this ` band ' also exists half - filled in the brillouin state , i . e . , there are two peaks whose energy peaks with @ xmath2 at @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 . this looks like a half - filled two - shell state with a quantum number of at @ xmath24, which also is very difficult because the integration is only valid for non - light . also , in addition to this ` @ xmath2 - band ' , there are two sets of states whose binding energy has a more linear relationship with @ xmath0 . however , when observing the two states , with energy in excess of @ xmath0 ( see section of ref . [ fig1 ] ) these values differ , i . e . , to no effect the energy scale of these states is @ xmath0 . this mixture of states with different energy scales can be clearly illustrated by the ` double ##t ' for @ xmath25 @ xmath13 @ xmath26 and for @ xmath27 : the peak with lower binding energy belongs into the @ xmath2 - band , the peak with the higher binding energy belongs to the @ xmath0 - band . the opposite of the @ xmath0 - band is a large energy band with maximum energy @ xmath24 for the same binding energy that we are observing . the states that fall onto this band lead to the formation of a spinon with maximum @ xmat##h4 @ xmath13 @ xmath28 , and the holon of states @ xmath29 . since the spinon momentum is fixed , this branch of peaks therefore only traces out the holon energy . on the other hand , the ` @ xmath2 - peak ' corresponds to the holon energy being fixed at the level of the holon energy , and therefore traces out the spinon momentum . + this time block for the theory can be taken back . however , we can say that not only @ xmath4 but the spinon momentum can serve as the starting point for a new branch of peaks which traces out the entire holon energy . that this is not the case is shown in fig . [ fig2 ] . here , the full range of the theory is shown and we have chosen the zero of energy at the energy level of either the highest ` @ xmath2 - peak ' at @ xmath30 ( left panel ) or the lowest ` @ xmath2 - peak ' at @ xmath31 ( right panel ) . due to this choice of the zero of energy , the ` @ xmath6 of the spinon withthe two energies cancel out . therefore , when measuring energies in excess of @ xmath0 the holon ##s ` are equivalent ' , i . e . , their energies _ corresponding to the corresponding spinon energy _ scales associated with @ xmath0 . therefore , these two pairs of electrons to the n ##s have exactly the same , backfolded nearest - electron energy , i . e . , the energy of the holon is zero @ xmath32 . as shown above , the complete holon band is occupied by the spinons n ##ons , @ xmath30 , so that the position above the energy level at @ xmath33 could be seen in detail . we have already shown that by alligning the spinon band at @ xmath34 , the complete holon band can be constructed . + we can now construct the following building blocks for the whole model : the basis for the whole model is the ` half - wave ' spinon band , with peak @ xmath35 ; this is shown by the two black lines in fig . 1 , where @ xmath36 - peak of this band is the ` peak ' for the complete holon band @ xmat##h37 , which is ` hooked on ' to the spinon band at the band maximum ; these holon bands are represented by the two horizontal lines in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) . comparison with the experimental data ( in this case for the @ xmath38 - 1 experiment ) in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) shows that indeed to great accuracy the components of the elementary electromagnetic wave function map onto these lines . there are also irregularities at the transition frequencies , which therefore is most likely a consequence of the lanczos equations , which are highly nonlinear even at high enough energies . finally , the holon bands in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) have been phase shifted , i . e . , they are ` hooked on ' to the spinon band , yet at their maximum - we have shown that this effect is a function for all band frequencies , and that it also has a band maximum effect . on an interesting note , the field strength seems to be zero for all of these holon bands , i . e . , the strength is a function only of the spinon band ( this seems also to be true for @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath17 and@ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath39 ; ( it should be noted that for these cases the holon band increases itself , which corresponds to a decrease of the peak energy ) . in the second limit , the number of particles increases , and also their peak energy decreases , resulting in excited states . ( with the experimental results of sorella and parola @ xcite for the case @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 it is clear that the first holon band in our limit , starting from the spinon angular momentum , develops into a band - like structure of the same energy . the spinon band itself , whose energy peak is @ xmath2 , develops into a second dispersionless band in this limit , which is the mid - point of @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath17 and @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 . sorella and parola found the peak energy of the second band to be @ xmath40 , which corresponds to both the backfolded and the nearest spin .thus , @ xmath41 . + from the expression for 1d we find that the standard electron removal spectrum has a very simple scaling law , which also holds for different directions and energies . from the comparison of the absorption spectrum with @ xmath2 and @ xmath0 we can identify ` bands ' of absorption which cancel out the absorption of the two internal components of the tll , namely the electron holes and charge carriers . the absorption of the spinons and holons are also associated with the nearest neighbor absorption spectrum , the spinons themselves having a half - filled spin spectrum . although these results may not be very interesting or useful , we find that they show that understanding the physical properties of different clusters is a very simple way to distinguish the different ` subbands ' . in the future , we will make more use of this information to study the much better known cases of 2d and 3d clusters . we go to the 2d case , and we consider also the case of half filled . the clusters shown below correspond to the cluster @ xmath38 - 1 ##d , which is the 2d cluster for which the study of the electron removal spectrum is done first . the 2d3 . the @ xmath42 - net for this cluster , which is shown in fig . [ fig3a ] , consists of the group of peaks which generally follow the @ xmath43 pattern , and a second group of @ xmath44 @ xmath16 @ xmath45 . we would like to note that spectra for these clusters are more consistent with those for the @ xmath38 - net cluster . finally , the right side of fig . [ fig4 ] shows the energy spectrum for this cluster with gap - bands ; here we will focus on energies at a distance @ xmath2 from the top of the band and on energies in excess of @ xmath2 . when the peaks are located at the top of the band , the energies of the first two peak energy bands do not show any significant drift with @ xmath0 . these energies do show a slight but noticeable drift with @ xmath0 , which however is much greater than ~ 1d . a good example is the spectrum of @ xmath46 , whose peak - energy decreases rather than increases with @ xmath0 . this means , however , that the ( very small ) nature of the peak@ xmath44 @ xmath16 @ xmath45 ( i . e . , the smallest of all , g . [ fig4 ] ) agrees with @ xmath0 to good approximation . another possible explanation is the fact that each hole in a 2d hole has two different methods for hopping , firstly by ` effective hopping ' , which gives effective hopping # @ xmath19 @ xmath2 , and secondly by hopping along spiral path @ xcite , which gives ( approximately ) effective hopping ##s @ xmath19 @ xmath0 @ xcite . it may be from @ xcite that the above equation for a 2d hole to good approximation can be written as @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 are arbitrary integers . the first term , which is from the effective hopping # , gives the term which is consistent with @ xmath44 @ xmath16 @ xmath45 and this term is given by the second , which is the term from the spiral path ; this term gives the magnitude of the hopping along this path with @ xmath0 . starting with 1d we see that with the .of @ xmath49 the ` @ xmath2 - band ' is located in the lower brillouin region , i . e . , the spinon - band used as space - filling in 1d does not exist . + we return to the first section of fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) , which shows the overall structure of the spectrum , with energy measured in units of @ xmath0 . it is first of all quite obvious that the peaks here are more ` diffuse ' than in 1d , with the peaks appearing only in the immediate vicinity of the center of the spectrum ( except for a very very small sharp peak in @ xmath49 ) . secondly , among the many peaks of high energy , are peaks whose energy roughly corresponds with @ xmath0 . although these ` peaks ' are very small , so that the effect of energy difference is not directly meaningful , their effect of energy can be easily translated into the term @ xmath50 , which is reminiscent of the concept of the ` holon - band ' introduced by sorella and parola @ xcite in 1d . an important difference when compared to 1d is the fact that this @ xmath0 - band isthey fail to reach the limit of the observed states - but there is the band of @ xmath19 @ xmath0 in the @ xmath2 - band , which contains the remaining bound states . we say that ` in 1d dimensions ' the most correct interpretation of the theory is the concept of bound states of spinon and holon : from a strong interaction between these bound states , which may arise , e . g . , from the well - known strong interaction for spin ##ons in the antiferromagnet @ xcite , one may expect that this band of bound states is formed out of the band of bound spinons and holons . this band of bound states corresponds to the @ xmath2 - band ( which only has a small difference @ xmath51 in its spectrum due to the long range effect ) . such a bound state of spinon and holon should be a bean - bean - bean @ xmath21 state , i . e . , a state completely filled with bound states . there is no experimental evidence @ xcite , that this is not the case of the lowest bound state in vacuum at high energies . one may expect , however , thatsuch a 2d state would not be stable for large distances , and we see that this is the case for the absence of the @ xmath2 - peak in @ xmath49 . in this case , the 2d state of the holon is not a fast spin state , because it is bound to the much larger spinon by the spin independent chemical bond . this observation fits well with the quantum nature of the ` spin ##on ##s function ' @ xcite : this function , which in the tll should describe only the energy of the bound holons , in 2d has almost no diffuse high energy ` peak ' , with almost no diffuse low energy peaks . however , the usual ( in the context of quantum spin ##ons ) use of @ xmath2 as a scale for the energy spectrum is also well understood in terms of the spin - moment of a single spinon - holon in @ xcite . + from the definition for 2d , we have a pair of 2d states , which both have @ xmath2 as the energy scale , and a diffuse low energy ` peak ' with the scale @ xmath0 . thus , the energy of the ` spinonangular momentum ' , as well as the existence of complete ` holon band ' , in direct contrast to the situation at 1d . the combination of two states of spinon and holon , resulting in a half - open state of spin - 1 and spin @ xmath21 , does this in a straightforward way . we return to 1d and consider the general case . figure [ fig5 ] shows the energy peak for the @ xmath22 - spin ##on with @ xmath26 holes . using the energy in terms of @ xmath2 ( left panel ) we can easily determine the spinon band . for @ xmath26 holes and @ xmath22 , the total angular momentum is @ xmath4 @ xmath13 @ xmath52 ( i . e . , half filling of @ xmath31 and @ xmath24 ) and the spinon band extends up to this point . as is the case for half - filling , the energy peaks show a corresponding increase of their total energy , and so the distribution of energy to @ xmath0 ( right panel ) , shows a more complete ` holon band ' , to which these peaks extend .the holon band again takes the form of a backfolded tight - binding band , but this time the edge of the band at @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 is missing . the holon band also appears to contain the electron states at @ xmath4 and at @ xmath5 @ xmath13 @ xmath53 ( the angular momentum is half way between @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 ) . this description of the spectral line also agrees with the exact numerical result in the limit @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 . penc _ et al . _ @ xcite : on the observed spectrum , this spectrum shows a high intensity ` band ' which is very similar to the backfolded tight - binding band of the holon band . in addition there is a dispersionless low intensity band with a specific frequency , which corresponds to the spinon energy in the limit @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 . for example , the numerical result in the limit @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath56 , and our experimental datafor example @ xmath2 , there are only two bands of electrons which cross the same band : the ` main band ' which touches @ xmath3 at @ xmath4 , and the ` side band ' @ xcite , which touches @ xmath3 at @ xmath5 . the ` energy - splitting ' of these two bands may be capable of explaining the well known ( theoretical ) error in the electron transport equation @ xmath57 at @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 , shown by ogata and shiba @ xcite . + the resulting experiments reveal a key feature of the tll , namely a form of mutual exclusion principle which holds for both holons and spinons : the spins of both types of particles are identical upon collision , i . e . , the spinon # ##on appears as if the spinons were pure @ xmath21 particles , and only the spin of the holon ##s is ` broken off ' as if the holons were spinless particles . it should be noted that this is probably not to be expected and that the spins for the individual ` electrons ' of the ' ansat##z ##s must satisfy the gauge - invariant uncertainty principle @ xcite . this has important implications for , e . g . , applications to mean - field theory , which would tend to model this type of particle as a gas . although spin - charge separation is often used as basis for the mean - field approximation , it is clear that this approach would fail to explain the observed behavior even when in 1d , the only case where spin - charge separation is still possible . + for a more detailed description of the hole surface , we note that the angular momentum for the small @ xmath58 is @ xmath59 . for this , the first branch of high energy particles is @ xmath3 . for small @ xmath58 the second branch of high energy particles reaches up to @ xmath3 and @ xmath60 . the two resulting particles together form the hole pocket of small @ xmath61 as one would expect for those bound to spinless particles . it is easy to see , that this hole pocket is nothing but the shadow of the holon ` zero point ' at @ xmath23 @ xmat##h13 @ xmath39 : the low energy regions , which may be thought of as corresponding to a black hole , at the outer edge of the holon pocket have a vector @ xmath62 , i . e . , the holon pocket has a vector of @ xmath63 , or the distance between the two corresponding regions . the wave equation for the coherent state above follows the same general form as for the case of the ##ons , with the only difference being that the spinon occupied holon pockets are no longer necessary for the calculation of coherent states . the pockets at @ xmath57 may be thought of as being the region , corresponding to spinless particles , and which are the inner edges of the holons . the occupied holon pockets are chosen so that their outer edges at @ xmath64 are the regions corresponding to the surrounding region of spinons of at @ xmath65 . we proceed to the second case in detail . let us see from the very beginning that for very simple theoretical calculations the situation is much more complicated in this case . to begin with , due to the high energy of the system the spin@ xmath42 sites are much smaller : for example , amongst the @ xmath66 - sites in the @ xmath66 - cluster , @ xmath67 @ xmath42 - sites are also not spin - 0 , so that the amount of nonredundant space is much smaller than in 1d . however , unlike 1d where a linear relationship exists between the energy and the liquid , the quantum states of black hole clusters correspond to open - shell states with only two spin states for noninteracting states . in the open - shell state multiplet states are likely to occur , so that it is in general unclear which states are allowed and which ones are forbidden ( this occurs for the ##rmi liquid , but is most likely true only for the ` spin states ' ) . different results can result from this . with this in mind , we therefore can reasonably expect to see a more complete and detailed picture as in 1d . + however , the [ fig6 ] shows the energy diagram for the @ xmath66 - site cluster , with black holes . we also see the right hand side , where energies are given in units of @ xmath2 . + with holes .[ fig5 ] , the results are more interesting : the relative energies of the two peaks at @ xmath46 , @ xmath68 match those of @ xmath0 ( although the spectra for @ xmath25 @ xmath13 @ xmath26 show a slight drift ) so that we can see a ` chain ' of peaks with energy scale @ xmath2 . the situation here is not so clear , except that the peak at @ xmath69 is so close in energy to the peak at @ xmath68 that it is not possible to tell if their energy scale scales with @ xmath2 or @ xmath0 . however , the two peaks at @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 show a strong correlation with @ xmath0 , which is somewhat typical of , e . g . , electrons . [ fig1 ] . but the full spectrum with energy scale @ xmath0 measured to greater accuracy shows these peaks ( although the peak at @ xmath70 also shows a slight drift ) , i . e . , their relative energy relative to the first peak at @ xmath68 scales with@ xmath0 . thus we can observe a number of different ` features ' at distances between @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 , which all appear perfectly diffuse ; these are indicated by the absorption lines . in accordance with 1d , we can also distinguish between areas of physics , with different energy scales in their energy bands . although the structure of the @ xmath42 - band has some uncertainty , the results are consistent with a ` @ xmath2 - band ' spreading upwards in the direction of the outer brillouin zone , and a ` @ xmath0 - band ' spreading downwards in the outer zone , i . e . , the core region as seen in 1d . a further difference is the fact that the ` features ' in the two bands are not perfectly diffuse , at least for @ xmath15 @ xmath74 @ xmath75 . more importantly , despite the fact that the energy scale appears to be @ xmath0 , the mass of the ` - band ' is much lower than in 1d . in other words , the effective mass of that band is @ xmath19 @ xmat##h76 , associated with a very strong prefactor . + we refer to the @ xmath38 - site cluster , also associated with free electrons ( see ref . [ fig7 ] ) . using @ xmath2 as the unit of energy , we see the most obvious differences : the central peaks for the peaks at @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 are identical ( although @ xmath25 @ xmath13 @ xmath26 ##0 varies slightly ) and the peripheral peaks follow a similar pattern with @ xmath0 ( an obvious exception is @ xmath46 where a clearly defined peak pattern is not present ) . according to us , @ xmath0 has a number of these peaks , which suggests that these peaks form the ` @ xmath0 - band ' which originates from the central peak at @ xmath77 . this explains the most important feature of the @ xmath38 - site cluster , namely that for the peaks in 1d ( and for those of the @ xmath66 - site cluster in 2d ) the most prominent @ xmath0 - bands all seem to originate from the central peak of the @. . we can also see that these unusual effects are the result of , e . g . , the multiplet effect described above . we also note in this section that the spectra at @ xmath46 are very much similar for @ xmath66 and @ xmath38 site clusters , which suggests the possibility of finite - size effects . + comparing the unusual effects at @ xmath46 to finite size - effects , we have a very similar situation as in the @ xmath66 - band spectrum , i . e . , the highest peaks for regions in the shadow zone have @ xmath2 as their energy scale whereas the highest peaks on the outer boundary of the band have energy scale @ xmath0 ( this also holds for @ xmath44 which is outside the boundary of the shadow zone ) . as is the case in the @ xmath66 - band the ` shadow zone ' , despite having @ xmath0 as its energy scale , has a much larger effect than the 1d . therefore , dividing the @ xmath0 - band in the @ xmath66 and @ xmath38 site clusters gives the energyof the frequency @ xmath79 - to be @ xmath80 - it is possible to conclude that this may not be @ xmath81 , as one would expect e . g . in the gutzwiller model . another interesting fact is that the @ xmath0 - band is restricted to the outer edge of the brillouin region . thus the very low - energy ` peak ' indicated by the red line in figure [ fig7 ] appears to correspond with @ xmath0 . + for this we would like to note that a similar analysis was also performed for the @ xmath82 - site cluster with @ xmath26 holes . the reason is simply that for some time there were no distinct individual ` peaks ' , but rather a cluster of close packed black holes . due to this , we were not able to find any specific ` bands ' , or groups of holes which show a large concentration of their own energy . we have also performed this type of analysis for the @ xmath82 site cluster with @ xmath83 holes and found many more peaks of the energy with @ xmath2 : with this much higher , the corresponding energy scale with @ x##math0 . + in the figure for example , the transition seems to lead to behavior which is more typical of 1d than for gap bands , in that the @ xmath2 - band spreading downwards in the inner part of the brillouin band and the @ xmath0 - band spreading downwards in the outer part seem to occur simultaneously in this case . just like 1d , however , the shadow band , while in fact having @ xmath0 as its energy scale , also has a very low energy , so that the band structure in the shadow compounds is almost identical to that of the undoped compounds @ xcite . we note however , that the fact that the shadow band has @ xmath0 as its scale has important implications for its properties : there have been attempts to describe the shadow band in bi2212 as a ` perfect approximation ' of the gap band , caused by separation of electrons in the weak electron - capture regime from their energy scales @ xcite . note , however , the fact that the shadow bands are present only in the overdoped compounds @ xcite , where doping is very high , as well as theand that they do not appear to be very pronounced in the underdoped system @ xcite , where coupling is weak , would suggest otherwise . on the other side , we believe that our calculations can accurately carry out this analysis : consider the ` interaction energy ' and the ` # ##s @ xcite and @ xmath2 are their respective energy levels , and it would be very difficult to see how the energy spectrum of @ xmath0 for the shadow band should arise from a combination of these two types of energy . in fact , the most simple calculation with only very small scales yields very different decay directions for the two types of energy . we also believe that the shadow band is a discrete set of states , at least corresponding to the states which comprise the @ xmath5 spectrum in the 1d case . in the previous section we have discussed the energy spectrum for the one and two dimensional @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 systems . by considering the time evolution of the spectrum , we could consider 1d the ` waves ' of energy which carry out the motion of the elementary particles of the tll , the spinons and holons. . these states have a similar nearest neighbor in energy , but with different band structures : that of the spinons at @ xmath19 @ xmath2 , that of the holons @ xmath19 @ xmath0 . + in the simplest case there are two types of bands which cover the lattice surface ( see figure [ figx ] ) . ` inside ' the noninteracting lattice surface , there is a long series of bands extending down to @ xmath3 . the first of these bands traces out the spinon spin and has @ xmath2 as its energy scale , the middle band traces out the holon spin and has @ xmath0 as its energy scale . in the outer limit these bands extend into ` outside ' and again has @ xmath3 . in the inner part of the brillouin limit , there are two bands which have @ xmath0 as their energy scale . these cover the full energy scale @ xmath5 , giving rise to a new lattice surface . thus the state is @ xmath23 and @ xmath84while counting our electron mass is not enough to make predictions about the electron bound states , the distribution of the electrons in the electron energy band as seen from the measurements does show that different fields of physics actually can interact @ xmath3 . the electron band can be thought of as a single region of space @ xmath85 , which is actually the center of the holon ##ic surface . + in 2d for space - time , the picture is quite different : while it is still possible to find states with similar energy as with @ xmath2 and @ xmath0 , the spinon energy band seen in 1d does not exist and the ` holons ' appear to correspond to overdamped states rather than spontaneous states seen in 1d . we propose that the interaction between momentum and charge carriers , most likely due to the well - known string theory , separates the band of bound states out of the band of ` free ' holon and spinon states . the alternative spin model is that of bean - shaped or spherical 1 / 2 states , as supported by a considerable amount of experimental data . + for the bound states in 2d , the picture is quite different and isis observed . the corresponding absorption spectra show an agreement with 1d , in that there seems to be a high intensity ` main band ' with energy scale @ xmath2 expanding upwards in the inner part of the brillouin zone , and a low intensity ` shadow band ' with energy scale @ xmath0 expanding downwards in the outer part of the brillouin zone ( see figure [ figx ] ) . in comparison to 1d the effect of the shadow band is much smaller , i . e . , although the energy scale of the band is @ xmath0 , it has an only very small prefactor ( of the order of the electron density ) . thus the @ xmath0 - band is restricted to the outer part of the brillouin zone , i . e . there is no evidence for a holon cloud with energy scale @ xmath0 expanding downwards in the outer part of the brillouin zone . but in the @ xmath66 - band , a single ` band ' with energy scale @ xmath0 can be clearly observed at the same energies . the corresponding energy scales of main band and shadow bands show that these two bandsof a theoretical nature , and in particular pointing out the fact that that the dark band is caused by scattering from the spin ##ons . + turning to physics , the data for spin ##e make a comparison with the results of aebi _ et al . _ @ xcite . these researchers note that in addition to the ` bright ' part of the band structure , which appears to be associated with the noninteracting spin , there is also a low intensity ` dark ' , represented only by @ xmath49 , which has been largely ignored in the previous studies . if one wishes to make a comparison to the data for the @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 model , one first should compare this low intensity band with the @ xmath0 - band pointing out in the @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 model . our results suggest that the dark band should have a slightly different structure than the bright band . the limitations of the experimental data may prevent a detailed theoretical analysis , but it would be interesting to see if this difference in structure can be observed directly . + we begin by considering a highly simplified model , based on the observationthat the two bands are two different bands , which overlap at different frequencies and states of quantum states . in this case , the spectrum splitting question raises an interesting question : whereas in 1d the two bands of high energy electrons , the @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 , in @ xmath86 are well separated in @ xmath42 and @ xmath84 ? for practical optimization problems , the experimental results of aebi _ et al . _ show that the main and shadow bands overlap at several points in the brillouin spectrum ( see ref . [ fig9 ] , see below ) . given the large difference in energy between main and shadow bands , we can then represent the high energy electron spectrum with the following hamiltonian @ xmath87 where @ xmath88 is the energy of the main band , @ xmath89 , and the @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 bands correspond to the main and shadow bands , respectively . as a function of the form @ xmath92 this hamiltonian yields the # ##onic operator used by aebi _ _ as : (( fig . [ fig9 ] ) . however , as mentioned , the two branches of absorption converge in a part of the brillouin region , so that even a slight difference between the two branches , which in turn may result from the spinon - holon ##omy , has a significant effect on the resolution of the high - absorption spectrum . therefore , a combination of the form @ xmath93 i . e . , the combination of the two branches of absorption , and adding large amounts of @ xmath94 open up a pocket in @ xmath44 and turn the total surface area into a pseudo ##sphere ( see next section of fig . [ fig9 ] ) . thus we calculate the surface area by assuming that the concentration of @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 respectively is constant ; it is easy to see that the area occupied by the pocket only determines the visibility in @ xmath58 , just as it is the case for 1d . thus the 2d pocket has a light band character at the inner edge , and dark band character at the outer edge , and a very small ` visibility ' in 2d . therefore , it is easy to see that the ` visibility 'the value ' @ xmath94 increases with increasing electron / hole distance . ' increasing to the maximum value @ xmath95 ' could induce a transition from the hole surface to the ` real ' hole surface ' @ xmath95 , which then would also explain the pseudogap effect of @ xcite ##s cuprate superconductors . + the support of r . h . by the european commission and of r . e . by the saneyoshi foundation and the grant - in - aid for the reserach from the ministry of education , science and technology of japan are both highly appreciated . et al . _ , science * , 2757 ( 1995 ) . j . de jong _ et al . _ , preprint . j . a . loeser _ et al . _ , science * 273 * , 325 ( 1996 ) . d . h . kim _ et al . _ , phys . lett . * 66 * , 4841 ( 1996 ) . d . kim _ et al . _ , phys . rev . lett . * 66 * , 4054 ( 1996 ) . a . dagotto , rev . phys . * 66 * , 763 ( 1994 ). . _ and r . blatter , phys . lett . * 44 * , 2567 ( 1990 ) . t . ogata and h . shiba , phys . b * 44 * , 2326 ( 1990 ) . m . sorella and m . parola , j . phys . cond . b . * 44 * , 3589 ( 1992 ) . m . penc , m . hallberg , and h . shiba , phys . lett . * 44 * , 1390 ( 1996 ) . r . favand _ et al . _ , j - cas cond - b 9611223 . r . eder _ et al . _ , 1996 . r . eder , y . ohta , and t . maekawa , phys . lett . * 43 * , 5124 ( 1995 ) . r . eder , m . wrobel , and y . ohta , phys . b * 43 * , r11034 ( 1996 ) . m . dagotto and j . a . schrieffer , phys . b * 43 * , 8705 ( 1990 ) . r . eder and y . ohta , phys .b * 50 * , 10043 ( 1994 ) . m . riera and m . dagotto , eds . j . h . schrieffer , j . h . wang , and j . h . zhang , phys . b * 50 * , 11663 ( 1989 ) . a . a . trugman , phys . b * 50 * , 1597 ( 1987 ) . r . eder and k . w . becker , j . phys . b . 50 , 219 ( 1990 ) ; see also a . vojta and k . w . becker , phys . b * 50 * , 15483 ( 1996 ) . v . a . bulaevskii , v . a . nagaev , and v . a . khomskii , sov . jetp * 50 * , 836 ( 1968 ) . r . eder , a . ohta , and y . shimozato , phys . b * 50 * , 3350 ( 1994 ) . v . chubukov , phys . b * 50 * , r3840 ( 1995 ) .
