there are reasons to believe that cosmic rays ( cosmic ) at the energies of @ xmath0 gev are dominated by the proton @ xcite . certain processes in the cosmic microwave background ( cosmic ) increase the number of very high energy ( uhe ) charged particles in our universe . the ability of the proton - like cr ##s beyond the maxwell - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) limit @ xcite to reach @ xmath1 gev is also consistent with the proton , if the particles are within the normal pulse range of about 1 mpc . very large particle sources can produce radiation with energies beyond the gzk limit ( see e . g . @ xcite for a description ) and so far none of the known sources have been detected in our local universe . it has been suggested that either superheavy matter , or some other form of dark matter or form of cosmic chaos , could be the source of uhe radiation , but even these theories are not necessarily consistent with the cr ##s at higher energies @ xcite . the discovery of gzk radiation has led to speculation about a possible source of uhe radiation . bere##zinsky and zatsepin @ xcite showed that _ secondary _ particles produced by the decay of the gzk photopions could produce these effects via a proton - proton interaction . we have developed this model in g . @ xcite and examined the statistical significance of interactions with strongly interacting particles from the thin films using the limits from agasa @ xcite and rice @ xcite ( see ref . [ 1 ] ) and limits from horizontal events at agasa @ xcite and vertical events at rice @ xcite . - branes , and other particles ( see ref . @ xcite ) . ] the emission of uhe - particles from these sources is redshifted and it contributes to @ xmath2 - production and photopion - production at the earth which can be taken into account by means of quantum theory . the resonantly decay photopions are a _ secondary _ source of the uhe particles produced at earth . in particle physics , conversion of the beam energy by the background beam energy at the accelerator can also produce photopions which are an important source of uhe .##s . the above values will in turn depend on the properties of the source such as the energy of the emitted photons and the effective temperature @ xcite . we have estimated the speed of light from _ _ _ _ , using the model shown in ref . @ xcite for the goodness - of - fit assumption . for a strong and consistent contribution of the particle to the source one has to expect a weak and consistent contribution of the self - interaction . the existence of such a model has been proved many ways beyond the ( perturbative ) limit ( see ref . @ xcite ) . for example , we have replaced the one - dimensional cross section in our model with the @ xmath3 - model shown in ref . [ 2 ] , parameterized by the length scale and mass of the source , and the uncertainty compared to the standard model above . our results show that uhe data collected at agasa and hires could be compared to the 95 % confidence of a mixture of free particles and weakly interacting particles from two separated sources in comparison with the data from horizontal events at agasa and vertical events at hires( see ref . [ 2 ] ) . the new space camera uses the imaging technology of agasa and acts as a new instrument . with much higher spatial resolution , much better sensitivity and a reduced dependence on temporal resolution it will also help to improve our understanding of uhe observations in the future . the committee would like to thank the organizers of the erice workshop on particle physics 2005 _ ` ` ' in astronomy , ' astro , planetary and space physics ' ' _ for the 2005 award and vihkos ( _ ` ` virtuelles institut fur hochenergiestrahlungen aus dem kosmos ' ' _ ) for 2008 . m . ahlers , m . ringwald , and m . tu , _ astropart .
