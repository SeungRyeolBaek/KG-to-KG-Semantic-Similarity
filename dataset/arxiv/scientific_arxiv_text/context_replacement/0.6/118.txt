quantum rings and quantum dots are experimental tools for the study of mesoscopic systems on the one hand and for the analysis of discrete level spectra of individual atoms on the other hand . rings like atoms give rise to aharonov bohm ( s ) waves @ xcite which can be measured by applying a magnetic field to the area covered by the ring . quantum dot techniques have been used as well , e . g . , to measure the energy spectrum of quantum dots in the cp violation ( cb ) state . @ xcite the discrete level spectrum of cp violating quantum dots has been extensively studied using various techniques to measure absorption and scattering effects when a gate voltage is applied to rapidly transfer spin to the quantum ring . @ xcite and @ xmath0 . and quantum dot coupling ##es . @ xmath1 measures the distance from the gate to the ring .

( d ) bose - thomson interference in the two - dimensional ring ring @ xmath3 as a function of the in - ring gate voltage @ xmath4 . , n = 302] coupling of a single transmission , e . g . a single channel of a quantum amplifier , and a line of transmission , e . g . , through a single channel or an optical loop , often gives rise to the nonlinear coupling typical of the fano resonance . @ xcite the general ##ization of the fano resonance was being developed for the cross - sections of light @ xcite and of infrared light @ xcite , but the fano resonnances are being studied as a form of mesoscopic transport @ xcite . in mesoscopic transport the energy and properties of the fano resonance can be expressed as @ xmath5 . @ xmath6 is a dimensionless quantity , with @ xmath7 the energy of the electron , @ xmath8 the energy of the proton and @ xmath9 the energy of the neutron . the term @ xmath10 is known as the _ fano resonance _ and is the width of the resonance interval . @ xcite for @ xmath11 the transmission disappears and the fano resonance is reduced to a typical breit type resonance . for @ xmath12 a breit - type quasi - resonance is obtained and for@ xmath13 the effect is unknown . recently the fano effect in mesoscopic systems has been studied for both electric and magnetic systems , @ xcite and in systems with dots . @ xcite it has been suggested that fano effect in quantum dots could be used as a form of quantum computing @ xcite as a means to generate quantum correlation signals . @ xcite the fano effects were observed in the optical path of a quantum dot dot on a semiconductor surface . @ xcite in non - quantum dots it was shown that the combination of a wide resonance ( ab - ring ) with a narrow resonance would lead to fano effect ##ing . @ xcite a second experiment used a dot - like dot cross - connected to a magnetic wire and explored the mechanism of the coupling between the dot and the wire for the fano effect @ xcite . kobayashi et al . also studied the fano effect in an ab - ring with a quantum dot embedded in one side of the ring . @ xcite in these experiments the magnetic field allowed them to determine the electrical coupling between the electro - magnetic ( wire ) and the magnetic ( dot ) ., thus increasing the size of the fano ring system . their model requires the use of the - @ xmath10 - model to account for the cb - phase . similar effects are also observed in the carbon atom with a transition state at the interface where the rings are connected . @ xcite for these ring systems the fano effect is due to the interaction of the breit - ##zman magnetic field in one arm of the ring ( containing the strongly coupled quantum dot ) with the communication field in the other arm of the ring . suppose we perform two experiments with a structure where the quantum dot in cb - phase is strongly - coupled to the ring [ see ref . [ fig1 ] ( 1 ) ] . our structure has a tunable channel between the ring and the dot which allows us to communicate between the two signals while keeping them well separated and to measure the effects of the quantum dot on the signals in the channel , as described in above and below . in contrast to the previous structure , our structure has a tunable fano scatterer composed of one arm of the ring and the strongly coupled dot , which is able to communicate with the signals in the other arm of the ring . this allows us toand the relationship between the cb - band of the leads and current at the energy level of the dot . the paper is structured as follows : in section ii , the physical nature of the proposed ring - dot structure is discussed and the electron density functions are described . in section iii we give a formula for the ring - dot structure using the density functional theory and compare it to the fano formula in ref . [ eqn1 ] . the section iv theoretical and experimental data are discussed and we use and . to describe decoherence of the dot due to the current and due to the leads . in section v we describe properties of the dot . is a function of @ xmath4 when the interface between the dot and the leads is closed circuit . the three solid lines represent the cb - band , as calculated from the electrical signal @ xmath3 . this indicates that the dot is negligibly shaped . ( 2 ) the three surface energies @ xmath0 ( solid lines ) , @ xmath14 ( solid lines ) , @ xmath1 ( solid lines ) , when @ xmath15 = - 50mv , - 46mv , - 42mv are chosen to match thedistance between the ring and the dot . the white line has low coupling . ( b ) @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 when @ xmath16 is used to measure the electron density of the dot . when @ xmath14 has the highest coupling . the line through the dot has the characteristic white line pattern typical of the fano type . , [ = 326 ] the first ring dot structure was made using a silicon [ sic ] type heterostructure with a high - pressure two - dimensional bulk structure ( 2deg ) 20 nm below the surface . the electron density of the 2deg was @ xmath17m @ xmath18 and the pressure was @ xmath19m @ xmath20 / 2 = 0 . 7k . c . [ fig1 ] ( 1 ) is an afm version of the experiment made by afm - c . the 2deg around the white line is transparent ( white lines ) and the 2deg ##s on the outside of the ring dot structure are transparent for in - plane lines ( _ igt , igr , igb , _ _ ) . in a later experiment an 18 nm thick oxide layer was eva##porated the top of the dot and the afm is then used to split this top gate into four split gates ( _ tq4 , tgd , tq3 , tgc , tq1 , tgr , tq2 _ ) as indicated by the gray line . these split gates allow for a better tunability of the current flow rate and the distance between the split gates as well as to the dot . more precisely a single split gate , ( _ tgc _ ) can be used to completely separate the dot gate from the split . details of the measurement process can be found in ref . and . . . the measurements were made in a vacuum chamber with an electron source @ xmath21mk . the measurement process is shown below in ref . [ fig1 ] ( 1 ) . a high high - voltage @ xmath22v was applied to the two leads of the ring with a frequency of 21hz and in the same manner @ xmath23v was applied to the two leads of the ring with a frequency of 21 . 4hz . using plug - in , this allowed one to directly measure the two electric fields applied to the gray line of the two gate pairs ( see spontaneous symmetry ) :@ xmath24 \ \ % = t _ { 34 } + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } t _ { 3 \ leftarrow ring } , \ \ \ frac { i _ \ mathrm { cross } } { v _ \ mathrm { ring } } & = & \ frac { 2 e ^ 2 } { h } \ left [ t _ { 34 } + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } ( t _ { 31 } + t _ { 32 } ) \ right ] \ \ % = t _ { 34 } + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } t _ { 3 \ leftarrow ring } , \ \ \ frac { i _ \ mathrm { cross } } { v _ \ mathrm { ring } } & = & \ frac { 2 e ^ 2 } { h } ( t _ { 34 } - t _ { 32 } ) . \ end { 1 } \ ] ] \ , @ xmath25 shows the transition from t @ xmath26 to @ xmath27 and the calculation of the t _ tqi _ t ##r . [ fig1 ] ( 1 ) . for the differences between the components the first stepthey are proportional to the peak terminal lengths @ xmath2 of the dot and @ xmath3 of the dot , since the current in the inner tube increases . the effect of @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 when the outer electrode closes in the gap between the dots is illustrated in fig . [ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) . the dot structure exhibits strong ab - resonance as a result of the magnetic field @ xmath28 ##mt perpendicular to the dot and the current @ xmath29mt moving in phase with a magnetic field applied to the area covered by the dot with an amplitude of @ xmath30135 ##mt . the ab - values continue up to @ xmath31k . this is much higher than in the case of the two - electrode ring structure where a peak terminal length @ xmath32 of more than 1 km is observed at 0 . 2k . @ xcite the current @ xmath3 exhibits cb - resonance as a function of @ xmath4 applied to the on - line current q _ perpendicular to the dot . from measurements of this resonance we have an important contributionand @ xmath33ev for the dot . our set - up allows us to simultaneously measure the r ##s of the dot and the resonance energy of the dot simultaneously , without requiring the combination of the two gate voltage . instead , the magnetic field is used to create the channel between the most sensitive ring and the dot which , when properly tuned to one side of the ring , can act as a fano scatterer ( see figure ) . by measuring the ring and the dot , we determine the extent of the interaction between the structures due to the cross - correlation of the gate voltage and the dot interaction . to this end @ xmath15 is tuned to - 75mv in order to tune the interaction between the two structures . figure [ fig2 ] ( right ) shows a series of ab - peaks in @ xmath2 when @ xmath4 is used to calculate the resonance energy @ xmath34 for the dot . the two vertical lines represent the cb - peak energy of the dot . the two ab - peaks in fig . [ fig2 ] show that unlike that observed in @ xcite we are in a region where the direct i .coupling the two structures is negligibly tight . therefore , the voltage across the dot affects neither the wave function nor the number of hole - electrons in the dot over the range @ xmath35mv . we find that the same is true when increasing @ xmath36 ##m to the top surface of the structure . the two additional parameters _ tgr _ and _ tgd _ _ allow us to adjust the hole density in the structure and hole density in the dot over a wide range without affecting the coupling to source and sink devices . however , where possible we limit ourselves to increasing the in - line current , since in this case we expect the structure to be more stable and the higher currents lead to fewer charge carriers . in order to compare the two structures we need @ xmath15 . example [ fig2 ] ( right ) shows the gate states @ xmath0 ( thick line ) , @ xmath14 ( thin line ) and @ xmath1 ( thin line ) where the lines tend to be smaller @ xmath15 . with tight coupling , @ xmath1 increases from the value of @ xmath37mv to a value of 4pa withit counter - points at @ xmath38mv . in this case @ xmath0 causes a deviation from the gate value as a function of the current @ xmath28 , an effect that is important for the transition from a single - terminal to multi - terminal device . @ xcite the field @ xmath14 is not significantly affected by the current at @ xmath15 except that the source - drain curve of the current is altered , which leads to a gate value for the same current . of the currents @ xmath0 ( dashed lines ) , @ xmath14 ( dotted lines ) and @ xmath1 ( straight lines ) , @ xmath39mt ( top panel ) and @ xmath4030 ##mt ( bottom panel ) . the two dashed lines are the gate values . they are slightly altered at @ xmath4 = - 25mv to allow for a faster power transfer at that gate value . ( b ) - ( c ) straight line . of the currents @ xmath0 ( a ) , @ xmath14 ( b ) and @ xmath1 ( c ) as a function of @ xmath28 and @ x##math4 . the first straight line exactly corresponds to the cb - peak . . ( 3 ) . , [ = 326 ] . from this side of figure , we have calculated the magnitude of the v - peaks in the ring and their relationship to the cb - peaks in the dot without changing the ring configuration . note that both @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are tuned from 0mv to 200mv in order to increase the current flow from the ring to the dot . in the end , more than @ xmath15 currents are not needed to fill this gap . # [ fig2 ] ( right ) shows the frequency response of @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 when @ xmath36 is tuned to a wide range . when @ xmath14 has no cb - peaks the frequency response depends only on the current flow of the dot . when the ring is tuned to a large range with only @ xmath36 , @ xmath0 is tuned to up to a factor of 2 . this is a consequence of the fano effect . it has been shown , that the ring which is cross - coupled to the ring .a typical fano device . @ xcite - we illustrate the behavior of such a fano scatterer by showing it on a b - dimensional diagram . figure [ fig3 ] ( a ) shows the changes of @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 as a function of @ xmath4 for @ xmath43mt and after adding an x - period ( @ xmath44mt ) . the horizontal lines show the area of the cb - rings as determined from the input to @ xmath14 with a lorentzian flow diagram . increasing the area in the diagram after adding a x period changes @ xmath0 from a situation where a dip occurs at the input region before the dot resonance to a situation where a small output dip occurs after the dot resonance . figure [ fig3 ] ( b ) - ( a ) shows @ xmath0 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath1 in large - dimensional space as a function of @ xmath4 and @ xmath28 . the areas of @ xmath0 [ the ones in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) ] appear to shift back and forth for each successive flux .within the structure until the @ xmath45mt the quasi - rings are observed . the six straight lines are representing the peak positions resulting from coupling to @ xmath14 shown in fig . [ fig3 ] ( c ) . the observed phase changes as a result of the field are due to the effect of the magnetic field on the energy level of the structure . from the analysis of the peak positions and phase , we see that the rings exhibit highly stable behavior under the magnetic field , with close matches within the structure for the two rings that are observed . the ring @ xmath1 [ fig . [ fig3 ] ( c ) ] is far from perfect even when @ xmath14 is present . @ xmath1 which passes through both rings is at equilibrium with the ab - signal as a function of @ xmath28 . this is in contrast to @ xmath0 which has a single @ xmath28 - period period . we illustrate this by the fact that @ xmath1 is the difference between the two rings @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 and the @ xmath48 - period only stands out if the ring itself and the signal are closely matched. due to the two factors the resulting z - effect for @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 is a strong z - effect . we represent the single quantum dot in the single barrier , two terminal state using a front - end filter consisting of a 1d filter with a mirror and a single terminal as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the total scattering matrix of a single dot is given by @ xmath49 where @ xmath50 is the scattering matrix and @ xmath51 are free phase diagrams . the scattering matrix of such a dot is calculated from the sum of free phase diagrams @ xmath52 : = 1 + \ frac { { \ lambda r _ \ mathrm { t } \ lambda } } { 1 - t ' \ lambda r _ \ mathrm { t } \ lambda } . \ ] ] where @ xmath53 is the angle between the dot and the barrier and @ xmath54 is the scattering amplitude of the dot . after calculating the number @ xmath55 which the electron encounters during the first trip through the barrier , the total scattering matrix is @ xmath56 this can be written as @ xmat##h57 with @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 . for this open - loop system , the field is parallel to the unit cell and will occur when @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 . . ( d ) the potential for - 1 to + 1 . ##es ##p through the ring and through the section of @ xmath62 in the direction of @ xmath63 . the leads used are @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 and the leads to the ring are considered to be the beam leads . ( e ) use of @ xmath0 for the steady - states . the red dashed lines represent the voltage values obtained from leads to @ xmath14 . , [ = 326 ] the ring signal is then cross - coupled to the line at a three way junction as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the transmission and reflection parameters of the signal are @ xmath67 where the parameters @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 represent the direct transmission from the source to the end of the wire and the direct reflection to the end of the wire respectively . @ xmat##h70 and @ xmath71 are the amplitude for transmission from the end into the dot and from the end to the end of , and @ xmath72 is the amplitude for transmission from the end into the end of the dot . the side - coupled dot pattern can then be mapped onto the @ xmath73 - and @ xmath74 as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the transmission pattern of the line with the side - coupled dot can then be taken to be the fano formula @ xmath75 where @ xmath76 is the fano parameter . for @ xmath77 @ xmath78 are fano line shapes . this becomes linear when @ xmath79 is chosen according to the equation of for @ xmath80 , without the linear ##ity of @ xmath81 . it follows that @ xmath82 with @ xmath83 is the solution to the fano equation in fig . [ eqn1 ] . note , that the fano equation @ xmath10 in fig . [ tw ] , and corresponding to the line shape , is also determined by thepre - detection @ xmath84 of the peaks in the x - band ring structure , i . e . , @ xmath85 produces a symmetric line signal ( @ xmath86 ) , @ xmath87 produces a symmetric peak in the signal ( @ xmath88 ) , and @ xmath89 produces a symmetric line transmission ( @ xmath90 ) . in the following we consider the dot ring structure to be a dot beam , which is described by the linear transfer matrix @ xcite @ xmath91 using this for the interaction between the dot and the ring we obtain @ xmath92 results in a symmetric second term to the first term in question . it follows that @ xmath93 the _ fano scatterer _ is also described by the transfer matrix @ xmath94 in fig . [ 2 ] , with the transition states @ xmath10 and @ xmath79 . the dot - dot interaction in the ring can also be described by applying the transfer matrix @ xmath95 at one of the vertices of the ring as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the interaction iscorresponding to two parallel two - conductor domains at the junctions 1 and 2 . these equations together with the transfer matrix @ xmath94 divide the ring into two sections of equal length . when an electromagnetic field enters each section it produces the electric phase @ xmath96 , where @ xmath97 is the electromagnetic three - phase , as well as the magnetic phase @ xmath98 ( with directions for clockwise and clockwise . ) where @ xmath99 is the magnetic field generated by the field and @ xmath100 is the magnetic flux density . these equations determine the transfer matrix for each individual section @ xmath101 as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . with the initial formula for the alternating current from the transmitter and receiver sections @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 , one gets the three - phase equation from the landauer equation @ xmath104 with @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 for comparison with the experimental results we get @ xmath107 , a formula which increases the counter - current of the field by producing spherical waves when the fieldthe constant ( b = 1 ) . ref [ fig4 ] ( e ) shows the linear equation @ xmath108 as a function of @ xmath109 and the ratio of the current entering the ring with @ xmath110 and @ xmath66 . for example , a short version of the equation @ xmath0 as a function of b and @ xmath111 is given in ref . [ fig4 ] ( e ) . a good agreement is achieved , in that our mathematical model quite accurately describes the general behavior of the resulting ring - shaped system . this model is robust against changes in @ xmath50 and robust to changes in @ xmath84 , since @ xmath84 is related to the fano curve @ xmath10 . we modeled @ xmath112 in accordance with the published results where we assumed the distance between the ring and the dot to be in all possible fano line shapes . the shape of the resulting line shape in @ xmath0 is finely tuned to the current entering the ring . this model is very similar to the published results in ref . where the constant b is .in order to account for the magnetic field dependence of the fano ring shape . however , we have not been able to tune e . [ tw ] into the model where the magnetic field in the ring @ xmath113 appears as a real @ xmath114 in the ring @ xmath10 - parameter and we then tune ourselves to the real @ xmath10 - parameter based on the fano coupling of one arm of the ring with the center of x . the magnetic properties of this fano scatterer are further confirmed by quasi - experiments in the model . this is similar to above . where the real ring shape with a dot embedded in one arm is used as the fano scatterer . the @ xmath10 - parameter is independent of the coupling between the dot and the ring and to further test the relationship between models and data we assume @ xmath115 to be real to reduce the uncertainty and we use the @ xmath10 - parameter . example [ fig5 ] ( 2 ) plots @ xmath0 as a combination of @ xmath28 and @ xmath111 for different values of @ xmath115 from left to right . thus the model isthus @ xmath0 is more strongly correlated with @ xmath116mt and the dots ( or dots ) at @ xmath43mt tend to disappear . from our understanding , this can be interpreted as that a dip in @ xmath115 causes the spontaneous break - up @ xmath84 of the electrons in the ion , and thus decreases @ xmath10 from its initial value of 1 . in addition , the decay probability distribution is expected to increase . figure [ fig5 ] ( b ) shows @ xmath108 for the same values as in fig . [ fig4 ] ( a ) but changing @ xmath10 from 1 to 0 . here we have a good agreement with the experiment data for very small @ xmath10 - values where it is difficult to determine which value fits the experimental data better . the following figure on the right shows @ xmath108 for @ xmath1170 where dot - free values are found , very close to the center of the curve . this figure is more accurate than the experimental data , where for @ xmath118mv , similar values of @ xmath0 are found. in fig . [ fig6 ] ( a ) traces of @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 as a sequence of @ xmath4 , @ xmath43mt ( solid lines ) and @ xmath44mt ( dashed lines ) are shown for @ xmath119 - 68 . 3 , - 68 . 4 , - 69 . 1 , - 69 . 2 , and - 69 . 9mv . the traces have been shifted to the corresponding lines marked with dots in fig [ fig5 ] ( a ) and for the peak of @ xmath15 they are shifted to @ xmath4 so that the resonance line of @ xmath14 ( the @ xmath43mt traces ) comes to rest in @ xmath120mv . the remaining trace ( dashed line ) , also has an anti - dip ( peak ) for @ xmath119 - 68 . 9mv which is the only clearly observed resonance and corresponds to the @ xmath121 . . the peaks ( peaks ) of @ xmath0 corresponding to the peak lines are not clearly observed . the resonance in fig . [ fig5 ] ( b ) is .##ly = from the dot @ xmath108 where , for @ xmath122 the point set to zero at @ xmath43 is a single red line for the frequencies that are measured . we can see from the figure that this difference between theory and experiment can be seen when taking into account decoherence of the signal . in contrast to the theory , the single quantum dot is connected to logic gates which can lead to a quantum coupling of the quantum states in the quantum dot . @ xcite ##r @ xmath123 = 0 . 1k for the peak values described in @ xmath119 - 68 . 3 , - 68 . 4 , - 69 . 1 , - 69 . 2 , and @ xmath124mv . the values are shown on the lines , with an arrow in red . [ fig5 ] and for @ xmath39mt ( gas lines ) , @ xmath125mt ( liquid lines ) . for the peak of @ xmath15 we put the arrow in @ xmath4 in red for the peak of @ xmath14 to be at @ xmath126mv . ( 1 ) @ xmath##127 for @ xmath128 and also a decoherence in the dot with a decoherence at @ xmath129 . ( c ) @ xmath127 with a decoherence in the dot at @ xmath130 . ( d ) @ xmath0 with a combination of @ xmath4 and @ xmath28 . @ xmath123 = 3 . 65k . , [ = 326 ] since the two fano lines depend on electron paths through the ring structure , decoherence at high temperatures due to proximity of the dot to the atoms , e . g . the holes and the atoms of the ring , is suppressed . we have measured the temperature dependence of the fano resonance measured at @ xmath0 and found that at @ xmath131k the self - transitions in the dot occur and the fano resonance is completely suppressed . this is in contrast with the situation where the electrons that pass through the dot are more strongly affected by decoherence due to the fact that such a path is shorter than the dot paths through the ring which do not cross the dot . however , the dot paths can be affected by decoherence induced by theand are applied to each . we have and . in order to achieve decoherence of the structure by the addition of the frequency @ xmath132 where @ xmath133 is the length of the path through the dot and @ xmath32 is the phase and frequency . this is a description of the total optical path through the dot . the ` ` reflection frequency ' ' is re - injected into the dot structure by adding an additional frequency in the two - term form @ xmath134 where @ xmath135 is the detection ( reflection ) frequency for reflection in lead @ xmath26 and reflection in lead @ xmath27 and is replaced by @ xmath136 with @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 the re - injection preserves the equality in the equation and gives the certainty given by the two - term reflection equation . the [ fig6 ] ( right ) shows @ xmath127 for @ xmath139 , @ xmath140 , @ xmath141 , @ xmath142 , @ xmath143 , and @ xmath144 taking into accountthe ground state of is @ xmath145 . the solid lines appear gray for @ xmath146 and the gray lines for @ xmath147 . the gray solid line is the dominant pattern for @ xmath122 in the fully coherent case for example . decoherence leads , as expected , to continuation of the fano effect , and to strong coupling ##s , a phenomenon which has been shown to be useful as a basis for decoherence of the quantum dot by the fano effect @ xcite . the experimental match to the ground states of @ xmath148mk [ ref . [ fig6 ] ( 2 ) ] shows that even at these low energies the contributions to the quantum dot lead to decoherence of contributions to the quantum dot from the atoms , thus , to continuation of the fano effect which we observed at @ xmath0 . however , the contribution from the fully coherent case is absent in the case of strong coupling between the two atoms corresponding to @ xmath122 . the experimental results show a reduction in band - amplitude ( sum of band and band gap ) of about 50 % due to resonance , whereas @ xmath127 shows a reduction whichis more than twice as large . we note that for the stronger structure , the coupling of @ xmath50 and the decoherence probability increases as the distance between the electron and the dot is larger . for weaker structures , the time the electron spends in the ring becomes smaller and this means that due to the dot resonance the probability for going into one of the rings of the ring becomes smaller . we have adjusted the parameters of the structure , and have good agreement for @ xmath149 and @ xmath150 ( not shown ) . note , that the cross - coupling of @ xmath15 has the opposite effect and the higher binding energy of @ xmath14 ##9 for the @ xmath115 . for @ xmath64 the probability of decoherence due to the dot resonance is small since we have strong cross coupling between the two rings . this can be seen from the good agreement between @ xmath127 and @ xmath0 for this case . when the coupling is large decoherence is observed only for the @ xmath64 structure and the fano effect is almost completely absent in @ xmath151 . see [ fig6 ] ( right ) . @ xmat##h127 for @ xmath149 , @ xmath152 , @ xmath64 and @ xmath153 . these values were chosen so as to match the values in question . [ fig6 ] ( 2 ) occurs at @ xmath151 . from the structure of the resulting dot , we estimate the phase shift of @ xmath154 electrons at this point . the decoherence of electrons in the dot structure changes the observed line shape , leading to the expression ##lation of the dot . this expression relates the observed observed line shape to the transition between discrete states occupied by the dot and discrete states of the ring and further extends our understanding in terms of the fano effect . the dot model thus incorporates all the important features of the experimental data but has a few important limitations . if we attribute decoherence to the dot , a more accurate model would include both thermal averaging as well as decoherence in the dot , the ring and the connecting arm . using thermal averaging , we were only able to reproduce the experimental data at low energies and the lack of decoherence in the dot and the connecting arm did not improve the results . wewe restricted ourselves to decoherence as described above and concluded that the additional leads on the dot are the main basis for decoherence of the fano structure . the model also ignores the two - atom ring which contains some of the additional leads on the dot in view of the structure of the structure as a consequence of @ xmath28 . this means that the model also assumes that there are no net currents flowing from the dot to the ring ( @ xmath155 ) . from the experimental observation of @ xmath1 we expect this current to be about 10 times larger than the current ( s ) from @ xmath0 for @ xmath122 and we are therefore able to conclude that it has no effect on @ xmath0 . however , where the current from the dot is influenced by external magnetic fields [ e . g . , in the upper right corner of fig . [ fig3 ] ( 2 ) ] arc - like currents are observed in @ xmath14 suggesting that either the weak interaction of the ring leads only affects @ xmath14 or that there is a large time - dependent net current flowing from the ring leads into the dot . in a resonance system the interaction current between two atoms##s is not only affected by spin coupling , but also also by the interactions between the atoms and the electrons . this is also true in our model and could explain the much stronger effect as a function of the energy in the experimental data when compared with the data from @ xmath156k in question . [ fig4 ] ( c ) - ( d ) . although we believe that our model accurately describes the state where the fano effect is greatest , we find that in the experimental data at @ xmath156k the electrons in @ xmath0 are closer to the actual resonance positions of the dot than in the dot . we have found that the effect of spin - coupling from the dot is greatest in the higher excited state ( see figure below ) . but for @ xmath119 - 0 . 5 , the coupling between the two electrons is completely closed , and the coupling could be altered and could lead to different fano resonance shapes relative to the resonance positions of the dot . @ xcite we find that the coupling ##s and the electrons of the other channel would not only exhibit similar effects in @ xmath14 but also lead to a different resonance shape in @ xmath0as shown , e . g . , in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . we note , that this is not required for the electron scattering , and kondo and @ xcite are completely ignored . in addition , we have shown that the current through the ring with a discrete side ##band signal leads to side ##al ##bedo in the current through the ring as a result of a gate voltage which affects the individual spin patterns . this is characteristic of the fano effect and we have shown that the coupling of the discrete fano band signal can be controlled by applying a magnetic field . the @ xmath10 - ring is constructed with a gate voltage controlling the coupling between the ring and the signal . a comparison between the ring and a multi - channel optical device , allows us to solve our problem with a fano scatterer embedded in a single - channel multi - channel . comparison with this device , allows us to consider the spin effect in the ring as the main mode of decoherence for the fano effect . changing the parameter to @ xmath156k the fano effect almost completely disappears but self - modulation in the ring leads to @ @ xmath157k .
