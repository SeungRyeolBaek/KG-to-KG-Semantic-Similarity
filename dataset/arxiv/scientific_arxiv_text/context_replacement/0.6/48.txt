cp violation , as in @ xcite and in the @ xmath7 @ xmath8 mixing , is a feature of the standard model ( sm ) that often provides accurate theoretical predictions . the ckm model , which describes _ _ _ the _ _ _ cp violation in terms of a single term in the spin - spin process , has been inspired by the experimental observations of @ xmath9 @ xmath10 and @ belle and belle @ xcite . cp violation is in fact one of the key conditions for determining the expected level of spin - spin in the sm @ xcite . the amount of cp violation observed in the sm ##s is , however , too small to produce a significant amount of the ground state of @ xmath11 @ xcite . new sources of cp violation _ in _ the sm are now a problem @ xcite . symmetry ( susy ) is perhaps the most important feature of the sm , since it addresses , for example , the problem of the protection of the electroweak symmetry - breaking mechanism against radiative collapse . in the new supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @ xcite introduces many new sources of cpthis involves strong cp - violation interactions , which can then be explained further by additional gauge theories . a large number of these models , including those with sparticles of the first and to a lesser extent of the second generation , are also supported by measurements of the electric magnetic moments ( edms ) of the electron , proton , neutron as well as @ xmath12hg and @ xmath13tl . however , these parameters are scale - invariant . it has been shown @ xcite that differences among these models allow different values of these parameters to be measured in a single mssm . however , if the sfermions of the first two generations are very large , in the 10 tev limit , the edm constraints on the values of the higgsino ##ids of @ xmath14 , in order up to @ xmath15 , are larger ; the sfermions of the second generation will therefore be smaller . non - negative values of @ xmath16 and / or the trilinear gauge of @ xmath17 will imply a cp violation of the higgs field via coupling ##s @ xcite . since these models have edms ##s of the first two generations of sfermions, the edms are determined by the charge distribution of the two interacting higgses @ xcite . for a detailed discussion of the edms see @ xcite and articles below . the observed cp phases can also have a significant effect on the higgs decay rates of the proton decay reactions at the tevatron and the lhc @ xcite . mssm cp phases can also affect the higgs behavior of particles quite significantly . all this makes the mssm with cp - odd particles a very useful model . it has also been the subject of several experimental studies , on the effects of these phases on neutralino / chargino decay and decay @ xcite , on the spontaneous generation of sfermions @ xcite , as well as the decay @ xcite and neutral @ xcite higgs products . both cp - even and cp - odd ( cp - odd ) observables , which can provide information about these phases , have been studied . it is important to note that cp - even observables such as energies , decay rates , cross sections , etc . , can be very reliable , due to the large size of the particles . for experimental measurements of cp violation , however , cp - odd /gravitational - wave observables not seen e . g . in @ xcite need to be measured . the theoretical analysis of the @ xmath18 and of @ xcite shows that it will be possible to calculate the real and imaginary parts of @ xmath19 to a precision of 100 % from a comparison of the mssm lagrange coefficients to energies , cross sections and branching ratios of a single @ xmath20 linear accelerator ( lc ) . this means that both the @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 and eigenstates can be measured in the lc and the branching ratios calculated with high precision . for the @ xmath23 and @ xcite the precision of @ xmath24 is high , about 1020 % for low @ xmath25 and about 2000 % for high @ xmath25 . in this study , we found that the longitudinal spin of particles produced by sfermion experiments , i . e . @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 with @ xmath28 a single particle ( s ) proton and ( r ) neutron , can also be used as a measure of cp violation . the longitudinal spin ofadds some information to the observed branching ratios and may in fact be useful if the branching ratios can not be determined with high enough precision or if no decay channel exists . the total number of nuclei produced by sfermion decay carries information on the @ xmath29 @ xmath30 decay as well as on the gaugino higgsino decay @ xcite . the numbers that can be measured are those of top and bottom ; they can be measured from the decay channel ##s . it is the same number that causes the @ xmath31 to contribute to hadronization and therefore the decay channel must carry information on the decay . for this , only the phase distribution of the decay channel can be used . the distribution of the decay channel has been used for studies of mssm and ##ization in the cp - violating case of @ xcite . for the cp - violating case , the phase distribution of the decay channel only has been used in @ xcite . we begin these studies by describing in detail the contribution of the decay model to cp - violating effects of the mssm . the discussion is presented as follows : in figure 1 , we haveour results for the interaction of the sfermion , neutralino and chargino systems in the mssm with cp violation . in section 3 , we discuss the interactions in sfermion decay to neutralinos , @ xmath32 with @ xmath33 . we present our results on the interaction as a result of the mssm , and on the response to cp - violation interactions between the sfermion and neutralino systems . in section 4 we present an experimental analysis for @ xmath34 values . in section 5 we review the analysis and publish our results . for intergenerational interactions , the sfermion energy spectrum can be expressed as a series of @ xmath35 values , each of which represents sfermions of a different type : @ xmath36 with @ xmath37 { m _ { \ sf _ { r } } } ^ 2 & = & a ^ n _ { \ , \ } + e _ f \ , a _ f ^ 2 \ , , \ a \ , \ b ^ 2 \ sf _ r + a _ f ^ 2 , \ \ [ \ , ] a _ f & = & e _ .- \ , ^ * \ , \ { \ cot \ a , \ cot \ , \ } = | f _ 1 | \ , { ^ { { \ phsf } \ , , \ { { 1 : aq } \ , { 1 } \ ] ] for @ xmath38up , see @ xmath39 - the sfermions ; @ xmath40 , @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are the mass , the charge and the spin component of the spin isospin of the free particle , respectively ; @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 are the susy - type parameters for this particle , and @ xmath16 is the higgsino ##id parameter ; @ xmath45 and @ xmath16 each have two parameters : @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 . + similar to fig . , @ xmath48 is represented by the probability density function @ xmath49 . the charge eigenstates @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 are closely related to their spin eigenstates @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 . @ x##math54 with @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 the sfermion mixing angle and is . since the off - diagonal mixing of @ xmath48 is equal to @ xmath40 , this generation is not equal to the second generation , @ xmath57 , on which we rely on the above . the two components are dominated by @ xmath58 by definition , we take @ xmath52 to be the first mixing eigenstate , @ xmath59 . note also that @ xmath60 . for the mixing of @ xmath55 we use @ xmath61 which is @ xmath55 in the right half of the unit square . the @ xmath62 @ xmath63 mixing is large if @ xmath64 , with @ xmath65 if @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 if @ xmath68 . finally , we note that the second mixing of @ xmath69 and @ xmath49 is dominated by @ xmath70 . this mixing is small if @ xmath71 . this situation will be discussed in more detail in the following analysisof phases 3 and 4 . in the basis @ xmath72 the neutralino mass parameter is : @ xmath73 the gaugino mass parameter @ xmath74 and the higgsino mass parameter @ xmath16 can in fact also be used . the basis of @ xmath75 can be turned around , which leaves us with two phases in this model : @ xmath76 , the phase of @ xmath77 , and @ xmath78 , the phase of @ xmath16 . + the solution of 2 . is given by the following mixing matrix @ xmath79 : @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 , @ xmath82 , are the ( non - zero ) masses of the two neutralino particles . we use the basis @ xmath83 . a detailed description of the neutralino model with two phases can be found at @ xcite . the chargino mixing matrix is : @ xmath84 which is divided into the following mixing matrices @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 , @ xmath87 where @ xmath88 is the masses ofthe corresponding chargino is with @ xmath89 . the sfermion interaction with neutralinos is ( @ xmath91 ; @ xmath82 ) @ xmath92 where @ xmath93 the @ xmath94 and @ xmath95 interactions are @ xmath96 for ##sons and sbottoms , and @ xmath97 for staus , with the corresponding by @ xmath98 and by @ xmath99 the gaugino interaction changes the helicity of the sfermion while the higgsino interaction changes to . in the case @ xmath100 , the spin number of the particle resulting from the @ xmath101 interaction can now be written as @ xcite @ xmath102 . , . , and as well as @ xmath103 , we have , for the @ xmath104 interaction ( taking the coupling of @ xmath105 and adding the sfermion and neutralino ##s for spin ) : @ xmath106 \ , . \ , { . } \ ]] we find that the phase dependence of @ xmath107 is the same for the sfermion mixing ( @ xmath108 ) and if the neutralino has both the gaugino and higgsino particles . it is , however , smaller if the total of @ xmath98 is zero . thus , @ xmath107 is subject to cp violation even if only one phase , for either the neutralino or the sfermion mixing , is non - zero . in particular , if only @ xmath45 and if only the sfermion mixing process has a non - zero total , the phase - dependence of becomes @ xmath109 if , on the other hand , if @ xmath76 is non - zero we get @ xmath110 \ , \ , ##e \ , \ , . \ ] ] the term @ xmath111 , etc . , depends only on time and not on frequency . for the general solution we can use @ xmath77 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath16 , @ xmath112 , @ xmath55 and @ xmath113 as thehowever , for @ xmath114 to satisfy edm conditions more generally : note that for the 1 - loop contribution and the cp - violating higgs coupling of @ xmath115 gev , 1 - loop and 2 - loop contributions to the experimental edm ( eedm ) , as well as their values , are in the upper limit . we use the parameters of @ xcite for the 1 - loop contribution . in order not to use too many parameters , we use , first , the gut parameters @ xmath116 and then @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 ( relative mixing not relative mixing ) in this analysis . the gut parameters in our analysis are : @ xmath75 , @ xmath119 , and the parameters @ xmath76 , @ xmath113 . when we obtain the final solution , the table appears in brackets : cp violation in the neutralino phase is dominated by the mixing of @ xmath77 and @ xmath16 , while @ xmath113 results from the mixing of @ xmath45 and @ xmath16 . for sb the mixture is dominated by @ xmath19 , while for sb##ottoms and staus , are restricted by @ xmath120 ; more precisely we have @ xmath121 unless @ xmath122 , and @ xmath123 unless @ xmath124 . more precisely , @ xmath125 for @ xmath126 , and @ xmath113 can be reached with the special case of @ xmath127 , instead of @ xmath128 . for @ xmath129 , however , @ xmath113 is restricted by @ xmath128 . for the special case of @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 . in the general , this is not a problem since @ xmath133 can in general be easily reached . for sbottoms and staus , having @ xmath134 restricted leads , however , to a restricted @ xmath135 , which can in some cases cause problems with number - and time - exchange problems .

[ fig : ptau _ m2mu ] and [ fig : ptop _ m2mu ] that the dependence of cp - violating particles will still be significant at @ xmath144 and / or @ xmath140 , but @ xmath16 is not too large . we will use the case of @ xmath75 and @ xmath119 to explain the spin dependence in more detail . this includes @ xmath140 as a result of @ xmath76 , for @ xmath148 gev , @ xmath149 gev and @ x##math150 , @ xmath151 , @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 . since for example @ xmath75 and @ xmath119 the @ xmath142 value varies with @ xmath76 , we consider the value in detail @ xmath140 as a function of @ xmath154 for fixed values of @ xmath76 , with @ xmath149 gev and @ xmath75 , so that @ xmath155 gev . @ xmath140 varies over a wide range depending on @ xmath76 and @ xmath154 ; if the neutralino phase , , @ xmath25 and @ xmath156 are known , @ xmath140 can also be used as a direct measure of these parameters ( although additional calculations may be needed to determine them and to distinguish the two values ) . in the lc , the values of the neutralino / chargino , and the sfermion , and other parameters can be determined more directly , using tunable beam splitting and beam splitting @ xcite . the exact resolution , of theconsider the following example . to understand the effect of uncertainty on the values of the measured parameters , we consider the values of @ xmath148 gev , @ xmath149 gev and their values at this point and assume that the following parameters can be measured : @ xmath157 , @ xmath158 , @ xmath159 , and @ xmath160 . measuring the parameters in this region of the reference frame improves to @ xmath161 and @ xmath150 , which is known as the - # ##ometric error .

it will therefore be zero for @ xmath239 , @ xmath240 and for @ xmath112 . however , this is a non - linear expression even if there is only one phase in either the sbottom or chargino sector . note , however , that the total cp ##t in the chargino sector is@ xmath128 , which then implies the sfermion energy limit . both @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 also imply @ xmath241 . more generally , @ xmath242 for 30 and not @ xmath112 , and not @ xmath243 unless @ xmath244 ; see below . and the next section . for the sake of a detailed understanding of the energy dependence of @ xmath237 ( and since @ xmath245 is not a free parameter ) , we will consider @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 as the free parameters . thus the total free energy of @ xmath247 is as a function of @ xmath119 for @ xmath248 gev , @ xmath249 and 30 , and the values of @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 . thus we have only @ xmath250 , since from renormalization - group calculations one has @ xmath251 . as in the previous section , we expect strong contributions from cp - spin interactions if the @ xmath252 has a largehiggsino ##id ; as such , these effects are identical for the @ xmath25 . the effects are the same if both @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 have their sign . hence , @ xmath253 . if @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 have the opposite sign , the difference of @ xmath237 from the range of opposite signs is larger than if they had opposite signs . in general , we use @ xmath254 in certain regions of the configuration space . with an energy range of the upper limit of about 1 % this means that in most cases @ xmath255 can easily be distinguished from @ xmath256 by means of @ xmath237 . however , the range of @ xmath237 is very similar to the actual @ xmath257 energy range , which is the lower upper limit of 1 . and is due to a strong susy ##l violation . for the case where we have measured @ xmath258 gev the energy is in the range of @ xmath237 when @ xmath259 are only between 1 . 5 and 3 . 5 .##v . as can be seen , the use of @ xmath259 expressed above as @ xmath260 is to rule out the possibility of cp - dependent effects , especially in the case of the @ xmath25 .

for @ xmath261 gev and @ xmath262 gev , and put the measured changes in these values together . this gives @ xmath237 as a value of @ xmath246 , for @ xmath261 gev ,@ xmath249 , @ xmath263 , and the values of @ xmath128 . @ xmath75 is chosen so that @ xmath264 gev ( i . e . @ xmath174 gev for @ xmath131 ) . the value obtained by dividing @ xmath259 by 0 . 5 . 5 gev is determined by the values for two of the parameters , for @ xmath131 and @ xmath265 . we see the effect of the incomplete ##ness of the other parameters in the same way as in the previous section . for @ xmath266 gev , @ xmath267 gev , @ xmath268 , @ xmath269 and @ xmath270 , we get @ xmath271 and @ xmath272 . adding in the @ xmath2734 . 5 gev for @ xmath274 . adding a 50 % rounding error for @ xmath237 by half , we end up with @ xmath275 ( @ xmath276 ) without ( with ) the @ xmath259 ge. these are shown as small values in red . we know that the sensitivity of @ xmath277 can easily be estimated from @ xmath278 in this example . however , @ xmath237 turns out to be just a different probe of @ xmath279 , i . e . the deviation from the ` sensitivity ' of @ xmath277 . in the example of above , @ xmath280 @ xmath281 can be observed if @ xmath260 is ( more ) , the , observed probe of @ xmath199 . note that , @ xmath282 also causes a error on @ xmath283 of @ xmath284 @ xmath285 gev . if the error on @ xmath75 and @ xmath119 is 0 . 5 % and @ xmath164 , we have @ xmath286 and @ xmath272 , meaning that the sensitivity is increased by the observed error . therefore , the resulting increase in the sensitivity is proportional to @ xmath287 and @ xmath288 gev . . . @ xmath237 is a result of@ xmath246 , for @ xmath262 gev , @ xmath289 gev , and the same values as above ( @ xmath174 gev and @ xmath131 ) . the effect of rounding error in @ xmath260 is also shown as error bands for @ xmath131 and @ xmath265 . varying the rounding error in the same way as above , but with @ xmath290 gev , we get @ xmath291 = @ xmath272 . adding the error @ xmath2734 . 5 gev to @ xmath292 . adding the 50 % rounding error in @ xmath237 in a , we end up with @ xmath293 ( @ xmath294 ) without ( with ) the effect of @ xmath259 , shown as error bands in a . in the two - dimensional case , @ xmath237 is a u - shaped shape in the @ xmath128 @ xmath246 plane , with effects of both @ xmath237 and a in this plane .if @ xmath199 is not known , a measurement of @ xmath237 can still be used to set constraints on @ xmath128 and @ xmath246 , but not on @ xmath282 , which limits @ xmath283 . in our analysis however , we have assumed that @ xmath295 is known . in this case , a measurement of @ xmath296 , for example , would restrict @ xmath297 to @ xmath298 , while a measurement of @ xmath299 would restrict @ xmath300 as well as @ xmath301 . the measurement would also put a limit on @ xmath282 . as mentioned above , a upper limit on @ xmath282 implies a lower limit on @ xmath283 . an upper limit on @ xmath302 can be used to put an upper limit on @ xmath283 as a function of @ xmath303 : @ xmath304 . note , however , that this is impossible for @ xmath305 . we have also considered the possibility of using @ x##math25 ( @ xmath306 ) . this has an @ xmath246 decay similar to that of tau , with almost no dependence on @ xmath199 and the @ xmath307 is much more complex . we have , however , a large rounding error , which can cancel out the dependence to @ xmath302 . + _ to sum ##mation , _ to decay ##s @ xmath219 , with some dependence on @ xmath199 . @ xmath220 is probably not a useful method to study cp violation , but can be useful for ( experimental ) testing of the gaugino higgsino theory . the measurement of @ xmath218 decay , on the other hand , can be used to probe @ xmath199 , @ xmath246 and / or @ xmath308 in different regions of the configuration space . the measurement of @ xmath237 , for states and states associated with vanishing spin , can also probe @ xmath283 . we have studied the effect of cp - violating decay on the vanishing spin of sfermion decay to neutralinosin charginos , @ xmath309 and @ xmath310 ( @ xmath206 ; @ xmath82 ; @ xmath311 ) . this method is used as a useful tool for the mssm - based @ xcite . when transformed into charginos , the dependence depends on the dependence of @ xmath16 . since this dependence is large in the case of @ xmath219 , @ xmath220 does not have a complete set of cp parameters ( on the other hand , having this dependence can make @ xmath220 useful for the construction of gaugino higgsino models ) . if @ xmath312 however , the dependence on @ xmath199 can be very large ; in addition , , the dependence of the sbottom - 1 parameter plays a role . if @ xmath313 , @ xmath314 . we note that this case can be difficult to distinguish from the cp - mixing case when considering @ xmath315 . if , however , a dependence from @ xmath316 is present , these parameters can be ignored and the dependence on @ xmat##h245 can be used . the parameters @ xmath317 and @ xmath318 provide a very accurate measure of cp violation because an additional parameter , the phase of @ xmath77 , exists . we note that cp violation can have a large effect on the proton and neutron states , especially if the decay neutralino has a large higgsino component . if the phase of the neutralino phase can be measured directly , e . g . , @ xmath20 ##2 with large nuclei , @ xmath319 and @ xmath320 can be used for the measurement of cp phases . in addition , since @ xmath192 unless @ xmath119 is very large , the phase of @ xmath144 can provide information about @ xmath19 . in this article it is important to note that ( for large nuclei ) the sfermion decay cross sections do not depend on cp violation . in the sfermion case , these can be measured by branching ratios as discussed in @ xcite , properties of the decay products as discussed in this article , and cp - violation ##ity . branching ratios are in general very largeto experiment with high energies . the information that can be obtained from these experiments is very useful if one decay channel exists , e . g . @ xmath136 in case of the particle stau . this makes the influence of the other channel a very good way to measure cp violation . last but not least we note that the experiments in this sector , due to interactions of a few particles , have been performed at this time . the effects of radiative interactions @ xcite will be of great magnitude and will therefore need to be taken into account for precision analysis . the study of the cp phase of the sfermion / @ xmath321 interaction can also study cp phases of the higgs interaction @ xcite , since in the mssm higgs - like cp violation is represented by the interaction @ xcite . last but not least we emphazise that , since the interaction can be measured , the effects of cp violation should be taken into account in the susy ##m experiment , not in the precision analysis , as described in @ xcite . t . g . has the full support of the institut fur hochenergiephysik in berlin and the cern research community . t . g . isto thank the cern physics laboratory and lapth for hospitality and financial support , where this work is conducted . thank the centre for high energy physics , london for hospitality and financial support . 3 . to thank the financial support of the department of science and technology , uk , with the letter sp / s2 / 2000 - 01 / 2000 - 01 . the physical methods used in the theoretical work are : @ xmath322 a . a . kane , pisma zh . teor . fiz . * 1 * ( 1967 ) * , jetp lett . 1 , 1 ( 1967 ) . for a full review , see a . a . dolgov , astro - ph / 0211260 . a . a . kane _ et al . _ , astrophys . j . suppl . * 148 * , 1 ( 2003 ) [ astro - ph / 0302207 ] . for full review , see e . j . a . kane and a . kusenko , j . phys . * 148 * , 1 ( 2004 ) [ astro - ph / 0303065 ] . also , e . j . j . a . kane and a . l . kane, phys . rept . * 117 * ( 1985 ) m . t . smith and m . nath , phys . d * 418 * , 501 ( 1998 ) [ ph - ph / 9707409 ] ;
