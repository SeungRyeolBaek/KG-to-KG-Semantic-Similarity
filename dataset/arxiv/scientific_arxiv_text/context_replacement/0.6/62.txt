galactic x - ray sources exhibit a wide range of temporal variability ( from minutes to hours ) . but none of these is as wide and varied as the x - ray temporal variability observed from the black hole microquasar grs 1915 + 1 ( gomez - tirado , martinez , & martinez 1992 ; greiner , morgan , & remillard 1996 ; morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ; muno , morgan & remillard 1999 ) . this source is one of two known galactic x - ray sources that have superluminal radio jets ( mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) . the presence of spectral lines and ir emission at wavelengths indicates that the source is in the hercules cluster at a distance of 0 . 5 @ xmath3 kpc ( mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) . the cluster limits uv / ir observations to infrared observations at wavelengths less than 1 nm ( mirabel et al . the source is thought to be a black hole , because of its chemical and physical similarity with the other known x - ray source with superluminal radio jets , gro j1655 - 1 ( zhang et al 1994 ) , which has a lower emission , instead of ablack hole . ( bailyn et al . 1995 ) . estimates for the mass of the inner disk in grs 1915 + 1 range from 1 to 10 @ xmath4 . along with the increase in mass , the observed x - ray emission is very high , i . e . , @ xmath5 km / s , which is twice the expected emission for a @ xmath6 @ xmath4 star . in spite of these observations it has been relatively difficult to study the x - ray light curve of grs1915 . it is not yet clear that even the short time scales caused by the instability have been fully resolved . belloni et al . ( 1997a , b ) account for the instability with an alternative model in which the inner disk slowly ` ` collapses ' ' in the constant - temperature model , and is then recreated on a longer time scale . the parameters of their model are : the inner disk radius , @ xmath7 ; the total surface area of the disk @ xmath8 , and the ad - hoc non - linear power law ( which is not determined by the disk itself ) . although a definitive theoretical explanation for the instability is proposed , very few observationsof values for @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , as well as many other observables , were obtained from the data , and the shakura - sunyaev coupling constant was found to be very large ( which would indicate that the standard model model is wrong for this phenomenon ) . the relatively small value of @ xmath7 found in these experiments can be used to distinguish between different regions of the solar disk in grs 1915 ( see below and [ ref : ref ] ) . abramowicz , chen & taam ( 1995 ) proposed a model for the high energy non - nuclear ##ity ( qpo ) phenomenon in some x - ray sources , in which the variation in the _ _ _ _ region leads to a highly periodic disk . with these assumptions , this model could reasonably be expected to account for at least some of the observed variations in grs 1915 + 1 as well ( taam , chen & wang 1997 ) . however , it seems to me that the experiments of abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) and taam et al . ( 1997 ) revealed an error in the heating / cooling equation for the disk which, when correct , find their orbits to have the same physical properties as the standard shakura - sunyaev disk , and are therefore likely to match the grs 1915 + 105 model ( see appendix 2 ) . we state quite clearly in our [ sect : geometry ] that neither a large inner region , nor an iron - rich disk , nor a ` ` slim ' ' outer region is consistent with the model of grs 1915 + 105 . ( ` ` slim ' ' outer disk model was examined in the most detail by abramowicz et al . 1988 ; it is similar to the standard model shakura - sunyaev disk , except for the gas model , which describes the gravitational pull of gas into the black hole . ) in this appendix , we attempt to make a more detailed study of the gas observed in grs 1915 + 105 in the form of the ` ` ' core @ xmath9hot ##ec ' ' model . in [ sect : geometry ] we present a detailed model that will aid us in our development of a suitable ( if somewhat ad - hoc ) solution for the model in cases where the gas content is high ( [ sect : geometry ] ) . the results of our detailed modelto solve the time - dependent disk problem with the help of this the following example is given in [ sect : results ] . in [ sect : results ] , we present the results of our time - dependent disk model . the observed light curves are shown to agree largely with the experimental results of grs 1915 + 105 . in particular , the measured observation rates and observed cycles are in perfect agreement with the observations . thus , the correlation of the observation rate with the observed cycle is , @ xmath10 in the original model . however , there are other errors as well . we then present a more elaborate model , [ sect : previous ] , where , in accordance with the observations ( e . g . , mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) , the ejected energy is expected to retain most of its energy in the form of a quasi - excited state . we show that the ejected energy is not captured by x - rays , but rather that it instead produces spontaneous emission . we show that this more elaborate model agrees with the grs 1915 + 105 model much better , thus showing that we are now presenting a first complete model of the origin and the most important properties of this particular disk . in [ sect : results ] we presentour investigation sheds the light of the previous work on grs 1915 , and in [ 1 : 2 ] we reach our conclusion . figure 1 shows several examples of the x - ray flux pulses from grs 1915 associated with the rxte system ( see , e . g . , smith , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) . it appears that the system exhibits a scale - free type of cycle ; the peak periods of panels ( a ) ( d ) are @ xmath1 2400 , 1000 , 1200 , and 800 sec , respectively . besides the period exhibited by panels ( a ) and ( d ) there are several other non - periodic cycles of much longer time scales . the mean time scale at which a significant increase in the x - ray flux occurs is @ xmath1 1000 sec . we will associate the slow cycles with the relative time scale of the local galactic center , whereas the more fast cycles will be related to the mean time scale . the x - ray flux of grs 1915 + 1 varies greatly with x - ray intensity ; and the spectral line is highly correlated ( or non - correlated ) with time ( e . g . , belloni et al . 1997a , b ; and##am et al . 1997 ; muno et al . more specifically , the spectrum is usually assumed to be composed of a multi - phase nonlinear component , " the thermal component " , and a power - dependent component with a single power level . however , the spectrum contains a wide range of qpos with characteristic frequencies in the range of 0 . 01 - 1 hz . the amplitude and phase of the qpos appear to be strongly correlated with the spectral level of grs 1915 + 105 ( am et al . 1997 ; muno et al . 1999 ) . the idea of using a fluid dynamics model to model power - dependent properties of rotating disks and black holes is not new ( e . g . , taam & lee 1984 ; lee & taam 1994 ; and also discussed above in this article ) . first let us explain in simple terms how the rotating disk properties relate to the properties of grs 1915 + 105 in general . in very large systems the presence of water is especially important . the water time scale is much longer than both the thermal and power time scales ( see lee et al . 1992 ) , unless @ xmath11 which is used for this purpose ( belloni et al . 1997b ). in this case , however , the equation for the ##static equilibrium and energy balance for the diffusion and radiative flux should be used . it is easy and common to plot the surface surface temperature @ xmath12 versus the electron density @ xmath13 to determine the mechanical properties of disks . in the three dimensional case , the equation for static equilibrium in the central zone is @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the radius of the central hole , @ xmath16 is the disk area and @ xmath17 is the disk distance from the central hole . the diffusion equation is given by @ xmath18 ( for a gas disk ) , where @ xmath19 is the zero - point radius , @ xmath20 is the electron density , and the gas temperature is @ xmath21 . the energy balance equation is given by @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 is the electron scattering flux , @ xmath24 is the penetration depth of the disk , @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 is the radiative flux ( assumed to be divided by the scattering flux ) , @ xmath27 is the diffusion .( see , e . g . , shapiro & teukolsky , p . 2 ) , and @ xmath28 is the keplerian angular momentum . as we mentioned before , in the standard shakura - sunyaev theory , the stress tensor is proportional to the fluid density , @ xmath29 we can then use equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ( [ 1 ] ) to calculate the stress tensor and to use the result to calculate the @ xmath12 @ xmath13 curve for a given temperature . in addition ( [ 1 : scurve ] ) we have provided two @ xmath12 @ xmath13 curves to use in our calculation of @ xmath0 . the first line is the curve that the standard shakura - sunyaev theory with @ xmath30 const ##rued . such a curve is unstable and viscously unstable when the slope of the @ xmath12 @ xmath13 curve is negative ( e . g . , wang et al . 1992 ) , which would be a surprising result from the nature of the phenomenon described in grs 1915 + 2 . however , the standard model does have a non - negative slope##retion theory for the high - energy state as well , which gives _ _ _ _ by the above formula ( see also the case of app . 1 ) . this theory ( as stated in belloni et al . 1997a , b and taam et al . 1997 ) is complicated by the fact that in many cases the high energy branch of the system is much longer than the lower branch , which is not the only gas - pressure - stable state . the @ xmath12 - @ xmath13 system that is a stable high - energy state is shown in figure ( [ right : scurve ] , energy diagram ) . it has the characteristic ` ` s - shape ' ' , known from the study of the electron orbital ##s of molecular disks ( e . g . , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , wilson & pringle 1982 , cannizzo , wilson & livio 1995 , and wilson et al . 1992 , app . 2 ) and from studies of gas - pressure regime , as , e . g . , taam & chen ( 1984 ) and chen & taam ( 1994 ) . it is also known that states of the s - shape that have a largeit is constant . in particular , when the @ xmath12 - @ xmath13 solution produces an s - curve , the unstable branch of the solution lies between the two stable branches of the curve , which gives rise to the high and low stability curves . so far , we have only two cases where this is true . the adafs ( air - gas flows ) will be shown in [ fig : adaf ] , if we plot on the slim solid disks ( abramowicz et al . these flows produce a solution for @ xmath10 solution consistent with the ideal gas theory due to the fast cooling ( heat transfer ) via air . similarly , the s - curves produced by these flows produce the upper stable branch for @ xmath31 solution ( see , e . g . , the fig . 2 , wang & taam 1993 ) . in other words , if we were to plot the upper stable branch of the gas solid disk on our graph ( [ fig : scurve ] ) , then it would be similar to the lower stable branch of the solid disk on the figure , except that it would be slightly smaller by a factor of 2 @xmath32 ( for the density @ xmath13 ) . however , if one considers that the inner part of the disk undergoes a transition from the initial state of the light - curve back to the stable state , and that @ xmath13 remains highly stable during this transition , then the decay rate of the outer part will increase by so large a factor of a few hundred to several thousand to reach the stable initial state . while this will not be a problem in terms of the energy balance , since most of the energy is directed towards and the rest of the disk moves towards @ xmath33 ( see fig . 2 of szuszkiewicz , malkan & abramowicz 1996 ) , the light curves themselves will always be highly unstable and the decay cycle of the low states is always much higher than the values of @ xmath34 that are first described in grs 1915 + 2 . the main consequence of the outburst outburst is the large difference between the decay rates of the high and low states . as we will see here in [ 1 : 2 ] , the decay occurs because ` ` too high ' ' energy ( the density @ xmath##13 ) has been extended to the maximum possible stable state of @ xmath35 ( i . e . , @ xmath13 is the first bend of the f - ring of the [ 2 : scurve ] ) . if the high - state decay rate is very much higher than the low state decay rate , it usually takes only a very short time for the high state to remove this excess mass from the inner disk . in other words , it would not be possible to recover mass even if the decay rate remained in the high state for very long . this is most evident from the experimental data obtained for # ##e . szuszkiewicz & colleagues ( 1998 , in their paper 7 - 8 ) . however , we know that unstable states are not able to fully account for the variability of grs 1915 + 1 , at all , if one has a model capable of explaining all of the variations in this state . the configuration of our inner disk , is that of a typical shakura - sunyaev disk ( except for the second bend ) , with a circular disk . here we have the set of equations that we use to describe the local properties of this disk ; these equations are applicable to the local viscos##ity ##q . further discussion of the law itself is needed until [ 1 : 1 ] . the two previous equations for conservation of energy and angular momentum in the system ( see , e . g . , taylor et al . 1992 ) can be combined in the following way to give the equation for the solution of the energy equation : @ xmath36 \ { \ } \ , , \ { { eq4 } \ ] ] where all of the terms , except for @ xmath37 , are discussed in the previous section . then @ xmath37 is the term that is related to @ xmath0 = @ xmath38 = @ xmath39 . the temperature - induced energy equation uses the heating and cooling form of above ( [ eq2 ] ) , but should also be updated to take into account the spatial dependence of temperature , and also add a number of additional terms . the form of the energy equation that we use follows the formulation of abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) with some modifications , and is given by @ xmath40 \ nonumber \ \ = f ^ { + } - f ^ { - } - { - \ # ##flow } \ ,{ \ , ( \ _ _ _ \ ) \ , \ , \ } + \ , \ dot { eq5 } \ dot { vr } \ ] ] where @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 is the ratio of the temperature to the gas entropy , @ xmath43 is the ratio of specific heat ( @ xmath44 ) and @ xmath45 as defined by abramowicz et al . ( the energy flux @ xmath46 is given by the following equation ( fig . 2 . 1 of smith et al . 1992 ) : @ xmath47 . \ label { vr } \ ] ] the terms on the left hand side of equation ( [ eq5 ] ) represent the radial energy flux ( e . g . , @ xmath48 ) of the gas entropy , and the terms on the right represent the thermal flux , the energy flux in the vertical direction , the flux of heat in the horizontal direction , and the pressure component of the flow . in cannizzo ( 1993 ; and others cited above ) , we define @ xmath49 $ ] to be the radial energy flux produced by the heat transfer , where @ xmath50 is the radialand at constant temperature . @ xmath51 is the total radiation cooling rate per unit volume , and is given by @ xmath52 the radiation diffusion in the horizontal direction . @ xmath53 the radiation cooling rate ( less than half that from radiative cooling ) in the vertical direction is given by @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 is the fraction of the energy that is transferred to the corona , by means other than the vertical radiation transport ( cf . abramowicz et al . 1995 , svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) . factors ( [ heatr ] ) and ( [ fvert ] ) differ from those given by abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) for reasons that are explained in appendix 2 . we note that in the most general case , the factor @ xmath56 should be thought of as a factor for the vertical radiation diffusion in the total - disk region . in our formulation of the theory , it is not clear whether this fraction of energy is stored in the corona and dissipated by a non - thermal power - transfer mechanism , or it contributes to the total thermal heating , since we are concerned only with the thermal properties ofthe same for earth . the same possibility could be reached if this new energy source were to be the energy source on the surface of the sun . of course , if our model has energy spectra that are in perfect agreement with those of grs 1915 + 1 , then a different model , one that would better understand the different energy spectra , would be necessary . equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , together with the equation of thermal expansion ( [ eq1 ] ) , form a complete system of linear , time - dependent equations for all the points at and @ xmath13 . for solving these equations we have a partial differential formula with a constant time step . the time step is assumed to be as a function of the smallest possible time interval of the disk ( i . e . , of the inner boundary ) . we also have a radial grid in @ xmath17 . the radius is constant in @ xmath57 , and we use 50 to 100 sample points . we can also refer to the radial grid in a dimensionless sense , i . e . , @ xmath58 , where @ xmath59 is the schwarzschild radius . the inner boundaryof the disks is chosen at a small radius , @ xmath60 a quarter to a kilometer , so that the disk at @ xmath61 is not gas - gas dominated . therefore , the outer boundary conditions are given by @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 for @ xmath64 , where @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 are the columns and the energy density is the shakura - sunyaev model gives that radius for the disks @ xmath67 , @ xmath10 and @ xmath68 , where @ xmath69 is the coupling constant for the gas - dominated disk ( see figure ) . the inner radius of the disk is chosen at @ xmath70 , and the boundary conditions there are @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 . in this section we present our model gas dynamics that we use to account for the observed behaviour of grs 1915 + 1 . the shakura - sunyaev model formulation is that the elastic stress at @ xmath27 is given by : ( [ 1 ] ) , where the radius @ xmath0 is defined by @xmath73 and where @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 are the mean - velocity and shock - velocity , respectively , @ xmath76 is the shock velocity , and @ xmath77 is the x ##tric ##no - energy density . however , this method is valid only when @ xmath0 is a constant , i . e . , one of the primary temperature parameters of the model , which is also the case in a number of cases . whenever the equilibrium temperature of the rotating disk changes significantly , it is easy to see why @ xmath0 would not change . an example of this is the well - known magnetic ( magnetic ) properties of the disks in the x ##e ( e . g . , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; meyer & pringle 1982 ; cannizzo , rossi & livio 1995 ; and rossi et al . 1992 ; p . 5 ) . it has been shown in this paper that the @ xmath0 - value tends to be larger on the high - branch than it is on the low branch of the model . some more recent research suggests that , in general , @ xmath0 should be apower - values based on @ xmath78 , e . g . , @ xmath79 , in order to explain the extremely rapid mass increase of the terra nova ##e ( cannizzo et al . 1995 ; vishniac & smith 1996 ) . however , based on these results , some authors have proposed various extensions of the formula for @ xmath27 when @ xmath80 . for example , lightman & eardley ( 1974 ; @ le74 ) , and miller & rosner ( 1984 ; @ sr84 ) showed that @ xmath81 where @ xmath69 is a constant . their standard model is based on the assumption that the magnetic fields should be produced by the gas pressure alone . in contrast , sakimoto & coronitti ( 1989 ; @ sc89 ) showed that , if one assumes that magnetic fields are not dominant in gas - rich systems , the field alone removes these forces from the system . since the gas pressure can be produced to a large extent by magnetic fields , this also implies that the @ xmath0 - value will increase when the gas pressure becomes constant . an important consequence ofthis second formula ( fig . [ 1 ] ) ignores the fact that it is unstable even when @ xmath80 , as shown by the positive feedback provided by this formula for the behavior of @ xmath12 @ xmath13 in general ( see the bottom line of fig . [ 2 : scurve ] ) . at the same time , however , this second prescription ( to which we now refer as the lightman - eardley law ) shows no stable behavior at all , and thus fails to explain the unstable behavior described in grs 1915 + 1 . of course , the results of le74 , sr84 and sc89 should be regarded as speculative , at best , since it is not always possible to model the electric and magnetic fields observed in a radiation - rich universe in a realistic and noise - free manner . in this regard , we take the view that it may not be possible to transfer the radiation to the particles by collisions and to allow the radiation density to add to the field when @ xmath82 is not too large . for example , sr84 shows that the energy density of the applied electric field does not exceed the kinetic energy density , since it is the case thatnot the magnetic field in the first place . however , as long as @ xmath83 , the magnetic field itself does not affect the gas pressure ( because of @ xmath84 ) , so that the sr84 equations are valid . to put our model into a mathematical form , we have devised a new prescription , between those of shakura - sunyaev and lightman - eardley . our power law is proportional to the gas pressure for small to medium values of @ xmath42 , and for large values of @ xmath85 , it is proportional to the gas pressure . we have substituted the first mathematical formula for the second prescription that actually combines these two equations , so that @ xmath0 is replaced by @ xmath86 where @ xmath87 is an independent variable . the f - curve shown in figure ( [ right : scurve ] ) is derived from this same equation with @ xmath88 . there are only three fundamental parameters of the model that need to be individually and / or simultaneously measured to determine the relationship of the parameters to their values : ( _ _ _ ) the black hole radius , @ xmath15, ( _ ii _ ) the gas flow rate , @ xmath10 , ( _ iii _ ) the density , , @ xmath69 , for the gas - rich region , ( _ iv _ ) @ xmath87 , the pressure , @ xmath82 , and ( _ v _ ) @ xmath67 , the volume of the gas produced , by processes other than radiative cooling . we chose a value of @ xmath89 , which is one of the estimated mass of the black hole mass for binary stars ( see , e . g . , barret et al . 1996 ) . for purposes of comparison , we chose a value of @ xmath69 relative to @ xmath90 , since it corresponds to reasonable time curves similar to those above . therefore , we chose a value of @ xmath91 , in part because it has a reasonable time - curve . however , we used a number of other values as well ( from @ xmath92 to @ xmath93 ) , and found that @ xmath94 matches the grs 1915 + 1 value very closely . we used a different massvariations and characteristics of the gas flow in one single variable in figure ( [ fig : feqo ] ) and ( [ fig : dip _ tau _ distr ] ) , and , for a combination of two variables : @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 . in figure ( [ fig : dip _ tau _ distr ] ) , equations ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) show the values of the disk optical temperature @ xmath97 , the ratio of temperature to vapor pressure ( @ xmath85 ) , the mean disk optical velocity @ xmath24 and the disk optical velocity @ xmath98 . note that since we are not concerned only with the energy difference over the # ##s , we define @ xmath97 to be the emissivity from _ to _ the disk and the vapor , i . e . , @ xmath99 , where @ xmath100 is given by = ( [ fvert ] ) . in this case , the range of values is for small values of @ xmath101 and . the photon with the highest energy @ xmath10##2 ( where @ xmath103 ) . the upper left corner of figure ( [ fig : t _ tau _ distr ] ) refers to the state of the gas present at the time of the outburst . the outburst occurs in the outer region of the solution , when a few molecules of the same radius will make the transition to the most stable state of the gas ( high state ) . although this is not shown from above . ( [ fig : t _ tau _ distr ] ) , the volume of the high state is greater than it is of the low state , because @ xmath104 , and , even in @ xmath0 ##4 , the expansion of @ xmath76 and @ xmath16 leads to a larger @ xmath37 . the increased volume allows the gas to dispose of its angular momentum energy , thus allowing a faster entry of the gas into the black hole . because of this energy transfer , the angular momentum of the gas that enters into the black hole is transferred to smaller @ xmath17 , where it has an excess of angular momentum , and all the energy then goes to larger @ xmath17 , which is thein figure ( c ) of above ( [ fig : p _ tau _ distr ] ) , a change in the radial velocity occurs . a density wave is generated and travels from the outer region to the @ xmath17 ( cf . [ fig : p _ tau _ distr ] c ) . this wave is often referred to as either a ` pressure wave ' or a ` pressure wave ' . as the wave travels outward , the material in the path of the wave becomes unstable and falls into the high pressure region . it then quickly loses its angular momentum and is sucked into the outer region , where the gas rapidly expands into the atmosphere . since the high pressure region is a ` ` # - ##neck ' ' for the expanding gas , more gas builds up inside , which causes the instability of @ xmath13 in that region as shown in figure ( [ fig : p _ tau _ distr ] c ) during the expansion . when the density wave reaches @ xmath105 , the expansion stops , since the gas in that region is not high - pressure enough ( for the example @ xmath10 and @ xmath67 ) . thethe disk slowly dies away , the remaining unstable regions are emptied of the excess mass and fall away . they are now in the zero energy state , and thus the rate of mass transfer into the unstable regions of the disk increases . the x ##s - cycle is initiated and the disk dies away , the last remaining mass in the unstable regions falls into the disk . thus , the new cycle begins with the removal of the excess mass ( since the initial cooling rate is greater than the expansion rate ) . we will now model the observed effect with the fluid dynamics model , in order to directly compare the effect with the observed greenhouse effect of grs 1915 + 1 . we calculated the average volume of @ xmath67 = 0 . 26 . along with the above data , we have considered a wide range of occurrences of @ xmath67 , and concluded that @ xmath106 is the most likely due to the observed conditions . the formula for the occurrence of the effect is : @ xmath107 0 . 26 for @ xmath108 0 . 26 , and calculated as : @ xmath109 ^ { - 1 / 2 } \ { { dmo } \ ] ]( see svensson & zdziarski 1994 and note that their value of @ xmath10 differs from ours by a factor that accounts for the full internal radiative expansion , i . e . , @ xmath110 ) . it follows that observationally that @ xmath111 should be lower by a factor of at least @ xmath112 than the value of @ xmath113 due to the transition from the gas - to liquid - - like state of the original system . however , if we assume that the maximum value of @ xmath114 and of @ xmath115 observed for grs 1915 + 105 corresponds to the maximum observed for this system , then the maximum appears to exist only for @ xmath116 . in contrast , other black hole clusters ( gbhcs ) with a more high temperature , and more large ##s , have not exhibited as stable behavior as grs 1915 + 105 does , and therefore none of them are as stable as @ xmath117 ( see , e . g . , barret , mcclintok & grindlay 1996 ) . we now consider the instability @ xmath67also see [ fig : 3 ] . in figure ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) we see the expansion of the solar system increasing as a function of time for the nominal values of the values given above and for @ xmath118 @ xmath119 , 0 . 26 , 0 . 31 , and 0 . 5 . in agreement with figure ( [ dmo ] ) , we find that for values of @ xmath10 and 0 . 31 the disk is cooler , because there is a low - density neutral atmosphere around the disk . we also find , in agreement , that as the value of @ xmath10 increases , the maximum cycle ( i . e . , the amount of time that the disk is in the vacuum vacuum ) increases , from approximately 10 % when @ xmath118 0 . 26 , to approximately 20 % when @ xmath118 0 . 26 . thus , the ratio of maximum to minimum energy of the disk increases with increasing @ xmath10 . the time for the disk to complete one of these cycles ( known as the critical cycle ) also increases with @ xmath10 , except for periods where the nominal value of @ xmath118 0 . 26where the burst rate increases in ; and the cycle time also increases with time @ xmath10 . the result is that there appears to be a ` ` ' excess mass ' ' in the inner ##most region , and that the burst will occur only when the mass of the disk reaches this limit . the formula for building up the excess mass is @ xmath120 , where @ xmath111 is the maximum possible burst rate given by equation ( [ dmo ] ) , and so a high burst rate @ xmath10 or @ xmath111 will bring about a significant increase in the cycle time . for large burst rates , the cycle time tends to decrease with the burst rate , because a larger mass of the disk is present , and it takes longer to build the excess mass during the burst . we will then compare our model shown in panel ( [ 1 : lcurves ] ) with that of grs 1915 + 1 . we should note from the above that it is a difficult task to try to explain with a single observation the complex , dynamic behavior exhibited by this system , but we hope to benefit from a comparison of all the best results of our model with the data . " ( 2 )of figure ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) is similar to figure ( [ fig : data ] . ) except that in both cases there is a short period of mass remaining ( the hot state ) . however , an analysis of the grs 1915 + 1 data showed that the rate of burst occurs when the burst burst rate is greater than @ xmath121 m / s , and that there also is a high burst rate at which the burst does not occur . in addition , the transient nature of the burst is explained by the fact that only a very small region at @ xmath17 of the burst is visible , and it takes very little time to get rid of the excess mass in that region . the differences with fig . ( 1a ) are mainly due to the fact that the bursting of the burst does not occur to completely remove the excess mass , and that the bursts occur with a gradually decreasing rate , whereas in the burst the hot state lasts until all the excess mass is absorbed by the black hole . panel ( a ) of fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) is also very similar to panels ( b ) and ( c ) of the figure ( fig . [ fig : lcurves ] ) .the distribution of time scales and the count rate ( i . e . , roughly speaking , the count cycle ) from panel ( a ) to ( b ) in fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) is similar to that from panel ( a ) to ( b ) in fig . ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) as well . the main reason for the cycle time being longer with panel @ xmath10 is that the cycle time would build up enough for higher count rates . however , panel ( b ) in fig ( [ fig : data ] ) is also interesting from the point of view that the steady state is short lived and is relatively stable at least for the first time . panel ( c ) of the simulations could account for some of the effects of this physical effect . in fact , the count rate increased in both the simulations and the data as the count rate increased . the cycle time did not increase fast enough in the simulations , however . it could be sped up by adding a panel @ xmath69 , and then the time scales of all the other panels would increase as well , which does not seem likely . however , a similar phenomenon occurred in the first few panels ( a - c ) of all the simulationsand the results show that the instability of the light source causes a gradually progressive decrease in brightness as the instability sets in . this is a typical example of the burst growing slowly until it reaches a stable equilibrium . we note that panel ( d ) of figure ( [ fig : burst ] ) appears to be quite different from the other observed burst panels . if the high energy is also shown as the one with higher count rate , then the consequence of panel ( d ) is that the count rate first decreases and then increases at the time of the high energy burst . this is the opposite of what is observed for the other cases , such as that shown in panel ( e ) of fig . ( d ) . from a theoretical point of view , this is a very interesting result . in one of our experiments , we found that as the outburst progresses , the amount of mass in the inner disk gradually builds up because of the greater and greater amount of material from different sources . thus in a stable ( high or low ) energy state , the inner disk mass is equal to the mean stellar number @ xmath13 , which can be calculated from this ( [ fig : scurve ] ) . thus , during the burst , the lumin##osity occurs only when the outer disk settles down and the flow of energy stops , leading to a peak of @ xmath13 in the inner disk . however , the observed behavior of the disk is such that the initial peak of @ xmath122 is always negative , never positive as shown in figure ( 2 ) of table 1 . we do not have a complete explanation for this phenomenon in the form of the standard model , but we do note that there would be a possible explanation for this phenomenon if a jet were present ( [ sect : jets ] ) . however , we note that in a number of the cases in question ( [ sect : lcurves ] ) , the first ( and sometimes even the last ) peak in the phase curve is of a smaller magnitude and duration than the peaks that occur later in the curve . this is probably the result of the disk going to a non - linear stationary phase and escaping from the same initial conditions that are given by the shakura - sunyaev equation corresponding to the initial value of @ xmath10 . let us also consider the more complicated case for @ xmath67 shown above , which means that as soon as @ xmath123 of the peak energy is taken out ofthe disk undergoes processes other than the usual radiative processes . if this process involves internal heating or some other mhd effect in the disk , then there appears to be a problem with the predictions of grs 1915 + 1 . the neutral component of the corona of this disk is very small in the normal state , but it may be large in the soft state ( muno , smith & remillard 1999 ) . one could say , that as much as @ xmath124 of the x - rays reflected from the corona towards the sun may be absorbed into the solar disk itself , ( e . g . , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) if the absorption / absorption takes place in the _ neutral region _ ( especially in the case of low - density elements , nickel and iron , that are necessary for the visible spectrum ) . however , in fact , the radiant energy could exceed that of the non - neutral region by the value @ xmath125 ( see fig . 2 and haardt & maraschi 1991 with their values @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 ) . the very poorly known energy observed in grs 1915+ 1 , e . g . , @ xmath128 kev ( belloni et al . 1997a ) , ruling out the possibility of neutral reflection , however . as stated by nayakshin & taylor ( 1998 ) and nayakshin ( 1998 ) , the standard value of the reflective surface in the case of a partially reflecting disk must be much higher than the value 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 of the neutral surface ( i . e . , @ xmath129 of 0 . 2 of haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , and so it is difficult to estimate @ xmath67 as well as 0 . 1 given the large amount of electrical energy available from the disk . one possible way out of this problem is that the standard value of @ xmath67 does not accurately predict the energy transport from the disk into the sun . however , taylor ( [ fvert ] ) states that the energy transport rate of the disk must be @ xmath56 times higher than that predicted by the quantum theory of gravity . observations of gas in the opposite direction ( e . g . , bisnovatiy - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ; taylor & wandel 1995 ; and , in##in ) is a physical phenomenon that can speed up the flux of energy out of the disk . mhd particles losing their energy before they reach the corona could be catastrophic . in addition , there is some evidence that the thermal expansion model ( i . e . , the transition state model ) used in the large - disk model does not lead to a significant increase of the thermal energy flux out of the disk . for example , if @ xmath130 , where @ xmath131 is , then @ xmath111 = @ xmath132 ( = sz94 ) , and then we would have @ xmath111 as fast as that observed in grs 1915 + , due to faster cooling or an even faster expansion , rather than due to the transfer of some of the thermal energy into the corona . it is possible that model ( s ) of r . ( [ 2 : 1 ] ) show a thermal expansion as fast as @ xmath1 hundreds of years after the end of the steady state , whereas our models do not show a similar phenomenon . also , note that the rise / fall time scales are smaller in the simulation than they are in our model . thenote that the formation of the unstable region in grs1915 occurs on a time scale that is not much longer than the disk itself . in fact , the outer part of the unstable region of the inner disk becomes stable only after @ xmath133 the end of the decay process , that is of the order of the normal decay rate for the high energy disk . the explanation given could be that these state transitions are contingent upon causing the disk to make a fast transition from the high to the low state . however , during these fast transitions the disk is much hotter than it is in the low state , which could be taken as an indication that only one part of the disk ( most likely the unstable region ) in grs 1915 + 1 takes part in these fast transitions , whereas the rest of the unstable region is still in the more stable part of the s - state . for this to be true , the inner disk must be assumed to differ to some degree from the rest of the unstable region , and remain stable on a much longer time scale than the outer disk . to test this assumption , we have carried out several experiments in which the @ xmath0 - 1 is a linear modelof course . our conclusion is that in this case , since @ xmath0 in the inner disk is smaller than that in the outer disk , the time taken for relaxation in the inner disk must be much longer than the actual relaxation time , which takes the form @ xmath134 ( e . g . , wang et al . 1992 ) . in 1991 ( [ fig : variable _ alpha ] ) we have one such model , in which the functional parameter is shown to be @ xmath135 $ ] . this modified model allows the @ xmath0 - system to be called @ xmath136 for the inner disk . ( @ xmath137 ) , and to be @ xmath138 for @ xmath139 . the difference of these two time scales is known only from a study of the resulting phase diagram . simulations of the inner disk reproduce the system observed in the first simulation in 1991 . ( [ fig : variable _ alpha ] ) . its apparent size is small because the amount of dark matter present in the inner disk is small compared to that of the outer disk . however , in the simulation the inner disk differs from the outer disk .at the beginning of the transition , not at the end as was observed in the grs 1915 + 2 data . this is due to the fact that as the outer disk makes the transition to the high state , the increased heat transferred to the inner disk causes the disk to go into the high state as well and to cool . in addition , measuring the @ xmath0 - value with some precision does not seem to be a sufficient explanation for the fast thermal transitions observed in the data which are dependent on the more predictable arrival time of rapid cooling . an alternative way of observing the fast transition could have been observed if the heating / cooling fronts disappear and are converted back to cooling / cooling fronts . this phenomenon was explained in terms of the large scale ionization transition model by cannizzo ( 1993 , see also in his figure 2 ) , where it appears to be an unusual phenomenon . however , we have not been able to observe any fast transition phenomena ( except for the examples shown in ref . [ 1 : x _ alpha ] ) , which should not be too surprising , due to the fact that the underlying structure of the outer disk and the structure described in this figure are very different , and one does not see a direct connection between thesetwo reasons . although we do not use actual light curves , we should note that we have not attempted to determine the value @ xmath67 to be a function of @ xmath85 , since the change from @ xmath140 to @ xmath141 causes a slight change in the physical structure of the spectrum . our hope is that the value of the @ xmath142 will help to explain the physical structure . unfortunately , all our attempts in this regard ( with @ xmath67 decreasing or increasing in the spectrum of @ xmath85 ) have been unsuccessful . although our model is able to reproduce a lot of the same patterns seen in the light curves of grs 1915 + 105 , the rise / fall time scales are much shorter in the models than they appear in the simulations . the short rises and falls are probably the reason why the shape of an outburst in one of the observed light curves of grs 1915 + 105 ( e . g . , outburst ( c ) of fig . [ fig : c ] ) has more of a plane - wave shaped shape rather than the round shape that an outburst has in the simulations ( see fig . [ fig : lcurves ] below ) . the difference betweenour experiment and the theory are interesting enough to us to consider the addition of a new element to our model and test whether it will bring the model closer to the truth . the following experiments have led us in adding the new elements of our model . the speed with which the ground state moves outward from the closed disk is equal to the speed of the transition wave , which was found both by , e . g . , meyer ( 1984 ) and independently by menou , hameury & stehle ( 1998 ) . both of these studies found that the initial temperature of the transition wave is @ xmath143 . the time scale for the transition wave to reach an outer disk of radius r is @ xmath144 , i . e . , the temperatures in the simulations above are @ xmath145 times higher than the initial time scale of the outer region of the closed disk itself . this is the reason why the rises and falls take so long in the simulation according to the data . also , note that during the first phase of the transition from the low to the high state , the temperature rises very rapidly in the simulations ( see also [ see : lcurves ] below ) , at constant rate .as well as that observed in the sky . however , if a fusion process managed to ` ` cut ' ' the observed light curves at , say , @ xmath146 , so that anything seen by the observer at this level _ is not seen _ by the observer , then the observed results would be much more consistent with the model . to assume a process managed to ` ` cut ' ' the light curves , we should assume that no fusion events are known to occur at grs 1915 + 1 ( e . g . , mirabel and rodriguez 1994 ) . however , eikenberry et al . ( 1998 ) , mirabel et al . ( 1997 ) and rodriguez & pooley ( 1998 ) have found that there is a strong correlation between the x - ray emission and emission at the infrared and radio wavelengths . the radio and infrared emission is due to the fusion events taking place in the outer regions of the disk . the gas pressure measured at the center of the disk ( that may consist of the fusion events ) was found ( e . g . , gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 ) to be as high as @ xmath147 sec @ xmath148 ##8 sec @ .##math115 for the jet was observed by mirabel and rodriguez ( 1994 ) . during later experiments ( e . g . , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , the combined energies were a factor of @ xmath149 greater than the factor observed by mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 ) , which therefore would be @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 because of @ xmath115 injected into the jet , which is as large as the total x - ray flux emitted by the jet . however , if one were to model these two energies in the terms of our model , one would have to wait for a large amount of the thermal _ energy _ to be injected into the jet . from here on , we can simply assume that the _ thermal _ energy @ xmath152 consists of two parts : the first is the x - ray flux @ xmath153 , that is equal to the sum of the thermal disk and non - thermal disk energy ; and the second part @ xmath154 is the ` ` thermal energy ' ' , i . e . , the energy injected into the jet . for .we may assume that the jet power is not present in x - rays , and therefore not in the sun and other non - x - ray sources . as such , the best known total jet power is given by : ( [ fvert ] ) , where we may further assume that @ xmath155 . the total power is : @ xmath156 where @ xmath157 is the amount of energy that flows from the disk into the atmosphere . this value ( @ xmath158 ) may be a constant , or it may be a function of the atmospheric pressure or a function of some other parameter , e . g . , the total disk power @ xmath152 . since the contribution of jet energy to the radiative effect is not determined by the parameter @ xmath159 , and since according to our model in : [ 2 : 1 ] @ xmath160 in this case , the contribution of jet is not seen in our model . therefore , the total x - ray power @ xmath153 will come from the jet power ( and @ xmath161 of the total disk power ) and the jet power which is given .an equation similar to that ( [ lj ] ) holds with the equation @ xmath162 instead of @ xmath158 for the disk . to correct this misunderstanding of our model , we assume that the fusion energy is distributed among the disk , the corona , and the jet as @ xmath161 , @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 , respectively . we should also note that the amount of energy carried out by the jet is small compared to that going into the black hole , so we substitute the former for the latter density ( cf . [ eq4 ] ) . the second rule is very simple : if the primary source of the fusion energy is the active galactic corona , then to produce one individual proton in the jet , the particles in the jet must contribute their total mass ( which is small compared with their bulk mass ) to that one individual proton . these particles would then have to go into the black hole in order to produce another proton into the jet . more precisely , the mean decay rate is @ xmath165 , where @ xmath166 is times the local mean mass density of the jet . thisis to be compared with the rotational velocity of the disk , that is , to @ xmath167 , where @ xmath168 is the ` ` radiative ' ' energy of the jet and @ xmath152 is the total disk area . thus , @ xmath169 since @ xmath170 . this approximation is very useful . for example , if the jet speed is increased by magnetic fields induced by electron - hole interactions , then the energy carried away from the jet is much higher . a further approximation allows us to estimate the angular momentum transferred from the disk into the jet . we point out here that the second term depends on the speed of the jet ; if the charged particles only lose a small part of the angular momentum as they are carried away from the disk , then the force induced by the jet on the disk will be non - linear . we want to explore these possibilities in future papers . eikenberry et al . ( 1998 ) showed that the jet effects are stopped in the low state and accelerated at the middle and during the high state . we therefore can define a parameterization of @ xmath158 such that it is close to zero when theit is in the low state , and it is very large ( but much smaller than disk , of course ) when the disk is in the high state . we now have two more experimental examples for the jet @ xmath158 to illustrate the possible effects of the radiation energy being converted into the jet . let us assume that the jet @ xmath158 is described by the following ( very carefully calculated ) equation : @ xmath171 where @ xmath172 is the total power of the disk in terms of the upper limit . this equation is not correct since one expects matter to be ejected from the disk when the power @ xmath102 exceeds ( and thus exceeds ) the upper limit . while the power may not be the actual total power of the jet , the increased power may cause more matter to be ejected and thus produce more jets . we show in figure ( [ 1 : steady1 ] ) the total x - ray power curve ( dashed line ) and the total disk power @ xmath152 ( represented by the dashed line ; broken down by the factor of 2 to form the figure ) for the energy jet @ xmat##h173 . note that the resulting light curve is the same as we would have had with our original formula for the initial choice of @ xmath67 and @ xmath10 , but with reduced jet power ( see [ sect : results ] & [ sect : results ] ) . the slope of the curve gradually becomes more than a square - root , and thus the rises and falls appear to be smaller than they were for the choice with @ xmath174 , thus making it difficult to reproduce this shape of the other light - curves ( in particular , panels ( d ) of fig . [ fig : data ] ) . as a simple example , we have the following formula for the jet power : @ xmath175 ( this formula , in addition to the one shown in fig . [ [ fj1 ] ] , was one among several that we used to generate the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig . [ [ fig : data ] ] , as shown in [ fig : test3 ] ) . the resulting x - ray light curve and the total energy of the outburst are shown in fig ( [ fig : steady2 ] ) . one assumes that the shape of the curve isx - rays are then averaged with respect to the total emission energy . when the disk contains most of the energy fraction , the x - ray light jet only has a theoretical shape , since most of the energy is absorbed into the disk during that period . this shape may be responsible for the ` ` transient ' ' nature of the jet seen in figure ( 1 ) of image ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) . as a simple example we consider a set of light jets emitted by our laser with a simple expression for the total energy of @ xmath158 and with the emission energy as the only part that is constant . the general form of @ xmath158 is then given by : . ( [ fj ] ) . then , motivated by the fact that the x - ray energy will vary only when it is in the high state ( see fig . 1 ) , whereas it does not vary very much in the low energy state , we expect the energy @ xmath67 far away from the jet rather than from the primary light source to vary at that point . thus , the @ xmath67 - jet will also have _ _ _ energy @ xmath176 , .that @ xmath177 : @ xmath178 where @ xmath179 is the real part of , the randomly chosen value of @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 is a random variable distributed uniformly between - 1 and + 1 ( the final value of @ xmath181 is randomly chosen every 2 years ) , and @ xmath182 is a function of the @ xmath183 such that it is constant for the inner disk and it is constant for @ xmath184 . the term elliptic function was introduced here to avoid confusion with the general ##ity condition of @ xmath185 , where we take the disk region to be that described by the disk - based shakura - sunyaev model with the parameter @ xmath186 ( see [ see : below ] ) . the shape of the curve @ xmath187 is almost completely invariant for the resulting elliptic curve as long as @ xmath188 is constant , since all of the constant ##s is constant in the inner disk region . however , although the last term on the right hand side of the equation ( [ 3 ] ) appears to be linear and time - independent , its value is notnecessary and sufficient only to make the light curve appear even more random . most of the experimental results of this paper depend on the correct values for the periodic part in @ xmath67 . figure ( [ fig : xandj ] ) shows the observed x - ray light curve for the different expansion rates . it is then combined figure ( [ fig : xandj ] ) with figure ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) , in which the random part and the part in @ xmath67 are observed . the region with the expansion rate shown in @ xmath111 ( i . e . , panel b of fig . [ fig : lcurves ] ) has not been observed as well as that with the observed expansion rate ; this is of course due to the fact that more light is emitted from the part in the former as compared with the latter . the regions ( a ) and ( b ) do appear at random , which is probably due to the periodic ##ity in the region @ xmath67 ( in fig . ( [ fig ] ) . comparing figures ( b ) and ( c ) of this paper , one finds that it turns out to be difficult to determinecompare the ` z - shaped ' pattern ( c ) and the ` ` square ' ' pattern ( d ) of fig 2 with the _ z _ pattern for @ xmath158 . it is the latter pattern , i . e . , the initial pattern , that allows our model to exactly fit the data ( see [ c ] and [ d ] of fig . 2 ) ; the only difference is that in panel ( a ) the volume fraction of the solid material is much larger than in panel ( b ) . for the purposes of comparison , we can model the peak of @ xmath154 with the dotted curve in fig . ( [ fig : jet1 ] ) corresponding to the dotted curve in panel ( c ) of fig . ( [ fig : xandj ] ) . given the very good comparison between the models and the data of grs 1915 + 105 , we believe that we may have a better understanding on the physical properties of gas in this region . although we are not sure about the shape of the z - shape in the @ xmath189 model , we believe that the shape of the gas disk in grs 1915 + 105 is that of a very thin and very thin disk (( [ sect : geometry ] ) . most of the x - ray energy is supplied by an extremely active jet , that may cover the entire solar corona , because of periodic strong solar winds ( e . g . , haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; nayakshin & smith 1997 ; nayakshin 1998 ) . in the latter case , the delay @ xmath67 of the energy flow from the sun into the jet and the corona can be thought of as a time delay effect . however , we note that these transient ##s may be an integral part of the solar wind , and are likely to be the result of an extremely high radiation dose . we will address this issue in a different way in [ sect : geometry ] . belloni et al . ( 1997a , b ) were the first to model the spectrum of grs 1915 + 1 with a two - dimensional model , consisting of a multi - component quasi - disk with a large inner disk radius and a band - gap . very quickly , these researchers showed that much of the observed brightness variation could be explained by a fast change in the large disk radius @ xmath7 and a slow change in the size of thesee instability @ xmath7 . they have also found a relationship between the observed rotation rate r and the equilibrium temperature of the inner disk . our models are very similar to the model of the disk as proposed by belloni et al . for grs 1915 + , since in the low state the inner disk is quite dim ( up to a factor of 10 - 20 , see figure [ 1 : 1 ] ) compared with what it should have been if the disk were normal . however , the inner part of the disk can be considered normal and can be said to be ` ` normal ' ' . at the same time , in the high state , the inner disk is greater than the equilibrium radius by quite a factor of a half , which would make the inner part of the disk ( that is , and therefore , half the ` ` normal ' ' radius ) also quite dim . under these conditions , it would be non - trivial to distinguish observationally between a disk where the temperature is a linear function of r ( @ xmath190 ) and a disk where the temperature is lower than that of the inner part of the disk , since the inner disk has a small fraction of the equilibrium radius . in general ,the inner disk is almost completely devoid of mass in our model , although the difference between the inner disk mass distribution in the high versus that in the low state may be a result of @ xmath1 leading to none ( see fig . [ fig : c _ z _ distr ] . ) . note that @ xmath7 values obtained by belloni et al . should be associated with the largest radius produced by the heating process in our model . more precisely , during the high state , @ xmath7 should be taken as the radius of the inner disk , whereas during the low state it is approximately equal to the maximum radius of the disk produces which @ xmath191 ( i . e . , @ xmath192 for example . [ fig : c ] ) . our values of @ xmath7 are in fact much higher than those obtained by belloni et al . the value of @ xmath193 obtained from the model could be higher if we were to replace the grs 1915 + 1 model with a more accurate ( and much more accurate ) model than the multi - point temperature model for the shakura - sunyaev model . however , for the actual heating process .in this case , the star would be more highly transparent and thus behave like a kerr ( rather than a neutron ) star ( see paper by taam et al . since this source has the highest intensity for a kerr source , the resulting spectrum would have a constant @ xmath7 . however , the value of @ xmath7 proposed by us would also be negative for a kerr black hole . we hope to answer this question in the future . belloni et al . ( 1997b ) propose that the burst duration is equal to the duration of the preceding radio burst , but there is no correlation between the burst and the decay time of the burst . observations of bursts in our model are quite different , and we assume we have a correlation among these bursts , in contrast to the belloni et al . model . on the other hand , in our model ( other than the one presented by belloni et al . 1997b ) grs 1915 + 105 does not show a significant correlation between the duration of the burst and the burst decay time ( cf . belloni 1999 , radio bursts ) . we have also studied the physical mechanisms underlying the formation of grs 1915 + 105 , and have arrived at some preliminary .regarding the nature of the large - scale flow , see this article . as shown in fig [ 2 : 1 ] , very thin s - type flows are ideal for this theory , since they would produce s - type flows with a very small duty cycle compared to those observed in the disk , for decay rates greater than the time constant . to produce flows as large as @ xmath194 ##e , very thick s flows would require very large values of @ xmath0 . however , if the decay rate is strictly non - exponential , then a large adaf flow could produce flows with a large duty cycle ( @ xmath34 ) . but since the decay time scale for very thick flows is as small as the standard deviation , their decay rates would be very low which completely fails the theory ( see , e . g . , the r & d of fig . 3 ) . showing how the fact ( e . g . , belloni et al . 1997a , b ; muno , smith & remillard 1999 ) that the disk narrows down to the entire disk region during the decay period can be explained with the use of thevery slowly , optical and infrared , respectively . for these reasons , the very thin galactic disk with the high ozone layer , hot stars , and w ##s seems to be the most likely candidate . as we have shown in this paper , this approach also allows us to make very good theoretical connections between the models and observations , and to explain the properties of the light curve in terms of specific physical properties . however , the general public may question whether the very large number of observations used by us in this paper allow us to pin - point the value of these parameters . we hope that the answer to this question is ` ` no ' ' , because statistical analysis , used so extensively today , may prove to be very useful in future studies . for example , we have discussed only the low energy light curve in this paper , whereas the tables below provide a lot of information about the time evolution of grs 1915 + 1 ( belloni et al . 1997 ; muno et al . 1999 ) . if further studies will provide more details of the light - curve model ( e . g . , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , then we have a chance of determining the parameters of h @ xmath158and the net effect @ xmath67 is the observed burst . however , we should not try to ignore the fact that the burst and the black hole profiles do not show anything similar to grs 1915 + 1 , at least not to the most significant degree . therefore , putting all these experimental and theoretical data together would be very useful in comparing the theoretical support for the model and the solar and galactic models . as an example of the need for a detailed description of the burst and qpos in the context of our model , we point out the following . from the results of muno et al . ( 1999 ) it appears that qpos are present when the energy - loss model describes the burst , which usually occurs during the low state ( ` ` low ' ' is the high burst rate ) . however , these results note that for the burst rate similar to the one shown in fig . 1 ( d ) , the qpos are present during the ` ` high ' ' state , which is similar to that of the other models . if qpos also indicate the presence of a large burst , this would mean that although our model ( d ) in fig . ( [ 1 : xandj ] ) is similar to the. . ( d ) , which does not explain the observed fluctuations very well . however , the figures seem to suggest that the higher count rate states will have higher count rates in the inner disk than the lower rate states ( because more liquid flows into the disk ) . it is also possible that the fluctuations occur during the short periods in figure 1 ( d ) rather than during the long ones ( e . g . , from @ xmath195 to @ xmath1 960 ##0 in this example ) . the ` ` s - s ' ' of the panels in fig . ( [ fig : data ] ' ) can also be ignored because these would be the low states being produced in the inner disk , and the high states of the three main panels ( a - c ) of fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) have similar fluctuations albeit with higher count rates . although we have not yet done a detailed analysis of this phenomenon , we can still incorporate it into our model , but only if we allow the variations in our sample values to depend on the panel size . _ note , however , that in this case we must use the samples from the inner disk in order to .1 ( b ) of fig . ( 1 ) . _ the emphasis here of note is on the exact interpretation of the second law that we have presented in this paper . we know that our work is still somewhat incomplete and we have not understood the exact interpretation of the second law in grs 1915 + 1 . the actual effects may well be much more complex , and in fact , the formation of the s - curve might be due to more than the induced effects , possibly causing an effect that we do not fully understand . however , based on the data presented in this paper , we are confident that there is an s - curve from this model , and that this curve can be described accurately by the second law given in above ( [ eq3 ] ) . a major limitation of our model is the presence of a non - rotating halo around a non - rotating black hole . we hope to avoid this in our future work . we hope that this will change the ` ` true ' ' values of the parameters that we estimate , such as the radius @ xmath67 , and the actual radius r , of interest , but that this will not change the true value of our model . the results of mr . e##oni , m . taam , m . muno , m . smith , a . remillard , a . vishniac and a . kazanas for further research . this project is funded in part by federal grants nag5 - 8239 and nag5 - 4057 , through the national research program .
