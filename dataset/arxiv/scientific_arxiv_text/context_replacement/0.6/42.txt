these white dwarfs ( denoted with ` ' ` ` - ' ' ) provide an opportunity to determine the likely source of planetary debris . although planets have not yet been found in white dwarfs , the evidence for the presence of planetary debris in these objects is in their outer atmosphere . approximately one quarter of white dwarfs show the presence of elements other than hydrogen in their atmosphere @ xcite and approximately one quarter of these show a near - infrared ( ir ) spectrum that is consistent with a circumstellar , dusty disk @ xcite . recent studies using the gamma ray camera on the _ planck space telescope _ @ xcite have shown that about half of all white dwarfs with surface temperatures ranging from 17000 k to 27000 k have such disks . more recent studies of these white dwarfs have revealed significant differences in the composition of the observed material . based on a study of ultraviolet ( uv ) spectroscopy of a sample of white dwarfs ( 19000 < @ xmath0 ##2 ) , @ xcite showed that the chemical composition of the observed material was similar to that found among solar system objects , although the effect of the radiative gas exchange on rotation rate , is unknown . @ xcite showed thatthe high abundance of trace elements , hydrogen for example , has altered cooling patterns in the white dwarf ( @ xmath1 k ) . by incorporating this effect into their sample , @ xcite found that at least 25 % of their white dwarf sample , which included the @ xcite sample , would be actively cooling , and in 75 % of these samples , and among the elements in their sample , the effect of radiative cooling changes the abundance patterns . the absence of this effect also leads to a decrease in the orbital rotation rate of trace elements with @ xmath2 k ( e . g . , wd0431 + 126 ) . the analysis of uv and ir spectra of several hot white dwarfs by @ xcite found the source material to be of a neutral composition where the abundance of trace elements is low compared to trace elements . however , @ xcite found that the hot , iron - rich and massive white dwarf nltt 43806 ( @ dazh ) is rich in iron but low in silicon which suggests that the source material is similar to the star itself . this has been found in hot white dwarfs ( e . g . , galex j1931 + 0117; * ? ? ? * ) , and , in all of these cases , the amount of hydrogen with respect to the other trace elements strongly suggests that the parent star contains some amount of water . for example , kepler - 11 @ xcite showed that the parent material contained hydrogen in excess of the amount expected to be produced by iron fusion , suggesting that the parent star contains water . a similar phenomenon , but with a smaller amount of hydrogen , was reported in the spectrum of sdss j124231 . 07 @ xmath3522626 . 0 @ xcite . the material present on the surface of a white dwarf is subject to two processes : trace elements are rapidly absorbed by the convective envelope of hot white dwarfs , and spread - out into the convection zone for a period of time much longer than diffusion timescales @ xcite . the hundreds @ xcite of diffusion timescales suggest that traces of an absorption line are present in the atmosphere of a cool ( 6000 k ) hydrogen - rich white dwarf for several @ xmath4 years and much longer ( several @ xmath5 years ) for hot hydrogen - rich white dwarfs . thus , the diffusion process would follow that of theits history , and the abundance of these elements is very low when compared to the average abundance of hot white dwarfs ( @ xmath6 ##8 ) . we present a physical and chemical analysis of the previously discovered hot , massive white dwarf ( nltt 19868 ) from the new nltt sample of @ xcite . we present details of the new data in section 2 : we present new low - and high - temperature spectra as well as new and improved temperature data used to determine the standard energy distribution ( sed ) . in section 3 , we analyze our observed data and the three parameters : temperature , atmospheric pressure , and density . then , in section 4 , we attempt to map the observed history onto this data . next , we present a comparison with the spectra of hot white dwarfs and the unusual photospheric structure of the hot white dwarf nltt 19868 , and , finally , we present our results . we present a chemical and physical analysis of the newly discovered white dwarf nltt 19868 . we first observed nltt 19868 with the eso variable star survey and camera ( efosc2 ) attached to the new zealand telescope ( ntt) at la silla observatory on ut 2009 may 1 . using grism ##o measurements ( in g / h ) with the slit - width set to 1 s , we obtained a measurement of @ xmath7 . the two resulting spectra of 1800 s each revealed a single daz ##nic structure with strong h & h coupling . we followed up on our previous measurements with three sets of echelle measurements of using the x - ray telescope @ xcite ##r to the ut3 at paranal observatory on ut 2014 may 28 , 31 and june 1 . the slit - width was set to 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 5 s for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . this measurement yielded a resolving power of 9900 , 7450 and 7780 for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . the doubling times for the uvb and vis arms were 2940 and 3000 s , respectively , and for the nir arms we obtained two spectra of 600 s each . we used the resulting spectra from the efosc2 and x - ray telescopes to obtain spectra of @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 and of nltt 19868 , respectively . finally , we used thethe magnitude of nltt 19868 and of the associated comparison star ( dec [ j2000 ] = 08h ##10 . 03 . 44s , dec [ j2000 ] = @ xmath101005525 ) with four measurements ( @ xmath11 mag , @ xmath12 mag , @ xmath13 mag , and @ xmath14 mag ) from the aavso chandra all - sky survey ( apass ) . apass is an all - sky survey consisting of three instruments ( johnson @ xmath15 and @ xmath9 , and sloan @ xmath16 , @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 ) with a magnitude range from about 10 up to 20 . we related the sloan @ xmath17 magnitude to the johnson @ xmath8 magnitude using the following equations of lupton ( 2005 ) : [ multiblock - 1 ] @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 we calculated @ xmath8 using these equations and using the difference of the two measurements ( @ xmath21 mag ) . then , using the difference between the instrumental magnitude of nltt 19868 and the comparison star , we calculated @ xmath229 and @ xmath23 , for nltt 19868 . note that the measurements for @ xmath9 and @ xmath8 are indirect , and exclude any significant gravitational effects . we used the indirect measurements from the 2 ##m infrared sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) and _ _ _ _ _ ide - european infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ? the measurements which are based on the solar system are listed in table [ tbl _ 1 ] . the @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 measurements are not available because no upper bounds are available for this measurement . we also used the _ wise _ data in conjunction with our x - ray @ xmath9 _ data . these measurements indicate that there is a nearby star 5 . 2 au away at a small distance p . a . = 107 @ xmath26 . the nearby star does not have the red dwarf proper motion and , therefore , is not closely associated . assuming the proper motion of nltt 19868 the distance between the nearby star and nltt 19868 would have been 5 . 2 au ##ond p . a . = 107 @ xmath26 at the time the _ wise _results were published ( 2010 ) . since the mass correction factor ( mp ) of @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 is 6 . 1 and 6 . 2 % , respectively , the _ _ _ wise data contained in the [ tbl _ 1 ] should agree with nltt 19868 and the distant object . the degree of contamination is unknown since the spectral type of the distant object is unknown , although the sed shows it to be a young star ( @ xmath29k ) . we have reviewed the 2mass images which show that nltt 19868 and the distant object are well separated , and we conclude that the 2mass wise data of nltt 19868 are not contaminated by the distant object . the 2mass images do not contain any information that would cause confusion with the @ xmath30 ##k . . imaging and spectroscopy [ id = " < , ^ , ^ " , id = " ^ " , ] . observations of distant , very hot white dwarfs attempt to determine the presence of stellar objects with an early intermediate period , i . e . , shortly after the distant object leaves the main - sequence . however , because of the slow ##down timescales required for the observationhowever , these effects can be more pronounced , especially during a large extinction event . in this case , the variety of relative timescales between a variety of objects would lead to time - averaged ratios to the maximum necessary for a better understanding of the chemical composition at the edge of the transition zone ( * * ? ? ? * ) . the number of cool daz white dwarfs is small compared to the number of their hot daz counterparts , especially to the helium - rich dz white dwarfs . focusing our attention on the helium - rich objects may help determine whether their composition is similar to the more hot dzs . in this regard , our understanding of the cool daz white dwarfs nltt 19868 and related objects is important . nltt 19868 is among the hottest cool daz white dwarfs . only three other daz white dwarfs have temperatures above 5500 k : g174 - 50 ( @ xmath31 k , @ xcite ) , nltt 10480 ( @ xmath32 k , @ xcite ) and g77 - 50 ( @ xmath33 k , @ xcite ) . the mean temperature measured for g77 - 50 is the weighted average of the temperature measured from @ xcite and @ x##cite . com . [ fig _ ratio ] ( top panel ) shows the calcium abundance of the seven hot daz red giants with temperatures greater than 7000 k . the bulk masses for each of these stars were calculated with the help of @ xcite . the calcium abundance varies by several orders of magnitude , consistent with previous observations ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this range of values is both the result of temperature changes in the sample material and of the large time period since the last observation , resulting in a temperature - induced increase in the calcium abundance . [ fig _ ratio ] ( bottom panel ) this shows the fe / ca abundance ratio for stars with a high calcium abundance . even though the ratio is low , a large increase ( @ xmath34 ) in the fe / ca abundance ratio is observed . in the small sample of stars shown in fig . [ fig _ ratio ] , @ xmath35 > @ xmath36 , which is lower than the bulk - mass abundance ratio of @ xmath37 @ xcite but is still consistent with the @ xmath38 of the sample . we compare our small sample to the small sample of the otherwhite dwarfs occur in @ xcite which compares white dwarfs with @ xmath39 k to @ xmath40 k . our hot sample has a slightly lower temperature and a higher abundance than what is observed in the @ xcite sample which has an average of @ xmath41 and above @ xmath42 . the main reason for the increase in the abundance is that in the hot sample the temperature is higher than in the cooler sample and this brings down the temperature of the @ xcite sample . however , the observations of @ xmath43 ( nltt 888 ; * ? ? ? * ) and @ xmath44 ( nltt 19868 ) are different . the abundance ratio observed in the nltt 888 is very comparable to that of the cool dz white dwarf sdss j1043 + 3516 ( @ xmath45 , * ? ? ? * ) the k / c in nltt 19868 is slightly higher than in the cool daz nltt 43806 ( @ xmath46 , * ? ? ? the high abundance of @ xmath47 in nltt 19868 is also the highest observed among the hot white dwarfs , and thethe average abundance of magnesium with respect to the other heavier elements . this abundance ratio is much lower than that of nltt 43806 ( @ xmath48 = - 0 . 2 , * ? ? ? . ) , the abundance of @ xmath49 is among the lowest among known white dwarf stars , in fact it is the second lowest after the well studied dbaz - 362 ( @ xmath50 , * ? ? ? * ) . a comparison with the average of the most known white dwarf , * @ xcite , for which the abundance is @ xmath51 with a ratio of 0 . 2 , also puts nltt 19868 at the magnesium - rich end of the scale . cooling to the bottom of the oxidation state changes the observed abundance ratio over a time period much longer than cooling timescales . stars with longer cooling timescales relative to other elements are rare , and their abundance ##s will change over time . in the case of ground state stars , the observed z1 / z2 abundance ratio is usually given by @ xmath52 . in the steady state , i . e . , slow ( cooling ) , the abundance ( @ xmath53) the abundance pattern is given by @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 represents the diffusion timescales at the surface of the boundary layer which are known to be highly stable . however , these timescales are uncertain . similar values are required for materials with surface temperatures above 6000 k . the abundance pattern of the parent material @ xmath56 is also uncertain and could , for example , refer to surface ( * * ? ? ? * ) , core , core , or core material @ xcite . other types of materials , based on the interactions with solar system materials such as those of comets and asteroids must also be considered . a comparison of the fe / ca # ##s of the two cases of nltt 888 ( @ xmath57 k ) and nltt 19868 ( @ xmath58 k ) and of both cases shows large abundance ratios in the parent material with some variation brought upon by thermal heating . the observed fe / ca ratio is 1 in nltt 888 and 0 . 5 in nltt 19868 . in both cases , steady - state heating alone does not significantly change the abundance ratio relative to the parent material itself . next , we consider the case of nltt 888 .with the age of @ xcite between 5000 and 6000 years , we find @ xmath59 and the abundance ratio for both media is nearly identical . the timescales from @ xcite , @ xmath60 , comes to the same conclusion . however , the abundance ratio of the core material fe / ca @ xmath61 years exceeds that of earth - ( @ xmath6213 . 3 ) and near - earth ( @ xmath621 . 4 ) considering that the core material of nltt 888 consists of 66 % core iron and 33 % carbon . the data related to mass measurements for these two materials from @ xcite and @ xcite . considering that the fe / ca abundance ratio is expected to increase over a longer time period ( @ xmath63 years ) and the fact that it is cut off , the total amount of core iron present in the core material of the core material of nltt 888 would be at a similar value . the presence of core iron also indicates the possible presence of the , previously unknown , trace elements such as oxygen and carbon @ xcite . a small amount of iron (1 % ( * , * ? * ) is also expected to be present in the core , although if both core and mantle were to be considered , most of the material would come from the core . among the large sample of young red dwarfs , in high mass stars , such as in the sample of @ xcite iron - deficiency is also observed , for example , when compared to earth , as pg 0843 @ xmath3516 and pg 1015 @ xmath3161 sample , where the fe / ca ratio is similar to the planet earth . however , in comparison of the fe / ca ratios for stars in their sample , galex 1931 @ xmath30117 is the star with the highest fe / ca ratio @ xcite and is only slightly higher than that of nltt 888 . results for nltt 19868 suggest that , on the surface , core - type material is completely absent and that the parent material is most likely composed of core - type material . under steady - state conditions , the high iron content in the core indicates a strong deficiency in the parent material , i . e . , much lower than the ' s chemical composition . such a deficiency of iron in the parent material ,i . e . , unlike that of the earth s mantle , would not be present . the observed fe / ca abundance ratio is only known if the temperature of earth s mantle is that fell below @ xmath64 years ago , enough to significantly increase the fe / ca abundance ratio of the convection zone to the present value . note that the timescales used by @ xcite are much longer than those used by @ xcite , up to a factor of 10 . the difference is because the convection zone has depths in the region used by @ xcite where it would be in a different environment . the abundance of the convection zone at higher temperatures ( @ xmath65 years ) is not determined by the theoretical assumptions of the diffusion theory , but , rather , the assumptions of the rate - of - motion and of the tables of @ xcite . comparing the tables of @ xcite and @ xcite at 5000 and 6000 years , we have @ xmath66 and 0 . 96 , respectively . if they remained at the same , the observed fe / ca ratio of 1 . 0 would be equal to the present value of 0 . 96 in @ xmath67 and in @ xcite - a .longer periods of @ xmath68 results than @ xcite . the shorter mean time implied by the calculations of @ xcite for an unusually high convection rate ( @ xmath69 ) . using the shorter mean time implied by the calculations of @ xcite , we can calculate the initial abundance ratio of fe / ca @ xmath70 ##0 : @ xmath71 where the mean time since the initial event is @ xmath72 years and the corresponding timescale is @ xmath73 years . suppose that the mass of the initial event is @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 @ xcite , respectively @ xmath76 ##8 , and the total amount of iron released onto the white dwarf is @ xmath77 ##1 , then , assuming an initial abundance fraction of 1 % of the system , the initial convection rate would have been @ xmath78 years . this also corresponds to less than 1 percent of the mass of the planet ( @ xmath79 ) . the same overall process , but with a new system characterized by a higher fe / ca abundance fraction than .the latter , would require a large theoretical upper limit ( settling at @ xmath80 ##1 ) to explain the observed , present - day ca / ca # ##s . for an unknown time as long as the convection event itself , even this would have dropped below the theoretical limit ( @ xmath81 ) of @ xmath80 years . in addition , we also found a very cool , young white dwarf with strong lines of carbon among weak lines of magnesium , calcium , and iron . our element gas also showed the highest magnesium to calcium isotope ratio of any known young white dwarf . using the element gas model , we found that the convection event of the young daz white dwarf , nltt 888 , and that of nltt 19868 are closely related . the material injected into the surface of nltt 888 is composed primarily of the iron - rich earth core material , while the material injected onto the surface of nltt 19868 is more similar to earth core material . in the case of nltt 19868 , the accretion event most likely occurred on uncertain timescales ago . although these models are plausible , many of the results rely upon uncertain - timescale assumptions . i .j . and j . m . , ##ments from the number ##ees of the czech republic ( 13 - 14581s and 13 - 15943s ) and ministry of education , culture and sports ( lg14013 ) . this publication is also supported by the number rvo : 67985815 of the czech republic . this publication makes use of data products from the wide -
