understanding the mechanisms responsible for electro - optic symmetry breaking is one of the most important goals of linear accelerator and particle physics . experimental and theoretical studies of the sm higgs field make the precise measurements of the physics of higgs interactions one of the main design goals of the linear accelerator ( lc ) . both the higgs particles of the standard model ( sm ) and those of alternative models will be directly observed in @ xmath0 collisions with various decay modes . a large number of possible decay modes will be observed with low energies and high energies . these observations enable us to measure the fundamental properties of the higgs field with high precision . the design of ecfa / desy experiments aims at a better understanding of the physics involved , enabling measurement of the highest number of higgs observables as well as providing a good cross - link between experiments , computer programs and experiment data . the light scattering accelerator offers us the study of light - photon interactions from light - scattering laser beams . the development of and progress in higgs physics at the linear accelerator is covered extensively in these articles @ xcite . in @ xmath0 collisions , the sm higgs field .+ , through the higgs - strahlung process , @ xmath1 @ xcite and through the w - fusion process @ xmath2 @ xcite . the total experimental cross - sections are well known for the electro - weak corrections at the one - loop corrections . for a brief summary of the experimental results see e . g . @ xcite . + the total one - loop corrections to the ww - fusion results have been published @ xcite . the radiatively measured cross - sections for higgs - strahlung and ww - fusion are shown in ref . [ 1 : zhxsec ] . for higgs - strahlung the corrections are positive for small higgs masses and negative for large higgs masses and values of @ xmath3 . for ww - fusion the corrections are of equal magnitude but are negative . + with the higgs particles being measured for mass , the corrections to the other particles are proportional to their masses : @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 . the higgs particles evolve rapidly into the more kinematically stable particle population . state - of - the - art classification of particles into electro - weak and weak .@ xcite is used in the program hdecay @ xcite for the lc and its associated supersymmetric model , the mssm . the mass of the interacting higgs particles in the mssm can be directly calculated with the feynhiggsdecay @ xcite . the corresponding higgs interaction ratios in the energy range corresponding to the lc are shown in fig . [ 2 : hbr ] . a number of first - order monte carlo programs exist which are commonly used for higgs calculations of @ xmath0 processes . they include max @ xcite , herwig @ xcite , hzha @ xcite , comphep @ xcite , and whizard @ xcite . comphep and whizard provide the means of computing the complete @ xmath6 and ( in the case of whizard ) complete @ xmath7 processes and their interaction with sm backgrounds . beamstrahlung is used in the analysis described above with the parameterization of @ xcite . the vast majority of the analyses in this article involve the simulation of the sm processes . the effects of sm background detection and acceptance have been studied in the simple particle simulation program simdet @ xcite which is basedat the scale as used for the tesla detector at the tdr . a comparative study of different model programs and of different model - reconstruction programs is carried out by @ xcite . the programs which perform simulations of the particles use a simple pair - based neural - network algorithm based on zvtop @ xcite which was also used in the sld experiment . a 3d model ( called @ xcite ) of the tesla tdr detector based on geant3 combined with a simulation program is available and can be used for comparative studies . the basis of a model - independent experimental measurement of higgs recoil mass at the lc is the measurement of the decay cross - section for the higgs - strahlung interaction , @ xmath1 . these interactions can be observed in @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 experiments . from angular - momentum calculations the recoil mass measured against the @ xmath10 decay can be determined . from the calculation of the recoil mass , higgs interactions can be calculated regardless of their decay ##s , allowing for a model - independent measurement of the 1 ##d interaction , @ xmath11 . when @ xmath11 is selected , all the higgs interactions can be measured .. the total higgs - strahlung cross - section can be determined with an accuracy of 0 . 5 % for @ xmath12 gev and @ xmath13 gev for @ fb @ xmath14 @ xcite . assuming that the accuracy increases with the square root of the cross - section and that the measurement time and uncertainty are independent of the center - of - mass energy , one can obtain an accuracy between 0 . 5 % and 1 % for @ xmath15 gev , for an effective value of @ xmath16 fb @ xmath17 gev , a center - of - mass energy equal to the square of the cross - section for a given higgs mass . the exact accuracy is shown in fig . [ 2 : 1 ] , with the total center - of - mass energy as a function of the higgs mass . the possibility of the theoretical and experimental - based determination of @ xmath11 , e . g . , been explored in the context of supersymmetric models @ xcite and in the context of models with different higgs mass energies , as well as in the context of two - dimensional models @ xcite . the determination of the total cross - sectionand the angular distribution with sensitivity to the cp quantum numbers of the higgs particle : @ xmath18 . in the tdr , the sensitivity of the @ xmath19 - state of the higgs - strahlung cross - section relative to the detection point is used to determine the spin of the higgs particle . the spin can then be determined from the invariant mass of the off - state @ xmath10 resulting in the formula @ xmath20 for @ xmath21 . this method is independent of the higgs particle , and is therefore applicable both to @ xmath22 and gg ##d . the invariant mass determination for @ xmath23 gev is shown in fig . [ 1 : hzz ] . for @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 , the sensitivity of the two off - spin states can be used to determine sensitivity to higgs - spin and cp @ xcite . the cp quantum numbers , including the spin , can be determined from the higgs - spin and cp @ xcite . in the tdr , the sensitivity of the angular distribution of the @ xmath10 state against the @ xmath26 state .##ggs - strahlung is used . recently a simulation has been developed which makes use of the observed spin correlation of @ xmath27 events . the spin correlation of the two @ xmath28 events are determined by the correlation of their decay products . in addition , events from @ xmath29 and from @ xmath30 can be measured . the angle between the decay products of the two @ xmath31 events from the @ xmath28 decay yields a new event @ xcite . while this angle can be measured in the standard setting , instead it is measured in the higgs - rest frame , which can be easily measured from @ xmath28 decay to @ xcite . the results from this simulation have shown that from a comparison of the pairs @ xmath14 of higgs - strahlung events and @ xmath32 gev , a spin correlation between a cp - even and a cp - odd higgs pair of two standard masses can be calculated with same cross section and mass distribution as for @ xmath33 ( see ref . [ 2 : andreas ] , note that this is not always taken into account ) @ xcite . thethe determination of higgs spin - spin interactions is one of the major tasks of lc higgs studies . in the original tdr as well as in many other recent lc experiments @ xcite experiments have been conducted to determine the relative values of the branching ratio scale . for a particular higgs interaction with @ xmath34 gev , a large number of higgs spin ##s can be observed . the hadronic interactions into @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are detected via the detection method of the lc detector system . progress has been made recently in the level of precision with which the methods to detect b - and c - particles are integrated into the detector . although these experiments are now discontinued , it looks like that the results of the tdr experiments can still be verified @ xcite . there are two main ways to determine branching ratios from the observed data : 1 . determine the spin cross - section for a particular spin pair , e . g . @ xmath37 and multiplied by the total observed higgs strahlung cross - section ( events derived from the measured spin distribution ) @ xcite . 2 . calculate a set of the @ xmath38 interactions ( .( the total energy density ) and in the number of events corresponding to a single @ xmath39 decay in this sample . the latter method was first applied to higgs branching ratio calculations with @ xcite . since in this method multiple ( and in general multi - nomial ) events can be used , the values of the branching ratio can be calculated for the larger number of events than from the correlation function . although not based on calculations with @ xmath40 , the latter method has properties very similar to those of the tdr method @ xcite . the best result for the two methods for an observed higgs decay of 1 gev from a sample of the @ xmath41 is given by equation [ 1 : higgsbr ] . a unique combination of these methods is currently being investigated . while for the hadronic higgs decay , there is a small improvement , for the @ xmath42 method a large improvement can be expected from it . for the decay into @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 and @ xmath22 different decay ##s have been observed . the very rare decay @ xmath45 can be detected by ww - type experiments . @xmath46 gev for @ xmath12 gev . a measurement of the double beta decay with about 50 % of precision can be performed from a measurement of the m @ xmath14 . also , the time expansion of the decay cross - section with @ xmath47 is of interest . a direct measurement of the @ xmath45 is , which can also be performed at even higher energies and even higher energies @ xcite . the resulting result is shown in ref . [ tab : htomu ] . [ id = " < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > " , id = " , " , ] [ tab : heavysusy ] since at the production limit and at the lower limit the two - mssm higgs particles arise from the @ xmath10 , the mass range for their production in the lc is extended to an @ xmath48 from the lower energy limit . it has been studied during the 1990s , how the particle process could extend the energy range of the @ xmath0 lc . in particular , the ww - decay of @ xmath49 has been studied @xcite . the size of cross - section is equal to @ xmath50 . depending on the susy parameter , radiative expansion can increase the cross - section for @ xmath49 , thus allowing simulation of the mass - kinematic effect for large values of the mssm parameter . for backward - biased electron beams and forward - biased proton beams the cross - section can also be increased . a general scenario where this is the case has been demonstrated for @ xcite ( @ xmath51 350 gev , @ xmath52 gev , @ xmath53 gev and the beam itself ) . cross - section calculations for this scenario are shown in fig . [ fig : heavymssm ] . the higgs field can be upper - bound in the lc via @ xmath54 if @ xmath55 . a computer simulation of this scenario for the particle @ xmath56 has been performed for @ xmath46 gev , and for @ xmath14 , and @ xmath57 gev @ xcite . the background data and calculations are shown in fig . [ fig : hphm ] . the theoretical uncertainty is about 0 . 1 % . the simulation@ xmath58 , may be achieved for @ xmath59 gev . since for pair production the maximum threshold for large higgs production is equal to @ xmath48 , then the rare processes of single charged higgs production must be considered . the rare processes for single charged higgs production are @ xmath60 , and @ xmath61 . their cross - sections have been improved to first order by @ xcite . the corrections to @ xmath62 have also been known @ xcite and are ongoing . in general , the values for which the measured cross - section is 0 . 5 fb are too small for large higgs and for the pair production process . cross - section values for @ xmath63 gev and 800 gev are shown in bold . [ category : singlecharged ] . + at this level , the mssm higgs mass only depends on @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 . however , if @ xmath65 would be measured , @ xmath64 could in theory be directly determined from the measured higgs mass . in particular , the ability of @ xmath66 to low - mass decay is closely related to @xmath64 . using this method which results in the coupling of the @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 parameters , as well as in the weak coupling of @ xmath69 can be used to calculate @ xmath64 in general . this has been done for @ xcite . due to the large radiative effects the values for the observables also depend on the susy parameters ( in particular the sfermion energies and energies ) which are used in this model . all the measurement methods ( see [ ref : tanbeta ] ) are only possible if all the susy parameters , are already known . a new approach to @ xmath64 analysis has been developed for @ xcite . in a model where the susy parameters are small compared to the center - of - mass parameter , the dependence of the cross - section for the higgs particles of @ xmath70 in the low tev region can be related to the large sudakov dependence of the cross - section . in addition , it has been shown , that the energy term of the model depends only on @ xmath64 . a further example of susy parameter estimation in the model mssm .is obtained when measurements of the higgs mass are combined with observations about sparticle structure . in the other susy models which use the susy coupling between higgs observables , are subject to local variation @ xcite . as an alternative , the nuhm ( non - standard higgs model ) model has been proposed for @ xcite . the nuhm model allows unification of sfermion coupling and coupling , as well as unification of gaugino ##v measurements on a large scale . however , in contrast to the msugra ( standard supergravity ) model , both @ xmath71 and @ xmath65 are independent models . in fig . [ 2 : cmssmsensi ] , the deviation of decay time of the tau higgs mass from the origin is expressed for the nuhm model as a dependence of @ xmath65 . the deviation is expressed in terms of the deviation of the mean decay time of the lc ##m measurement of the tdr . it can be seen that in general @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 have a dependence to @ xmath65 but the dependence on @ xmath71 is only partial . as a result , thevalues of @ xmath64 as well as the other two parameters are unknown in this study and they have to be allowed to vary slightly in the data and have to be estimated from observations in order to convert the small values into small values on the experimental basis . this method gives the ratio @ xmath74 @ xcite . at tree level , in the mssm , this ratio is negative since all the particles and @ xmath28 particles undergo beta - decay ##s , comparing them to @ xmath75 to the @ xmath76 . the exact value of this ratio is very close to the size of the radiative contribution to these decay ##s . in experiments with the @ xmath77 these values are constant , helping to increase sensitivity to the measurement of @ xmath77 itself if all the susy parameters are known . the value of @ xmath78 as a function of @ xmath77 is shown in fig . [ 1 : bbttsensi ] . + in the mssm the higgs sector is invariant under the cp symmetry at tree level . however , it is possible to break cp symmetry in the higgs sector by radiativeand , finally , results from second generation anti - gravity @ xcite . such a model is also possible since it is a possible solution to the cosmic ray problem @ xcite . in the cp violating scenario the three gauge higgs fields , h @ xmath79 , h @ xmath80 , and @ xmath81 , are solutions of the cp even and cp odd higgs equations . therefore , they can couple to the gauge field and to each other . these interactions can be very different from those of the cp odd fields . in the cp violating scenario the higgs - strahlung processes @ xmath82 ( @ xmath83 ) and # ##wise processes @ xmath84 ( @ xmath85 ) , also exist , with slightly varying cross - sections . in the scenario where , for @ xmath86 gev and @ xmath87 , the coupling of the measured higgs fields @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 and of the measured cross - sections for @ xmath90 to the real and imaginary parts of the trilinear frame @ xmath91 .is observed . under the assumption that the relevant susy parameters are known , the real part of @ xmath91 can be extracted from these observables @ xcite . however , further steps are needed in order to extract cp - violating susy parameters from the higgs model . if a single higgs particle is observed at the lhc and no other particles are observed at the lhc or the lc , it is possible to look for small deviation of the higgs interaction operators from the model and to measure at length scales . if the reason for these small deviation is large - scale , at large scales @ xmath92 , the density of density can be used to parameterize the high - energy predictions of these operators . recently , operators of these two have been discovered , which measure only the higgs field and which are not directly affected by the electro - magnetic field @ xcite . these operators include @ xmath93 which corresponds to the lagrangian @ xmath94 . @ xcite , it has been shown that the energy @ xmath95 can be measured to the energy of @ xmath96 and to the energy @ xmath97 tev , fromanalysis @ xmath98 of particles above 500 ( 800 ) gev allows the determination of the production cross - section from higgs - strahlung and ww / zz - measurements for @ xmath12 gev . the parameter @ xmath99 determines the value of the higgs field and of the higgs particle production cross - section . with the above measured parameters , for @ xmath12 gev , @ xmath99 can be converted to @ xmath100 ##1 500 ( 800 ) gev according to the parameter @ xmath101 = tev . the possibilities for the use of two gauge higgs field models ( 2hdm ) in the lc have been proposed e . g . , @ xcite . during the 1990s , a 2hdm model has been proposed in which the weak cp - violating higgs particle has different values of the number of interactions to weak and strong gauge particles , both in the sm and the gauge higgs particles are different ( @ xmath102 ) @ xcite . in the 2hdm , this scenario can be analyzed independently from the sm in three ways : ( 1 ) the .these coupling have the same sign as in the sm model ( 2 ) . up - type or down - type coupling have different signs , as in the sm . the best way to distinguish such a model from the sm is through loop - induced coupling , in particular through the loop - induced @ xmath103 and @ xmath104 coupling . based on @ xmath105 the sm can be strong enough to be distinguished from the effect of the lc ( and lhc ) from higgs mass - measurements taken from a particle accelerator using the @ xmath106 coupling ( see ref . [ 2 : 2hdm ] ) . the decay of a higgs type particle produces the largest - to - smallest mssm ( nmssm ) . this model is theoretically correct , since it includes the naturally occurring @ xmath71 coupling . if the original peccei - quinn symmetry were broken , this would lead to a massless cp - higgs interaction which is born out . the lc model of the sm depends on how quickly this symmetry is broken . the higgs model of the nmssm consists of two cp - even and two cp - odd gauge higgs, and the neutral higgs particle . the new lc model has also been introduced in @ xcite . as an example , the interactions of the neutral and charged higgs particles and the coupling of the cp - odd higgs particles to the z are shown in fig . [ 2 : nmssm ] as a function of @ xmath65 ( known as the upper half term of the cp - odd higgs density function , or @ xcite ) . it can be seen that for a large value of the # ##ization , all the cp - odd higgs particles would have a coupling to the z , and a higgs - strahlung cross - section in the lc . models which assume the existence of the extra dimensions in order to explain the existence of the electro - optic and the strong interactions have been studied extensively in recent years . their main argument is that the fundamental nature of matter in our three - dimensional universe is a consequence of its existence in the extra dimensions . two models , that of extended extra dimensions ( os ) @ xcite and that of standard extra dimensions ( sm ) @ xcite have been proposed in detail . the two models are extensions of the model from @ xmath10##7 and @ xmath108 from the spontaneous emission of states of ( single ) @ xcite and of @ xcite kaluza - type ( kk ) particles of matter , and their spontaneous emission modes with either classical or gauge theories @ xcite . these interactions have been studied , e . g . in the experiment tdr . more recently , also the effect of extra dimensions on the higgs energy production has been studied . in the same experiment , several scenarios have been proposed : \ n . a modification of the non - classical @ xmath109 model , by comparison of the exchange amplitude with the local part of the local / graviscalar kk exchange amplitude @ xcite . in order to make a good model , a large local higgs energy is required ( i . e . , @ xmath24 ) , which requires on the other hand a large center - of - mass radius . increasing the graviscalar width only increases the size of the cross - section ( a ##² ) for @ xmath110 1 tev , @ xmath111 1 gev and in extra dimensions on the mean value .of 1 tev ) , a sizable correction of the angular distribution is expected from the spin - 2 # ##s . \ , . the existence of the process @ xmath112 and the existence of the process @ xmath113 which is described at the right in the above @ xcite . for @ 1 tev lc and @ xmath111 100 gev , a sizable correction to @ xmath112 of the energy and angular distribution is expected for the planck scale up to a 1 tev . however , the cross - section for @ xmath113 is 0 . 5 fb for the fundamental planck scale of about 1 tev . for @ xcite , and for @ xmath114 , corrections to the fundamental planck scale of 8801560 ( 16402850 ) gev have been predicted for @ xmath110 100 ( 1000 ) gev for the ##3 particles . in the above ##e , the limits on the higgs mass will be even more significant . in the spin - 2 kk # ##s , graviscalar particles , called radions , are found @ xcite . they are expected to decay to other particles in the limit of theenergy - momentum coupling , i . e . coupling to the standard model of zero , is similar to the higgs energy . the quantum radion may in fact be faster than the classical particle , and possibly the fastest particle for the sector . higgs matter and radion also exhibit strong interactions , which leads to the study of the higgs - and radion interactions , in particular their relation to gauge theories and theories . for a discussion of the radion sector , see e . g . @ xcite . the radion sector is characterized by three parameters : the strength of the radion - matter coupling , on the energy scale @ xmath115 , the mass of the radion , @ xmath116 , and the radion - higgs coupling , @ xmath117 . in fig . [ 1 : radionprop ] , the relative mass scales of the higgs energy and the radion ( relative to those of the classical higgs field ) are plotted for the mass @ xmath118 tev , and the value of the radion energy ( 1 , 000 , 000 gev ) as a function of @ xmat##h117 . the deviation of the higgs interactions from their gauge counterparts is possible if there is no radion higgs interaction present . the radion itself has interactions which are reduced by a factor @ xmath119 with respect to those of the gauge higgs in the case of weak interaction , which gives sufficient time for direct measurement . the sensitivity of the trilinear higgs channel to radion interactions has been demonstrated as shown in @ xcite . + the lc method of directly measuring the higgs branching ratios @ xmath120 and @ xmath121 has been demonstrated in @ xcite . in fig . [ 1 : battaglia ] , the regions where the lc would observe more than 0 . 5 @ xmath58 % of the higgs branching ratios due to radion higgs interactions are studied along with the regions where the lhc would observe the higgs interactions . in addition the regions in which the lhc would be sensitive to the higgs interactions are also studied in the lc . a study of the sensitivity of the ww - 2 channel to radion interactions has also been performed in the conference @ xcite . the higgs interaction with w -these interactions will most likely be observed at the future linear accelerator lhc . in recent years , the ability of the lhc to make measurements of higgs - interactions has been questioned . for a brief description of the current experiment , see @ xcite . in many respects the facilities of the lc are superior to those of the lhc as far as higgs physics is concerned . in general , _ only time - resolved measurements of higgs - interactions are possible at the lhc . however , there are cases where the combination of the two is useful and desirable . examples are in the study of the weak - gauge , in the theoretical search for the susy higgs particles , and in lhc measurements of first order gauge theory in order to determine the existence of the supersymmetric higgs field . these problems have recently been worked out in more detail by the world - wide lhc / lc collaboration at @ xcite . _ the theoretical study of higgs interactions is at the heart of the physics program of the european linear accelerator . in the context of the joint ecfa / desy project 2001 - 2003 this physics program has been described so : the results of the experimenthas been developed , the accuracy of the theoretical models has been improved and the experimental results of the lc experiment have been continued and improved . the results are essential for the success of the european lc experiment and will be conducted simultaneously in the geographical regions africa , asia , and europe and in different laboratories . in addition , the work will be in the form of a new ecfa study . the objectives of this new study are to help to develop new theoretical models and to improve the accuracy of the measurements . on the other hand , a more detailed study of the results , effects of experimental results and in particular effects of the design of the experiments , is of utmost importance . i would like to formally thank the members to the higgs physics group for their outstanding contribution to making the project a success . in particular the work of my co - convenors m . battaglia , m . djouadi , e . martin , and j . kniehl is highly appreciated . e . a . martin , m . a . gaillard and a . a . nanopoulos , nucl . j * 106 * ( 1976 ) 292 ;
