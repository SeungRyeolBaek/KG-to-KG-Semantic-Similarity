about a decade ago , amateur radio observations revealed large numbers of opaque molecular clouds ( irdcs , @ xcite ; @ xcite ) . these are visible as dark matter against the # ##d near - infrared background . subsequent observations of these dark irdcs revealed that these have very high volumes , energy levels , and temperatures ( @ xmath2 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ { ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 3 } $ ] , @ xmath3 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ { { } ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 3 } $ ] , @ xmath4 ; @ xcite ) . since they are dark , they are thought to be at an early evolutionary stage . included in irdcs are ` ` clusters ' ' of a few individual star systems @ xcite . it has also been suggested that these irdcs are the long - lived remnants of clouds formed at the beginning of the evolution of massive stars and ( super - ) galaxies . this hypothesis was supported by observations of very young stars in a few other irdcs ( @ xcite ; @ xcite ; @ xcite ) . these observations have provided the basis of models for irdc ##s (e . g . , @ xcite , @ xcite ) and m1 ( e . g . , @ xcite , @ xcite ) . irdc ##s are often assigned to regions of rapid star formation ( msf ) , such as m1 and m17 ( e . g . , @ xcite ) . [ sec : 1 ] this classification may not be accurate , however . the above papers ( and @ xcite ) show that clusters of low and medium mass stars will soon appear as targets in regions of near - infrared radiation @ xcite . these irdcs will eventually become massive stars . however , the number of irdcs evolving towards msf is still not known . no close to 1 % have been reported in the literature ( see [ ref : mass - of - irdc ] ) . in this paper , we will use a new approach to provide the first ever experimental evidence that a few irdcs are evolving towards msf . this includes identifying pre - msf irdcs as targets for alma and mira . as a result , the msf problem is where the first order analysis of this paper takes us . in papers i and ii @ xcite , we show that stellar activity is typical of msf ( sec :hercules , orion , orion , and ( ##tte ) . ( @ xmath5 irdcs corresponding to fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) would violate , e . g . , hercules and orion , but not hercules ( which violate fig . [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . figure [ sec : msf - limit ] shows how the definition for msf can be fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . since cloud formation requires an even mass distribution , msf implies that a large mass is present in a relatively small region . based on more detailed theoretical data , figure [ sec : msf - limit ] shows the constraints on this well defined limit . as shown in fig . [ fig : msf - limits ] , the clouds in this msf region are all within the actual mass range defined by fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . observations of msf regions consider fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) as the true msf region ( see [ fig : msf - limits ] ) . thisand to include fig . ( [ sec : mass - size - limit ] ) to help distinguish irdcs with ( known ) msf from those without . this section is summarized as follows . based on data from section [ sec : threshold ] , section [ sec : msf - threshold ] suggests ( for most msf clouds ) that fig . ( [ sec : mass - size - limit ] ) is the msf cloud . most well - studied irdcs ( 100 % / % ) fall short of this threshold ( section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) . more recent evidence for the irdc ##s suggests that most irdcs pass fig . ( [ sec : mass - size - limit ] ) , and will therefore not form massive stars ( section [ sec : studied - irdcs ] ) . however , some of the stars captured in irdcs will be in fact very massive stars ( i . e . , those in fig . [ sec : mass - size - limit ] ) . ; _ ( and x ^ _ ) in addition to mass - energy = ( e . g . , @ xmath6 = x _ _ \ cdot { } x ^ _$ ] ) and for non - msf clouds ( fig . [ fig : mass - size - comparison ] , fig . [ fig : mass - size - comparison ] ; _ _ _ _ ) . at high energies , msf clouds ( _ _ _ _ _ ) may contain fragments corresponding to the same msf - limit . based on the parameters of transit , @ xmath7 , and transit , @ xmath8 , these fragments may , at least @ xmath9 , be massive than those of non - msf clouds . [ fig : msf - limit ] ] observations for the largest clouds not containing bright stars ( examples : orion , vega , hercules , and ##a ) are taken from annex a ( and published here ) . we rely on # ##s to identify msf clouds : @ xcite map the well - characterized msf clouds with well - defined molecular structure but no gas content ; @ xcite map fir clusters found in dense regions of high - energy ( @ xmath10 ) ; @ xcite map gas ##eous and super - dense hii clusters ; @ xcite map the@ x - based msf data ( we use their ` atlas ' ) . to obtain data obtained from new sources , we will use the ` mm ##1 ' cores ( @ xmath11 and / or @ xmath12 extinction , with known emission regions ) from the @ xcite study , and only the two ` mm - 2 ' cores ( without mm and hii elements ) from the @ xcite study . the irdc ##s are obtained from msx and spitzer images . @ xcite ( @ xcite ; using extinction ) and @ xcite ( @ xcite ; using @ xmath13 extinction ) survey the sample with the @ xmath13 telescope . @ xcite and @ xmath14 - based images for the irdcs appear in their @ xmath14 galactic halo images . @ xcite # ##s data for @ xmath15 spitzer @ xmath13 irdcs with known spectra . the mass - density estimates for the dust grains are derived from paper ii ( the data presented in both fig . 2 and fig . 3 of paper ii ) . they are based on # ##ar data obtained from the grains ( ar and bolocam ) and the( 2mass ) . . in the dendogram method given by @ xcite , starting from a set of known column density distributions , a random column density distribution is associated with the column density . each column is the size of a single fragment . we compute the semi - surface area and the column diameter , @ xmath16 . the columns / fragments are then compared . this yields relationships between the columns , thus a series of mass - size relationships . in fig . [ 2 : mass - size - relationships ] , these relationships are solved in linear time . to obtain column density from the observed data , we assume that column density and scattering intensity are given by @ xmath17 @ xcite . to obtain the scattering and absorption measurements , they must be scaled with respect to one another . in particular , we use @ xcite for absorption ( scaled by a factor of . 5 , to the observed density law ; figure 1 . 2 of paper ii ) for non - absorbed measurements . for this , we must fit the measurements to the observed density law from paper i . therefore , it is necessary to combine the two values of density and radius . the resulting equation is :see ref . [ 2 : column - length - scale ] . where possible , we use the values predicted by the standard model . first , we consider our choice of mass , and the corresponding 1 . 5 scaling factor . @ xmath14 masses are easily derived from @ xcite , since their @ xmath14 - to - mass - ratio is in perfect agreement with ( i . e . , yields values of 1 . 5 . 5 greater than ) the light - coefficient values predicted by @ xcite . we assume that light intensity at @ xmath18 wavelength and light intensity at @ xmath19 wavelength are given by @ xmath20 ( 1 . 5 of @ xcite ) , and calculate column lengths from these values ( for example at @ xmath21 , and using the 1 . 5 scaling factor ) . we then calculate the @ xcite values ( from their [ ` % ' ) by a factor of . 5 ( to account for their distribution of atomic and molecular mass ) ^ 2 / ( \ farcs2 ^ 2 ) $ ] , where @ xmath22 = 1 , since pixels per pixel ( sometimes also used ) are to be divided into pixels per beamsee fig . ( 5 ) of @ xcite . ] . in some cases ( @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite ) , the mass measured in the original column corresponds to the mass at half peak intensity , and the column also reflects light at much lower intensity . in these cases , we assume that the masses have a non - uniform distribution ( just as we assumed in some of the original columns ) . for these cases , the mass measured in the half - column or column is only a fraction @ xmath23 of the total mass ( e . g . half of @ xcite ; the mass at half peak intensity [ @ xmath24 ^ $ $ ] ) . so we reduce the mass to a fraction @ xmath25 , and use half of the total fwhm value as the effective aperture . @ xcite measures mass for a distance , without an aperture , and then the distance ( except for the sum of their values ) has to be broken down by a factor of 1 @ xmath26 ( @ xcite , fig . 5 ) . if more than one distance is used for a given distance , we use the same distance ( see a fig .to @ xmath6 / m _ { \ rm { } lim } [ r ] $ ] ( ( ) . lc ) provides a mass - size limit for msf ( section [ sec : msf - threshold ] ) . only a fraction of the irdcs exceed this msf limit ( fig . [ fig : size ] , section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) . if a star - forming region contains more than one fragment ( i . e . , cluster , core , etc . ) , the most common fragment ( i . e . , with to @ xmath6 / m _ { \ rm { } lim } [ r ] $ ] ) is represented as a vector .

[ fig : mass - size - comparison ] , title = " fig : " ] & + for example , a compact fragment ( i . e . , core , cluster , etc . ) can be plotted against mass . ( [ fig : mass - size - comparison ] ) by calculating the density of @ xmath27 ( where @ x##math28 = 870 \ , [ _ { \ rm } \ , [ / / { \ rm { } } } ] ^ { 1 . 0 } $ ] ) , to which we refer to the ` core ' . ` ` cluster population ' ' ( as used in @ xcite and @ xcite ) are found in the cluster - forming clusters ( i . e . , a single individual cluster , not the entire irdc ) at their values [ ##ness , @ xmath29 $ ] . $ ] , for mass size limits . for a large cluster , the regions in which a certain percentage ( e . g . , 50 % ) of the cluster population resides are denoted by $ . the non - msf samples ( fig . [ fig : mass - size - limit ] [ comparison ] ) have no value @ xmath30 ( fig . [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . the values for the @ xcite samples are ( _ left _ ) , _ and ( _ right _ ) , their ` bar ' values . therefore , the irdcs do not reside in the mass - size limit region associated with msf . [ fig : comparison ] ] . [ fig : comparison##ness ] [ @ xmath29 $ ] works well for the data shown above . this is based on the mass - size limit shown in fig . [ fig : mass - size - comparison ] . the data has a spread of distributions for each region . this distribution is determined by comparing the samples . as shown in fig . [ fig : mass - size - comparison ] , we can also see in fig . [ fig : density ] that some of the clouds are , to some extent , more compact than the largest region , @ xmath31 . in most cases of msf data , @ xmath32 of the clouds has a greater density @ xmath33 . the study @ xcite found a very large region of clouds ( @ xmath34 ) more compact than predicted by fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . these regions may be good candidates for follow - up studies . in general , however , this analysis ignores the fact that fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) is the case for msf . the [ fig : density ] shows a similar situation for irdcs . we will examine the @ x##cite both above and compare their ` dark ' data with the @ xmath13 data ( which is not known ) . ` ` true ' ' irdcs generally have masses in between these extremes . two major trends appear in these @ xmath27 data . first , irdcs have masses which are , for given size , equal to those of their parent stars , forming massive stars ( e . g . , saturn and pluto ) . in both cases , @ xmath35 of the clouds has the mass @ xmath36 . but for the @ xcite clouds , @ xmath37 of all clouds exceeds it . ( [ see : cloud - upper - limit ] ) by a factor @ xmath38 . second , irdcs are less compact than regions with massive stars . for example , of the @ xcite clouds , @ xmath32 of the irdcs is less compact than that ( @ xmath32 ) of the msf regions . in contrast , the irdcs listed above have ( for given size ) masses in between those of regions with and without msf ( where ` ` true ' ' @ xcite irdcs have masses in between the two )2 ) . most likely , they do not exist in the infinite - mass regions commonly associated with the formation of massive stars . however , before reaching our conclusions , let us consider two assumptions about our data . first , @ xcite derives masses using clumpfind , whereas @ xcite uses gaussclumps . for the former , paper i states explicitly that the calculated masses are , for most maps , only @ xmath39 of those derived from our dendrogram ##s . for the latter , the opposite is true , since the resulting maps only contain a fraction of the mass . in the general case , our # ##s from papers i and ii would only suggest higher masses . these assumptions are challenged by other models , however . we use the ` case a ' model ( very distant star formation ) provided by @ xcite . unlike @ xcite , their ` case b ' ( massive stars ) appears to be more distant . the mass could also be reduced by the factor @ xmath40 @ xcite . however , @ xcite gives @ xmath14 - to - 1 conversion , higher than provided by @ xcite . in either case , these assumptions affect the results for msf .. differences between these and irdcs are most likely to only arise from experimental data . however , all of the irdcs in the @ xcite , @ xcite , and @ xcite samples are ` ` ' ' ' for the entire galactic plane . @ xcite and @ xcite are samples which are relatively bright in @ xmath19 emission . @ xcite samples are irdcs which are relatively small and dark , and are not visible in @ xmath14 emission . . this produces irdcs of similar size and distance from the source . the resulting irdc ##s should also be more accurate than previous samples . the @ xcite sample contains irdc sample sizes and gas compositions for the entire galactic plane studied by spitzer . it also provides an easy way to obtain a rough approximation of the irdc ##s . since they all represent ( to our present time ) the general distribution of galactic star - forming gas , irdc ##s may predict the future evolution of the star forming gas .

[ fig : msf - limit ] gives these values for the mass of @ xmath58 , based on the @ xcite . the free - fall timescales of their parent stars @ xmath59 @ xcite , , @ xmath60 . 1 , @ xmath61 ( @ xcite , fig . 2 ) and @ xmath62 @ xcite . since new stars often form spontaneously , and the star formation rate is not known yet , we have @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 in between . [ fig : msf - limit ] ] and timescales from spitzer models of stellar molecular dynamics .in the model , cloud formation will only affect a single star if kept within the limits defined for them . ( [ fig : msf - ff ] [ fig : msf - f ] ) . @ xcite is a similar model , but assume that the entire sky is dominated by a cluster of low - mass stars ( in our case , they are @ xmath65 ) . in order to achieve msf , at least a few individual components of msf clouds must remain within the same msf limit as above ( fig . [ fig : msf - efficiency ] ) . the size distribution of these clouds can also be described by power laws , @ xmath66 , with @ xmath67 ( figure 1 ) . these power laws predict that msf clouds are @ xmath68 ( fig . [ fig : mass - energy - limit ] ) . depending on distance ( @ xmath7 ) , mass ( @ xmath8 ) , and their size , different effects are predicted for each @ xmath69 ( fig . [ fig : msf - limit ] ) . this is exactly what we expect for msf clouds ( fig . [ fig : mass -( - size ] [ b ] ) . msf is usually only observed if a few slopes are small , some are large , or small , when compared to others . ( [ b : ( - size - comparison ] ) . this is a good way to directly study the structure of clouds with and without msf . the differences in @ xmath8 imply that msf and non - msf clouds may differ in their dust content . differences in @ @ xmath7 , however , imply _ _ _ changes in the structure , such as differences from the overall cloud structure . the irdc ##s described in the paper ( @ xmath2 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ { ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 3 } $ ] , @ xmath3 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ { 5 } ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 3 } $ ] , @ xmath4 ) , appear to be the major components of both small and large irdcs . they are also well suited to large irdcs on average . large irdcs with @ xmath68 may eventually develop and eventually develop msf . and other cloud types could , in theory ,and , @ xmath68 where the same is true . however , these assumptions are not usually used when using irdc properties to predict msf . here we depart from these assumptions . our research suggests that many irdcs , if not all , are directly related to msf . one also needs to be careful when using irdc ##s to predict msf observation conditions . most observations of irdcs at pre - msf wavelengths focus on very large irdcs of large apparent size . these objects must satisfy fig . ( [ source : mass - energy - density ] ) , and many of them are likely msf sources . @ xcite suggest that most of the observed star formation can come from irdcs . the lack of any known source of star - forming material supports this hypothesis . in fact , most irdcs are unable to form stars and are of low and intermediate mass , just as hercules and neptune are . therefore , most irdcs will evolve towards msf . however , @ [ source : peretto - smith ] suggest that most of the material found in irdcs is in material that can form new stars . for example , the 250 -the clouds from the @ xcite sample ( observed at a certain time ) contain more than 90 % of the star - specific gas content of all irdcs . this suggests that they may contain a significant portion of the gas found in irdcs . if this conclusion is correct , then the @ xmath1 irdcs ( and possibly all @ xmath70 : @ xcite ) may contain some of the non - star - forming gas . given the unusual nature of the data obtained from the @ xcite sample ( section [ fig : non - irdcs ] ) , this conclusion is far from certain , however . this question asks whether some compact clouds ( irdcs ) are able to contain massive stars . our preliminary results are as follows . * observations of clouds with and without galaxy - formation ( msf ) show that the sample @ xmath71 ( fig . [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) has a requirement for msf ( section [ fig : msf - limit ] ) . msf clouds differ from those in fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) for mass - size , or mass ( fig . [ fig : msf - limit ] , or[ sec : msf - limit ] ) . * most irdcs ( section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) , if not all ( section [ sec : large - irdcs ] ) , do not have mass . ( [ sec : mass - extinction - limit ] ) . without any further study , most stars are poor candidates for msf , but they may still contain clusters and planets of low to moderate mass ( like pluto and neptune ) . a few irdcs of large enough mass are good msf candidates . * if mass - extinction models could be used , a * @ xmath1 irdcs would contain a small fraction of the stars ' star - forming population ( section [ sec : well - studied - irdc ] ) . these irdcs would be large and massive enough to support msf . abergel , m . , martin , j . m . , boulanger , m . , cesarsky , m . , martin , j . m . , falgarone , m . , lagache , m . , perault , m . , puget , j . - j . , martin , j . j . , nordh , m . ,olofsson , m . , huldtgren , m . , kaas , j . a . , andre , m . , martin , m . , burgdorf , m . , copet , m . , martin , m . , montmerle , m . , persi , m . , & sibille , m . 1996 , mathematics and physics davis , m . j . , dunham , j . a . , van rgensen , j . a . , enoch , m . a . , mern , m . , van dishoeck , j . j . , alcal , j . m . , myers , m . j . , stapelfeldt , j . a . , huard , j . a . , smith , j . m . , smith , j . m . , van kempen , j . , smith , j . a . , koerner , j . w . , mundy , j . a . , padgett , j . a . , & smith , j . a . 2009 , , 181 , 321 perault , m . , omont , m . , martin , m . , seguin , m . , ojha, m . , blommaert , j . , felli , m . , gilmore , m . , guglielmo , m . , habing , m . , miller , s . , miller , m . , de batz , m . , cesarsky , m . , elbaz , m . , epchtein , m . , fouque , m . , miller , s . , levine , m . , cohen , m . , prusti , m . , siebenmorgen , r . , testi , m . , & tiphene , m . 1996 , mathematics and physics
