in the last years many new experimental results have been presented by different groups @ xcite , and a phenomenological extension of the standard model has been proposed that uses multiple different length scales , over which the different types of interactions are averaged . despite many good predictions , this can be seen as an extension of the standard model that does not address certain issues , e . g . , particle size and the scattering angles due to the ##s , and has raised a serious concern about the important physical properties of nuclei that could lead to a less complete understanding of the physics @ xcite . to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenology the use of measurements in the # # ##s was suggested . because of the increase in experimental data , in recent years new proton - proton interaction cross sections have been presented @ xcite and are expected in the near future @ xcite . these cross sections are needed to make a complete kinematical picture of particle - nucleus interactions and a complete picture of particle - nucleus interactions is needed for the interpretation of the results . the argoneut collaboration has recently presented @ xcite a model of theand the charged - current ( mc ) flux - averaged capture cross section on @ xmath0ar in the energy range up to 1 gev . the big gold detector is very useful because it has the ability to make accurate measurements of a very wide range of particle energies from the mev energy up to multi - gev energy @ xcite . the argoneut experiment has proven the feasibility of this new detector and , hoperfully , more data will be collected in the future . for example , the measurement of electron capture cross sections for the particles that could be detected by this new set of detectors was done in @ xcite . the energy range measured by the argoneut experiment , with a mean value of @ xmath1 gev , requires the use of a mathematical model , where not only particle interactions are considered , but also the charge and density interactions are considered in a mathematical framework . the first measurement of the charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) flux - averaged non - zero electron capture cross section on @ xmath2c using the miniboone detector @ xcitethis raises several questions . in general , the nuclear cross section is best modeled by the inverse fermi ##onic model and not the more accurate model based on the impulse approximation @ xcite , unless the effective electron mass @ xmath3 is much larger with respect to the world standard value of 0 . 03 gev / @ xmath4 . it is reasonable to assume that the effective electron mass resulting from the miniboone effect at @ xmath2c can be used as an appropriate parameter to describe experimental effects that are not taken into account by the model ; this is the reason that a better knowledge of electron - nucleus cross section , where assumptions about nuclear physics are reduced as much as possible , is needed . therefore , a model aimed to model electron - nucles ##ons should first be tested against electron scattering data in the nuclear kinematic model . at high energies , quasielastic ( qe ) electron scattering models @ xcite , which are able to accurately reproduce a wide range of nuclear effects , can be a useful way to model electron - nucleus effects . there are , however , concerns that the model may have significant limitations from sources using the impulse approximation ( e ) in higher energy regions wherethe nuclear interaction has some theoretical implications . for example , in the case of @ xcite the contribution of multinucleon emission to ccqe ##2 has been studied , and found to bring the model in line with the observed miniboone cross section without changing the predictions of @ xmath3 . the importance of reactions in two - electron interactions compared to the other models has been confirmed by @ xcite . a detailed study of the nuclear interactions and of the mechanism of multinucleon emission and of the non - nucleonic interactions @ xcite would be , without a doubt , necessary for a better understanding of the interaction mechanism . the existence of final nuclear states ( fsi ) has been successfully demonstrated for the proposed @ xmath5 model , where the existence of a final wave function ( op ) and the half - wave interference approximation ( dwia ) are proved @ xcite . the first part of the op is an approximation that preserves the cross section and allows for the transfer of some of the incident flux from the elastically open channels to the closed channels which are observed . after the optical transfer , the incident flux is removed , the final nuclear state is not observed and the open and closed channels are. therefore , a general ##ization of fsi is required , where the bound - state energies are conserved and the energy level , although different among the two states , is constant . several approaches have been proposed to include fsi in the equations for the - qe ##q - and nucleus - bound states @ xcite . in the simple plane - wave energy approximation ( rpwia ) , fsi is well defined . in other approaches fsi is included in dwia , where the bound quantum state is described with two variables , either using only the real part of the strong energy - independent complex field potential ( rrop ) , or using the same strong complex field potential used in describing the bound quantum state ( rmf ) . although considering the energy , the rrop is different from the theoretical point of view . on the contrary , the rmf , where the same strong energy - independent complex potential is considered for the bound and excited states , has the same equation @ xcite and follows the same relation . in a simple combination of fsi and the equation ##np ( rgf ) , @ xcite .2 . in the rgf formulation , under certain conditions , which are not equivalent to the ia , the components of the nuclear force are expressed in terms of the single particle optical potential and spectral function ; the above decomposition , that is based on the biorthogonal model in terms of the non - hermitian optical model @ xmath6 and of the hermitian model @ xmath7 , can be used to perform the simultaneous calculation of the single particle ' s function and of the components of the diffusion process @ xcite . these involve complex representations of the same form as the dwia representation of the diffusion process @ @ xcite , but with eigenfunctions of both @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 , where the second part has an even value and is in one case a loss and in the other case a loss of energy . the rgf formulation allows us to calculate the # ##es into nonelastic states in the case of the nuclear force and from the complex optical potential which describes the nucleus - nucleus interaction , and to include terms which are not present in the rmf and in other models based on the ia . however , with the use of the classical complex optical potential , thehas a different description of fsi in the exclusive and in the exclusive case . in particular , because of the different shape of the interaction matrix , it has the same equation of @ xcite . these different models of fsi have been used in @ xcite for the @ qe electron scattering , in @ xcite for the ccqe electron scattering , and in @ xcite with the ccqe and nce miniboone data . while rmf and rgf are used to describe the results of the ccqe scattering data , only the rgf gives cross sections of the same size as the exclusive , without the need to increase the resolution of @ xmath3 @ xcite . similar results are found in @ xcite , where the rgf ##s and their comparison and comparison with the nce data from miniboone are discussed . in this article the results of the theoretical models of fsi for the @ xmath8 - electron scattering are discussed and compared for the same cross sections and with the @ xmath9 argoneut data . we are aware of the many challenges that can be posed to the results of models used for the qe data in the kinematic theory, with the @ xmath9 argoneut , up to @ xmath10 gev , where other reactions in the system , which are not included in the models presented above , can give similar results . therefore we believe that our models will provide useful information about the role of these reactions in the analysis of @ xmath11ar , and about the parameters which are relevant to their analysis . for the reaction @ xmath0ar @ xmath12 as a function of the total scattering momentum @ xmath13 . the data are from argoneut @ xcite .

[ csteta ] the total experimental cross section @ xmath22 obtained from the argoneut model is calculated as a function of the decay energy of @ xmath13 . all the calculations yield results in close agreement with the experimental results but they underpredict the value of the experimental cross section . we note that in the rpwia fsi is slightly different , but in the rmf the same , energy - independent , model is used for absorption and emission .. the comparison of the rgf data obtained with the edad1 , dem , and undem models can give an indication of how the results of the dem are affected by differences in the predictions of the phenomenological op . the differences depend on the energy and time , and are mainly due to the same imaginary part of the two models , which exists for the different types of elastic flow and is therefore univocally different from the elastic flow . in contrast , the real part is known for different parameterizations and produces different results . we note that the dem and undem models result in very similar results ; in fact , even if they are calculated using very different calculation methods @ xcite , they are based on the same dataset of elastic - flow models . to constrast , the edad1 model gives slightly different results and different values in comparison with the results of the dem and undem models : for example , in the same comparison with @ xmath23 deg , the rgf - dem and rgf - edad1 cross sections differ slightly from @ xmath24 . the rgf cross sections are much smaller than the rpwia and the rmf ##ia , but they arein general , less than the latter , except for @ xmath25 deg and @ xmath26 deg . in the rgf the imaginary part of the electron potential represents the flux to all the higher - order channels and , for each channel , the flux lost towards the channels is replaced by the flux gained from the other channels . the lower cross sections in the rgf result from the modification to the classical form of the optical model of some processes which are not included in the standard model such as , for example , rescattering effects of the electron on its way out of the cell , non - nucleonic @ xmath27 , which can occur during nuclear migration , and in other multinucleon processes . these effects are not explained directly by the rgf , but they can be explained , to some extent , by the imaginary part of the phenomenological op . we note that in all the models used in this article we have used the same value of the electron potential @ xmath28 gev . a higher value of @ xmath3 would increase the cross section and improve the comparison with us . see ref . [ cspmu ] the following wave equationthe @ xmath29 resolution of the argoneut data is calculated as a function of the cross section @ xmath30 . and in this respect the rpwia and the rmf data are better than the ia data , because the rgf gives the cross sections which are in good agreement with the ia . finally , the first two terms of the total cross section of @ xmath30 are multiplied , increasing the resolution by a factor of @ xmath31 . all the models which have been developed for the ia data are based on the ia , where the cross section is given by an infinite number of interactions between the electron nucleus and all the other electrons of the nucleus . and the rgf , which is a more sophisticated model and , with the help of the new op , is able to include types of interactions which are not found in the ia models , is also based on the ia . models based on ia have been used for the description of qe interactions and single electron interactions @ xcite . furthermore , the rgf is able to give a detailed description of ccqe and nce miniboone cross sections @ xcite . in the model of multi - electron interactionfor energies greater than a few gevs , however , even these calculations often include large quantities of decay products which cannot be included in the calculated cross section . it is therefore not surprising that the calculated cross sections in fig . [ csteta ] and [ cspmu ] are much better than the experimental results . [ in rgf - dem . [ csrgf - area - dem ] , title = " fig : " ] + [ in rgf - dem . [ csrgf - area - dem ] , title = " fig : " ] - 0 . 5 . with the aim to obtain a more accurate result we have attempted to reduce the uncertainty of our results . the most common source of uncertainty is the electron flux : it is well known with high confidence that exact values are not known @ xcite . for energies up to @ xmath32 gev the argoneut flux is calculated in terms of values of @ xmath33 and @ xmath31 gev and , for each bin , we have an averagecross section calculated from one or more samples at different energies . it is easy to see that this approach introduces some uncertainty into our results . in fig . [ csrpwia- area ] and [ csrmf - area ] we present our values for the @ xmath22 and @ xmath29 angular cross sections of rpwia and the rmf . the errors in the figure are these numerical errors are in phase . in the cases of @ xmath13 and @ xmath30 measured by the argoneut , the numerical errors are generally large and neither the rpwia nor the rmf cross section can match the measured results in the two bands . this is a good approximation since the rpwia and rmf cross sections in each band are identical and the errors about the optical flux are generally small . in the case of the rgf we have two different types of errors . the rgf ##s . here are the values of the components of the metric shown in fig . ( 2 ) of @ xcite . the value of the second term , which is large relative to the continuum part of the op , is a difficult and time consuming numerical calculation which requires the integration of all the eigenfunctions of the continuum part of the optical flux . the errors in this basis are not under consideration and , from the angles in both directions ,has been tested for energies above @ xmath34 . the fact that for the rgf calculations we have to use a phenomenological ##ly = op presents further difficulties . the results of @ xcite have been tested for values up to @ xmath35 gev and to obtain results up to @ xmath36 gev we have to extend the range of values of these parameterizations . this has done by replacing each term of the op with a single term of the energy that has been used to accurately model the behavior of the op at @ xmath33 gev . we have found that our results do not depend solely on the energy used . the rgf - dem @ xmath22 and @ xmath29 experimental cross sections are shown in fig . [ csrgf - dem - dem ] , where the error bands represent all the energies that we have calculated up to now . the results with lower energies are shown in the cases of rgf - undem and rgf - edad1 . the error bands for the rgf calculations are smaller than for rpwia and rmf and , as a result , the lower parts of the rgf cross section are closer to the origin .this uncertainty can be attributed to the very large error in the cross section of the experimental measurement of the interaction , in particular for the energies of @ xmath37 gev and the energy transferred to the nucleus . the large error figures in ref . [ csrgf - da - dem ] do not allow us to draw any firm conclusions . indeed , the results presented in this paper show that the rgf , as well as the theoretical models based on the data , may underpredict argoneut predictions , but they are able to reproduce the predictions and the full order of magnitude of the experimental cross sections . in this paper we have discussed the predictions of the theoretical models of fsi for the electron - electron interactions in the argoneut model . in the rpwia fsi is included ; in the rmf they are described by the usual linear inverse square law ##s , describing the electron ground state ; in the rgf the same term op , with both real and imaginary parts , is used to account for fsi . two ground - state channels are described in the rgf , the energy transferred in one channel being replaced in the other channel by the imaginary part of theop makes use of the transfer function and the overall effect is calculated . the rgf provides a graphical representation of the @ xmath19 channel in the qe model and it is also used to represent the ccqe and nce miniboone data . in the rgf cross section the contribution of reaction channels that are included in the first parts , e . g . , rescattering effects of the proton on its passage out of the nucleus , non - nucleonic @ xmath27 channels , which may occur during the reaction , with or without the proton emission , or even multinucleon emission , is incorporated , to some extent , into the overall strength of the second part of the phenomenological op . however , the contribution of the other reaction channels included in the phenomenological op , can not be determined and the strength of the cross section can only be attributed to a single channel . in order to reach this conclusion , a careful determination of the overall strength and of the contribution of multinucleon emission and of the non - nucleonic channels , as well as a careful determination of the total op , which also follows the same relation ,would be the experimental data of the rgf . our results give a strong indication that type - ii effects are able to reproduce the same order of magnitude and the shape of the argoneut , but they often underpredict the experimental data values , in particular for the values of @ xmath30 and for values of @ xmath13 , @ xmath38 deg and @ xmath39 deg . a careful study of the medium effects is necessary to add some useful points to the non - strenght . in particular , a careful study of the effects on the sub - gev scale , that takes into account quasielastic , deep , as well as non - deep effects , is highly recommended . 89ifxundefined [ 0 ] ifx # # ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ` ` ` ` # ` ' ' ' ' @ noop [ 0 ] secondoftwosanitize @ link [ 0 ] + 12 $ 12 & # # 1212 _ 0 % ' @ startlink [ 0 ] @ endlink [ 0 ] @ ' @ innerbibemptylink : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 86 . 052010 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 107 . 241801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1140 / epjc / s10052 - 013 - 2345 - x [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 107 . 161801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 86 . 032007 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 86 . 052009 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 131801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 171803 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 108##8 / 1674 - 1137 / 1 / 1 / 011001 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 191802 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 072003 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 112007 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1155 / 2013 / 163897 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1155 / 2013 / 852987 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 83 . 083522 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 073006 [ * * , ( ) ] https : / / www . doi . org / 1475 - 7516 / 2011 / t = 09 / t = 034 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 07##3004 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop ( ) , link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 87 . 012005 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 161802 [ * * , ( ) ] miniboone , @ noop * @ xmath8a , @ noop t2k , @ noop @ noop ( ) , link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevc . 87 . 014607 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 87 . 132301 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / j . physletb . 2011 . 07 . 032 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevc . 84 . 055501 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevc . 84 . 015501 [ * * , ( )] @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / 0370 - 1573 ( 81 ) 90132 - 2 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop _ _ , , vol .
