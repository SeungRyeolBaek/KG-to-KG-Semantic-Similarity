among the vast majority of the papers devoted to the flight with unit speed in the euclidean space @ xmath8 ( see @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite for the symmetric cases and @ xcite , @ xcite for the non - symmetric cases ) , the symmetric random flight in the three - dimensional euclidean space @ xmath1 is , arguably , the most complex and difficult to solve . while in the important two - dimensional spaces @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 one tries to compute the sum of the motions in an exact sequence ( see @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite , below ) , in the important three - dimensional spaces only a few solutions are known . the characteristic zero function of the correlation function of the linear symmetric random flight with unit speed in the euclidean space @ xmath1 is defined as ( * ? ? ? * , ( 1 . 3 ) and ( 1 . 4 ) below ) . it is an extremely simple form of the integral with poles , whose integrand has become the correlation function . this integral has a simple form that can not even be solved by means of simple computer programs . however , the definition of the integral ofbut this approach fails in the extreme because it does not allow to consider the physical properties of the system under certain initial conditions ( see kac # ##n , for example ) . the presence of two parameters ( i . e . the speed and the intensity of collisions ) in the model of the free particle makes it , perhaps , the most simple and accurate model for describing the two - dimensional motion in the euclidean space . these parameters can also be considered time independent because they are correlated with each other at the boundary ( here , the speed is the distance through _ per unit of time _ and the intensity is the total number of collisions _ per unit of time _ ) . the limit of the density of in @ xcite is the infinite density at the boundary @ xmath11 . thus the local limit of the infinite density at the boundary of the global boundary is a very common phenomenon in the euclidean space of two dimensions ( in @ xcite for the local space @ xmath12 and ( * ? ? ? * the local part of formula ( 3 . 21 ) and ( 4 . 12 ) ) , @ xcite , ( * ? ? ? * and ( 4 . 12 ) ) for the space @ .##math1 ) , the point at the origin is very large and difficult to solve . the difficulty of solving the three - dimensional symmetric random flight and , on the other hand , the great theoretical and practical complexity of the problem of calculating the constant - speed speed in the model @ xmath1 led to search for new methods of solving this problem . that is , the following formula and a good approximation would be a very easy part of the method . some important results could be obtained by solving the characteristic function formula . in the case of the three - dimensional symmetric - random flight some important expressions for the characteristic function were obtained . in particular , the closed - form expression for the fourier transform of the characteristic function was obtained by the methods of ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 1 . 7 ) and ( 1 . 8 ) ) ( for constant speed ) and in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 3 ) ) , @ xcite ( for constant speed ) . the general formula for the general characteristic function of the three - dimensional symmetric - random flight multiplied by the number of components of phase , is obtained in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 1 . 9 ) ) . the .included in these representations is the problem of computing the inverse fourier transform of the integral of the conditional characteristic function in the complex upper half - plane . this is the basic problem of computing the fourier expansion of the conditional characteristic function corresponding to two and three changes of direction given in section 3 . based on these results , an explicit expression , at time @ xmath5 , for the conditional characteristic function is given in section 4 and the order of this formula is the time @ xmath6 . the inverse fourier transform of the conditional characteristic function gives an explicit expression for the transition density of the distribution which is given in section 5 . this expression shows that the distribution is discontinuous on the boundary , but it is not at the time @ xmath11 , as it should be . the last and important result is that the transition density corresponding to two changes of direction has a distribution with an infinite term on the boundary of the phase boundary . from this , it follows that the transition density is discontinuous itself on the boundary and this distinguishes the 3d - case from the 2d - case where , the transition density of the single change of direction has an infinite term on thetheorem . the term in the above linear formula has the form @ xmath6 . in step 2 we increase the resolution of the linear formula and show that it is a good approximation for short time scales whose values depend on the speed of light . finally , in addition we give a number of additional equations that have been used in our paper . consider the random motion of a particle that , at the same time as @ xmath13 , starts from the point @ xmath14 of the configuration space @ xmath1 and continues with a new velocity @ xmath15 ( note that @ xmath15 is defined as the initial value of the particle ) . the random vector is a random one - dimensional vector with uniform distribution on the unit circle @ xmath16 the motion is controlled by a random poisson process @ xmath17 of on @ xmath3 as above . after each poissonian event , the particle then takes on a new random direction uniformly distributed on @ xmath18 independently of its initial velocity and keeps moving with the same velocity @ xmath15 until the next poisson event occurs , when it takes on a new random ., and so on . let @ xmath19 be the particle in space at time @ xmath20 which is referred to as the three - dimensional hidden variable random variable . at most some instant @ xmath20 the particle , with probability 1 , is concentrated on the small three - dimensional sphere of space @ xmath21 centered on the point @ xmath22 : @ xmath23 is the probability distribution of @ xmath24 of the process @ xmath4 , where @ xmath25 is the fixed point in the sphere @ xmath1 . for a point @ xmath20 , the process @ xmath26 consists of two processes . the process ##ity corresponds to the situation when no poisson events occur on the time interval @ xmath27 and it is concentrated on the sphere @ xmath28 in this case , at some instant @ xmath29 , the particle is concentrated on the sphere @ xmath30 and the probability of this event is @ xmath31 if at least one poisson event occurs on the time interval @ xmath32 , then the particle is also concentrated on the sphere @ xmath33 and the probability of this event is@ xmath34 the density of the distribution @ xmath26 up to this point is concentrated in the sphere @ xmath35 of the distribution @ xmath33 and is an absolutely continuous function . let @ xmath36 be the density of the @ xmath37 . this has the form @ xmath38 where @ xmath39 is the density ( in the form of generalized function ) of the continuous component of @ xmath26 concentrated in the sphere @ xmath30 and @ xmath40 is the density of the absolutely continuous component of @ xmath26 concentrated in @ xmath41 . the continuous part of density ( [ struc2 ] ) is given by the form : @ xmath42 where @ xmath43 is the generalized delta - function . the absolutely continuous part of density ( [ struc2 ] ) has the form : @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 is the generalized function of concentrated in @ xmath41 and @ xmath46 is the generalized delta - function density given by @ xmath47 the expansion of the probability density ( [ struc2 ] ) at this point isis the main result of this section . since the second component is also denoted by ( [ denss ] ) , all our efforts are now focused on finding the corresponding corresponding representation for the first zero component ( [ densac ] ) of the function . our main result is the characteristic function . because , as it is stated above , the closed - form expressions for the characteristic functions ( both conditional and objective functions ) of the three - dimensional symmetric conditional random flight @ xmath4 are obtained . in this way we obtain the corresponding representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three changes of direction . these expressions form the basis for our subsequent work leading to the results for the conditional characteristic function and the characteristic function of the three - dimensional symmetric conditional random flight @ xmath4 over different time scales . the main result of this section is given by the following formula . * = 1 . * _ the conditional characteristic functions @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 corresponding to two and three changes of direction are given , respectively , by the formula : _ @ xmath50 @ xmath51 @ xmath52 _ where @ xmath53 is a function , @xmath54 is the continuous hypergeometric function given by _ ( [ hypergeom54 ] ) _ ( see below ) and the parameters @ xmath55 are given by the formula _ @ xmath56 3 . 2 . _ 1 . _ it is shown in ( * ? ? ? * _ ( 3 . 2 ) ) that , for all @ xmath20 , the correlation function @ xmath57 ( that is , the transform @ xmath58 with respect to the parameters @ xmath59 ) of the probability distribution @ xmath60 of the n -

known relations for pochhammer symbol @ xmath165 and the relations for the zeta - function @ xmath166 we can easily see that the expression on the right - hand side of ( [ appa1 ] ) holds @ xmath167 where @ xmath168 is the inverse hypergeometric function . according to ( * * 1 . 1 . 1 , page 539 , page 1 ) @ xmath169 translating this into ( [ appa3 ] ) , we get ( [ appa1 ] ) . the theorem is proved . from this result we have derived expressions for the derivatives of the inverse gamma function that have been used in the proof of the above results . however , these expressions are of a more general mathematical interest because , to the surprise of the mathematician i . ,there are three uniform representations , corresponding to ( [ appb2 ] ) , ( [ appb4 ] ) and ( [ appb6 ] ) ( see below ) , in these cases , namely @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . @ xmath184 taking these series into ( [ appb3 ] ) we get ( [ appb2 ] ) . the uniform representation of the series in _ ( [ appb2 ] ) can be defined similarly to that of _ b1 . this is the proof of the theorem . @ xmath81 * _ b3 . * _ for _ @ xmath185 , the following uniform representation exists : _ @ xmath186 _ where _ @ xmath187 _ is the corresponding hypergeometric series . the series in _ ( [ appb4 ] ) _ is defined similarly to @ xmath172 . _ proof . proof . _ proof . _ from ( [ appb1 ] ) and ( [ appb2 ] ) it follows that @ xmath188 where the coefficients @ xmath55 are given by @ xmath189 , ( [ apa3 ] ) , ([ appa2 ] ) and the coefficients @ xmath190 after some additional work , we arrive at the formula @ xmath191 taking these coefficients into ( [ appb5 ] ) we get ( [ appb4 ] ) . the theorem is proved . @ xmath81 * _ b4 . * _ for _ @ xmath177 , the following relation also holds : _ @ xmath192 _ where the coefficients @ xmath55 are given by the sequence _ @ xmath193 _ the series _ _ ( [ appb6 ] ) _ is continued up to @ xmath172 . _ _ _ . _ according to _ b2 , we have : @ xmath194 where the coefficients @ xmath195 are : @ xmath196 \ \ & = \ frac { 2 } { l + k } \ ; _ { l = k } ^ { \ frac { k ! \ ; ( l -
