the effect of pressure and angular momentum on pairing gap is an important topic in the study of nuclear pairing . because of its simplicity , the bcs theory is widely used , which is a good example of the phenomenon at the small scale , as in superconductors . it explains the phenomenon of the pairing gap , @ xmath0 , which causes the sharp superfluid - nuclear ( nm ) phase transition at finite temperature . the bcs theory , however , has pressure and thermal fluctuations , which are observed in very small systems . therefore , it has to be modified for the transition to finite temperature . several experimental methods have been used to study the effect of temperature on nuclear pairing @ xcite . their results show that , for finite angular momentum , thermal fluctuations cancel out the sharp nuclear phase transition , resulting in the pairing gap , which does not collapse at finite temperature . for such systems , a model of temperature and spin splitting , which shows the mutual influence of the temperature fluctuations in such systems , has also been predicted @ xcite . the new quantum theory , called the new bcs ( mbcs ) theory @ xcite has shown , for the standard model , that the upper limit of the spin - spin pairing gap is the quasipar##ticle - correlation function ( qnf ) . recently , we published the self - consistent quantum single - particle analysis ( scqrpa ) @ xcite , which describes the qnf as well as the quantum effects related to the application to quantum theory . the goal of this paper is to apply this theory to finite energy and finite angular momentum . the corresponding hamiltonian is : , which describes a system of @ xmath1 particles interacting via a transfer operator with the velocity @ xmath2 and : with the velocity @ xmath3 and a finite angular momentum : @ xmath4 along the classical ( or experimental ) axis @ xmath5 and : @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 ( @ xmath8 ) is the energy that creates ( creates ) a system with angular momentum @ xmath9 , and energy @ xmath10 , @ xmath11 , and energy @ xmath12 . for example , the coordinates @ xmath9 denote the single - particle states @ xmath13 with @ xmath14 respectively , whereas @ xmath15 denote the time - independent states @ xmath16 .the particle number of @ xmath17 is defined as @ xmath18 , whereas @ xmath19 is the @ xmath20 - unit of total angular momentum . the variational method is used to obtain the expectation value of this hamiltonian in the quantum canonical form . the method yields the coupled equations for the band gap , particle number and total angular momentum , which satisfy the definition of qnf in the form @ xmath21 @ xmath22 ~ , \ hspace { 0 } } { = \ sum _ { n _ k ( n _ k ^ { + } - n _ k ^ { - } ) ~ , \ dots { 0 } \ ] ] where the total energy @ xmath23 and the single - particle energy @ xmath24 are defined as @ xmath25 @ xmath26 with @ xmath27 , and @ xmath28 . the expectation values @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are obtained by solving a set of coupled equations , which are the scqrpa @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 respectively . the qnf is given by @ xmath33 , where the energy##particle correlation ##s @ xmath34 $ obtained from the integral equations @ xmath35 ^ { 2 } + [ \ int _ { n } ^ { \ omega } ( \ omega ) ] ^ 2 } [ \ omega ~ , \ int { nkcoupling } \ ] ] with the integral equations @ xmath36 $ by combining the system of equations for discrete - time linear plane waves ##n and those of the theory associated with scqrpa particle interactions . the resulting dampings are denoted [ @ xmath37 $ ] . the first approach is called the ftbcs1 + scqrpa theory . with the extensions to scqrpa , i . e . the interactions @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 , it becomes the ftbcs1 theory , which is distinguished from the proposed ftbcs ##1 by the choice of the qnf . the effect of particle motion with zero angular momentum is then calculated by using the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method . the two approaches are called the ftln1 + scqrpa and ftln1 . the second calculations are carried out using the @ xmath38 .##ubly an energy , with the number @ xmath38 of particles equal to that of high , @ xmath1 , as well as for @ xmath39o , @ xmath40ca , @ xmath41fe , and @ xmath42sn . the results also show that , under low angular momentum , and the action of qnf on the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) , the initial state ##f energy induced by the ftbcs ##1 is cancelled out . as the result , the energy gap does not exist for @ xmath43 , but the energy gap , which leads to the @ xmath44 . the theoretical relationship to the scqrpa vibrations also supports the relationship with the experimental results for the total energy and energy gaps obtained for @ xmath45 as well as those for @ xmath41fe using the high - dimensional quantum monte carlo method @ xcite [ fig . [ fig ] ( a ) [ fig ] ( b ) ] . however , for simple systems such as @ xmath42sn , the scqrpa vibrations are predicted to be stable in comparison with the ftbcs1 (ftln1 ) ) . for @ xmath39o and @ xmath40ca , the ftbcs1 theory gaps , obtained at smaller @ xmath4 , collapse as @ xmath44 , and do not collapse at different @ xmath44 . for @ xmath4 less than the maximum value @ xmath46 , where the ftbcs ##1 for @ xmath47 collapses , there are the first two steps , after which the ftbcs1 gap collapses at a smaller @ xmath48 , and remains finite at @ xmath49 [ cf . [ 1 ] ( 2 ) ] . this process is governed by the qnf of the ftbcs1 gap . at @ xmath47 , the qnf is negative , and the ftbcs and ftbcs1 gaps are the same as those of @ xmath4 ( and @ xmath3 ) , and they collapse at @ xmath50 . however , with larger @ xmath44 , the ftbcs1 gaps , which are obtained at smaller @ xmath44 , collapse at @ xmath51 , and remain finite even at a large @ xmat##h44 , whereas those provided by the original ftbcs would be for @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 [ fig .
