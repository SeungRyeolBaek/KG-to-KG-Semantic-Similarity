study of charge migration in dna molecules has opened new avenues to the migration mechanisms , from its application in the dna repair process and synthesis @ xcite to application of it in nanoelectronic electronic devices @ xcite . in addition , dna - based molecular electronic devices are able to operate in the energy range @ xcite that far exceeds the range of the conventional solid state devices . as expectedly , the dna molecules will be the result of many different mechanisms both theoretically @ xcite and not @ xcite . from all these mechanisms of charge migration in the dna molecule , as well , it is evident that there are two mechanisms for migration of charge depending on the molecular structure and its function : the superexchange charge transfer and the charge migration @ xcite . the charge transfer contributes to the structural changes in the molecule and the dna molecules , which also contribute to the charge migration mechanism . due to the shape of the @ xmath0 orbitals of the first two atoms and the size differences between them , charge can be transferred to different positions in the ( g - s ) @ xmath1 and ( s - s ) @ xmath1 oligomers . this also affects thestudy of the thermal environment of the nucleobases inner - sphere component and that of outer - sphere component . furthermore , the calculation of the interaction parameters , such as the overlap @ xcite and the energy for the interaction i . e . the charge and the activation energy @ xcite , has been performed specifically for the nucleobases and / and base pairs . the main objective of our study is to determine the chemical interactions between the two different nucleobases , their charge transfer and inner - sphere activation energy , when they are located in the ( a - b ) @ xmath1 and ( a - c ) @ xmath1 oligomer complexes . all these calculations have been performed using different physical - chemical methods . the very low electron activation energy of the dna molecule makes the electron - transfer mechanism very different from that of the overlap @ xcite . the charge transfer in the dna molecule is found to be highly dependent on the combination of the donor and recipient atoms and details of their overlap @ xcite . the charge transfer in the dna molecule is due to the interaction of the @ xmath0 - orbital of the dna and the oxygen atoms that form the @ xmat##h4 orbitals of the dna nucleobases . charge migration in the electronic system with many interacting holes and electrons , such as between the base pairs of the dna molecule , is described by the very low - energy nonadiabatic charge - migration matrix @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 is the electronic donor - donor matrix element , and fc is the maxwell - condon constant . the electronic donor - donor matrix element @ xmath6 is determined by the difference of the orbitals of the donor and the donor and depends on the geometry of the dna molecule . for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers the following expressions for the deviation of the electronic coupling from the basis of @ xmath2 have been calculated @ xcite . according to these expressions , the deviation of the electronic coupling increases with distance of the oligomers @ xcite . in fig . - 1 , we model the electronic coupling of the nucleobases of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers using the quantum mechanical analogy with the standard model .see also @ xcite . according to the coupling theory , the electronic coupling can be expressed as function of the ground state energy between the electron and the homo - orbital of the original , electronic state , represented by the hartree - fock self - consistent model . recently , the rhf / 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 has been used for the electronic coupling calculations . the 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 data set is sufficient for our calculations . the calculations show that the bond length has no effect on the electron density @ xcite . the atoms of the two different base pairs have been calculated with the rhf / 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 , and in the program , the corresponding atoms of the base pairs have been calculated with a bond length of @ xmath9 and a dimension of 2 . 5 . the combination of the two different calculations allows us to consider the two nucleobases to be ` in equilibrium ' @ xcite with the atoms of the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 and ( c - c ) @ .##math1 oligomers . the fc ##e deals with the effect of the vibronic field on the wave function and can be expressed as @ xmath10 where @ xmath11 is the activation energy of the ion , and @ xmath12 is the reorganization energy . the relaxation of the donor with the negative ion is included in the outer - sphere reorganization energy @ xmath13 , and the relaxation of the ion , the donor and the hole bridge ##r is included in the inner - sphere reorganization energy @ xmath14 . for adding one electron to the positive ion and ( 2 ) the reorganization energy @ xmath15 for adding one electron from the neutral state , where @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 are the electron donor and the hole bridge . ] the outer - sphere reorganization energy is for the low - energy non - bonding state and can be expressed using the standard cubic equation as @ xcite @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 is the energy of the neutral state in a neutral geometry , @ xmath20 is the energy of the neutral state in an ionic geometry , @ xmath21 is the energy of the neutral state in an ionic geometry , and @ x##math22 is the length of the hydrogen bond in the parent molecule . the reorganization energy @ xmath15 is the energy to add an electron from the electron pair @ xmath17 , and the reorganization energy @ xmath23 is the energy to add an electron to the electron pair @ xmath24 . the method for calculation of the reorganization energy is shown in figure [ 1 : fig1 ] . here , the vibronic electrons determine the structure of the molecule and the transition from the non - equilibrium state ( @ xmath25 ) to the equilibrium state ( @ xmath26 ) . the total reorganization energy is given by @ xmath27 and differs from the method @ xmath28 in the inner - sphere reorganization energy . the inner - sphere reorganization energy has been calculated using the modified becke3p86 / 1 - 311 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 version of the dft method . the dft theory was found to be valid for this case based on a comparison of the results of experiments . these results show that the dft method estimates the value of the inner - sphere reorganization energy with a small error when compared to the experimental method @ xcite .furthermore , we have also studied the predictions of the kinetic theory and the dft theory for the positive electric potential ( pi ) , and have shown a direct and quantitative correlation of the results with the experimental data @ xcite , and the becke3p86 model is used for this purpose . at first we consider the case of the two interactions . the equations for the two interacting base pairs ( pi ) are given in table [ 1 : table2 ] . in the case when the phosphate / phosphate and phosphate / phosphate bases are stacked on the membrane , the configurations of the phosphate and phosphate bases have higher energy in comparison to the phosphate / phosphate configurations . for the ( g - b ) @ xmath29 and ( g - c ) @ xmath29 oligomers the electrons are spread between the two intrastrand nucleobases , and therefore , there is a significant difference between the @ xmath0 orbitals of the respective phosphate / phosphate and phosphate / phosphate configurations . for oligomers where the phosphate and the phosphate bases are stacked , thesingle strand ( a - t / t - a , a - t / c - g , g - t / c - g ) . in the secondary strand ( a - t / c - g and g - t / c - g ) , for some strands the @ xmath0 orbitals are present , but the coupling is weak . for others the @ xmath0 orbitals are present mostly on the nucleobase , and we can see the weak intrastrand and interstrand coupling between the nucleobases as well . the weak interstrand coupling for the strands a - t / t - a and g - c / c - g has been studied in @ xcite . [ ^ = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] therefore , the hydrogen bonds are the basis for charge transfer between the nucleobases . in the transition state the hydrogen bonds participate in the charge transfer between the nucleobases to transition the reaction from the nonequilibrum state , where the charge is concentrated mostly on the nucleobase with a positive charge , to the transition state , where the charge is distributed across the strands . @xcite . we use the a - t and g - c base pairs as the transition state for the chemical reaction of @ xmath14 . the addition of the base pairs into the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - t ) @ xmath1 oligomers leads to a decrease of the inner - sphere reorganization energy @ xmath30 and a decrease of the charge as well . the results are shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] , where the reduction of @ xmath14 is assumed to be due to the sum of the position and rotation of the base pairs relative to each other and to the decrease of the charge of the base . according to our calculations , with addition of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - t ) @ xmath1 oligomers the rotation of the base pairs also leads to the decrease of the transition state of the nucleobase and to the reduction of the @ xmath30 . the addition of the sum of the transition states ( see fig . [ fig : fig5 ] ) and the inner - sphere reorganization energy ( see fig . [ fig : fig2 ] ) causes the reduction of the transition, which is the ratio of the two charges . and the corresponding charge versus the number of electrons in the dna replication oligomers ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 [ with ub3p86 / p - 311 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 ] as we discussed above , @ xmath30 depends on the charge density of the molecule . the electric potential distribution between the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 and ( a - t ) @ xmath1 oligomers and also the density of the replication and the oligomer , and the distribution of the charge between the free electrons and those in the homo complex . we also studied the potential distribution of the difference between the @ xmath32 and in the @ xmath33 with mulliken kinetic ##s @ xcite . in the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 and ( a - t ) @ xmath1 , the charge is distributed throughout the molecule and is determined by the total charge density of the dna replication center . for example , the ratio of the two negative charges present at the @ xmath2= 2 which is greater than that at the center , by 0 . 06 coul for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and by 0 . 05 coul for the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 sequences . for the ( g - c ) @ xmath34 , our results are in agreement with the results from ms . @ xcite . however , the geometry relaxation in the oligomer and in the transition state is the only such effect at the center of the target molecule . we have done an analysis of the geometry relaxation of the individual base pairs @ xmath35 from the 3d structure of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers , where @ xmath36 . the experimental results of @ xmath35 for @ xmath2 = 3 and @ xmath2 = 4 are shown in figure [ 1 : fig3 ] . however , for the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 sequences the effect of the charge changes on the shape of the molecule and at the center more pronounced than that for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 sequences . the .of these two pairs , the difference is between the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 pairs . distances to the two lone pairs of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers , where @ xmath37 and @ xmath2 = , were measured with ub3p86 / 1 - 311 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 . ] the difference in the inner - sphere reorganization energy of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers should reflect the larger value of the electron affinity energy for the g - c pairs than that for the a - t pairs , and larger for the latter than that for the former ( see also [ table : table1 ] ) . we have performed several quantum - mechanical calculations to determine the electron affinity and the inner - sphere reorganization energy for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 - oligomers , where @ xmath36 . the electron coupling between the nearest two nucleob##ases on the dna molecule vary significantly with each of the base pairs in @ xmath2 resulting in the bond formation . the @ xmath384 is the highest number used for an accurate measurement of the chemical bonds in the dna molecule . the charge distribution of oligomers with the charge distribution in the dna nucleobase has been shown to be the main reason for charge distribution in the base pairs located close to the chain center . the charge distribution in the center causes much of the the geometry distortion of the base pairs during the oxidation process in dependence on their position in the oligomer . also , the base pairs in the chain center show little geometry distortion during the oxidation process . these results are in perfect agreement with the pattern of polaron formation in the dna molecule , where the greatest geometry distortion occurs in the polaron in @ xcite . the authors would like to visit dr . a . a . starikov for more information . this project has been funded by the canada research council grant and a canadian foundation for innovation ( cfi ) grant . s . a . beckman , r . l . ames , _ j . biol . chem . _ * 1997 * , _ 272 _ , 19633 - 19636 ;
