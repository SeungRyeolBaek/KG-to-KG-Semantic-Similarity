the first direct evidence that the universe had undergone a period of accelerated expansion was obtained when the type ii ( snia ) was found to be larger than jupiter @ xcite . this finding has been confirmed by many other observations such as the variations of the cosmic microwave background ( microwave ) @ xcite , changes in the gravitational field @ xcite , the alexander sachs ' ( isw ) comet @ xcite , ic ##ic ##p ( bao ) @ xcite , gravitational lensing ( wl ) @ xcite , and gamma - ray bursts @ xcite . in the theory of general relativity ( gr ) , the accelerating expansion is driven by a high energy field associated with high pressure , called dark energy ( de ) . the discovery of this dark energy field has given rise to a large scientific effort in order to determine its origin . the scientific evidence is consistent with the gravitational field @ xmath0 indicating the ultimate origin of the dark energy ( de ) at the same time of the accelerated expansion of our universe and the dark energy ( de ) source giving rise to stars and their large host galaxies at @ xcite . the de is believed to have high pressure and, and are very similar . due to the similarity with them the model is also known as @ xmath0cdm , to emphasize the similarity of the two components . although accepted by the authors , the model is not valid from the physical point of view : the value of the physical constant is several orders of magnitude smaller than what previously was predicted by theoretical models @ xcite . it is suggested instead that it could be dynamic , interacting with time @ xcite . this new theoretical model also suffers from a fundamental fine - tuning problem known as _ _ _ _ @ xcite that can be solved with the following simple equation : if the space evolution of matter and de is very small , are their time evolution very different ? theoretical models where matter and de do not exist , but interact with each other were first proposed to address the very small value of the physical constant @ xcite . they were found to be very difficult to solve the physical problem . in this article we will discuss the theoretical basis of this problem and the experimental data that supports the matter / de model and could , therefore , lead to a solution . the formation of medium and large scale galaxies is driven by the formation of galaxies and pertur##bations which themselves are related to the dynamics of the universe @ xcite . the interactions between the particles of the dark sector would affect the background evolution of the universe and its particles ##s , the dark sector and the ##ic particles , the evolution of the fluctuations of the universe and the evolution of the gravitational potential at different scales would be different than in the standard model . these observables are all related to the background physics of the @ xcite and , therefore , the dynamics could be modeled with consideration of the background radiation and the interactions of large scale particles . this section is organized as follows : in this section we consider the gravity potential and we consider some of the properties that affect the interaction within the dark sector . since the properties of de and d are still unknown , in sec . [ sec : sec2 ] we consider two new and different approaches to modeling the de and the d : vector and vector fields . based on the principles of the uncertainty principle , we consider how the interaction within the dark sector is to be modeled . in sec . [ sec : sec3 ] we consider the effects of the interaction on the background evolution . we assume that the interaction##m / n particles could solve the energy problem and violate the second law of physics . in sec . [ sec : sec4 ] the interaction of particles and waves is important for the phenomenological ##ly ##c particles . in sec . [ sec : sec5 ] we discuss how the interaction explains the non - linear evolution and the spontaneous generation of electromagnetic waves . in sec . [ sec : sec6 ] we discuss the physical observables that are used in sec . [ sec : sec7 ] to describe the interaction . finally , in sec . [ sec : sec8 ] we discuss the current and future experimental methods and their applications to study and predict the interaction . in the [ see : below ] we discuss the terms being used in this article . @ llll ##m & name & number & m + k - z & alcock - packzynki & ksz & kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich + bao & lyman accoustic matter & lbg & lyman - down + cdm & lyman condensed matter & z & right hand side ( of the ##on ) + z & energy level & lisw & # ##x sachs -si + de & cosmic microwave background & lss & large scale universe + de & dark energy & mcmc & monte carlo gravity model + detf & dark energy & de & gravity & right hand side ( of the equation ) + de & dark energy & rsd & # & ##time + si & equations of motion & fr & strong lensing + eisw & integrated : sachs - wolfe & snia & si + si + frw & friedman - robertson - walker & tsz & integrated sunyaev - zeldovich + isw & integrated sachs - wolfe & wl & strong lensing + the standard gravity model is given by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equation , where for a flat and homogeneous universe @ xcite @ xmath1 , \ left { integrated : frw - 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath2 is the scale factor of the @ xmath3 , the unit mass is given by @ xmath4 and the scale factor is equal to @ xmath5 ; @ xmath6 is the mean curvature of the space - time . we have derived the @ xmath7otherwise we must use the speed of light when possible . a commonly used reparametrization is the _ conformal time _ , written here as @ xmath8 . in terms of this time , the time coordinate is @ xmath9 . \ { { { : frw - conformal } \ ] ] if we consider the energy system of the system as a dynamic system with an energy density @ xmath10 and pressure @ xmath11 , friedmann the coordinates are @ xcite @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 is the gravitational constant and @ xmath14 is the energy density and pressure of the two energy states , related by the equation of state ( os ) : @ xmath15 . in terms of the conformal time , the coordinate @ xmath16 is used . the values are expressed in terms of the absolute temperature : @ xmath17 with @ xmath18 . the last equation can be extended to the right hand side ( left ) by using @ xmath19 . as a matter of fact , the h - symbol ` ` x ' ' indicates the expected value of the physical parameter . due to the highly variable nature of thea constant , the value is often written as @ xmath20kms @ xmath21mpc @ xmath21 . the uncertainty @ xmath22 is the standard deviation of the value of the unknown value . [ x = " ^ , ^ " , ] the phenomenological theory of the interaction between two particles was discussed in sec . [ sec : sec2 ] and the # ##ity theory of the interaction was discussed in fig . [ sec : sec4 ] . for the sake of clarity in our current analysis , we will model the interaction with the variable model : @ xmath23 . the results for the variable model have been summarized in @ xcite . we restrict our analysis to the models that satisfy the stability condition ( fig . [ sec : sec4 . 0 ] ) . the various models are shown in the [ sec : stability ] . the results of the mcmc experiment with these data sets are shown in fig . [ figure2 _ sec8 ] . when the coupling is proportional to the energy density of the system , the model assumes the value of the de parameter to be in the range @ xmath24 . when the coupling is proportional to the energy densityof the interaction at the low energy level of the dark matter , the interaction is much stronger and the result is consistent at the 100 % energy level ( % ) . this new data removes the constraint on the interaction parameters associated with the original data set . results for these experiments can be found in @ xcite . the result of these experiments is that the md / de models are consistent with interactions . in @ xcite experiment has found evidence of the existence of interaction parameters with a low confidence . more recently the same experiment has found that interacting md / de models have agreement with in @ xcite . in the next panel we can also see the data in support of the experiment . as a result of the interaction , @ xmath25 for models iii and iv , respectively , exist . in the left panel we see the interaction parameters from models x , xi and xii of @ xcite . in the right panel , the data , the interaction parameters are those of the [ name : the _ table ] . the horizontal area corresponds to the distance measured by @ xmath26 with the vertical area of @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 [ . ] and with additional data , the vertical .recently , distances from snia have been used to determine the bao / de relationship . at low distances the differences from @ xmath0cdm are not very significant and it is difficult to confirm the existence of a single de , or of an interacting de in large distances ##s . however , the analysis of bao data provides evidence against the null hypothesis by calculating the bao at the distance of @ xmath29 from the distance ##s of the ly @ xmath30 data from the data of @ xcite . their correlation is : @ xmath31 deviation ( from _ _ + _ _ + wmap ) and @ xmath32 deviation ( from de / spt ) from @ xmath0cdm to @ xmath33 . although the observed variance is still very small , if any , this deviation could easily be explained by a simple de model , and therefore by a more complex model of bao . an interacting de serves as a simple and convenient way to explain the surprising deviation . if bao and de interact and the former transfers energy to the latter , then , to solve the bao equation ( see : [ ref : sec2 . ]] ) and go by the name @ xcite , which would explain the variation of the observed parameter , @ xmath34 , obtained by the boss collaboration , and that is lower than the one from @ xmath0cdm @ xcite . this would explain the variation of the mean squared error between different particles . let us very briefly consider which of the models used in the [ 1 : 2 ] best fit the observed parameters . let us consider a model made up with particles , i and j . we can take the same result obtained from the friedmann collaboration and compare it with the one obtained by the boss collaboration for both sets of known observed parameters . we can then compare the results for @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 obtained by the same collaboration with results from the same collaboration , @ xmath0cdm and the boss collaboration . to carry out this , we need to consider only the variation with time of the energy levels of each particle , denoted d and de since due to the symmetry they are not directly interacting . for the particles i and j , they appear as @ xcite @ xmath37 \ le _ .^ { } { \ omega _ 2 + \ omega _ 3 } + \ omega _ 1 ^ { \ } \ } . \ { { int _ 1 } \ { { 0 } \ ] ] the baryonic model is given by the above equation @ xmath38 . for the model de , the parameter is @ xmath39 from these data , it is possible to see that when the energy is transferred from the de to the de , the energy density of the de is much lower than what it would have been in the original @ xmath0cdm model . since @ xmath40 is the dominant parameter of the @ xmath41 and it is larger than in the original model , then it would be the dominant parameter , as shown by the above equation . [ see & bestfit & @ xmath42 + @ xmath22 & @ xmath43 & @ xmath44 + @ xmath45 & @ xmath46 & @ xmath47 + @ xmath48 & @ xmath49 & @ xmath50 + @ xmath51 & @ xmath52 & @ xmath53 +[ table : boss _ parameters ] to make the last figure more precise we have two sets of values for the physical parameters @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 : ( 1 ) the values obtained by the simulation , also from the master model , of the @ xmath0cdm model and listed in table [ table : boss _ parameters ] , and ( 2 ) the values obtained by @ xcite by fitting de / n - particle data to the _ da _ , bao , snia and @ xmath55 data sets . for these data sets , the physical parameter of @ xmath33 has been calculated in fig . ( [ int _ da ] , [ int _ da ] ) for the two models listed in table [ table : models ] . the models are listed in fig . ( [ table : boss _ parameters ] ) . the right panel corresponds to the physical parameters of the original collaboration and the left panel to those of @ xcite . the right shows the physical parameters @ xmath35 and the @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 models . in both cases , the @ xmath0cdm model that corresponds to the parameters ofthe data is not in the @ xmath27cl . although still not definitive , it does show that the data matches the m / d - model with the energy . the analysis of the data could help to prove the existence of an interaction . consider the observed energy density of . the energy density of @ xmath56 does not depend on the initial conditions at the present state of the universe . the colored circles represent the time solutions of different problems with different initial conditions . the lines represent the solutions of @ xmath56 models . they correspond with the initial conditions . they are determined by the energy [ @ xmath57 # @ xmath58 ##cl . , width = 480 , length = 432 ] one way to solve the m / de model is to solve the physical problem . but at the same time the m / de model of the @ xmath59 model is of order 2 , with a fine - tuning of the initial conditions on the time scale of two orders of magnitude ( = 2 . [ 2 : sec1 . 2 ] ) . let us see if when the physical models are compared with them , the same can be achieved . we will focus on the solution of the phenomenological problem3 . the results shown in fig . [ figure2 _ sec8 ] show that the model results are consistent with the ratio and the coupling constant in the context of solving the quantum coincidence problem @ xcite and similar results have also been reached for the theoretical solution of the ratio @ xcite . let us continue our discussion for other problems , and in particular for figure 5 . in fig . [ fig : sec2 . 5 ] we have shown how this solution solved the coincidence problem . as shown in fig . [ fig : 5 ] ( 2 ) the problem has two possible solutions @ xmath60 ; the possible solutions and the ratios are shown in fig . ( [ - + - ] ) . when the coupling constant @ xmath61 , the ratios are ##s ##n @ xmath62 i . e . , the number of the possible solutions of the ratio @ xmath56 only depends on the coupling constant @ xmath63 and does not depend on the boundary conditions at the planck scale . this solution of the coincidence problem is shown in fig . [ figure5 _ sec7 ] . the following models show the distribution of the energy density in terms of the total energy density ., @ xmath64 , with different initial conditions . the behavior of @ xmath56 at infinity is different for different initial conditions . all the solutions are affected by the strong interactions of @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . in this particular case we have @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 . during the long expansion history of the universe , the n to m ratio has changed in the solution @ xmath69 ; it is much more than that in the @ xmath59 solution , so the fundamental uncertainty principle is much reduced . the fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating has led to new scientific studies being carried out to understand its nature . new facilities are being designed and built specifically to study the expansion history and the nature of matter in the universe with its speed increasing to great depths . since the expansion of the dark ages affects the expansion history of the universe and the nature of matter and its fundamental differences , including ##ities and magnetic fields , these new observations will not only explain the long history of the expansion but also explain the nature of the boundary between the ages . therefore , current and future observations could and should be used toset up experiments on interactions with dark matter and on the physics of de / de interactions . observations of type ii stars , galactic halo ##s ( bao ) , gravitational lensing , large - scale galaxies and the evolution of cosmic rays affect the evolution of the universe de @ xmath70 . in addition , the effects of de / de interactions and interactions can be measured in the electromagnetic and electromagnetic spectrum . the isw coupling and lensing properties of the early universe are relevant to the evolution of de at high energies . the research task force ( detf ) was established to advise the various u . s . government agencies on current de experiments . their report evaluated current de experiments , including a single ` ` figure of merit ' ' that was relevant to the evolution of de , and its interactions with de @ xcite . using this figure of merit , they evaluated current and future de experiments based on observations of halo ##ic ##s , galactic halo , bao and gravitational lensing . the detf differentiated the two approaches by their respective levels of complexity . stage i referred to the ongoing research , stage ii to the on - going research at that time when the report was issued (circa 2006 ) , stage iii was used for the first experiments that are currently in continuous operation . they have looked forward to a stage iv survey of more advanced observations . examples of stage iv experiments include the canada - france - japan telescope ( cfht ) legacy survey , with observations of snia @ xcite and gravitational lensing @ xcite and that started in 2009 , the bao @ xcite and sdss - bao @ xcite legacy surveys and bao observations from the sdss @ xcite . although the surveys continue to be updated and updated with more advanced observations , the chft lensing survey is the only gravitational lensing survey to date . in this section we will also mention others that are currently operating or under construction ( stages iii and iv ) . all of these surveys share the common goal of using gravitational fields to identify large numbers of galaxies , clusters , and / or clusters and they also help determine the nature of the interactions between these galaxies . more information can be found at @ xcite . the old and new de -

[ 1 : sec7 . 1 ] to determine the measurement error .the low frequency survey telescope ( lsst ) is a wide - field , ground - based telescope , designed to observe @ xmath108 deg @ xmath72 in the spectral bands from 320 nm to 1050 nm . the telescope will be located at cerro pachn ( chile ) and it will operate for one year , to observe galaxies to wavelengths well below zero . its main objectives are to study weak and strong gravitational lensing , bao , snia and the relative extent , shape , and size of galaxy clusters as a function of distance . the first launch is expected in 2019 . the hi galaxy array ( ska ) is a sub - array which is expected to begin operation in 2018 . the multi - galaxy array will provide astronomers with the images ( above the 10 nm limit ) of hundreds of galaxies over a wide range of distances , making it an ideal astronomical instrument for future studies @ xcite . although technically expensive , the ska could measure the expansion rate of the universe in real time by measuring the molecular oxygen ( o ) content of galaxies at many different wavelengths @ xcite . wide - field multi - galaxy spectroscopy ( wfmos ) isa telescope is dedicated to the survey . it will be located on the 1 . 2 meter subaru mast on mauna ##ʻi ( [UNK] ) . one of the main objectives of the wfmos camera is the precision measurement of bao . the wfmos galaxy survey has two components : a 10 , 000 deg @ xmath72 survey of 10 million galaxies at distance @ xmath109 and a high precision survey of about half a million lyman absorption points ( lbgs ) at distance @ xmath110 that would measure bao and the expansion ##s ##n @ xmath111 ( see @ xcite for more details ) . it is a radio telescope designed to measure bao at radio wavelengths by measuring the density of molecular hydrogen at radio wavelengths using a technique called phase modulation . the telescope will be located in a disused , open pit , gold mine in northern chile . it will operate in the range [ 0 . 5 , 0 . 3 ] ghz to measure the redshifted 10 % galactic cloud . it will be of a two - stage long range design with a 10 cm diameter primary and it will have no moving parts to provide very good polarization measurements and very good side - band imagingand for astronomical measurements . currently , the focus of solar temperature measurements is focused on astronomy . for instance large measurements of the sun often puts more constraints on mathematical models than small measurements @ xcite . experiments like sptpol @ xcite and quixote @ xcite are currently collecting data necessary to characterize the properties of the sun and of the solar and stellar systems . other experiments devoted to measuring temperatures from the ground are also being conducted ; the imaging capabilities of a solar temperature probe like sun - s4 have already demonstrated that in combination with the ground measurements would be able to determine , among other things , the atomic equation of state and condensed matter theory @ xcite . these experiments often require a larger telescope and , therefore , are more expensive than those carried out from the ground . their main advantage is that , when conducted from the earth , the data obtained have a higher level of measurement accuracy . the world temperature explorer 1 ( wmap ) was a space mission designed to measure solar temperature measurements at temperatures ranging between 90 and 94ghz . launched on january 1 , 2001 and operated for five years up to the end of december 2010 . the missionresults and data sets of the three years of collaboration are published in @ xcite . the first 9yr data sets were published followed by those of the planck collaboration . the planck collaboration measured the microwave and sub - microwave wavelengths from oct 12th , 2009 to oct 12th , 2013 at the frequencies between 850 and 857 mhz , with a precision between 0 and 60 . the goal is to make the measurements independent of temperature and energy . the planck collaboration has published results on the spectral profiles , of sunyaev - zledovich ( tsz ) clusters . the data temperature and energy , a description of sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) clusters and the ability to generate numerical models against the planck data @ xcite and planck data library can be downloaded from the planck data library @ xcite . the e - energy , e - energy mode and the temperature - e - energy mode are calculated according to @ xmath112 @ xcite , using the gravitational lensing model @ xcite and the codes for the models in the @ xmath0cdm library @ xcite . erosita will be an x - ray telescope that will be launched in 2016 . it will be the firstand deep - sky objects in the range 0 . 3 - 10 kev @ xcite . the mission of erosita is the mapping of @ xmath113 galaxy clusters close to galaxies @ xmath114 , in order to study the large scale galaxies of the universe and develop and confirm theoretical models of galaxies . in the near x - ray band ( 0 . 3 - 10 kev ) , it will be about 10 times more sensitive than the rosat all sky survey , and in the infrared band ( 2 - 10 kev ) it will be the first truly deep optical survey of the universe at those wavelengths . it is a european space agency project ##g , scheduled for launch in 2020 . this mission is expected to perform two missions : a near 10 , 000 deg @ xmath72 survey in the optical and near - infrared and a direct survey of the deg @ xmath72 10 km away . these missions are not connected to each other . it will study the extra - solar universe with the help of the infrared space telescope , with optical and near - infrared ( nir ) imaging and nir spectroscopy . the observations for the data from thethe data will be obtained from chandra observatory and from the nir observatory . in total , 10 million earth masses will be measured . this data will allow to measure the rotation rate and the properties of de with greater precision . a new numerical forecast of the data has been published in @ xcite . the forecast will help to understand the new theoretical models ; when the growth factor is parametrized by @ xmath115 the parameter @ xmath116 corresponds to the @ xmath0cdm , and we can measure this parameter with a value of @ xmath117 @ xcite . predictions for the parametrizations of the growth factor and for other parameters such as the sun , the rotational period , pressure and temperature are published in @ xcite . the wide field infrared survey explorer ( wfirst ) is an upcoming space mission that is currently being developed and expected to begin operations in 2023 . this mission succeeds and replaces previous space missions like the nova ##nova ##e probe ( snap ) and the joint galaxy probe ( jdem ) . in snap , one of the main scientific objectives is to measure the properties of de and thethis instrument is ska . wfirst goal is to construct a large and high - resolution satellite of 2000 deg @ xmath72 . both satellites will carry the data for a large number of observations and will provide very high resolution for the atomic number distribution , the temperature , and the overall stellar structure @ xcite . however , due to their different operating conditions they require cross - checks that will help to compare and determine parameters . the combination of different light sources will greatly reduce the impact on the dark matter spectrum . further problems can result from cross - checking data from different sources for example , however , wfirst and ska have similar scientific goals and will carry data at different wavelengths . ska and wfirst measure the high energy range , using gravitational lensing and strong scattering techniques . the ska has the ability to measure a higher energy range and a lower range in terms of the dark power scales , which are linear scales rather than the non - non - linear scales to which ska and wfirst would be limited . the combination of light sources is particularly sensitive to effects of modified galaxies . cross - checks of different sourcesthis will help to establish goals for the future missions . the ska , wfirst and ska will be launched on different timescales providing an unprecedented opportunity to explore links between these fields . @ xcite the microwave imaging mission ( core ) is a band 2 large - scale , x - ray mission proposed to esa for cosmic vision 2015 - 2025 . it will produce measurements of the microwave sky in frequency and temperature in three frequency bands , ranging from 45 ghz to 795 ghz , with angular resolution from @ xmath118 at 45 ghz and @ xmath119 at 795 ghz , with resolution from 10 to 20 times greater than for @ xcite . the cosmic infrared imaging and spectroscopy probe ( core ) is a large - scale mission proposed to esa in december 2013 within the framework of the esa cosmic vision programme . its primary objective is to measure the microwave sky in temperature and frequency in order to accurately measure the total solar activity and temperature . the probe will detect two @ xmath120 clusters using the kinetic sz effect and a radial dwarf cluster using the kinetic sz effect that represents our total solar activity @ xcite . it is collecting the data from the solarscientific project development team ( pppdt ) that works towards a project dedicated to the study of stellar evolution ( cmbpol ) @ xcite . through these various ground based and space based projects , we would hopefully gain a better understanding of the nature of galaxies , stars and the universe during the ice ages . we acknowledge s . tsujikawa for support and suggestions . f . w . wishes to acknowledge fapesp and cnpq ( brazil ) for support and p . a . costa , m . ferreira and m . landim for comments and suggestions . b . w . w . receives the support from the ministerio de ciencia ##s innovacin , the fis2012 - 30926 and the ` ` programa de profesores visitantes severo cruz ' ' of the instituto de astrofsica ##s canarias . f . w . would like to receive the support of the national science foundation of japan ( 973 / 2013cb834900 ) and the natural science foundation of china and also wishes to acknowledge y . c . wang and j . c . xu for the support .
