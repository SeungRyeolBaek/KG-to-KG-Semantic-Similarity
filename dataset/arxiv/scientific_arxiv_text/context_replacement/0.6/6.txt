let @ xmath1 . then @ xmath2 \ longrightarrow [ 1 , \ sum _ { p , q } / \ ] $ ] is the family @ xmath3 where @ xmath4 . the @ xmath0 - _ [ [ _ , @ xmath5 , $ ] are defined to be the integral of @ xmath6 , @ xmath7 \ ] ] \ to @ xmath8 by the formula @ xmath9 which makes them continuous , linear , even with respect to , and even with respect to @ xmath10 . these are classical extensions of the elliptic functions , like @ xmath11 and they are known to share a number of important properties with their algebraic counterparts @ xcite . among these properties is the important question of linear and linear independence of the family @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 . this problem has received more attention than @ xcite , with a particular focus on the family @ xmath14 . in the first case , @ xmath15 is the family of eigenfunctions of the linear independence problem for the finite - dimensional @ xmath##16 - laplacian subject to dirichlet boundary conditions @ xcite , which is known to be of interest to the study of slow / fast . ##s , @ xcite . see also the following for @ xcite . let @ xmath17 , note that @ xmath18 is a schauder basis of the banach space @ xmath19 for let @ xmath20 . the formula @ xmath21 is also a schauder basis of @ xmath22 if and only if the family _ _ of _ _ _ , @ xmath23 , corresponds to a linear homeomorphism of @ xmath22 . the fourier transforms of @ xmath24 up to @ xmath25 satisfy the formula @ xmath26 for @ xmath27 , let @ xmath28 ( note that @ xmath29 for @ xmath30 ) and let @ xmath31 be the smallest number such that @ xmath32 . let @ xmath33 note that the system of coordinates takes the form @ xmath34 relations of ` ` and ' ' between elements of banach space are known to play a fundamental role in density functional analysis ,@ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . however , the evidence clearly suggests that @ xmath21 is not ` ` ` or ' ' @ xmath18 , e . g . , the krein - lyusternik and the paley - wiener theorem , @ xcite . the older methods , such as those of the paley - wiener limit theorem , are unlikely to be directly applicable in the general case . in fact , more sophisticated methods must be used in order to prove the invertibility of the set of the points . from this follows that @ xmath35 = @ xcite it was shown that the right side of holds true for all @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 is assumed to be in the neighborhood @ xmath38 . then @ xmath21 would be a schauder point , whenever @ xmath39 . further results in this area were then obtained by bushell and edmunds @ xcite . these results then filled the gaps previously found in ( * ? ? ? * * * ) and showed that , if the left side of had to hold , whenever @ xmath40 the same would hold for @ xmath14 .@ xmath41 . therefore , the basisness problem for @ xmath21 should be answered by other methods in the case @ xmath42 . more precisely @ xcite , edmunds , gurka and lang , . in order to prove invertibility of @ xmath43 for the functions @ xmath44 , as well as @ xmath45 since is constant whenever @ xmath46 this implies @ xmath47 for @ xmath48 . finally , note that the # ##ness of @ xmath14 ##0 , , leads to the non - equality of @ xmath49 . in section [ linearind ] , we prove that the function @ xmath21 = @ xmath50 - _ _ _ _ for pairs @ xmath1 , by example [ likernelandspan ] . in section [ ribap ] we establish that such that @ xmath43 is a homeomorphism of @ xmath51 to the subset of the points of the @ xmath44 - family where @ xmath52 proves theorem [ inprovement ] and see theorem [ beyonda ] . for this reason , in section [ below ] we establish the conditionsexamples which apply in the hilbert space case , are sections [ main _ 1 ] and [ main _ 2 ] . in this section , the _ riesz _ _ , @ xmath53 show how @ xmath21 suffers from being an orthonormal basis . these two criteria give upper bounds for @ xmath54 , which depend upon those obtained from the other side of , even when the rule is broken . the formulation of the solution to the below relies heavily on results published in section [ toep _ s ] . from section [ multareshifts ] we get from the canonical form of the case @ xmath31 : they turn out to be polynomials of finite degree . thus we can obtain from the formula the operators which are toeplitz operators of finite type acting on compact hilbert spaces . as the formulation is too simple for the case @ xmath55 and as the improvements compared to those given above would imply a limitation of the case @ xmath56 , we have decided to extend our work with respect to these results , to the more general hilbert space case . section [ casep = s ] is concerned with the ##s of the solution of the case@ xmath14 , and this will work on both the general case @ xmath20 and the special case @ xmath57 . not surprisingly , we have found a result which makes impossible the proof of invertibility of @ xmath43 for @ xmath58 , as for @ xcite . see remark [ p _ p ] . however , the result of ( * ? ? ? * problem 2 . 4 ) also applies to the _ basisness _ _ of @ xmath59 , where @ xmath60 is given by the expression @ xmath61 and also ( * ? ? ? * problem 2 . 5 ) . by remark [ fixingbbcdg ] we show that @ xmath21 is also a schauder basis of @ xmath22 for @ xmath62 where @ xmath63 , and ( * ? ? ? * problem 2 ) . for @ xmath64 , basisness is already known for all @ xmath65 . see remark [ impro _ p _ p = 1 ] . in remark [ nume ] we work on our current proof of the necessary conditions for invertibility of the set of the operator , andin the case of equal indices and , . based on the general results given in proposition [ 2 ] , we propose a simple test of invertibility for @ xmath43 which is open to experimental and theoretical interpretation . this test involves setting upper bounds on the first two terms @ xmath66 . see also [ beyond2 ] . for the case of equal indices , this result shows that @ xmath21 is a riesz family of @ xmath51 for @ xmath67 where @ xmath68 . all the other results given in this appendix are accurate up to the last term , , which is equal to the nearest integer . in the appendix we have described several simple linear families which can be used to prove the results above . the family @ xmath69 of a banach space is a @ xmath50 - linear family @ xcite , if @ xmath70 [ likernelandspan ] for and @ xmath1 , the family @ xmath21 is @ xmath50 - linear family of @ xmath22 . similarly , if the linear part of the family @ xmath23 is a linear family @ xmath##71 , and @ xmath72 for the second . we prove that @ xmath73 . let @ xmath74 be such that @ xmath75 where the sequence is equal to the sequence of @ xmath22 . from @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 we prove that all @ xmath78 ##8 means of a double - product . and that @ xmath79 . we prove that all @ xmath80 . secondly , all @ xmath81 from with @ xmath82 . we prove inductively that @ xmath29 for all @ xmath83 . from for @ xmath84 we prove @ xmath85 and @ xmath80 for all @ xmath86 . but this would imply the fact that @ xmath87 , because @ xmath88 . and that inductively that @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 . we prove that all for @ xmath80 . then , @ xmath81 from with @ xmath91 , because @ xmath92 . , and by proving that@ xmath29 for all @ xmath93 . from for @ xmath94 we get @ xmath95 the second assertion is a consequence of the fact that , for @ xmath96 with @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 , then @ xmath99 ( indices for the @ xmath100 ) or @ xmath101 ( indices for the @ xmath102 ) . then @ xmath80 for all @ xmath86 . but this would also imply the assertion that @ xmath87 , for all @ xmath103 implies that @ xmath104 . the first assertion is true as well . suppose that @ xmath105 . if @ xmath106 , then @ xmath107 for all @ xmath108 , so @ xmath109 which in turn implies that @ xmath110 for all @ xmath111 . on the other hand , if the assertion is true for @ xmath112 , then @ xmath113 for all @ xmath114 , then @ xmath115 ,see before . thus , @ xmath21 is a riesz basis of @ xmath51 if and only if @ xmath105 and @ xmath116 . this simple example shows how a set of continuous continuous functions can give the illusion of being a riesz basis . [ ex1 ] [ @ xmath117 $ ] . for @ xmath118 by means of remark [ toep ] thus , @ xmath119 is a riesz basis of @ xmath51 if and only if @ xmath120 . for @ xmath121 we have an orthonormal basis . but it is not complete , as it only contains the finite - dimensional component @ xmath122 . the spectral sequence of @ xmath43 shown above allows us to find the components generated by toeplitz functions of finite type , @ xcite . in order to extract these components , we start by taking the # ##s of the components @ xmath31 , @ xcite . examples : [ diri ] .

[ beyond2 ] for @ xmath57 and @ xmath423 . suppose that 1 . @ xmath290 , @ xmath245 and @ xmath424 for each and @ xmath425 . 2 . @ xmath426 . if @ xmath427 then @ xmath43 ##8 true . suppose that the coefficients are and . the comparison of and gives @ xmath428 , @ xmath429 and . the result follows from . we then compare the differences between the above estimates given in the previous section with those of the cases @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite . for this comparison we obtain two alternative estimates of @ xmath207 and @ xmath430 . these estimates are based on the following two papers : @ xmath431 and @ xmath432 . @ xmath433 is the generalized beta function , @ xmath434 is the beta function and @ xmath43##5 is the identity function . now , by repeating all the cases described in @ xcite for the case of ( * ? ? ? * ( 2 . 0 ) ) , it follows that @ xmath436 { \ mathrm { d } } = \ \ & = \ frac { \ sqrt { p } } { \ right } \ int _ p ^ 2 \ , \ } [ \ ! \ left ( \ frac { \ pi } { p } \ { \ mathcal { p } } \ ! \ ! \ left ( \ frac1q , \ frac { p - 1 } { p } ; x ^ ( \ left ) \ right ) \ } ] { \ mathrm { d } } \ . \ dot { x } \ ] ] . the values of @ xmath37 , @ xmath437 and the value of @ xmath438 are given here for comparison purposes , so we are not getting that @ xmath439 . green indicates relevance to the special case @ xmath20 . yellow indicates relevance for the case @ xmath57 . [ impro _ p _ 1 = 1 ] , p = 241 ] let us start with the case of @2 . see also [ impro _ p _ 1 = 0 ] . as shown in the figure , @ xmath440 for @ xmath41 . the condition @ xmath441 is true for all @ xmath442 where @ xmath443 . the corresponding condition @ xmath444 for all @ xmath445 whenever @ xmath446 . then we need to return to @ xmath447 , for the final proof of the existence of the [ beyond2 ] for @ xmath448 . here we have the following . 1 . for @ xmath449 , the conditions are true even for @ xmath450 where @ xmath451 . 2 . for @ xmath447 the condition cannot hold even for @ xmath452 where @ xmath68 . this means that that the condition for invertibility of @ xmath43 in the configuration space and for @ xmath14 holds at all @ xmath453 . thus we have the following formula . the regions shown in the [ th10ab ] and [ th10c ] correspond to points in the @ xmath44 - spacefor @ xmath454 . curves in figure [ th10ab ] that are not blue are applicable only to the color space of @ xmath57 . the same apply to @ xmath20 . figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( a ) _ and the black line in figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( b ) _ , have two solid ( colored ) lines . one that shows the limit of application of theorem [ impro _ implicit ] - [ aimplicit ] and another that shows the limit of application of the application of @ xcite . the black line is where and . to the intersection of that line is not and . there are two other regions of same color in _ ( a ) _ , which are where @ xmath455 and where @ xmath456 for @ xmath208 . theorem [ beyond2 ] is not applicable to the intersection of these regions . we only have the region where @ xmath457 and @ xmath458 . the intersection is part of the boundary of this region . the solid black line corresponds to the limit of application of theorem [ impro _ implicit ] - [ bimplicit ]we also see the figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( a ) ( b ) _ . to the right of that figure , in the next line , we see that @ xmath43 is used for @ xmath57 . the figure in figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( c ) _ now fills the gap between theorem [ impro _ implicit ] - [ aimplicit ] and theorem [ impro _ explicit ] - [ bimplicit ] in this @ xmath57 example . thus @ xmath459 is the point of reference for the region where @ xmath29 for @ xmath123 . these points are shown in figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( b ) _ now for @ xmath460 and @ xmath461 . in this figure , we also show the boundary of the region where @ xmath455 and the region where @ xmath456 is for @ xmath462 . note that the points for @ xmath463 and @ xmath458 are part of the boundary of the region . consider _ ( a ) _ and _ ( b ) _ , the straight line that divides the@ xmath16 starting at @ xmath464 points to the region of where proposition [ beyond2 ] for @ xmath465 is true ( for @ xmath16 to the right of this region ) . the difference between the two red lines ( for @ xmath57 ) means that proposition [ beyond2 ] would not satisfy the argument for basisness with respect to a direct consequence of the [ impro _ statement ] - [ bimplicit ] . as we approach @ xmath466 , the boundary of the restricted region moves to the right , following the lines in red [ th10ab ] - _ ( d ) _ and _ ( e ) _ . the dashed red lines in red , located next to the red line , correspond to the expected boundaries of the region @ xmath466 where proposition [ beyond2 ] is the definition of invertibility for the region of interest which includes the change given above . for @ xmath467 the definition does not include the dashed red lines , for @ xmath447 it does include this region . the region shown in red is a restricted region where proposition [ = _ _ ] would not exist , but is restricted to this regionis true . theorem [ th10c ] is the application of theorem [ impro _ 2 ] - [ cimplicit ] . the small region shown in green is the smallest region where the theorem is true . as it happens , it follows that the properties of theorem [ th _ 2 ] allow it to be proven for the invertibility of @ xmath43 in the region of @ xmath454 . thus in the region shown in green , the upper bound for the riesz product coefficient of is lower than that obtained from . one of the methods for the proof of basisness for the function @ xmath21 in the region @ xmath470 is to make the assumption that the fourier coefficients of @ xmath471 are those of the point @ xmath472 . from this , we see that , for @ xmath473 , that @ xmath474 let @ xmath475 be the ( fixed ) point , and that @ xmath476 and @ xmath477 and @ xmath478 are the lines passing through the points @ xmath479 and @ xmath480 . there is a single value @xmath481 such that @ xmath482 this equality is defined because of monotonicity of both sides of this equality , and also , by definition . if both the parameters and are continuous in @ xmath16 , then and @ xmath483 is continuous in the case @ xmath16 . thus , @ xmath484 and , by solving the equation for @ xmath483 , we have @ xmath485 the right hand side , and hence the left hand side , approaches 0 as @ xmath388 . therefore , one ( and hence both ) of the two parameters and on the left should approach 0 . let @ xmath486 be the graph which has n vertices ( denoted by ) @ xmath487 for @ xmath488 @ xmath489 \ { \ { n \ } ) \ { ( \ { 0 \ } \ { [ 0 , 1 ] ) $ ] \ hausdorff space . then the graph of @ xmath486 approaches 0 as @ xmath388 . similarly , @ xmath486 is the graph of @ xmath490 for @ xmath##491 . 1 @ xmath492 finally , there is a node @ xmath493 in the set of @ xmath494 such that @ xmath495 and @ xmath496 the proof of is derived from the fact that , since @ xmath494 is convex ( because the indicator function is convex ) , the piecewise linear interpolant of @ xmath494 for the set of nodes @ xmath497 has a value twice that of @ xmath494 . the following python code written in the open source languages java and python can be used to prove some of the key results given in this article . # for computing @ xmath207 with n -
