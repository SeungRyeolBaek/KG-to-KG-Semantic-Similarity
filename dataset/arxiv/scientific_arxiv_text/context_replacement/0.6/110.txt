methods of photon electroproduction have played an important role in understanding the structure and properties of matter ( _ , _ e . g . _ , @ xcite ) . in the last few years , however , experiments with pairs of dileptons in proton - electron and electron - proton reactions have attracted more attention @ xcite . in these reactions , particles , which act as dileptons ( _ e . g . _ , the @ xmath2 reaction ) , provide important information about properties of matter because the processes by which the quantum system is formed occur in the timelike region of the ` ` lifetime ' ' ( @ xmath3 ) of the emitted photon . therefore , the study of these processes is necessary and sufficient for creation of new and sometimes useful information about the electromagnetic interactions of particles and systems . the interactive photon electroproduction ( ipe ) , @ xmath1 , ( @ dileptonproduction ) , was for a long time the main source of information about the fundamental electromagnetic interactions in the timelike region , having been studied by theoretically @ xcite and theoretically @ xcite since the beginning of the 1990s . in www . @ xcite , we focus on the fundamentalof both the nuclear and nuclear electromagnetic form factors from ipe at high energies . this technique has been successfully applied in the form of experimental data on the experiments and @ xmath4c and @ xmath5li . @ xcite and some of the form factors were measured for the first time in the timelike range of @ xmath3 , from 0 . 05 to 0 . 05 ( gev / s ) @ xmath6 . in a . @ xcite , the researchers proposed to use ipe at high ( at @ xmath7 ##l ) energies and at @ xmath8 to study the nuclear magnetic field and scale it up to @ xmath9 . although experimental data @ xcite for the @ xmath10 experiment is now available , there still exists a wide range of @ xmath3 ( up to @ xmath11 ) , where the form factors can not be measured directly in these experiments . on the other hand , the large electron energies available can allow researchers to perform more complex experiments at ipe aimed at simultaneously studying the nuclear structure and carrying out a multipole experiment similar to those for photoproduction and electroproduction (( , _ e . g . _ , @ xcite ) . such experiments can be interesting results . for example , in the @ xmath12 experiment it was possible to observe the @ xmath3 energy of the electric - magnetic - optical interactions found in the spin - state @ xcite . it is , therefore , worth considering the very remarkable results of the photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe to further the methods of understanding the strong and weak interactions of the universe on the basis of the ipe process in the first resonance region , and to apply the methods of this model . of importance for the ipe in the first resonance region is the possibility of studying the underlying weak interactions , using the same methods as for the born model . this approach is based on the total energy ( e ) , and on the general theory of ipe . in the ipe , the measurement of the @ xmath2 energy of total energy ( called the ` ` quasithreshold ' ' ) is done in the same process , whereas the rescattering - energy measurements are at the level of radiative energy corresponding to the energies @ xmath7 and @ xmath13 gev ( the` ` quasithreshold ' ' ' ) @ xcite . due to this fact , the same capture method for the processes electroproduction and photoproduction can be applied in the case of ipe up to the upper limit @ xcite . this allows us to avoid the problems when using the ipe method ( or the electroproduction method ) for measuring the weak form factor of the process . however , in the case of ipe there is no significant kinematic restriction applied to the @ xmath14 process and no kinematic restriction of contribution of the weak pseudoscalar weak form factor to the cross section of ` ` ' ' ' processes , such as @ xmath15 , except because of scattering of the # ##s . research on the pseudoscalar weak form factor @ xmath16 , which is completely irrelevant for the experimental results , is important because @ xmath16 has pairs of electrons with the same quantum number and , therefore , it is related to the chiral symmetry group . this would allow us , _ e . g . _ , to test the goldberger treiman theorem . the goal of this research is to draw attention of researchers to theand @ xmath1 , a new and improved method for studying the atomic structure . we could use these methods for studying the s ##s ##s effect on the structure of the @ xmath17 resonance of @ xcite . on the other hand , analysis of the nuclear processes @ xmath18 and others with low - energy electrons at the energy level of the dilepton and the resulting energy transfer to the nucleus could give rise to the parton theory as proposed by @ xcite . this section is organized as follows . in sec . ii we present the basic principles for the theoretical treatment of the processes @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , and @ xmath21 . in sec . iii we present our structure - based model for the treatment of these three processes and compare the theoretical results with experimental results . to better describe our model , we present a simplified version of the model , which also describes the effects of the photoproduction and electroproduction . in sec . iv , we present the method of calculating the effective energy scale obtained from low - energy ipe and apply the results of its analysis to analysis of the ipe data on the nucleus . "it is equivalent to calculating the pseudoscalar - scale amplitude from the experimental ipe data , and summary of the results is given . the results , published in ref . , on the calculation of the amplitude , determination of the quasithreshold formula for the multipole effect on the basis of the calculation of the second - order fourier power , and calculation of the transfer function . we study the processes @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , and @ xmath21 in the framework of the unified model . this model is useful because in the two - dimensional case , compared to the @ xmath22 - model , research into these three processes is limited to the study of the interaction @ xmath23 with the electric field @ xmath24 , where @ xmath25 , @ xmath26 , and @ xmath27 correspond to the processes photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe , respectively . this allows us to study all of the ipe processes on the basis of the new experimental data for the electroproduction and photoproduction and to evaluate the validity of the unified model for these three processes . the @ xmath28 -the matrix for the electroproduction of the two -

orbit interactions of spin ,the resonance model . to this end , we use the same principles , including energy , unitarity , and frequency , and the description of the processes @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 , all in the context of the resonance ( or ipe ) model . we use a finite version of the model , which contains the experimental data together with a finite number of terms ( called scale factors ) . this allows us to carry out a simple analytic transformation from the spacelike to timelike version of @ xmath3 . for isovector theory , the pre - @ xmath102 spectral relations without change of the terms are used , with the following relations for the energy terms of the @ xmath103 resonance . the isoscalar processes are described only by the energy terms since the @ xmath103 resonance does not respond to them due to the isospin effect . in a . @ xcite , it was shown that this model was correct . the analysis of the models for the processes electroproduction , photoproduction , and ipe in the high - energy range from the origin up to @ xmat##h104 gev . however , this formula is insufficient for our purpose , namely to apply the method for extraction of the form factor in the timelike domain , for the following reasons . first , in the power - law approach , the spectral lines in the magnetic scattering region are determined by the corresponding magnetic form factor and the phase diagram of the @ xmath7 - and @ xmath105 . this adds to the number of spectral lines , which is not important in the ipe approach . second , in the @ xmath103 approach , the electric @ xmath106 and magnetic @ xmath107 quadrupoles , which ( like the magnetic scattering @ xmath108 ) undergo all of the scattering @ xmath103 , amount to no more than 1 % of @ xmath108 . for example , the photoproduction method @ xcite gives the value @ xmath109 for the @ xmath110 ratio . phenomenological reasons for the @ xmath3 extraction of the @ xmath110 and @ xmath111 ratios are not clear , and depend upon the method of their extraction from electro##production model ( see details of this model in ref . @ xcite , p . 698 ) . however , these values do not change 5 , 10 and 20 % up to @ xmath112 ( gev / c ) @ xmath6 . based on the standard form of ( _ , _ e . g . _ , ref . @ xcite ) , we assume that an equilibrium process takes place , for @ xmath113 , at frequencies up to @ xmath114 vs . small ( gev / c ) @ xmath6 . however , in the first step of our model we observe the quadrupole effect of @ xmath103 , which we consider to be a good approximation for systems with unpolarised frequencies . the standard method of reggeization provides us with values of the # ##s for @ xmath115 and for @ xmath8 @ xcite @ xmath116 however , for the small @ xmath46 - based model , we should use a non - @ xmath102 transfer function with a value of constant frequency for the isovector of @ xmath117and without solving for the corresponding energies , taking into account their fixed points . however , the above relations with the wave functions which describe the magnetic moments of the @ xmath103 electrons work very well even for @ xmath118 \ gev for all the energies @ xmath66 . therefore , we use the 1 - @ xmath102 resonance relation without solving for the resonance frequency @ xcite for the isovector energies @ xmath119 and we use the same formula for the isoscalar amplitude @ xmath120 where @ xmath121 , @ xmath122 \ ; , \ nonumber \ { { 0 } \ ] ] and @ xmath123 \ ; , \ ] ] with the @ xmath7 expression : @ xmath124 and the expression of the expression above : @ xmath125 . the terms @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 correspond only to the term @ xmath117 . note that @ xmath53 and @ xmath54 have the kinematic structure of @ xmath55 . the, these terms are carried out kinematically because these terms transform into the general form of the combination @ xmath128 which is equivalent to @ xmath129 , where @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 are the two dimensions which have been shown to have a kinematic component @ xcite . for the dimension h , the equation @ xmath132 = [ \ ; , \ ] ] which is satisfied by the solution of the combination @ xmath127 ( [ x : c5 ] ) , implies existence of the solution of @ xmath55 . the spectral functions @ xmath133 are used to describe the vanishing moment of the @ xmath103 { @ xmath134 } ~ [ _ { ( s , \ , \ ; ^ \ ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath135 , @ xmath105 is the corresponding spectral function of the @ xmath7 -

[ 1 . [ 1 : 1 -pr - n ] we compare comparison of our model for the differential cross section with @ xmath140 - photoproduction data . [ fig . [ fig : ph - pr - n1 ] we compare comparison with the electroproduction data of the model for the transverse @ xmath141 and longitudinal @ xmath142 regions of the cross section @ xmath143 \ ; . \ ] ] the differential cross sections for the differential electroproduction of electrons in transverse and longitudinal light waves are shown in fig . [ fig : ph - pr - n2 ] . in addition , we have found very good comparison with the differential photoproduction and electroproduction data for unpolarized electrons , especially in the region of the @ xmath103 region ( @ xmath144 gev ) . in the region of the @ xmath140 photoproduction , the results are very good compared to @ xmath13 gev ( @ xmath145 gev ) , see fig . [ fig : ph - pr - n ] . it is possible that our model can be further improved by considering the quadrupole region of the @xmath103 and ( @ xmath146 and @ xmath147 ) in the correlation region . however , a much more simple formulation should include , in addition to the quadrupole states , contributions of the excited states and high - energy ` ` holes ' ' to the absorption parts of the amplitude to give a better analysis of the samples . however , the incorporation of the higher absorption parts of the amplitude into the transition regions of the spectral lines , @ xmath148 for @ xmath149 , makes use of the quasithreshold relation ( derived from the above ) between the transverse and longitudinal multipoles @ xcite for which ` ` hole ' ' multipoles are @ xcite . on the contrary , the expected convergence with the data ( [ fig : ima ] ) is good . however , keeping in mind the limitations of the experimental data , the above - mentioned mathematical formulation seems to be very difficult ( see ref . [ fig : e - pr - 2 ] - [ fig : e - pr - n2 ] ) . application of the theory to the data for ipe is an important application of therelative behavior of the born terms with @ xmath3 and their values in the range of the energy @ xmath150 @ xcite . this relative behavior of the born terms has a time - dependent nature . it is due to the quasithreshold of @ xcite , which means that at the quasithreshold , @ xmath151 , the ipe amplitude is the largest amplitude in the energy range from the surface energy to @ xmath13 gev . this relative behavior of ipe distinguishes it clearly from the photoproduction and electroproduction , where rescattering changes to @ xmath152 . let us consider the quasithreshold nature of the ipe amplitude . at @ xmath153 the multipole moments increase in the same way @ xmath154 but , at @ xmath155 , the transverse ( @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 ) and longitudinal ( @ xmath158 and @ xmath159 ) transitions disappear . in addition , the value of the independent moments decreases to the independent one of the quasithreshold due to the quasithreshold theorem @ xmath16##0 which arises from the conservation ( above ) . the selection rules which arise from the energy conservation and the conservation of the angular momentum of the half - particle , @ xmath161 , assign both side - ##real states of the quasithreshold to the following states : @ xmath162 , _ etc . _ ] and @ xmath163 , _ etc . details of the multipole analyses of @ xmath164 and @ xmath153 and the quasithreshold region among them are given in appendix a . since the @ xmath46 - and @ xmath165 - and @ xmath7 states are stable at energies above 1 . 5 gev , we can assume that the states @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 are dominated by the born terms at this energy . this is in agreement with the multipole analysis of the quantum photoproduction and also by the time - amplitude analysis of @ xmath166 . we can , therefore , assume that in the quasithreshold region , the ipe state is dominated by the born terms with energies greater than @ xmath167 . in thefor @ xmath168 gev , we can write for the quasithreshold ipe @ xmath169 . \ { { 0 } \ ] ] in the above example , however , we can only write for the quasithreshold , and , therefore , the compensation curve ( see below ) is used . by considering the initial conditions of the system for calculating the form factor , the ` ` compensation curve ' ' @ xcite can obtain . the curves are defined at points in the @ xmath170 plane at which the born cross section is affected only by the correction function . these curves can be obtained by combining photoproduction coefficient data with the born cross section and using the compensation theorem for compensation curves ( more details of the compensation curves are given in appendix 2 ) . the method of obtaining the differential form factor from low - energy ipe is , therefore , based on combining the quasithreshold model , the linear non - compensation curve , and the compensation curve . this method has been successfully used in the experiments on the electrons and in @ xmath4c and @ xmath5li @ xcite . .

[ id = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " ^ " , ] in table [ tab1 ] , we have tables of the different form factors observed in experiments on the surface . in table . [ tab1 ] , the same experimental errors are found for @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 because in this @ xmath3 - region these form factors can be related with each other via the spectral function and the region @ xmath173 . the quantity @ xmath174 , observed from the experimental region @ xcite , has a much higher experimental uncertainty than the experimental regions @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 . this is shown by observation of experiments with the same uncertainty in the spectral function of @ xmath174 which , however , is represented by the single - photon quantity observed in the region @ xmath175 . we can see that this uncertainty is not time - dependent . thus the same experimental uncertainty can be found for @ xmath##171 and @ xmath172 . of course , for high - quality data for ipe one needs to consider the interactions of @ xmath171 with @ xmath172 when determining these parameters . the interactions of @ xmath171 are not consistent with the formulation of the fundamental field theory in terms of the theory and the real - valued field theory @ xcite . let us look at the problem of determining the form factor @ xmath176 of the @ xmath177 vertex at @ xmath178 . whereas the measurement of the scattering cross section for the electroproduction with unpolarised electrons in the @ xmath12 region of @ xmath179 and of the surrounding region allows one to obtain information about the form factor of the @ xmath177 vertex , this information is not very useful for ipe because the value of the coupling operator which generates @ xmath180 in the quasithreshold is not known for the values of @ xmath3 . it turns out that the position of the @ xmath181 ( [ x _ 1 ] ) in the dilepton region of the quasithresholdgive us that formula . we consider the term @ xmath93 , corresponding to the term @ xmath181 . this can be converted to follows : @ xmath182 is the quasithreshold with factors into account : ( [ f _ 1 - f _ i ] ) , ( [ t - k - expantion ] ) and ( [ gk - expansion ] ) @ xmath183 the second part of the original term [ s . ( [ t _ k - expansion ] ) @ xmath184 _ { { \ bf k } = 0 } \ ; , \ ] ] is zero near the quasithreshold . it follows from the formula ( [ r - thr - constr ] ) . contributions of @ xmath93 for @ xmath153 , and @ xmath185 where @ xmath186 _ { \ bf k = 0 } . \ ] ] in the @ xmath103 series , the terms @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 are given by the real part , and the imaginary parts of the terms are ignored . contributions of @ xmath106 and@ xmath187 corresponds to less than 1 % of that of @ xmath108 . multipole moments @ xmath188 and @ xmath187 , due to the strength of the @ xmath189 term , would have to be very large , as it is important in terms of photoproduction ( absorption of the light ) . thus , with very high precision , we estimate @ xmath190 since the quasithreshold properties ( [ gk - 1 ] ) have to be fully developed in a very short time for @ xmath3 , the term @ xmath181 has to be reduced to @ xmath191 in the @ xmath103 region . the calculation of @ xmath181 would , therefore , allow us to test against the assumptions of the nature of the weak field , and to obtain information about the behavior of @ xmath176 and @ xmath113 . this is possible because the reduction of the background part of the term to @ xmath93 is strongly correlated in the quasithreshold region , the background part reduces to @ xmath192 for @ xmat##h182 = 0 . now let us consider a simple method of calculating the effective band gap due to the approximate induced phase factor described by the equation [ @ xmath193 \ x _ 5u ( x _ 1 ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath194 is the wave - function , , and @ xmath195 and @ xmath196 are the induced and the pseudoscalar phase factors , respectively . an extended formulation of ipe which includes the complex icc , pcac , and icc allows one to prove the potential - energy dependence of the poles , @ xmath197 and @ xmath198 , due to the approximate chiral ##ity and @ xmath199 amplitude . calculation of the continuum contribution at the quasithreshold extends this solution up to @ xmath13 gev @ xcite with the continuum contribution being exactly the same as in the density - matrix formulation . thus , one has for the longitudinal component of the @ xmath200 amplitude at the quasithreshold , and the transverse components are @ xmath201 @ xcite , so that @ xmath202 \bigr \ } , \ { { \ } \ ] ] where the values of the @ xmath203 and @ xmath204 are given as @ xmath205 , @ xmath206 , and the quasithreshold values of the decay products @ xmath207 @ xmath208 as observed in these experiments , first of all , @ xmath209 and @ xmath210 . it is possible to obtain all this from @ xmath211 however , it is impossible to obtain the results of @ xmath16 from these experiments since its contribution to cross section is kinematically suppressed ( it is suppressed by the real number ) . in the @ xmath14 - capture and @ xmath212 - capture experiments , there is a kinematically suppressed decay value of @ xmath8 , @ xmath213 , from which the decay product values can be obtained , but with a small error . for example , the value obtained from measurements of the @ xmath14 - capture by the @ xcite is @ xmath214 . @ xmath16 has also been used in the analysis of the sample .@ xmath215si ##m @ xcite . # ( [ long . fig : ca ] ) note that the kinematic component of the @ xmath16 amplitude is different when the ipe data on the quasithreshold is used for calculating @ xmath16 . in this way , the pseudoscalar value of @ xmath216 can be calculated in the range corresponding to @ xmath217 ( which corresponds to @ xmath13 gev ) . using the quasithreshold values , we can overcome the many difficulties that are encountered when applying the analytical method to the analysis of electroproduction processes . first we shall perform the steps of integration . first , using the @ xmath218 and @ xmath219 values used for the analysis of the ipe data on the surface @ xcite , we choose the data points for the remaining components of the @ xmath220 amplitude of the quasithreshold . these data points , which can be considered as valid values , are shown in fig . [ long : ca - exp ] . for @ xmath216 we obtain the following values without error : @ xmath##221 the energy at the point @ xmath222 is given by the pcac term . when only the @ xmath223 - pole term is used for @ xmath16 , the result is consistent with the experimental results as shown in fig .

( [ g _ p : dr ] ) should be zero . this could be determined by the interaction of two , one - , and two electrons with the same quantum number . however , since the contribution of the three - electron state can be determined by the chemical shift , it is , however , possible to calculate the integral of ( [ g _ p : dr ] ) using the 3 - pole term . a similar result is obtained if one uses the following formula for @ xmath216 with the following values of and : @ xmath224 where @ xmath225 , the @ xmath226 beta - decay coefficient @ xmath227 is defined as @ xmath228 , and @ xmath229 and @ xmath230 are the decay coefficients of the @ xmat##h223 and @ xmath226 interact with the threshold , respectively . as seen from the effect of the anti - nuclear force , one would expect that @ xmath231 to be the effect of the case ( in contrast to the strong effect ) in which the proton concentration is equal for all the ##s . this tendency is observed in some cases with the nonlocality which suggests chiral symmetry of @ xcite . note that the pole of @ xmath232 in fig . ( [ 1 _ 1 ] ) , although much smaller than the poles of the two stable states @ xmath233 and @ xmath234 , is useful for comparing the two experimental results of ipe . in fig . [ 1 : 1 - 2 ] we obtain the value @ xmath235 by comparison with the values obtained by @ xmath14 - type of the @ xcite and the analysis of data from the @ xmath236 electroproduction on the surface of the solid @ xcite . the error lines : the error lines indicate that the values of @ xmath216 obtained by this method are of poor quality . one can see that the value of. . @ xcite agrees with the n - particle interaction hypothesis in a narrow range of energies , unlike our model in which the hypothesis is valid only in the channel @ xmath102 state , whereas in the range the number of particles is infinite . note that the contributions of the n - particles , @ xmath233 and @ xmath234 , which are completely absent from this state , are small and their presence would only slightly affect the parameters of @ xmath237 . the parameters of this new state , ( [ x _ n ] ) would have changed very much if we compared the channel @ xmath238 with the previously observed channel @ xmath239 @ xcite , due to the strong multichannel nature of this state . in this case , the hypothesis would be false that the state with @ xmath240 in the range 400 - 800 mev is sufficient for describing the new ipe state . let us assume that the radial emission of the first particle of this isotriplet was observed in the @ xmath241 channel @ xcite and interpreted as the first radial emission of the particle in the direction of the heavy .and @ xcite based on the tree approximation for two - dimensional systems . using this formula for @ xmath242 and extending the formula for the @ xmath226 weak - interaction energy in the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model up to the weak interaction energy with a known mass , @ xmath243 mev , we obtain @ xmath244 . there are no exact numerical values for this coupling constant however . in the njl model , the description of the exchange of holes requires introducing some nonlocality . since a precise evaluation of the @ xmath7 coupling constant in that approximation requires it to go beyond the limits of the tree approximation and take the ##holes into the @ xcite , it follows that a correct interpretation of @ xmath245 in that approximation does not justify introducing some nonlocality . of course , a more accurate interpretation of @ xmath226 requires consideration of the interactions with @ xmath226 . consideration of this symmetry would also raise the question of the su ( 2 ) symmetry . a precise ( approximate ) evaluation of the gauge symmetry is , therefore , necessary for this particular model . we have tothat a systematic analysis of ipe is necessary for obtaining all the information about the physical properties of particles in the full - @ xmath0 - region of the timelike region of @ xmath3 and the corresponding weak structure in the spacelike region . the latter is used by _ , _ e . g . _ , in connection with determination of the quantum structure of the atomic ( _ , _ e . g . _ , @ xcite ) and quasinuclear states @ xmath246 and @ xcite . analysis of the experimental ipe data in the full @ xmath7 - region allows us to determine the values of the scale of @ xmath171 and timelike region of @ xmath3 which are all consistent with the results in the form of the classical - n - d - scale @ xcite . the first step that is necessary for the determination of the weak structure of non - interacting particles in the timelike @ xmath3 - region is a multipole analysis of ipe similar to that for the photoproduction and electroproduction , _ e . g . _ @ xcite . at first , with the available light beams being ., it is possible to conduct experiments aimed at carrying out that goal . for the study of the neutron - pole amplitude of the second and third @ xmath7 ##li ##s , the multichannel nature of the nuclear interaction can be taken into account , _ e . g . _ , by the definition of # . @ xcite and by the two interaction parameters @ xcite . as we have mentioned , our data is useful for the study of the neutron - induced dilepton effect between the neutron and atomic nuclei . it is worth making some assumptions about the nature of the interaction of the @ xmath5li beam with the @ xmath236 beam at 1 mev / s @ xcite . the atomic spin model of the interaction has shown that about half of the events are related to the part of the interaction which are determined by the mechanism + @ xmath247 . + in all this data it is shown that the ##sion - pole amplitude is determined by the neutron - induced spin , and the other half ( the wave function of the @ xmath248 ) is determined by the nuclear spin of @ xcite . the remaining events relate to the nuclear+ @ xmath249 . + when both the reactions were performed ( with and without fission of the nucleus ) , the cross section on the nucleus was found to be additively correlated with the cross section on the individual nuclei and these factors were taken into account via experiment . in both cases , our model was correct for the ipe on the individual nuclei . the experimental results for @ xmath171 are therefore completely consistent with the results described above . @ xcite . in the case of the reaction without fission of the nucleus , we observed only the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus in the timelike @ xmath3 region for the first time . however , in the second case , the information about the electronic structure of the nucleus in the timelike region was lost . therefore , it appears at present that there is no reliable description of the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus in the timelike region . a reliable description must take into account both the electronic parts of the nucleus ( and the nuclear electronic structure ) and more complex ( than the usual ) nuclear interaction effects . however , it should be noted that a fully accurate description of the reaction + @ xmath250 involves solving a number of problems , includingtheoretical and experimental . in the pseudoscalar model , states of higher energies are possible , as for @ xmath251 , the @ xmath252 and @ xmath253 glueballs , @ xmath254 electrons , and multiquark systems . however , all the experimental and theoretical results give values of those quantum states of less than 1 gev . however , the most interesting occurrence of @ xmath250 seems to be the highly excited electron states . the authors are grateful to n . a . gerasimov , v . a . meshcheryakov , and a . a . pontecorvo for their support and contributions in this paper . yu . s . acknowledges the support provided by the votruba -

dimensional solution of the compensation curves with @ xmath3 as a parameter . consider the point @ xmath25 in more detail . we shall use @ xmath336 instead of the @ xmath102 , where @ xmath84 is a positive constant in the r . p . r . if the solution takes time , then in the plane @ xmath337 we ought to find the compensation curve @ xmath338 ##4 in the physical region . roughly speaking , there can be several solutionsof this follows , because the function @ xmath339 can also be written as a polynomial in terms of @ xmath340 : @ xmath341 and the function @ xmath342 can have positive square roots @ xmath343 . however , due to the assumptions stated above , the polynomials do not exist , since no one photon can pass through the same angle . in the case of the experimental photoproduction , the born terms are used to define the compensation curve @ xcite . to this end , it is possible to identify all the corresponding points of the electric born cross section with the electric born cross section and place these points in the curves @ xmath337 and @ xmath344 . in fig . [ 2 : 1 - curv ] the compensation curves for the experimental differential photoproduction are shown . in the born cross section , we take into account the interaction of the electron beam with the surface . however , in these curves the born cross sections are not affected by the electric born term . we can see that at low energies , the compensation curves pass through different angles in accordance with the electric born term ( ebm ) @ xcite . the compensation curves show also that thecontribution of ebm to the cross section corresponds to the same energy spectrum , but at the same frequency , giving a more complete and accurate picture . of course , there are also compensation curves corresponding to the measured scattering energy . however , if one assumes that for each of the observed electroproduction and ipe , when @ xmath166 , the compensation curves are not significantly different from the compensation curves for the photoproduction @ xmath345 , then for these , the standard error of both of the curves should be zero . in the resonance region , this assumption would be incorrect if the emission of @ xmath3 does not contribute to the phase change of the helicity ( or multipole ) and of the structure of the first resonance . in the second resonance region , measurements , _ e . g . _ , of the quantum mechanics , which agree with the results of the theoretical analysis ( _ e . g . _ @ xcite ) and with the results of the phenomenological analysis of the electroproduction process ( _ e . g . _ @ xcite ) , show a complete picture of the first resonance structure of the @ xmath103 , with the exception of@ xmath346 . # ##s compared this expression to that of @ xmath178 . using our new formula , it was found that the compensation curve @ xmath347 is identical with @ xmath3 for the cross section of the state @ xmath348 with the same energy level of @ xmath349 gev @ xmath350 . this result was confirmed by the formula @ xcite for the timelike behavior of @ xmath3 : @ xmath351 . in the second and third order cases , the analysis of the data for electroproduction ( _ e . g . _ @ xcite ) showed a significant difference ( with @ xmath352 ) of the helicity curve for the case of magnetic fields , which is not significant except for @ xmath353 . the compensation curves exist only for the states of the neutral state produced by the processes @ xmath354 - _ @ xmath355 / [ d { \ sigma } _ { \ perp } / dt + d { \ sigma } _ { \ sigma } / dt ] \ ; . \ ]] for example , at @ xmath356 gev the reaction of @ xmath357 ( [ x - asym ] ) takes place at @ xmath358 for the @ xmath359 photoproduction . since at high energies and small @ xmath360 ebm ( with a mathematical model of the small forward peak of @ xmath361 for the @ xmath359 photoproduction ) describes the shape and size of @ xmath362 at the forward peak , the compensation curves for @ xmath362 at the critical point go to exactly the same shape of the small @ xmath363 and for @ xmath364 . this phenomenon is described by # ##ically . the possibility of assuming that the compensation curves at high energies and small @ and small @ xmath166 are not significantly different from the compensation curves for @ xmath25 is confirmed by the application of ebm to the study of the mechanism of electroproduction and @ xmath365 at low energies and @ xmath366 @ xcite . in this way , the compensation curves allow us to determine the optimal initial conditions for studying the mechanism of @ x##math367 and @ xmath368 in terms of the _ electroproduction and ipe . m . amaldi , m . fubini , m . furlan , _ electroproduction at high energies and @ ##ic _ _ , selected papers in theoretical physics * 48 * ( springer , berlin , 1979 ) . surovtsev , yu . s . tkebuchava , yad . fiz . * 55 * , 2138 ( 1992 ) . blokhintseva , yu . s . surovtsev , a . nagy , acta physica slovaca * 55 * , 351 ( 1999 ) . titov , m . kmpfer , eur . rev . a * 8 * , 217 ( 2001 ) . berger , m . diehl , m . pire , phys . a * 523 * , 265 ( 2001 ) . lutz , m . friman , m . soyeur , nucl . a * 713 * , 265 ( 2003 ) . bratkovskaya , m . cassing , m . mosel , nucl . a * 686 * , 568 ( 2001 ) . geffen , phys . rev . * 8 * ,1745 ( 1962 ) ;
