in the field of physics , the stability level of a system or configuration is one of the main research topics . such systems or configurations are usually not realizable in nature and they are usually an intermediate stage in the dynamic evolution of the universe . a black hole problem in general relativity can also be put in the previously mentioned way : the question that asks us is whether a black hole which is unstable has a limit , i . e . if we observe the black hole from within , whether it goes back to its initial state after some time or whether the energy disappears , making the black hole unstable . the question of black hole stability remains an extremely important one which has enormous influence on the recent discovery of the black hole @ xcite . in physics , the dynamic evolution of states of the black hole background can be divided into two stages , the first of which consists of an infinite level of energy , depending only on the initial free energy , the second stage consists of damped energy , known in the literature as the quasinormal mode ( qnm ) whose value turns out to be a real number , the real part representing the energy , and the imaginary part representing the. qn frequencies also depend on the mode and not on the field which is causing the coupling and thus provide important information to these fields which are used to determine the black hole parameters ( mass , energy and angular momentum ) . the coupling has a fish - tail effect at very short wavelengths . the equations describing the black hole parameters in all of the cases can be put into the schrdinger - type form . the qnms are solutions to the wave equation with constant coefficients with a boundary condition which is completely ingoing at the origin and completely vanishing at asymptotic infinity . with the recent experimental observation of the gravitational field @ xcite the interest in the black hole parameters has added another dimension . apart from the fact that the qn ##ms provide important information about the black hole parameters , they were also found to be important from the point of view of ads / cft physics . it has been shown that qnms in real space - time arise naturally in the framework of the general conformal field theory of the universe @ xcite , thus extending the study of qnms towards the black holes @ xcite . although the qnms are theoretical in nature , they have been shown to be solutions to theevolution of black holes @ xcite . thus , in the above case we would be working on the second of the above two models of evolution of black hole formation in a regular black hole system in the de - space - time . the importance of studying black holes in de - space lies in the fact that our universe looked like a black hole in both early and recent times . the observational data strongly suggest that our universe is going through a process of gravitational evolution @ xcite , thereby suggesting the possibility of a positive gravitational constant . in fact de - space turns out to be a perfectly consistent solution to the vacuum einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant . just like the ds / cft correspondence , a strong ds / cft correspondence exists between theories of de - space and conformal field theory on the boundary of 3 - dimension @ xcite . looking back to the nature and evolution of black holes in de - space , there have been a number of studies @ xcite - @ xcite . quasinormal ##ity of wave , vector , gravitational , gravitational fields , physics of elementary particles , etc .##normal ##ization , and addition of complex numbers etc . on one hand , it is well known that general relativity is concerned with the avoidance of singular . the problem of avoiding the singular in general relativity , however , is one of the most important , and it is a very difficult one . in this case , ` ` regular black hole ' ' may play a key role . when a black hole does not have a space - time boundary at the core , it is described as a ` ` regular black hole ' ' in the literature . the first solutions of the regular black hole with non - singular geometry and the strong interaction theory were proposed by z @ xcite , which is also known as the regular black hole . however , the solution they proposed lacked physical motivation because the solution was not a physical solution , so it was modified by using some theory of gravity and by introducing the energy momentum tensor into the einstein field equations . the modification of the energy - momentum tensor was done in an _ ad hoc _ way . years later , ayn - beato and garca @ xcite proposed the energy momentum tensor to describe the gravitational action of a magnetic monopole arising out of a specific theory of non - singular electrodynamics . however , many other theories@ xcite - @ xcite , and the avoidance of gravity was published in the paper . there are several papers published on regular regular black holes : stability theory @ xcite , qnms @ xcite , dynamics @ xcite and the dynamics @ xcite of regular black holes to name a few . most recently fernando @ xcite has proposed a de novo model for the regular regular black hole and introduced the # ##ness parameter for such a black hole . in this paper , we will be studying the qnms of the van de sitter ( or einstein ) black hole background to einstein ( both massless and massive ) and other fields . although study of the field theories in the black hole background and the associated qnms is not easy , the dirac field theories , on the other hand , are much better understood . therefore , apart from the field theories , it will also be possible to study the field theories in the regular black hole background and de novo branches . the structure of the paper is as follows : in the first section we will discuss the regular black hole . in section .we have a brief discussion of wkb , along with a discussion of the local qnms of the local black hole . section 4 deals with the local quasinormal ##ity of the local black hole . finally , in section 5 we conclude the paper with a brief discussion of recent developments . in this section , we will also discuss the van de jong ( 2006 ) black hole and the work of fernando @ xcite . the author of this paper uses the results of @ xcite to find a new coupling term for the equation : @ xmath0 where @ xmath1 is the ricci tensor and @ xmath2 is part of the field strength tensor of the non - linear electrodynamics @ xmath3 and the coupling is given by @ xmath4 in the equation , the action @ xmath5 is related to the gravitational field and the mass of the black hole in the following way : @ xmath6 . if one uses the equations of motion from the above equation ( [ 1 ] ) , the following equation can be solved : @ xmath7 it is shown by @ xcite that a unique and symmetric solutions for the above set of equations are: @ xmath8 with @ xmath9 and with @ xmath10 the sum of @ xmath11 is the horizon and in the special case of a black hole there will be two real roots of two horizons : the black hole inner and outer horizons together with the horizon horizon . there is the possibility of having only one real root corresponding to one horizon horizon for a set of parameters of this universe and the sum of two real roots corresponding to the sum of the inner and outer black hole horizons for a set of parameters @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 . thus the ads black hole is similar to the reissner - nordstrm - de ##hn ( rnds ) and born - infeld d * ( ads ) black holes which also have the possibility of two horizon horizons as well as a single single degenerate root . however , it is shown by @ xcite that the physical dimension is smaller in the case of rnds black holes compared to the ads one . the fundamental property of this theory is a non - uniform curvature tensor . it can be shown by direct calculation that all the surface curvatures @ xmath1 , @ xmath14, @ xmath15 is finite , except for the vector field of @ xmath16 which is finite and @ xmath17 @ xcite . in this case we can use the massless and the vector field equations of the corresponding black hole geometry to determine the properties of the qnms in the comparison with the corresponding white hole geometry . as shown in figure 2 , einstein ' s is given by , ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) . the klein - gordon metric for the massless vector field @ xmath18 is @ xmath19 which also has the coordinate @ xmath20 as before , we obtain the ansatz for @ xmath18 where , @ xmath21 with the same ansatz , we obtain the corresponding schrdinger - maxwell field equation for the variation of the standard norm for the vector field is given by @ xmath22 where , @ xmath23 . the coordinate @ xmath24 is the standard spherical coordinate corresponding to the coordinates @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . the advantage of using the radial coordinate lies in the fact that the value ofthe region defined lies from @ xmath27 to @ xmath28 , whereas in the same radial coordinate @ xmath25 , the region defined now lies between the black hole and outer horizon . note also that the coordinates @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . it can be easily shown by plotting the magnetic field strength against the radial coordinate ( ) for different values of the multipole moment @ xmath31 that the @ xmath32 mode has a large energy gap between the black hole outer horizon and the inner horizon ( see fig . 2 ) , which is also pointed out in @ xcite . for this reason , the method used in this article to evaluate the qnms for the real black holes , namely , the wkb method is not a valid method to evaluate qnms for @ xmath32 modes . therefore , from now on , we will only talk about @ xmath33 modes for the massless complex qnms of real black holes . as previously mentioned , we can solve the differential equation for the qn ##ms non - directly , using the second generation wkb method used in @ xcite . it has been shown already in 2010 thatwkb method works particularly well for high qn energies . the fourth order wkb method is more efficient than the third order method and the method in general gives results more consistent with those obtained from the fourier analysis of the wave function @ xcite for high energies , i . e . for fields with large imaginary parts , and for large multipole moments @ xmath34 . the fourth order method for the maximum black hole potential @ xmath35 is given in @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 is the frequency of @ xmath35 , @ xmath38 , @ xmath39 is the frequency of the peak frequency corresponding to the peak of the potential @ xmath35 and @ xmath40 is the peak frequency . qn frequency @ xmath41 would be of the maximum @ xmath42 . the equation ( [ qnmeqn ] ) , @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 are given in @ xcite @ xmath45 \ \ \ r _ 3 = & \ frac { ( 1 + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } ) } { 2v ^ { ' ' } ( r _ 3 ) } \} [ \ frac { 1 } { 6912 } \ left ( \ frac { v _ 0 ^ { ( 4 ) } } { v ^ { ' ' } ( r _ 0 ) } \ right ) ^ 2 ( 77 + 188b ^ 2 ) \ nonumber \ \ & -

\ frac { 1 } { 288 } \ left ( \ frac { r _ 2 ^ { ( 1 ) } } { r ^ { ' ' } ( r _ 1 ) } \ right ) ( [ + 4b ^ 2 ) \ } ] . \ { { [ } \ ] ] . the corresponding table @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 will be found in the appendix of @ xcite . the above method also works very well for the eikonal ##ization of re @ xmath31 relative to the random samples , which will also be found in the appendix . in eqn ( [ qnmeqn ] ) , we computed the qnms and then we computed re @ xmath41 and values of i m @ xmath41 and body ##body # . both re @ xmath41 and i m @ xmath41 increase when re @ xmath52 is used . in table 2 , we computed the values of the qn ##ms derived from the fifth order and sixth order wkb values for thethe results @ xmath53 and @ xmath54 . the data from the above shows that the value of the real part of the result shows a steady increase from the 3rd order method . on the other hand , the corresponding real part obtained by 5th order wkb method shows a steady decrease when compared to the third order method . p3cmp3cmp3 . 5cmp3 . 5 = multipole method & + & 5th order wkb & 6th order wkb + + @ xmath31 = 1 & n = 1 & 0 . 300446 -

time is compact , locally symmetric and locally flat . also a non - trivial example of non - asymptotically flat near - extremal schwarzschild space ##hn black hole space ##time is also given in this article . the same result can be obtained in case of compact black holes . in the case of near - extremal schwarz##riai for massive black holes where either the black hole horizon and the inner horizon merge or the inner and outer horizon merge . in these cases , it may be useful to write the eikonal solution of the wkb equation as @ xcite . for a gravitational field the inverse gordon equation is given as @ xmath61 where @ xmath62 is the field strength . in , we have the ansatz parameter ##ization parameter ( [ ansatz ] ) and in , we have the schrdinger - gordon equation and the effective potential as @ xmath63 where the potential as @ xmath24 is equal to @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . in , we have the effective potential @ xmath64 ( @ xmath25 ) vs @ xmath25 for different mass masses ( @ xmath62 ) . we have chosen the coordinates @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 vs @ xmath25 for different masses ( @ xmath62 ) , [ = 302 ] note that the value of the parameter depends .the mean field mass @ xmath62 with the parameters and . since qnms are assumed to be the modes emitted at the surface of this object @ xcite . as shown in @ xcite , we found the results for large black holes that the imaginary part of the quasinormal modes emitted will increase for small @ xmath62 . however , the real part of qnms will decrease as @ xmath62 increases . for and , we have calculated the ratio of imaginary and real parts of @ xmath41 versus mean field mass @ xmath69 for large scale number of : @ xmath13 , @ xmath52 , @ xmath56 and @ xmath70 . we have used all the results obtained from 3rd , 4th , 5th and 6th order wkb calculations , to calculate the difference between the calculations . we found from the plots of the im ( @ xmath41 ) and im ( @ xmath41 ) that for small scale numbers @ xmath40 , the difference between 3rd and 5th order wkb is not very significant but for large @ xmath40 it is significant . therefore , the plot of im ( @ xmat##h41 ) decreases with increasing field strength as well , on the contrary , the magnitude of im ( @ xmath41 ) increases with increasing field strength . in table 1 , we list the possible values of qn ##ms with the parameters . since it is now known that wkb model is not valid for @ xmath71 , we have calculated the qnms values for @ xmath71 instead . [ parameters = " < , < , < , < " , parameters = " > " , ] [ ... ] . for massless model , we put re and the magnitude of qn ##ms with @ xmath13 and @ xmath56 for @ xmath57 and @ xmath72 respectively . im ( @ xmath41 ) increases with increasing amount of electric field @ xmath56 while that of im ( @ xmath41 ) decreases . this behaviour of qnms can be easily estimated from the height of the peak . since the height of the peak peak increases with @ xmath56 , the overall behaviour of qnms decreases . on the other hand , note that im ( @ xmath41 ) decreases with the increase in the constant ( @xmath13 ) i im ( @ xmath41 ) increases with @ xmath13 in general . but if we consider the change of height with @ xmath13 the energy increases , and i im ( @ xmath41 ) increases . thus , we can solve for large mass density with the same wave function , the particles decay faster with large mass density @ xmath13 and decay faster for large electric field @ xmath56 . in this case , we will extend our analysis to massless wave equations for massive black holes . starting from @ xcite , and starting from the equation for spherical symmetric cosmic rays , the schrdinger - schmidt model we have looked for is given by @ xmath73 where @ xmath24 is the spatial momentum given by @ xmath74 , @ xmath75 is the energy . the total mass is given by @ xmath76 it is worth noting here that the coordinates @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 corresponding to the particles and non - particles are supersymmetric to each other and .from the second superpotential @ xmath79 . we can compute the quasinormal mass by solving for [ [ sc1 ] ] with values @ xmath77 . it is now shown that the classical particles and quasi - particles have the same non - classical modes @ xcite . in , we showed the variation of the total mass ( @ xmath77 ##9 ) for different black holes with different symmetry @ xmath70 for ( @ xmath80 ) and @ xmath25 for different values of @ xmath31 for the massless [ particle , n = 226 ] we also calculated the massless mass qnms semi - directly using first order wkb methods . the results are shown below . in , we showed the variation of real and imaginary parts of @ xmath41 with a constant @ xmath13 and in , the variation with magnetic charge @ xmath56 for different values of @ xmath31 with different radio frequencies is shown . we can also see from the plot that mass ( @ xmath41 ) only increases with the change in the magnetic charge @ xmath56 of the same black holewhereas it slowly decreases with the mass of @ xmath13 . whereas the value of the real part of the constant plays its role , i . e . if we increase the gravitational field , the imaginary part of , however , slowly decreases if we increase the gravitational field , keeping the other part constant . in this way , we have studied the massless and the total mass ##less and the massless fermionic parameters for a single massive black hole . we have used first generation wkb ##d measurements to estimate the qnms frequencies . we showed how the frequencies vary as a function of the gravitational field strength ( @ xmath62 ) , multipole moment ( @ xmath31 ) as well as with the parameters of the gravitational constant ( @ xmath13 ) , black hole mass ( @ xmath52 ) and magnetic moment ( @ xmath56 ) . we found that the qn ##ms increase with the increase in black hole mass @ xcite . the comparison of r versus the total mass showed that r @ xmath41 increases with m @ xmath62 and that re @ xmath41 decreases . the authors have found that ifwe study the range from low to high . taking into account the wkb values , we see that the amplitude is higher for @ xmath81 . we also see that m @ xmath41 increases with the increase in the constant @ xmath13 for magnetic ( both massless and massive ) fields as well as with small amplitude . the m @ xmath41 decreases for massless and fermionic cases respectively , except for the massive case when @ xmath13 is large . we have also studied the effect of how the g - factor for the massless magnetic field varies with @ xmath13 and @ xmath56 . for massive magnetic fields , we see that m @ xmath62 increases the field strength and decreases the amplitude for m @ xmath13 , unlike in the massless case where it is increasing the amplitude . in all the above cases the amplitude of the m @ xmath41 increases along with the amplitude ( @ xmath56 ) and the amplitude given by the m @ xmath41 is . for further research , it would be useful to .the time evolution of mass for this particular black hole . apart from that , in @ xcite , the authors have used the conformal properties of the spinor modes to determine the corresponding qnms for the two dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole . they have interpreted these results in the context of the so - called split electron theory , where electrons and holes rest on separate branes in order to determine their properties . the split electron theory can have massive components in the universe and it may be useful to understand the massive quantum changes in the behavior of higher - dimensional models of the same black hole . spphys kokkotas a , and ##o , p 1999 _ string theory . * 26 * _ nollert b - p 1999 _ math . _ grav . _ * 26 * r159 berti a , cardoso a and starinets a . 2009 _ math . quant . grav . _ * _ * 163001 konoplya a , and zhidenko a 2011 _ math . math . phys . _ * _ * 793 -
