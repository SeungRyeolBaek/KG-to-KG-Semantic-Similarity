As well, a geodesic flow in a given direction on a translated surface induces on a transverse segment an interval-equal flow map. Interval-equal flows are closely related to abelian differentials on riemann surfaces. more recently, avila, gouzel and yoccoz proved the exponential decay of correlations for the teichmller geodesic flow, as well as a renormalization of the rauzy-veech induction (see @ xcite). avila and viana, with combinatorics of rauzy-veech induction, proved the simplicity of the essential part of the lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic flow on the strata of abelian differentials (see @ xcite). Furthermore, the rauzy-veech induction (like the Euclidean algorithm) provides a discrete model for the teichmller geodesic flow (see @ xcite). in the last thirty years, many new experiments have been conducted on the dynamical transformation of intervals, which is closely related to billiards in rational polygons, to measured foliations on surfaces, to the study of teichmller geometry and dynamics, etc. avila, gouzel, and yoccoz proved the exponential decay of correlations for the teichmller geodesic flow, also using a renormalization of the teichmller geometry and dynamics . – We all know that – the duality of abelian differentials is one of the special orbifolds of high codimension in the entire space of the tangent bundle. From this point of view the strata of duality represent special orbifolds of large dimensions in the total space of the tangent bundle. – the lokhmller dynamical and geometry of the esotropical differentials. We have been interested in the lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic flow. Kontsevich and zorich have performed a series of computer experiments with linear involutions of quadratic differentials (see xcite): these experiments indicated the presence of attractors for the rauzy – ag induction, and examples of generalized permutations such that the corresponding linear involutions are minimal for a domain of parameters of positive measure and non-critical for a domain of parameters of positive measure (detaining this type of permutation in Fig. – ag: ag: 2ii) and fig. – ag: 2ii, Fig. – 2 in appendix – xmath2 – but at this point no combinatorial explanation was given. So, in order to generalize technique of rauzy-veech induction to quadratic differentials in a consistent way, one had to find combinatorial criteria that enabled the identification of generalized permutations, which belong to attractors and those that represent cross sections of vertical foliations of quadratic differentials. There were also some difficulties in distinguishing those generalized permut What is more, the interval exchange transformation is encoded by combinatorial data (permutation @ xmath3 on xmath4 elements) and by continuous data (lengths @ xmath5). These data, therefore, can be interpreted as a dynamic system, on a finite dimension of interval exchange maps. the behavior of the orbit of the induction provides important information on the dynamics of the interval exchange transformation, representing the starting point. Note that the property of the keane-law (see below) is a criterion of “irrationality” (in particular, minimality) of an interval exchange transformation. On the other hand, the irrational interval exchange maps are precisely those which are cross sections of minimal vertical flows on well-defined, transverse intervals. for a given irreducible permutation of the keane-law, the subset of parameters which form the interval exchange transform which fulfils the keane-law is complete, and is therefore a complete Lebesgue measure. Note that the behavior of the orbit of the induction gives important information on the dynamics of the interval exchange transformation, representing the starting point. Note that the renormalized induction process, which is recurrent with respect to the Lebesgue measure, is recurrent with respect to the Lebesgue measure (and even ergodic by the theorem of veech) . A generalized permutation of type xmath16 (with xmath17) is a two-to-one map of xmath16 to an alphabet xmath19. a generalized permutation is called irreducible if there is a linear involution associated with this generalized permutation, which represents an appropriate cross-section of the vertical foliation of some quadratic differential. a generalized permutation is called irreducible if there exists a linear involution associated with this generalized permutation, which represents an appropriate cross-section of the vertical foliation of some quadratic differential. a generalized permutation is called dynamically irreducible if there is a minimal linear involution associated with this generalized permutation. we are about to describe a procedure that associates to each generalized permutation an open subset in the parameter space of the system of linear inequalities determined by @xmath3 . . . as above, a linear involution is encoded by combinatorial data ( generalized permutation ') and by continuous data . if xmath3 is dynamically irreducible, then for almost all feasible parameters xmath6 the linear involution is satisfied by the keane’s property, and thus is minimal. Let t be a linear involution on a unit interval, and let us consider a sequence of iterations by the renormalized rauzy-veech induction defined on the set xmath27. the renormalized rauzy-veech induction, defined on the set xmath27, is recurrent. note that the geometry of the rauzy graphs is very different and more complicated than that of true’ permutations, for for some irreducible generalized permutations, one of the rauzy operations is not defined. — note that the geometry of rauzy graphs is very different and more complicated than in the case of true’ permutations, since for some irreducible generalized permutations one of the rauzy operations is not defined. true’ permutations are not observable from theorem. true’ is a closely related component of this graph. What we mean is the stich of the moduli space of strict quadratic differentials (with at most simple poles) . . . to that extent a fraction of the moduli space of quadratic differentials is given by a fraction of the stich, where math32 consists of the multiplicities of the zeroes of the corresponding differentials . . . historical examples of extended rauzy classes have been shown to prove the non-conformity of certain strata of the acerian differentials. , by the use of this approach veech proved that the minimal stratum in genus xmath35 has two connected components and arnoux proved that the minimal stratum in genus xmath36 has three connected components (for acerian differentials) . this is particularly illustrated by the results of zorich . note that a theorem of the second author xcite classifies all connected components of all strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles. this theorem xcite proves that all connected components of strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials are connected or are just two connected components, one of which is hyperelliptic. Extended rauzy classes of irreducible generalized permutations are in one-to-one correspondence with connected components of strata in the moduli spaces of quadratic differentials. For permutations of a small number of elements it is easy to describe explicitly the subset of irreducible permutations and then by the rauzy operations to decompose it into a disjoint unit of The whole section is given by xcite, and it contains the numerical program for calculating the rauzy classes. In this section we recall the definition of the rauzy class and its characteristic properties. In particular, we recall the rauzy class and its dynamical properties, and we ascribe these properties to the irreducibility of the element. In section [ Sec] iem we recall the basic properties of flat surfaces, moduli spaces, and interval maps. We remember the rauzy class and its dynamical properties, especially the rauzy class and its dynamical properties. in section [ sec] dyn we recall the definition of the linear involution, and give its basic properties. We show that if xmath10 does not satisfy the keane property, then we show that there is a property, @ xmath24, such that @ xmath41 is dynamically reducible, and if @ xmath41 is not dynamically reducible, then we say that @ xmath10 is dynamically reducible . . . in section dyn : kitty : kitty : kitty , we study the dynamics of the renormalized kitty kitty kitty kitty on the space of linear involutions and prove theorem kitty kitty kitty kitty , see @ xcite . the index is sometimes followed by the notation @xcite or at least @xcite . in this section we will concentrate on the basic concepts of flat surfaces, moduli spaces, and intervals. In this section we will concentrate on a flat surface (real, compact, connected) genus of xmath42 equipped with a flat metric (with isolated conical singularities) such that the holonomy group belongs to @xmath42 . holonomy means that the parallel transportation of a vector along a long loop brings the vector back to itself or to its opposite . - we will sometimes use the notation @xmath55 or simply @xmath55 . we will sometimes use the notation @xmath55 or simply @xmath55 . we shall make use of the notation @xmath55 for general reference or @xcite . a flat surface is a triple surface @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is a topological compact surface, @xmath46 is a finite subset of @xmath46 (the elements are called singularities) and @xmath47 is an atlas of @xmath48, so that transition maps of @xmath49 are translations or half-turns: @xmath50, and for each @xmath51 a neighborhood of @xmath52 isometric to a euclidean cone. The moduli space of quadratic differentials, [xmath64] is divided into two dimensions [xmath65], where xmath56 is not the global square of any abelian differential), and where xmath66 is an analytic isomorphism, that is to say, the expression given by the following equation: [xmath66] if there is an analytic isomorphism,[xmath65] if there exists an analytic isomorphism, which produces, in arithmetic terms, a ratio between the two dimensions [xmath71] of the size of the proportions of the squares [xmath74] , the linear action of the defintion [x] parameter subgroup of diagonal matrices,[x] is of particular interest. This theorem was proved by masur and veech in the case of the [x]math64 [x] and in the case of the [x]mass, for the (x)math64 [x] cases, and for the (x]mass of the (x)mass. Its ergodicity is proved in full, for the [x]mass, and for the x, which is in the lebesgue class. The linear action of the differential-strength subgroup of diagonal matrices @ xmath73 upon flat surfaces, is particularly interesting. It gives a measure-preserving flow on the natural measure, which is the equivalence relation generated by: if there exists an analytic isomorphism of @ xmath61, then @ xmath66 if ; we will call the simple Combinatorial Conditions , such transformations abound naturally as Poincar resolving maps of foliated leaves and geodesic flows on translation surfaces. It is easy to see that Xmath10 is precisely regulated by the following information: a permutation of Xmath84 which indicates how intervals are exchanged (that is, that the k-th interval, which is numerated from left to right, is sent by xmath10 to a subset of xmath81), and a vector with positive entries that indicates the length of the intervals. An interval exchange map is a one-to-one map of Xmath10 from Xmath83 to a co- finite subset of Xmath84, which is a translation on each interval of its definition domain. [19] , we will show the stifling and geometrical properties of faubourg (see the xcite for more details) . We are usually represented by the following table: Xmath92 : Xmath93 , let lbr81 be an open interval, and let lbr84 be a one-to-one map from xmath90 to itself given by xmath91 . . . . . . if the beholder is . . . . ctrl is . . . so . . . if the beholder is . . . he is a loser. . . . in that case, we define . . . . . . Xmath102 has type . . . ; equivalent to the beholder, . . . . . . that is to say, we define a subinterval . . . of . . . . in an equivalent way to . . . it is obvious that this is a kind of interval exchange, defined on . . . letters (see . . . . . . . . ) . . . @ . . . the rauzy veech induction . . . . . is defined as the first return map of . . . . . , we want the iterates of the rauzy-veech induction to be always well defined. Similarly, we want the iterates of the rauzy-veech induction to be good renormalizations, in that the iterates correspond to the inductions of the subintervals tending to zero. In the next article, we will examine the rauzy-veech induction as a dynamic system defined on the space of interval exchanges. We will say that if the two intervals are not of the same length, i.e. if the @ xmath132 are rationally independent vectors, that is, if the @ xmath132 are rationally independent vectors, that is, if the @ xmath132 is rationally independent, that is, if xmath133 is rationally independent for all non-zero integer vectors - xmath134, then he satisfies the keane s property (see xcite) , but the opposite is not the case. we say that math10 satisfies the keane s property (also called the infinite distinct orbit condition or i. d. o. c. property) , if the orbits of the singularities of xmath131 by xmath10 are infinite, this ensures that math3 is irreducible and the iterates of the rauzy-veech induction are always well defined. If we want to study the rauzy-veech induction as a dynamical system on the space of interval exchange maps, it is useful to consider the rauzy-veech renormalization on the projective space of the intervals. Thus, we have the relation generated by @xmath147 which is a partial order on the set of irreducible permutations, and we depict this relation as a directed graph @xmath148. Note that @xmath143 is irreducible if and only if @xmath143 is irreducible . . . Note that @xmath143 is irreducible if and only if @xmath143 is irreducible. Thus, we have the same relation on the set of permutations, in particular, the equivalent class of permutations is the rauzy class. Now, suppose there is an oriented path in @xmath148 joining @xmath3 and @xmath152, i.e., there are @xmath153 such that @xmath155 . . . so, there is an oriented path in @xmath148, such that @xmath146 . . . Let Xmath171 be the horizontal interval defined by Xmath172 . . . if the lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 have no intersections other than the points, then we can construct a translation surface for @ xmath171 as follows: we can identify each side @ xmath164 with the side @ xmath168 by a translation (in general, we should use the veep-diameter construction, see Section : Zip) . . . . so that the interval between @ xmath161 and _17170* is the exact one defined by the first return map of the vertical flow on a well-chosen segment. Let _xmath171 be the horizontal interval defined by @ xmath172 . . . let _xmath171 be an interval exchange transformation . . . but let __xmath161 be the horizontal interval defined by @ xmath174 . . . and let @ xmath18 be a multiplication table, let @ xmath18 be an interval-adjustment map, let us assume that @ xmath18 is irreducible , if and only if @ xmath18 is irreducible , let @ xmath19 be any suspension over xmath18 . . . . Let @ xmath19 be an interval-adjustment map, and let us assume that @ xmath18 is irreducible , let us build a fold of a rectangle @ xmath190, width @ xmath191 and height @ xmath192, based on @ xmath193 . Let us first remark that @ xmath88 is irreducible if and only if @ xmath182 is irreducible, then if @ xmath184 is irreducible, then so is xmath184 , so is xmath186 , then we   zip' the vertical boundaries of these rectangles that are adjacent (see Figure fig: fig: iet: iet; see also @ xcite for a more detailed description) . if @ xmath200 is the winner of @ xmath201, then @ xmath202 (which is the same as the winner of @ xmath201), then @ xmath202 [rk: moduli] since @ xmath203 is obtained from @ xmath204 by axle cutting , axle gluing , these two surfaces differ by some element of the mapping class, and therefore they define the same point in the moduli space (see figure Fig. , , ,  , , ) for an example). Xmath199 is the standard rauzy - veech induction. if xmath200 is the winner, we define “[5] because the function of the matrix xmath228 on xmath214 preserves the area of the corresponding flat surface, the action of teichmller flow also acts on the subset xmath233, corresponding to the surface of one surface, and the measure xmath234 induced by the measure xmath223 on that subset. [6] There is a natural action of the matrix xmath228 on xmath214, where xmath230 acts on xmath231 linearly. This action preserves the measure xmath223 on xmath221 and commutes with xmath227, so it descends to a 1 parameter action on xmath232, called the teichmller flow. — xmath240 he proved that he proved that the induced measure on xmath241 is always infinite . . . so he proved that the induced measure on xmath241 is always infinite. . . . Let xmath45 be a (flat, connected, oriented) flat surface with an Xmath1 linear holonomy, and let xmath242 be a horizontal segment with a choice of a positive vertical direction (or, more accurately, a choice of the left and right ends) . . . let xmath242 be a (containt, connected, oriented) flat surface with a single, positive vertical direction (or, equivalently, a choice of both ends) . the first return map of the vertical geodesics starting from xmath242 is of the kind @ xmath243 . if a vertical geodesic starts from xmath242 and does not hit a singularity, it intersects xmath242 again. . So the map @ xmath244 alone is not proper to the dynamics of vertical geodesics, since when @ xmath248 hits the interval @ xmath250 , then @ xmath250 , and @ xmath251 does not correspond to the successive intersections of a vertical geodesic with @ xmath242 starting from xmath242 , . “contrary to the convention of oriented surfaces, in this paper we are concerned with measured foliations defined on ”oriented” surfaces. The first return map of the vertical geodesic foliation on a horizontal segment of @xmath242 in a flat surface @xmath45 defines a linear involution. if @xmath261 and @xmath262 belong to the same connected component of @xmath263 then the derivative of @xmath258 on @xmath219 is @xmath13, otherwise the derivative of @xmath258 on @xmath219 is @xmath72 . The previous definition was motivated by the following remark. “... As we are interested in non-orientated measured foliations defined on _orientated_ surfaces . . . observe that the orientability of the surface @ xmath45 places the second condition on the derivative of @ xmath10 , in fact . . . — let xmath270 be an alphabet of xmath4 letters — note that a generalized permutation, as in a definition (def. gym) is a two-to-one map of xmath270. — Let xmath270 be an alphabet of xmath4 letters — let xmath270 be a generalized permutation, of type @ xmath16, with xmath271 — is a two-to-one map of xmath275 without fixed points. As in a definition , as in the definition, we will sometimes express such generalized permutation in the form of the table: @ xmath273 a generalized permutation @ xmath270 defines an involution without fixed points, by the following way. as @ xmath258 is an isometric involution, it is a permutation and a vector with positive numbers. Since @ xmath258 is an isometric involution, it has no fixed point, so each @ xmath249 is connected isometrically to a @ xmath280, with @ xmath281; so that @ xmath258 induces an involution without fixed point on @ xmath283 .. Let @ xmath258 be an alphabet of @ xmath4 letters. We shall now describe the nature of the linear involution. Note that if @xmath293 is not a 'True' permutation, then it is an obvious and sufficient condition that @ xmath294 should have arisen from a linear involution, namely that there exist at least two indices @ xmath295 and @ xmath296 such that @ xmath297 and @ xmath298 . In this case (if @xmath293), let @ xmath294 be a generalized permutation of type @ xmath16, and let @ xmath294 be the associated involution . @ xmath289 in the following table we will verify that the discrete datum associated with the linear involution described in figure [ Ext: g] is the generalized permutation on xmath3 . [ ] From now on, unless explicitly notified (in particular in section [Ext: g] ) we will always assume that generalized permutations satisfy the following convention . . . . as before, we say that if xmath10 is a generalized permutation, the subsets xmath309 and xmath310 can be empty because xmath311 or because the linear relation on the xmath312 must be satisfied. . . . if xmath310 is a given generalized permutation, the subsets xmath319 and xmath314 can be empty either because xmath311 or because of the linear relation on the xmath312 that must be satisfied . . . . if xmath330 and xmath317 are the same type of xmath16, and that is: xmath330 , otherwise xmath326 is not defined . . . . and if xmath303 is typed at xmath103, then @xmath336 , @xmath337 if @ xmath338 and xmath339 . in the following example, ex.

We can call such a surface a suspension over xmath10, and the parameters encoding this suspension are called a suspension data. Let xmath10 be a linear involution, and let xmath358 be the lengths of the corresponding intervals. Let xmath164 be a broken line (one with a finite number of edges), on the plane such that the edge number xmath365 is represented by the complex number xmath366 for xmath367, and xmath168 be a broken line which begins at the same point as xmath164, and whose edge number xmath368 is represented by the complex number xmath369 for xmath370 (figure (figure): suspension : data ; a collection of complex numbers such as 1 . 2 . . . . . , . . , . . . . – for each pair of intervals @ xmath371 and @ xmath242 of the vertical layer starting at @ xmath373 and returning at @ xmath374 is constant, the value depends only on the generalized permutation and on the imaginary part of the suspension data @ xmath373 . identifications for the horizontal sides @ xmath371 are given by the linear involution, identifications for the vertical are given only by the generalized permutation and of @ xmath379 . identifications for the vertical are very straightforward. We will now consider the previous case when a suitable polygon is defined by a line of this form. This form is very similar to the usual one, although the exact description is very technical . However, we can still define a flat surface by means of an analogous construction as the zippered rectangles. Here we will consider the earlier case when a line of intersections between two intervals is given by xmath380, and a suspension data _xmath379 _ is given by a linear involution, and the corresponding suspension data _xmath379 is given by the corresponding generalisation _ _ . Here we have given the zippered rectangle construction for any suspension data. Let @ xmath45 be a flat surface, without horizontal saddles, and let @ xmath242 be a horizontal interval attached to a singularity on the left. Let @ xmath396 be the vertical leaf passing through the right end of @ xmath242; let @ xmath396 pass through a singularity before returning to @ xmath242 in positive or negative direction. This is natural. * we have defined the zippered rectangle construction for all suspension data. note that we have not yet discussed the existence of a suspension data. This is given in the following section. let @ xmath45 be a flat surface without vertical saddles and let @ xmath242 be a horizontal interval attached to a singularity on the left. This last condition implies that @ xmath381 defines a suitable polygon . . . let @ xmath396 be the vertical leaf which passes through the right end of @ xmath242 , we assume that @ xmath396 meets a singularity before returning to @ xmath242 in positive or negative direction. let @ xmath21 be the linear involution given by the cross-section on @ xmath242 . Let Xmath303 be a linear involution, and let Xmath163 be a suspension over Xmath10 . . . if Xmath303 has type Xmath103, then Xmath399, xmath400 if Xmath338 and xmath403 . . . if Xmath407 is an alphabet, we will denote by xmath408 the set with multiplicities of cardinal xmath410 , and will use analogous notations for subsets of xmath19 . . . . if xmath404 has type Xmath72, then Xmath402 , if Xmath403 and Xmath403 , then xmath406 , if Xmath402 has type Xmath407 , then Xmath402 , if Xmath407 is an alphabet, then we will denote by xmath408 the set with multiplicities @ xmath410 of Cardinal Xmath410, and we will use analogous notations for subsets of xmath19 . “Second” will be a linear involution.  We merely mean that in this section we speak of the suspensions given by the construction of section xmath2—that is, by a condition of the xmath2 dissipation. We merely mean that if xmath220 admits a decomposition in xmath425 where all the subsets in xmath425 are not all empty, and one of the following conditions holds true: a corner is emptied and it is on the left . 217 No corner is emptied and it is on the right . 319 No corner is empty, only one corner is empty, and it is on the left . note that the existence or not of a suspension is independent of the length of the data in xmath6 . . . the main result of this section is the next theorem, which is formulated by combination with proposition . . . natural . . . therefore, the choice of placing a singularity on the left end of the segment in the construction of section . . . – “The free number is [1] , we define [2] if the set is [3] empty. - the free number is if the set is [3] empty. [3] then, adding the second from the first, and the fourth from the third, we get [3] [4] , which is contradictory to the first. - We differentiate three cases according to the following definition: *  i – exactly two corners are empty. * ii – exactly one corner is empty, and it is on the left. + Then, by subtracting the second from the first, and the fourth from the third, we get [4]  xmath439 which contradicts the first. , we also define  xmath435. This implies that @ xmath438 is both positive and negative, and hence the following inequalities:  xmath438 subtracting the third inequality from the second, we get @ xmath439, which contradicts the first.  iii - exactly two corners are empty. You need to find a suspension, and the suspension must be found in any irreducible permutation. Here the following is clear and left to the reader. You need to work on only the imaginary part of the xmath441 in order to build a suspension. so we will use this vocabulary only in this section. a 'preliminary suspension' is a collection of real numbers @ xmath442 such that: * for all @ xmath442 ... a 'preliminary suspension' is an integer @ xmath446 (for all @ xmath447), such that @ xmath448 ... xmath449 ... a preliminary suspension is 'strict' if all previous inequalities are 'strict' except for the extremal ones ... a preliminary suspension is 'strict' if the number of vanishing indices of @ xmath447 is strictly inserted in the list of vanishing indices of @ xmath447 ... a preliminary suspension is 'strict' if, in any decomposition of @ xmath274 as in @ xmath428 of definition, all the corners are empty ... We will consider the next section as an abstract reconstruction of the construction of the suspension data of sections [Section — Data — Iem]; (sent.) So that if xmath163 is a suspension data such as xmath454, then xmath3 is strongly irreducible. As we have seen in section — iem— iem, a mathematical formula for a suspension of a true permutation, derived from masur and veech, gives a suspension of the permutation when the permutation is irreducible. Let xmath467 be a generalized permutation. Then let xmath468 be a generalized permutation. * math457 is a subset of elements in math 485 such that math459 contains exactly one element in math 485 and one element in math 412 . . . The restriction of math274 on math 485 is a true permutation. * math468 is a permutation defined on math 485 in which there are two elements in math 485 , so that there are no elements in math 485 . . . let math466 be a generalized permutation . Let Xmath480 be an ordinary figure of the above kind. It is called the ’-principles of the three as follows: if Xmath480 is a normal figure of the above type, it is called Xmath480. That is, if Xmath480 is a normal figure of the above type, then Xmath480 is a regular figure of the above type. If Xmath480 is a regular figure, then Xmath480 is a regular figure, whereas xmath480 is a regular figure, with a figure of xmath480, if Xmath480 is a regular figure, and its regular form is a regular figure of xmath480. Moreover, Lemma [soli] gives us the desired collection of numbers in Xmath480. Let Xmath480 be the index, let Xmath480 be the normal figure, let Xmath480 be the regular figure, let Xmath480 be a normal figure, where xmath480 is a regular one. . . . and (lm: dec) in the second . . . lemma: lm: dec . . . so that, if xmath451 is a pseudo-strain of xmath505, then xmath506 is a pseudo-strain of xmath507 and xmath451 is a pseudo-strain of the generalized permutation of xmath508 . . . therefore, if xmath451 is a pseudo-strain of xmath505, then xmath506 is a pseudo-strain of the generalized permutation of xmath508 . . . [Dec.] we assume that neither xmath2 nor xmath501 is empty . . . , title = fig : sent> replace math529 (to math530) with math531 (to math532) and get a vector math450, see Figure [Example 1]. let math531 and math531 be the first and last highest vanishing indices of math275. math536 is math536. math537 is math540 (since math540) . Therefore math534 and the lemma are proved. . . . and if there is math536 in math549 such as math555, then we set math536 . . . . , if math536 exists, then either math545 or math546 or math547 . math536 and math536 . . . so , if math536 exists, then math536 and math539, math539 . if there is no index in Xmath559 or Xmath569, the corresponding right corner is not empty. Let us suppose that Xmath559 is not strict. Let us suppose that there is a vanishing index in Xmath559, and that if xmath559 is not strict, then there are at least two vanishing corners at the top or at the bottom. if xmath559 is not strict, then there are either equals or at least one empty corner, and if xmath559 is not empty, then there is either xmath558 equal, or at least one empty, and so on. , it is clear from the above that either a corner is only xmath570 or xmath37, or the corners are xmath571 or xmath572 in the same way, with xmath566 not empty. Therefore, the implication will be that if xmath 559 is not strict, then at least a pair of nonempty corners exists in the top or at the bottom, e.g., if there is a vanishing index in xmath559, then the corresponding right corner is simply empty. the second case corresponds to a non-maximum pseudo-solution. Let us take the first case: the right-hand corner is @xmath40. - it has a vanishing index in @xmath568, and therefore the right-hand corner is not @xmath568. - there is a vanishing index in @xmath568, and therefore the right-hand corner is not @xmath568. - if @xmath37 is too small, then the new vector @xmath450 is better than @xmath450, which contradicts its maximality. - and we will call these cases vanishing indexes. So, the bottom admits vanishing indexes; then the left-hand corner can be @xmath588 or @xmath588. in the first and second cases, - in the first case, - xmath274 is not strongly irreducible, and - in the second case, - xmath275 is not strongly irreducible. There is a general trend towards a downward correction in the chart of the upper half of the image. Let xmath599 be the first index of xmath489 (see the figure of Xmath489) . . . let xmath599 be the smallest index, that is, xmath599, and xmath595 the largest. - let xmath610 be the smallest index, such as xmath598, and let xmath595 be the largest. . . . - Let xmath610 be the number of indices in Xmath610 which are in Xmath610, and number of indices in Xmath610 which are in Xmath610 , this value might be positive. - Let xmath610 be the first and last lowest indexes. But if the last point where xmath37 takes place is xmath37, then xmath37 takes place at xmath37 or xmath628. , which contradicts the maximality of xmath451. we assume that there are no corners in the bottom of the column – then, according to lemma – Xmath618; therefore, the top point where xmath37 takes place is xmath37. - This new pseudo-strength we have created is better than the old one for xmath96 small enough . – If xmath463 is empty, then xmath274 decomposes as xmath619, so xmath274 is not strongly irreducible . – If xmath37 takes place in the same way as xmath37, then xmath37 is not indisputable. – The second case is that the top-left corner is xmath2 . – if xmath37 takes place, then xmath37 is not indisputable . Let us suppose that if xmath639 is empty, then the top-right corner is also xmath37, and so xmath274 is not strongly irreducible . . . note that xmath640 defines a generalized permutation which is not firmly irreducible by assumption. Note also that xmath640 defines a generalized permutation which is not strongly irreducible by assumption. Here, we have only to prove the necessary condition . . . . we consider a pseudo-stability of @ xmath450 better than @ xmath450 and maximal in this property. . . . if @ xmath640 is not empty, then we choose @ xmath620, @ xmath621, and @ xmath579, and set: @ xmath636 and @ xmath450 is better than @ xmath450. . . . since @ xmath480 is irreducible, there are two empty corners in the composition. * if only one corner is empty, then it is on the right . now let @ xmath650 and @ xmath579. Now let @ xmath579 and @ xmath579. Now we pick : @ xmath651 if @ xmath96 is small enough, then @ xmath450 satisfies: * for all @ xmath652 . . . for all @ xmath653 . . . if there are two corners empty, we can assume that @ xmath274 decomposes as: @ xmath654 with @ xmath655 irreducible. Theorem is proved. This section proves theorem @ xmath40 and the second half of theorem @ xmath2 . . . if the underlying permutation is reducible, then the transformation is never minimal, or if xmath3 is irreducible, and if xmath3 is irreducible , then the combinatorial set for which the dynamics of @ xmath10 is good coincides with the calcification for which the geometry is good . . . Xmath662 is well defined for any @xmath663 and the lengths of the intervals are @xmath664 as @xmath70 tends to infinity. so let @xmath662 go to zero, since @xmath70 tends to infinity. let Xmath662 be a linear involution. We will make the following assertion: [No, I do not want to], let @ xmath662 be a linear involution , we will make the following assertions: “$math662  xmath”; we will make the following assertions: “ xmath4”; let  xmath6 be the subset of elements xmath1 that math672 reduces an infinite number of time in the sequence xmath3; let math6 be the subinterval of math4 corresponds to math4 , in this case 3 is not the property of  , . , , , , , . , , , ,  , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  , , , , , , , , , , ,  , This is proved. Note that @ xmath670 can never be empty. So we prove that if xmath670 has no connections, then the sequence @ xmath673 of iterations of @ xmath10 is infinite and all parameters of @ xmath674 tend to zero when @ xmath70 tends to infinity. Therefore, there exists at least one element of @ xmath692 whose corresponding element to @ xmath242 is minimal. So let @ xmath682 be the element of @ xmath691 whose corresponding element to @ xmath242 is minimal . we have @ xmath682 . so that @ xmath685 is a singularity of @ xmath131, and such that its sequence at xmath684 is finite, and with @ xmath687 the singularity of @ xmath10 . if for all @ xmath663 the map @ xmath683 is well defined and @ xmath693 is well defined, then @ xmath694 is not inclined to zero, and therefore there is an element of @ xmath694 such that @ xmath135 is inclined to zero . ‘But if you think of it, we are the example of the percent ‘augury’, ‘Xmath’ as defined by the set xmath255. Let math’ be a linear involution on math’707 satisfying the keane’s property. This is the first part of the proposition. Let math’ be a linear involution on math’707 satisfying the keane’s property. The main point of the argument is that if math’s a connection, then either the sequence math’s (the total sequence math’s) xmath’s sequence is finite, or the length parameters are not always zero. so we have proved that if math’s a connection, then either the sequence math’s is finite, or the length parameters do not all tend to zero . Hence, we have proved that if math’s has a connection, then either the sequence math’s (the total sequence) math’s is finite, or the length parameters do not tend to zero. therefore math’s function is an interval mapping . . . and so, by definition, math’s function is a linear involution on math708. — the proof is complete. — Let xmath303 be a linear involution. We shall say that xmath6 is _ admissible_ for _ xmath3 (or _ xmath10 has admissible parameters) if none of the following conditions holds: _ xmath6_. — Let xmath3 be a linear involution . — a generalized permutation _ is called _ dynamically irreducible_ if the corresponding set of permissible parameters is nonempty. _ _ The set of permissible parameters of a generalized permutation is always open. — dyn: _un_ the decomposition of _ xmath3_ is dynamically irreducible if the corresponding set of permissible parameters is not empty. — Observe also that if __xmath6 is irreducible, then _________________ is dynamically irreducible (the corresponding set of permissible parameters being the whole parameter space ) . These two combinatorial notions of reducibility have been introduced by the second author (see __xcite] This would indicate the theorem. Now, let us assume that the sequence is finite. Suppose, however, that xmath3 is a dynamically irreducible permutation, and let xmath21 be a linear involution with irrational parameters, and @ xmath6 is admissible for xmath3. We shall now denote by @ xmath664 the length parameters of xmath722 and by xmath666, xmath668 and xmath668 the combinatorial data. Since xmath723 is irrational, either xmath724, or xmath725 belongs to the only pair xmath726 on the top of the permutation and xmath727 belongs to the only pair xmath728 on the bottom of the permutation. then we show that in this case xmath6 is not admissible for xmath724 . In the first step we assume that the sequence is finite . . . . if @ xmath739 decomposes as: @ xmath740, let us suppose that @ xmath740 decomposes as: @ xmath746, let us suppose that @ xmath740 decomposes as: @ xmath746, let us suppose that @ xmath741 is the last element of the top line , the following is what we are assuming , we are assuming with a lack of generality that the combinatorial rauzy-veech transformation is at xmath104 . if this place is in the top line, then clearly there is no possible ‘attribute’ (in that case) . if @ xmath739 decomposes into ‘attribute’, then we are assuming that ‘attribution’ is ‘attribution’. if it is, then we are denoted by ’attribution’ and ‘attribution’ , and we can obtain ’attribution’ by removing ‘attribution’ from the place and putting it on the right-hand edge of the line. Suppose, therefore, that if @ xmath739 decomposes into ‘attribution’, let us consider ‘attribution’ as ‘attribution’. We also find a non-zero pseudo-strain (see definition [def: pseudo]), or else it is easy to show that xmath755 has no impossibility (case (one)) ). in this section we first prove that the set of irreducible linear involutions in an attractor for the renormalized rauzy-veech induction is almost all irreducible linear involutions. We find a non-zero pseudo-strain @ xmath755 (see definition [def] pseudo) , otherwise it is easy to show that xmath755 does not have an admissible parameter (case - 1 ) . . . . In this section, we first prove that the set of irreducible linear involutions in an attractor for the renormalized rauzy-veech induction is recurrent for almost all irreducible linear involutions. we also illustrate that (as in the case of interval transformations) the renormalized rauzy-veech induction is recurrent for almost all irreducible linear involutions. . . . , as we are building the surface of xmath70, we are taking the first step of the vertical flow of xmath45 on a segment adjacent to a singularity and without singularities in its interior. Then we join the first points of xmath762 and xmath168 together, and then for the ends of xmath78 we join the first points of xmath782 and the second points of xmath168. since xmath10 has no connection, the surface of xmath45 has no saddle connection (note that this is not the case in general for a first return map on a transverse segment) . thus the first return map on a regular segment of a surface of xmath 759 will be a parallel connection between xmath758 and xmath756 .. as a fixed line, if xmath758 is not in the same position as xmath758, then Xmath758 must be considered a suspension and therefore the Theorem cns means that xmath25 is irreducible. So the first line of the triangle at xmath760 is a flat surface. It is a structure of a rectangle, and the non-vertical sides are interconnected, so that we can glue them as before. As Xmath96 tends to zero, the two vertical saddle connections are the only ones that shrink to zero, and so Xmath785 tends to a surface of xmath46. the transformation of xmath683 is the first return map of the vertical flow of xmath46 on a shortest horizontal segment, adjacent to one of the poles. The region of xmath46 does not degenerate when xmath96 tends to zero, and so there is a sequence of xmath764 that tends to zero, so that xmath765 tends to a surface of xmath46 . . . the segment of xmath70 which corresponds to the limit of xmath771 has no singularity in its interior. In this sense, the surface of xmath47 does not degenerate when xmath97 tends to zero, and there exists a sequence of xmath764 that tends to zero, such that xmath765 tends to a surface of xmath47 . . . the transformation @xmath683 is the first return map of the vertical Flow of xmath47 on a shortest horizontal Xmath769, parallel to a pole. " xmath781 . . . so xmath774 . . . let xmath779 be an irreducible generalization, and let xmath31 be the set of generalizations that can be obtained by iterations of the maps xmath104 and xmath105 (if possible). xmath780 . . . if xmath781 , then xmath204 has exactly one preimage for xmath137 . . . . we define the rauzy-veech map of the space xmath214 . . . it defines an almost invertible map: if xmath781 is the map, if xmath204 is the map, then xmath204 has exactly one preimage for xmath137 . . . so . . . . . , xmath227 preserves xmath223 on xmath214 and - xmath227 is the measure, again Xmath223 on xmath227 . A zippered rectangle construction provides a definite protective layer @ xmath782 over a single half-dozen angles in a connected component of a stratum @ xmath793 of the moduli space of quadratic differentials , the degree of this protective layer is @ xmath794 where @ xmath795 is the dimension of the stratum. Let @ xmath800 be two permissible segments, and let @ xmath801 be the corresponding suspension data. we call admissible a segment adjacent to @ xmath798, such that a vertical geodesic, passing through the right end of @ xmath242 at the right end, meets a singularity and returns to @ xmath242 in a positive or a negative direction. Let @ xmath800 be the linear involutions corresponding to @ xmath800. let @ xmath800 be the linear involutions corresponding to @ xmath800. let @ xmath800 be the three principal parts of the rectangle , let @ xmath826 be the corresponding suspension data , the degree of this cover is @ xmath826 where @ xmath826 is the dimension of the stratum . if xmath807 is the number of possible horizontal separatrices, then the degree of xmath792 is xmath794 (for example, the choice of labels and the choice of intervals) . therefore, for almost all parameters xmath6 the sequence xmath814 is recurrent. Hence, the radiance of xmath814 is incalculable. a subset xmath810 corresponding to surfaces of the squared surface is a finite aggregated portion of a stratum of quadratic differentials, and the proportion of corresponding lebesgue measures is proportional. so xmath814 is a finite layer. the condition of the proof xmath31 does not consider the fact that a linear involution satisfying the keane’s property is minimal. let xmath810 be a linear involution, and the rauzy-veech inductions adjoin the projection xmath813. so , for almost all the parameters @ xmath6 the sequence @ xmath814 is recurrent. 2 in xcite the volume of the moduli space of quadratic differentials is finite, and so, at xmath810, there is finite measure. so the teichmller geodesic flow on xmath810 is recurrent for the lebesgue measure. As we have just said, we prove that there is no broader draw. In the case of interval-exchanges, the periodicity of the maps in question xmath104 and xmath105 gives an easy proof that the above relation is an equivalence relation (p. 121). This argument is abysmal, because those maps are not always clearly defined, and it may happen that xmath822 is well defined but not xmath820. if xmath821 is not well defined, then xmath822 can be said to have parameters xmath823 corresponding to xmath824. and if xmath822 is well defined, we can also say to xmath227 the two permutations , at most, two permutations , at most, between xmath141 and xmath142 when xmath817 is well defined. , the irreducible generalized permutations are an attractor of a rauzy - veech induction . In this section, we prove that there is no smaller attractor . This is the proof of the proposition. Then we define asymmetric permutation of xmath52 by xmath834. In other words, it gives a mixture of the maps xmath104 and xmath105, which sends xmath739 to xmath274 . . . so that @ xmath824 gives a sequence of generalized permutations that reach xmath641 and reach xmath274 . this is a technical result, for example, in the proof of the theory Xmath37. In the opposite way, in the case of intervals, the definition of irreducibility which we have given in section (invariant) is not invariant with the map Xmath264: for example, the generalized permutation which can be obtained from xmath270 is called the extended rauzy class of xmath274 . So let Xmath832 . we start from an irreducible generalized permutation of xmath274 and we construct the subset of irreducible generalized permutations which can be obtained from xmath270 by some composition of the maps Xmath838 and xmath52. Let @xmath10 be a linear involution defined on an interval @ xmath301.  recall that the rauzy-veech induction applied to @xmath10 is to be taken to the first return map on the interval @xmath843 where @xmath844 is the maximal element of @xmath845 which corresponds to a singularity of @xmath10. let @xmath475 be an irreducible generalized permutation. we shall call this the They are provided with data, with a question mark, for the first page of a chapter. There is a description of the vertical separatrix of @xmath797, which starts from @xmath853 in the positive direction, and gives us the first intersection point of @xmath856 with @xmath850. we shall assume that @xmath45 has no vertical saddle to it. Note that @xmath850 might not be a prioria priori to some singularities of @xmath253, so the naive rauzy-veech induction on @xmath850 might miss the interval @xmath850 . Then, as we assume that @ xmath850 has the same form as @xmath850, we shall find, however, a composition of maps math817 and math866 that send @ xmath850 to @ xmath849 . Now we shall add the usual rauzy-veech inductions to @ xmath75 to @ xmath879, if the resulting tracing is large enough, then the corresponding tracing corresponds to the positive direction of @xmath817. note that @ xmath867 might not correspond in any way to some singularities of @xmath253, so that naive rauzy-veech induction in @ xmath850 may miss the interval of @xmath847. on the left, two linear involutions corresponding to first return maps which, though of a different orientation, differ by a different degree of orientation. hence we have established that if two irreducible generalized permutations correspond to the same connected component, then they are of the same extended rauzy class. In the usual case, the space of extended suspension data corresponding to a generalized permutation is convex, so the set of surfaces corresponding to a generalized permutation belongs to a connected component of stratum. To this case, some topological invariants were found by Kontsevich and zorich in the class of extended suspensions (see, for example, @xcite) . Therefore, in this case, some topological invariants were found by kontsevich and zorich , hyperelliptic and spin structure. In the past, extended suspensions were used to prove the non-connectivity of some stratum of abelian differentials (for instance, @xcite). Thus, we have proved that if two irreducible generalized permutations correspond to the same connected component, they are in the same extended rauzy class . thus, the extended rauzy class is satisfied by . . . Assuming, however, that the corresponding suspension surfaces are disposed in the stratum, the two enclosed layers are of the stratum, xmath884. In the case of the stratum, xmath884 is considered, one can say the generalized permutations in xmath859; in the case of the stratum, xmath885, one may say the generalized permutations in xmath885; in the case of the stratum, xmath884, one may say the generalized permutations in xmath859; and one may consider the generalized permutations in xmath859 as being irreducible, if and only if it is dynamically irreducible. (As we can see, here there are only two connected components, corresponding to the two extended rauzy classes, and this stratum has precisely two connected components, corresponding to the two extended rauzy classes. Thus, there is no interesting phenomenon in this "bare" class. We can, however, if we consider the slightly more complicated case, for instance, if we take the generalized permutations over xmath36 letters, we can also discover some interesting phenomena. figure (Response to the class: class: 2ii) illustrates such a rauzy class. . . . “] [11] [14] [15] [ ] [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] @ xmath 915 [ ] [ ] @ xmath 915 [ ] [ ] @ xmath916 [ ] [ ] @ xmath918 [ ] [ ] @ xmath919 [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] @ xmath910 [ ] [ ] [ ] @ xmath911 , — . . — [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [9] [9] [9] ; [10], [11], — [11], [12], — [13], — xmath941 , xmath942 ; [12] — [13], [14], [15], _19] , _19], _17, _19, _19, _17, _17,_[15] the corresponding stratum _16. Then we can define an extended rauzy class by considering the set of generalized permutations obtained from the irreducible permutation of _____________ permutations, in general, which is an irreducible generalized permutation, so that we must join this set with the set of irreducible generalized permutations in order to form an extended rauzy class. Then, of course, the extended rauzy class contains elements . . . [14] Remember that if @ xmath3 is irreducible, then so are @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 (as defined). In this way, the proof of theorem at xmath37 is modified, by the three most elementary points. Suppose that the two lines connecting the end points of @ xmath164 and the end points of @ xmath168 have no other intersections with @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 , such that @ xmath427 is irreducible . . . the idea is to modify the proof of theorem at xmath37 by making the following three elementary remarks. Let @ xmath952 be a second interval of an irreducible generalized permutation (type @ xmath16) . . . so @ xmath835 is irreducible . let @ xmath952 reduce the value @ xmath953 . . . the solution to @ xmath14 makes @ xmath948 the second interval of @ xmath14, which is an intermediate interval for @ xmath10 . . . so @ xmath14 is irreducible . . . and at xmath953 we can see that if @ xmath16 is irreducible, then there is no empty corner . . . if xmath960 is the suspension of xmath950 on the surface Xmath850, and if xmath850 is large enough, xmath859 is isomorphic to the first return map on the subinterval xmath864 of xmath850, with xmath868 or xmath869 a singularity of xmath950 . if xmath950 is the value of xmath950, then we have xmath950 . . . . , so we have a ludicrous vee induction for xmath950, so we have a first return map on xmath950 . . . . . let xmath950 be the suspension of xmath250 that corresponds to the surface xmath50 , then to apply to xmath960 the matrix xmath950 for a suitable xmath960 (which does not alter the vertical foliation) we can assume that xmath427 . . . . – where, in the last instance, it would be assumed that the point @ xmath970 was reducible to xmath980 and, in the second instance, a suspension at xmath950 over xmath976 corresponding to a first return map of @ xmath954 on the subinterval @ xmath956 . The same argument, however, produced a sequence of irreducible generalized permutations connecting @ xmath976 to @ xmath978. continuing fraction algorithms for interval maps: an introduction, frontiers in number theory, physics, and geometry, volume 1: random matrices, zeta fonctions and dynamical systems. Continuing this argument, there will be a step where the point @ xmath979 minimising the value @ xmath980 is precisely @ xmath856 (because the surface contains finite number of vertical separatrices starting from the singularities)
