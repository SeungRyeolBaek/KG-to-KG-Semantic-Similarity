Xcite system, if it does not involve open-closed strings, then one of the main features of such open-closed mixed systems is a duality between open- and closed strings. this duality is shown, for example, in one-circuit diagrams of open strings as tree insertions of closed strings through modular transformations of the string world. In a system of d-branes, this duality should serve as the rationale for the correspondence between gauge theory on the open-branched strings and gravity theory in the open-branched strings. in a system of d-branes, this duality should serve as the rationale for the correspondence between gauge theory on the world-volumes (open-branched string sector) and gravity theory in the bulk space-time (closed-branched string sector). This duality was emphasized also in xcite. Hence, low-energy effective theories of the open-branched strings, so that they become field theories on the non-commutative world-volumes. This uv/ir fusion is observed, for instance, in the case of a tree propagation of closed-branched ropes. This uv/ir blending gives us the opportunity to take some of the light particle effects of gravity, e.g. gravitation. " At Xcite the generalized star products arise in a disk of amplitudes consisting of a closed-string vertex operator and a closed-string vertex operator in a constant Xmath field. This observation was combined in Xcite and it was shown that in the zero-slope limit of Xcite disk amplitudes of a closed-string tachyon and arbitrary numbers of gauge fields on this background give rise to a straight open wilson line. The generalized star products also appeared in straight open wilson lines by the expansions in powers of the non-commutative gauge fields of xcite. Open wilson lines in Xcite are remarkable gauge invariant objects in non-commutative gauge theories. So, taking account of the above role played by straight open wilson lines in the shape of the bulk boundary duality, dhar and kitazawa, @xcite, conjectured that curved open wilson lines whose transitional state (slender) should be brought about by higher-level (stringy) states of closed string. They found that the coupling of graviton is indeed the gauge invariant operator, which appears in the leading coefficients in harmonic expansions of curved open wilson lines of a straight path. In Section—Second issue—We construct the envelope states of the open string tachyons. On the continuous @ xmath0 field, the boundary states of the open string have been constructed in the “world-sheet” by @ xmath7, and we may therefore call them by the “world-sheet” a contraction of the closed string tachyon, that is, by the inclusion of the brane. In this context, the solution of this problem can be approached with only the first sentences of the section, and the basic idea of this procedure can be found in this manner: suppose that the world-sheet of the closed string is an infinite semi-cylinder of @ xmath5, and that the brane or “world-sheet” is located at @ xmath7, and that the brane or “world-sheet” is located at @ xmath7, and that the Brane or “world-sheet” is located at @ xmath7. The insertion of a closed string into the brane, we shall call this state a polarity in the presence of the brane; likewise, it may be interpreted as a bogolubov transform of the @ xmath2 invariant vacuum of closed string; whereas, for the same matter, one can interpret the state as a bogolubov transform of the polarity in the @ xmath2–invariant vacuum of closed string, which is achieved by the _us_, where _us_ is the suitable generator of the transformation. the expression *         ,  ,,, is the proper time on the world sheet of open-string tachyons. These are presented separately in the section    / r    and renormalized in a suitable way. We also show that the present constructions are applicable to a vanishing -  field background. We take a 13-fold limit on the stringy states ( ) of open-string and, as a result, make the changes of the stringy states (     ) infinitely heavy and separate from the light states. One-Run amplitudes of open-string tachyons on a constant - field background are reduced to those of a non-commutative (-                                                      -           , (This is a sub-limity of the theoretical limit of the closed string (geometry) of a plane of a plane. It allows us to deduce the theory of the world volume. The geometry of the uv- behaviour of the non-commutative gauge theory is examined in Section 1 : uv-nc gauge . It is found that this inverse limit is a vertical index of the amplitudes of open strings around xmath25, and hence the region xmath19. this inverse limit is a transverse factor of the world volume theories. this zero-resisting limit is the magnification of the string amplitudes near xmath25 and therefore the region xmath19 . Although this limit is somewhat different from the gravity limit, these zero-resisting limits share a common property. In general, the open string amplitudes are factorized by a tower of closed strings. The conjecture @ xcite implies that a curved open wilson line somehow factorizes generating functions of one-loop amplitudes of gluons or open-loop tachyons. Consequently, the function of one-loop amplitudes of gluons or open-loop tachyons is factorized at the limit by a number of straight open wilson lines that exchange closed-loop tachyons. For the construction of the figure of the universe, he introduced the closed-string state, where the prefix xmath is a momentum- loop. The state is not an eigenstate of closed-string momentum, but serves as a generating function of all closed-string states. The difference between xmath29 and the corresponding boundary states of the strings, with open legs, is the generating function of the coupling of all the closed-string states to the non-commutative d-brane. The corresponding transformations of the strings on the world sheet are also re-evaluations of the boundary states. This gives us a proof. We begin by introducing the closed-string state at xmath28, where xmath26 is a momentum loop, and the overlap with the gluons is shown to become a curved open wilson line in the zero-slope limit. we make an explicit correspondence between the closed-string states and the coefficients of harmonic expansion of the curve. The same expression is true for the open-string state of Gluons, where the difference between wilson line and the wilson line in the zero-slope limit. We prove that, by way of example, the equilibrium is resolving to one of the two curved open wilson lines. we prove that the energy equilibrium is corrected by imposing the ishibashi condition of xcite or equivalently the brst invariance on these states. As for the boundary states of open-string tachyon and gluons, the wilson line is invariant in the slope. A summary of the eigenvalues of the closed string momentum operators is given in appendix (sections (a) of the world-volume and space-time tensors used in the text is provided. It turns out that they are the standard boundary actions of the metric system of the world-sheet theory. In appendix (b) the world-volume and space-time tensors are discussed, with their relations. a formulae of creation and annihilation are presented. they are necessary for our calculations of several string amplitudes in the text. Let us take the system of d_xmath31_ brane in bosonic string theory. we consider the following closed-string metric: @ xmath33 here, where @ xmath33 and @ xmath37. These are the closed-string consequences of the operation @ xmath37_, where @ xmath34 is constant. the directions @ xmath39 are parallel to the d_xmath33_ brane, and the directions @ xmath39 are perpendicular to the brane. a relevant action of a closed-string is the following: _xmath40 = frac 14 4843 p int   d tau d sigma d tau d sigma d sigma d d tau d sigma d sigma d  sigma d  sigma d  sigma d  sigma ‘as a cylinder, and we have used the cylinder coordinates @xmath44 (@xmath6 and @xmath45) . Since it is an exact two-form, we can recast it by applying the stokes theorem to create a boundary integral: @xmath43. The cylinder coordinates @xmath44 are mode-elongated, and the standard first class needs the following commutation relations: @xmath49 . . .   frac  1  4  pi  alpha –   alpha     n   n      n        n         n         n         n           ,                  ,   ,  , and , which are all the forms of the virasory algebras with central charges equal to xmath51. virasory virasory and the ibashi condition are the common forces in the field of the closed string. It has the following representations in terms of oscillator modes:   , , ,  , , , , , ,  ,    end  aligned  ] [9] . . . . let us first describe the subject of the boundary states. . . . a.

The corresponding amplitude of the open-string amplitude is given by the corresponding amplitude of the open-string amplitude. This amplitude can easily be calculated by the formula of the appendix “Section 2” of the Singularity. It turns out to be @ xmath106, where @ xmath106 he equals the hamiltonian. The contribution of the world-sheets to reparametrization is excluded in eq.

At this point we have chosen the generators by @xmath132, @xmath133; let @xmath133 be a local operator of closed string, and this operator can be written as follows: @xmath133 is a closed string operator of momentum at xmath135; it is a local operator, and it entails the adjoint transform of @xmath126. The action of this operator on a closed string state at xmath127, where @xmath4 is a generator, is a local operator and interpreted as the adjoint transform of @xmath126 by @xmath131 . in this section we focus on the tachyon vertex operators. As we are interested in the world-volume theory of xmath31-brane, we restrict ourselves to the bogolubov transform associated with the neumann boundary state. however, the story is not so simple. as we are most interested in the world-volume theory of xmath31-brane, we restrict ourselves to the bogolubov transform associated with the neumann boundary state. sent> - n  +  tilde  alpha          mu      bar  z     -    - n   - n      - n             -   - - in this - if we consider the bogolubov transform, we can write the bogolubov transform of xmath9 - as if the original - and -types are preserved, it can be written in the following way for xmath146: xmath148, a local operator - xmath148, that is, the bogolubov transform of xmath9 , - it takes the form of xmath148, where xmath150 and xmath151 are both operators - a new mode: a new mode: a new mode: xmath155; - xmath150 singularity, - in eq. (distribution of vt) - this factor can be considered a renormalization factor of a closed-string tachyon vertex ... - [11] , [12][13] - , this is a basis for a generalization of the holomorphic factorization of the two equations of xmath164 and xmath169, which is defined by xmath166 . which is denoted by xmath166 . the modified term of xmath164 is a consequence of the modified operator products between xmath159, xmath160, and xmath9. Then, by the effect of this expression, the transformation (transform of vt) indicates that the boundaries of a system give rise to extra correlations, that is, between the chiral and anti-chiral parts, namely, to the coordinates of xmath169. The modification is the result of operator products between xmath159, xmath160, and xmath9 . Here, the function green_program_, on the unit disk @ xmath165, is a sum of the correlations @ xmath172 and xmath173 . . . . these correlations are characteristic of open-string theory. Thus, taking account of this expression, the transform (red_program_) indicates that the boundary states of an ensemble, i.e., those of the chiral and anti-chiral segments, @ xmath168 and @ xmath169, of the strings’ coordinates. . . . as a result of the virasoro algebra, it is necessary to renormalize a tachyon vertex operator of the same type . . . in view of this, we introduce an renormalized tachyon vertex operator of the same type . . . that is, to achieve the renormalization, we introduce an renormalized tachyon vertex operator of the same momentum . . . so that the tachyon operator of the tachyon operator has the same momentum. to obtain this condition, we use the relation (def. of ren vt) to write a form: @ xmath206 , we call that state math208 . . . an explicit form of math208 has been given in eq. - (normal ordered transformed vt) . , so that we can express the state in the oscillator, and then we take the limit math195 without ambiguity . . . .

Xmath223 and xmath224 are the fourier modes of ghost and anti-ghost fields, Xmath232 and xmath233. if a phantom is a closed string hilbert space, then we want to read the state of xmath246 as a state of the closed string hilbert space, since it is a boundary state of the neumann directions, we first extend it to the boundary state of xmath239 by tensoring the boundary state (state bd) of the direction of the Yenmann directions, and from this state Xmath249 satisfies the ishibashi condition. and this state is satisfied by a first condition in eq.

( qc on one tachyon b) gives xmath259 @ xmath249 . for the second condition, we can assume the xmath259 of eq. . [ qc on one tachyon b] = xmath259 . The above operation can be identified by the brst transformation of open-string tachyon vertex. to describe the branching of a branch, we need the dual branchings of a branch. Instead of xmath132 we introduce the bpz dual: @xmath286 the transform of the branching of a branching of a branch becomes possible by changing the coordinates of @xmath179 to @xmath297 . instead of xmath132 we introduce the double branching of a branch, that is, @xmath290, which we interpret as the (double) bogolubov transform of @xmath291 . . . which will be described in the next subsection. It is worth mentioning that the present construction is also applicable in a field that has vanished by the period of the vanishing @xmath0 and in particular the boundaries of the branches ( m open-string tachyon boundary) become accessible only by setting @ xmath285. It is a very similar calculation as that which is carried out to obtain eq. (_renormalized_ tachyon vertex) that gives the result @ xmath297. xmath303 be the chiral anti-chiral correlation of the green s function , xmath304. Let xmath303 be the renormalized open-string tachyon operator , which we call xmath307, is given by subtracting the singular factor which appears in eq. (xmath187 on lim ren vt) after we have reached the limit xmath305. Let xmath310 be the dual vertex operators. The unavoidable tachyon operator, which we call xmath307, is called 19, and the hamiltonian operator of closed-string is called xmath317. In this subsection we only consider the propagations along the hamiltonian directions. The hamiltonian operator of closed-string is called xmath317. [14] We consider the state math313 and take the limit math314. Then we consider the state math315 and take the limit math315. mu     (r)    mu  nu  k And the amplitudes ([tachyon amplitudes by boundary state]) , coupled with the closed string propagations along the dirichlet directions, must be compared with open string amplitudes. The evolution of open string in the upper half-plane is described by the integral representation of @xmath375. , they are of the following form: @xmath371 where we put @xmath372 . it is necessary to observe the vectors of open string, especially @xmath376, at the boundary. we will omit to mention the standard normal ordering of @xmath366. we will make use of the standardized normal ordering of @xmath366. According to the normal ordering of @xmath362 – the invariant vacuum of open string, it is convenient to introduce by @xcite commutative zero-version modes in Xmath363 instead of non-commutative ones. It is necessary to observe the open-string coordinates, especially @xmath376, at the boundary. The amplitude of one-loop tachyons is calculated by means of a tachyon-shaped eigenvalue which is positioned at a lattice (xmath327). In the form of an operator, one-loop amplitudes are obtained by adding a traces of these operators, with propagators inserted in among them. It is thus that the one-loop amplitudes of tachyons and gluons are influenced only by the non-commutability of the world volume. Consequently, in the case of tachyons and gluons only the zero-loop of open string are influenced by the non-commutability of the world volume. The flow of open string is restricted along the upper half of the plane, as shown in figure [upper half of the plane]. ([236] We introduce the open-loop tachyon operator of momentum @xmath135 by @xmath327. Hence the tachyon amplitude, which we call @xmath385 , is given by a sum of the products arranged in cyclically distinct order, keeping their partial cyclic orderings at both ends: To compare the amplitude of the open string one-and-a-half loop ( amplitude of the open-and-a-half loop by the open-and-a-half parameters) we consider a cylinder with a diameter of xmath391 in xmath404 by the conformal transformation xmath405 . see figure xmath405 . two bold vertical lines are identified with each other. xmath406 is mapped to xmath406. xmath406 is mapped to xmath406. We put xmath406. We note that the insertion point of the xmath405 tachyon is set at xmath406. we put xmath408. two bold vertical lines are identified with each other. A closed string with circumference of @xmath409 evolves along the imaginary axis, beginning at the real axis, where it interacts with xmath260 open-string tachyons, and ending at xmath410, where it interacts with xmath81 open-string tachyons. Here a closed string with circumference of @xmath409 recurs along the imaginary axis, from the origin to xmath396, interacting with the vertices inserted at xmath392 or xmath397 tachyons inserted at xmath406 or xmath404 . - it is a scalar field theory on the non-commutative world-volume. in general, scalar field theories on a non-commutative space suffer from the mixing of uv-ir by a non-commutative invariance, which results from the non-commutative. In this section, based on the results obtained so far, we study the uv-ir behaviour of the non-commutative scalar field theory. For this purpose, we start with a brief description of the above zero-slope limit of the one-complex feynman diagram consisting of the corresponding trivalent vertices. The vertices represent the following cubic interaction: @xmath432 Here we introduce the moyal product (an associative non-commutative product) by @xmath433 the feynman integral becomes a little complicated because of the above moyal products. By @xmath434 we introduce the moyal product (an associative non-commutative product) by @xmath434 the feynman rule becomes a little complicated, but the feynman integral can be evaluated by using the standard technique @xcite and translated to eq. (open-string ftl of one-string amplitude) . —for each value of the closed-string parameter we obtain a graph as shown in figure [Open-string diagram] — and these graphs are the set of representations of the conformal classes, and so one may choose other combinations. The above moduli space has several ends — usually there are two ends at xmath25 and xmath18 — if you identify these graphs as representatives , then the open-string parameter is a further source of coordinates of the moduli space. The above moduli space has several ends — for example, we have two ends at xmath25 and xmath18 — so these graphs can be chosen as representatives. the previous zero-slope limit of open-string is related with the end at infinity, as we can see from eq. (Schwinger parameters of scalar field theory) . the graph of the above moduli space is represented by several ends — typically there are two ends at xmath25 and xmath18 — these edges are represented by the open-string parameters . therefore, the open-string parameters give another set of coordinates of the moduli space. this matrix is represented by the open-string parameters. therefore, the open-string parameters give another set of coordinates of the moduli space. After the calculation of the limit, the transformation between the open and the closed parameters of eq. (eq. (open-string ftl of one-tooth) leads to xmath444 and xmath445. As a result, the above zero-slope limit is not identical to the standard, 504420546 that is, the standard of 5012265111811186 , and the special conditional field-side parameter is described by eq. (open-string ftl of one-toothed amplitude) consists of two parts, one of which is known in field- theories, and the other is a strange regularity that originated from non-commutativity. There is important to compare the above zero-slope limit with the preceding one. In eq. (closed-string ftl of one-toothed amplitude) the schwinger propagator is integrated and becomes the propagator of the closed-string tachyon of momentum. The counterpart in eq. (closed-string ftl of one-toothed amplitude) is composed of two parts, one of which is the standard in field theory and the other a curious regularization factor, originated in non-commutativity. - it was originally from the modular transformations ([5] of tachyon correlations] - so it is a stringy effect. - this is the result of modular transformations ( [6] modular trans of tachyon correlations] - this is a stringy effect. - - . . Let xmath464 be the fourier modes of an open-string tachyon field: - xmath465 because this is a real scalar field, the fourier modes satisfy - xmath466, where the line denotes complex conjugation . - now we examine the zero-slope limit of the following function: - jt, - see the zero-slope limit . the method of obtaining the limit of the open-string field is very different from the one used in the present work: the limiting method, however, is not the same as the one used in the present work: it is true that the xmath0 field is vanishing and the limit is different from the corresponding scalar limit of the field theory. - This is a sound effect . . . we introduce some vector and momentum eigenstates of the closed-string, and take some notice of their relation to the boundary states. These eigenstates will play a very important role in the future. “I don’t care about that,” said Patten, “because of the existence of two different currents, we have two operators, namely —— _xmath494_ and ——_xmath494 _ . . .  _     pi   left [Thirty-eight; if _xmath492 is given as a function of _xmath487_, then a regular commutation of closed-string leads to the same commutation relations ([Thirty-eight] . . . . . . . the conjugate operators of @ xmath490 are those operators satisfying @ xmath487_, for the sake of _xmath486_, we may offer them in a similar way to eq. _fr.

[1,2] And to the reader’s convenience, we have attached the dictionary below the link: “xmath502,” where the parts of xmath503 are translated into xmath505; thus, we have xmath506 and xmath507. iii) The eigenstates of the string are indicated by two conditions: (iii) They are eigenstates of the string coordinate operators, @xmath511, where we abbreviate the superscript Xmath260 in the rhs, so we have xmath511 and xmath511 respectively.

In this section we will pursue this possibility . . . First of all, it is expected that the closed string tachyon propagation, including gravitons, will fluctuate the straight line of eq. (i.e., closed string ftl by straight open wilson lines) and slant it into a curved one. This proportion between curves and states will make the sum of these products a perfect integral over the space of curves. analogously, the conventional factorization of closed string amplitudes must be taken first over the perturbative closed string states. in other words, it is expected that there are correlations between the deviation from the straight line and the propagation of closed string states . . . In order to justify the above statement, let's first factorize the string amplitudes by the insertion of a partition of unity . we say that the straight open wilson line is the average . We can say that the straight open wilson line is the average . Then we start by analyzing the integral on the interval between @ xmath625 and @ xmath631 in eq. («General tachyon amplitude – state] – which we do not alter, but in the first four lines we can see the exact value of eq. («General tachyon amplitude – state) . these variables describe the fluctuations of @ xmath621 . this is because @ xmath625 and @ xmath631 in («General tachyon amplitude – state] are rescaled ones, multiplied by dividing the original variables by xmath632. then the whole amplitudes of @ xmath621 will be astounded. We have examined the zero-slope limit of the factorization of («General tachyon amplitude] . we first focus on the integral over @ xmath625 and @ xmath631 in eq. («General tachyon amplitude by boundary state] . Let us first consider the first exponential of the integral. It should be noted that the complicated variables that were originally used to parameterize @ xmath621 do not scale under the limit. The coefficients that are multiplied by the first factors of @ xmath631 are rescaled by multiplying the original variables by xmath632 . , ( theta  theta  g  theta   8  pi  2nq c  frac  n    2nq c   frac  n  2   alpha     right) 27  mbox  det   left    mbox  det   right [24          the end  aligned  ] the other two in the integral have the same form. In this section the study of gauge theory begins. The result of the gluon vertex operator of open-string is introduced in the closed-string theory. It can be calculated by replacing the integration variables with their mean values and become a unity in the zero-slope limit. Then the above factorization reduces to the straight open wilson lines. It is enough to know the behavior of the weights of @xmath637 in their exponents. The last piece we need to estimate is the exponentials whose exponents are bilinear of @xmath669 with the weights, @xmath640. “Locked shell-open-string tachyons are made. We speak of a closed-shell, in which the gluon-arratom operator can be regarded as @xmath667, where @xmath667 and @xmath670 are the momentum and polarization vectors. We write the operator in an exponential form, namely, math677 with @xmath676  non-umber    &  quad  times  prod   n = 1      infty     exp    n = 1    n   n   n   n The operator @ xmath684 is defined as @ xmath685 in which @ xmath684 and @ xmath685 are only the initial modes and take the forms of @ xmath685 in the transform (transform of hvg) which can be found in the same singularity structure as that of the tachyon. Moreover, the one factor which appears in the transverse transformation of hvg is represented by the term (Eq) as an integral of the chiral and anti-chiral parts of @ xmath697, in the form of @ xmath696. ”  ] , in the form of the closed-string tensor xmath692 that has been employed there is transformed into @ xmath693 , the second term is irrelevant, for it is proportional to @ xmath694 . we have a few remarks about this extra factor. The singular factor which appears in the transform of the tachyon vertex operator has been expressed in eq. ([eq]: singular factor as self-contraction of vt]) as the self-contraction between the chiral and the anti-chiral parts of @ xmath9 . so we can express the singular factor in the form of @ xmath696 as a self-contraction of @ xmath696 . We will then examine the ope of @ xmath703 by defining a separate ope function of @ xmath704 by encoding the renormalized tachyon-linear operator @ xmath702 , which in the boundary does not exceed the standard virasoro action for open-string tachyon-linear operators, and ii) the interpretation of the ope function on @ xmath704 by defining a certain renormalized action on @ xmath705 which, by the means of green s function, allows us to introduce the renormalized open-string tachyon-linear operator @ xmath675 , iii) the description of the diffring action on @ xmath705 , which, at the boundary, reduces to the standard virasoro action on open-string tachyon-linear operators, and iii) the reproduction of open-string tachyon amplitudes by the boundary state formalism . The most important thing to say is that the two labels are aligned. . . . so that if a renormalized gluon is given, then he will give a renormalized operator (doing the reverse of renormalized hvg) and a [  2]  . . . if he omits this factor, then in general it is required . . . even if it disappears without the xmath0 field, this factor is surely necessary. . . . a renormalized operator (in the sense of def of renormalized hvg), the right axis gives rise to the axis @ xmath716, and a polarization @ xmath670 for . . . . let us introduce the renormalized operator @ xmath711 by the following subtraction: @ xmath712 in other words, besides the subtraction of the singular factor @ xmath689, a finite subtraction is made by the multiplication of xmath714 . without this subtraction, it is impossible to reproduce even the ordinary virasoro action, which we will discuss below. 0  rangle  non-umber  & &   left ( frac  –  det g –  mu  nu       left)      left ( det g –   mu  nu     right)     left (  det g –  mu  nu    left)    left (  det g –  mu  nu   left)    left (   det g –  mu  nu   right)      left (  det g –    mu  nu     )   left (  det g –  mu  nu  right) –      left (  det g –     mu  nu      –   left) – left (k   mu  + ina   mu  (k)  right)   left ( frac  1  e  t  g  right)   left ( frac  1  e  t  g  right)   left ( frac  1  e  t  g  right)    left (     left (k    mu  - ina a   mu  (k   right)  left ( frac  1  e  t  g  right)   left ( frac  1  e  t  g  right)       nu                      left   right   right         left      left ,            left               left   left    left - - (- ) left (-  e  t  g  right) -  mu     nu    tilde     alpha    nu     nu          nu    nu          in     left (   e   t  g  right)     left (   e  t         left (   e  t  g  right)                                 b total  n = 1   left   k    mu  + i (n-m) a a    mu  + i (n-m) a a    mu  (k)  right        left ( frac  1  e  g     alpha     alpha       alpha                                                                                                     mu              mu    nu We may observe the corresponding (integration) action of the virasoro action on (open-string) gluons of the same momenta and polarity.

We then consider the scattering of the gluons with momenta @xmath307. [Second section: open-string tachyon.] [3]where we put @xmath706. - [4] The radial coordinates of the upper half of the plane (open-string world sheet) are given by @ xmath783 where xmath784 and xmath377 are respectively the complex and radial coordinates of the upper half of the plane (open-string world sheet) . We compare the amplitudes ( aux gluon amplitude by boundary state) of the gluon , taking into account the closed-string propagations along the apex, with the open-string gluon amplitudes . . . the above expression is followed by the contributions of the ghosts, math782 . . . Using these properties, we can write the amplitude in the following form: @ xmath821 Using these coordinates, we can write the amplitude in the following form: @ xmath821 the coordinates in rhs are the insertion points of the auxiliary gluon vertices and provide a parametrization of the diagram. the above virasory action implies: @ xmath821 taking these properties, we can write the amplitude in the following form:  xmath814 the coordinates of the auxiliary gluon vertices are mapped to @ xmath814, which are corresponding to @ xmath814. correspondingly, @ xmath814 are mapped to @ xmath814 by @ xmath814 . , namely,  xmath814. In this section, following the steps of the previous study of the non-commutative scalar field, we investigate the uv behavior of the non-commutative scalar field. The auxiliary parameters @xmath795 are also present in the amplitude ([ aux gluon one-loop by open-string parameter]); they are introduced in order to describe the gluon vertex operators ([def of open-string gluon vertex]) in the auxiliary forms ([def of open-string aux gluon vertex]) and to make the loop calculation tractable. This is in parallel with what we have done in the previous section to get the zero-slope limit ([Open-string ftl of one-loop amplitude]) of the tachyon amplitude. And in order to obtain this amplitude we must add the following field theory parameters ([A] aux gluon one-loop parameters], and we must add the following parameter (a counterpart of the parameter a by a schwinger parameter a by a schwinger parameter a) and the double contribution of the amplitude with respect to the extension. It was also said that schwinger's encyclopdia to xmath826 in the integral came from the schwinger representation of the open-string tachyon propagator, xmath826 . It was also discussed that the encyclopdia in the above integral came from the schwinger representation of the open-string propagator, xmath827. As the field theory amplitude (open-string amplitude of gluon one-loop amplitude) is derived from the appropriate magnitude of the integral (deflation of eq. 4 . 9) , it is compatible with the calculation of the gauge theory, which is found in [39] [40] [41], that is, from the corresponding one-loop amplitude of the non-commutative [42] gauge theory. This power is derived from the scaling relations, [42] [42] . and we derive this limit from the following parameters: xmath831 we set the tensors of open-string tensors at xmath200 and xmath201 to capture the world-volume theory. The auxiliary parameters of the above are the modified ones that are in the integral (eq. gluon one-loop by closed-loop parameters) . this is because the present limit is not expected to be a simple world-line description. As is well known in the field theory of scalar field theory, the zero-slope limit based on the closed-loop parameters describes physics at the trans-loop scale of world-volume theory. The relative scales of these gluons are, as follows, marked. In this limit there are terms describing correlations between two gluons inserted at xmath423 and xmath422. But these correlations are lost in XMPH420, and Gluons become topological in this limit. As can be seen from the expression equivalence with the boundary state of gluon, we keep them intact. They exhibit a striking contrast between the two limits. all the perturbative stringy states of open string contribute to the limit. As was noted earlier in the previous study of the scalar field theory, the zero-slope limit based on the closed string parameters describes physics at the trans-string scale of the world-volume theory. The following sections show the relation of the closed tachyon state with its bpz and bpz dual state. Xmath845 the disk amplitude of the closed tachyon scattering by the closed tachyon state with the gluons is obtained from the edge of the boundary state formalism by integrating the overlap at xmath846; ( sigma  1 , k   ( 1 )  cdots, ( sigma  m , k   m )  right  r  .    nonumber   & .   nonumber      . . .

(Eq: Pnb-shift) and (Eq: Pn-shift) by using operators of the form Xmath989 where xmath508 is the closed-string coordinate operators, and Xmath990 denotes the normal normal ordering of closed-string. [20] here we have used Xmath906. our observations about the poles and the eigenstates seemed to indicate that we may interpret the boundary conditions of open-string to be momentum eigenstates of closed-string, where eigenvalues are delta functions on the boundary circle. this led us to the conjecture: [20] the momentum eigenstates of closed-string are expansions by means of an extension of the eigenvalues , which is observed in the eq. , #1 , b, ; this corresponds to the eq. , where eq.  is the closed-string coordinates, and  (xmath908) is the standard normal ordering of closed-string . to the normal ordering, the eigenvalues are the delta functions of the original boundary. . . . this means that, in place of the normal ordering, the eigenvalues of the eigenstates of the eigenstates are to be rounded up in a smooth curve, by a pre-order. We hereby remark that the eigenstates of the eigenstates of the eigenstates of the eigenstates of the eigenstates of the eigenstates ‘Subsequently,’ said K. M., ‘thanks to all the members of the particle theory group at kekuki during his stay in the summer of 2002. It seems probable that the boundary conditions which are drawn by the legs of the open string are generalized to the function of the relations between open and closed strings. This tensor is called the ‘open’ tensor in the text. The tensors at xmath198 and xmath199 are known as the flat space-time metric and the constant two-form gauge field of closed strings. Moreover, in xcite, the open metric @ xmath993 and the non-commutativity parameter @ xmath754 are obtained from the symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of @ xmath994: @ xmath996 where A xmath1005 or a xmath1007 complex.
