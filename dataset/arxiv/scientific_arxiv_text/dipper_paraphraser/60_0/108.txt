It is also important to know the effects of the physical parameters determining the cooling process. laser- cooling -  in : the simple method of laser- cooling - is shown to be an excellent technique for preparing atoms in the ground state of the harmonic potential  . among the various methods, the raman side-band cooling has shown to be very successful in preparing atoms in the ground state of a harmonic potential  . the process of re-repumping is of a higher order in the ratio  == 2 of the recoil frequency = 5 and the trap frequency = 5; 3 is the mass of the atom, 3 is the wave vector of the one-photon transition. The whole process of re-repumping is a matter of more than one frequency, the ratio 2 is of the recoil frequency =0 and the trap frequency =7, the number of incoherent events required before the atom is finally re-scattered into 0, which greatly increases the motional energy at the end of the optical pumping, which in turn reduces the cooling efficiency . in the lamb-de-Rose regime, where 10 8 , the probability of the motional state is negligible, and, therefore, the system is cooled at a rate of one phonon of energy per cooling cycle. For instance, we consider a three-level atom as in fig. - Scheme1, whose internal level is the ground state (xmath13), a stable or metastable state (xmath14), and a bright state (xmath15) of radiative width (xmath15); xmath17, xmath18 are dipole transitions, with respective probability of decay (xmath19) and @xmath20. a laser driven by rabi frequency (xmath22) drives the transition (xmath18) with rabi frequency (xmath22). In the following section we derive some conclusions, and in the appendix we report the results of our calculations. in particular we show that in some ranges the average effect of multiple photons can be described with an effective wave vector at xmath11 for the “effective” transition @xmath12 of two-level transition. , for the principle of xcite we have applied the sum rules, and hence we have inferred the cooling efficiency for the lamb- dicke regime and will discuss the results outside the lamb- dicke regime in connection with the proposed  xcite. This article is organized in the following manner. The interaction of the ion with the laser light is described by the operator @xmath32 in the second order perturbation theory @xcite, and this three-level structure is reduced to two levels, i.e., the excitation of @xmath32, and @xmath34 the dipole-raising operator, @xmath36 its neighbour, and @xmath41 the position of the atom. Then, in the limit of @xmath40, the master equation for the density matrix @xmath43, the projection of @xmath23 on the subspace @xmath43, can be rewritten as @xcite: @xmath45 -  gamma e  left [ j e  rho  rho  right] [  label  master1  ] with effective hamiltonian @xmath47, @xmath51 jump operators, defined as: where @xmath50 and where @xmath51 the solution of the solution of the solution of the equation, with the result that @ xmath50 a jump operator, whose name : What follows is the inverse of the equation '' (Six) which is a sum over all possible paths of the scattering event weighted by their respective probabilities. For instance, for a pulse of duration Xmath62, we can substitute Xmath56 for Xmath63 and assume that the atom has been scattered into Xmath0 at the end of the pulse. Hence, in the equation 'Six' we have the sum over all possible paths of scattering event weighted by their respective probabilities. ' Xmath72,' for example, and ''" Xmath73, the atom is divided into xmath73. Xmath74 - xmath73, where xmath74 is the initial motion of the atom, and ' ' ' xmath73', with xmath74 atom initial energy, and according to Xmath74, the atom was finally scattered into xmath0. And for @ xmath77 the following relation is written:  s  rangle = d n (s) . [Note]: if, by means of the explicit form ([tilde],]    ] = xmath77 ,  xmath79, is the probability that the atom is found in the state @ xmath80 at @ xmath59, given the initial state @ xmath81, and @ xmath82 . Using the explicit form of @ xmath79 («demo] ,             ] («demo] ) we get the expression: @ xmath82, where  label  width1  end  aligned   ]           ] , where @ xmath82 is the lamb- dicke parameter.             ] where @ xmath88 is the energy of recoil, a sense of the energy of the refracted. ... if @xmath101 is of a lesser level than @xmath102, a much greater degree than @xmath98 ... We see that @xmath11 is the scattering process for almost any branching ratio, while for @xmath98, an appreciable difference is already visible at @xmath99. - from the well-known solution of the rate equation @xcite, the diffusion coefficient affects the stable state average vibrational number @xmath106, which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient ... from the well-known solution of the rate equation @xcite, the diffusion coefficient affects the average vibrational number @xmath106, which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient . - from the well-known solution of the rate equation @xcite, the diffusion coefficient affects the steady state average vibrational number @xmath106, which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient ... outside the lamb- dicke regime, when Xmath107 is comparable to, or greater than Xmath98, a substantial difference is already visible at xmath99 . Moreover, the coarse grained dynamics of the system can be described by a rate equation for the motional states @xmath103 projected on @xmath0, where the temperature (the temperature) is the real part of the sum of two terms: one corresponding to the component of the fluctuation spectrum of the dipole force at frequency xmath6 (@xmath104) , the other to the diffusion coefficient, which spontaneously emerges from the excited state @ xcite , this latter term is proportional to the squared lamb- dicke parameter for the incoherent scattering, and thus to - if we take a second look at the phase-composition scheme of fig. 3 (a), we have added to fig. 3 (a) and added to the phase-composition scheme of fig. 3 (a) , where we have added to fig. 3 (a) , where we have added to fig. 3 (a) to fig. 3 (b) where we have added to fig. 3 (a) a further channel of decay from @xmath2 to a stable or metastable state @xmath117, with probability of decay @xmath119, where @xmath120, @xmath121 are the probability of decay on @xmath122, respectively. a laser resonantly drives the transition @xmath123 with the rabi frequency @xmath124 . . . in this limit the master equation obtains the form @xmath125. . . . Theeffective hamiltonian is now: math129 with math130. In this way, for example, we have defined eqs. ( Center1 ) , (width1 ) where now the probability math19, math19, is now math143 and math143 is the rate of scattering in the excited state math141 math143 . math145 . if math137 is such that math143, then the solution math . ( center1 ) ( width1 ) is also applicable to this case, where now math19 is defined as math144, and the probability math19 of decaying into math0 is math145 . - as a result ([Result] ] ) it is shown that the heat is minimum for math146, which can be obtained by selectively choosing the laser intensity of the repumping lasers, or by simply removing the degeneracy of the degeneracy.
