There are precise cross sections of high energy nuclear reactions expressed in terms of the nuclear parton distribution functions (npdfs), so that precise npdfs are necessary for discovering new phenomena in high energy reactions. As a matter of fact, these cross sections are often based on nuclear parton distribution functions and neglect nuclear modification, though it is well known that nuclear corrections can be as large as 20 % in small nuclei of high energy. The npdf studies are also useful for studying heavy ion collisions, such as the colour of glass condensate, the suppression of Xmath8 , and the loss of parton energy . However, there are still some issues in deep inelastic scattering . . . for example, a strange xmath11 value was observed in the neutrino-iron scattering by the nutev collaboration . . . this could be attributed to the nuclear correction difference between the xmath12 and xmath13, because the iron target is used in the nutev calculations. Besides, it is an issue that nuclear corrections are different from the ones expected from electron and muon scattering by recent nutev studies . . . " [52] related to the nuclear binding mechanism and, perhaps, to a nucleonic modification in a nuclear medium [52] . Consequently, it is desirable to obtain accurate npdfs, which are obtained in a model-dependent way, to calculate precise nuclear cross-sections. one would like to obtain accurate npdfs, which are obtained in a model-independent way, for the calculation of precise nuclear cross-sections. However, these calculations are insufficient at this stage. because the pdfs are related to the nonperturbative aspect of chromodynamics (qcd) , theoretical calculations have been performed by the lattice qcd or the phenomenological model. first, the available experimental data are inaccessible. in the Hera experimentation, the experiments of the hadron - electron ring accelerator (hera) have given experimental data for structure functions at small values in a wide range of xmath6; but these data do not exist for nuclei. second, the analytical technique is not well established. npdfs are expressed in terms of a number of parameters, which are then determined by a complex analysis of the nuclear data. npdfs are expressed in terms of various parameters, which are then determined by a system of nuclear cross-sections and bjorken - xmath6 dependency. Further, the higher-cluster effects might be important in the small - xmath7 region. In this way, parametric studies have recently been developed for the npdfs, but they are inadequate. , so that we have to extend our analyses to refs. xcite. There are related studies on nuclear shadowing and global analysis of the structure functions. , the details of our analysis are explained in refs. xcite, the results are explained in sec. , the results are explained in sec. , our results are adb. . . . , the optimal npdfs are determined by analysing experimental data of the npdfs and the drell-yan process for nuclear targets.

In this work, the flavors symmetric antiquark distributions are assumed, and the distribution type xmath29 is indicated as Xmath12, xmath13, xmath35, xmath36, xmath37 and xmath37: xmath38, and Xmath37 is assumed in refs. Here, too, are not neglected the number of flavor subsciplines. The numbers of flavor on xmath32 (and at xcite) are considered. , a given phase is introduced, and the whole model is described in its logical configuration. The modification in question has the following functional form: @ xmath53, @ xmath54, @ xmath55, @ xmath56, and @ xmath57 are parameters. The inverse is the substitution of nuclear radiation with a square root: @ xmath5— where @ xmath5—is a normalized phase. At xmath5—we test the nucleon with various powders and, though the results are not significantly different, they are not at all different. The integral between antiquarky and gluon modification is assumed to be the following: @ xmath5—where @ xmath5—and @ xmath56—are parameters. The modification of the nuclear radiation is assumed to have the following functional form: @ xmath5—where @ xmath5—and @ xmath56—given a minute functional form, and @ xmath57—relates to the fermi-motion part of the equation. in our cteq studies (a joint theoretical and experimental project on phenomenology and phenomenological tests) we are using the initial scale of @ xmath5 [1, 1, 2, 3, 4], where @ xmath5 = 1 in the fraction ... as will be seen in the result section, the antiquark and gluon modifications cannot be determined from the present data at @ xmath57 .

Besides the parameters xmath13, xmath77, xmath78, and xmath79 are taken to be xmath15 dependent: xmath80 because the extreme values xmath65 and xmath66 are almost independent of xmath15, according to the data of xmath16, and also from the previous studies xcite, they are taken to be xmath17 dependent. In addition, xmath81 and xmath82 are specified in the antiquark and gluon distributions as follows: because the gluon distributions can not be calculated from the present data, the parameter xmath83 is taken xmath84, as it was assumed in the previous analyses xcite. Besides, Xmath85 and xmath80 are taken as xmath11 as xmath11, since the extreme values of xmath65 and xmath66 are almost independent of xmath11 according to the xmath16 data and also from the previous analyses xcite , they are assumed to be independent of xmath11 . First, the ratios @ xmath88 (@ xmath89) are from the fermilab e665 , and the e866 / nusea . . . a third, the drell-yan is from the fermilab e772 , and the e866 / nusea collaboration . . . . these ratios are taken from the measurements by the emc e665 , the bcdms e772 , the fermilab e665 , and the nmc e866 / nusea collaboration. The data for the deuteron-proton ratio are added because precise nuclear modifications are needed in the deuteron, for example, at the relativistic heavy ion collider (rhic) . . . therefore, the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions in eqn ([eqn]: wpart) are necessary for a successful fit and for the detection of modifications in the deuteron.

In the higher figures the theoretical curves and uncertainties are calculated for the ratio of xmath160 and drell-yan ratios of the xmath157 type, and the lower one is taken for the ratio of xmath157 type because experimental drell-yan ratios are smaller. As we can see, the @ xmath14 values, 53 .0 , 64 .9 and 29 .6 in the nlo, are especially large for xmath160, xmath162 and xmath140, in comparison with the number of their data, 17 , 24 and 9 in their nlo, according to table [tab: chi2] . ; title = 'fig f2 - dy' ; the lower figure shows the ratios of xmath154, where xmath159 and xmath139 are shown, respectively, compared with xmath154.

It is interesting that the nlo band of the xmath16 ratio is a little smaller in comparison with the nlo band at xmath6; but, the magnitudes of the two errors are similar in the region, xmath165 . the comparison shows that both the nlo and the parametrization can explain the xmath6 dependence of the calcium data. . . .

The extreme values (@ xmath65, xmath66) are assumed to be independent of @ xmath15 in our current analysis, as explained in sec. __paramet_, so that they are the same in fig. In this case, the figure shows that valence-quadrio distributions are well defined in the wide range, i.e., i.e., at xmath179. Because the valence-quadrio is a special nucleus, it is necessary to explain its results separately, in sec. [deuteron]. It is also interesting to observe that the valence-quadrio distributions are almost the same. The measurements of valence-quadrio variations at xmath179 are performed by the accurate measurements of valence-quadrio modification at xmath178. The anti-shadowing part in the region at xmath180 is also determined by the valence-quadrio analysis, for the anti-quadriocy is almost non-neutral according to the drell-yan measurements. Further, the jlab (the national accelerator for physics) will provide data that could constrain the nuclear valence-quadriocy, especially at the small-size-size-size-size_ xmath6__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The neutron distributions are important for discussing the properties of quark- hadrons in heavy-ion reactions, so that they have to be experimentally proved. To determine these neutron distributions accurately, precise measurements are needed, and the penalty for the appalling degree of correction is described in sec. pb._ . . if we are to resolve the distributions of the gluons, it is necessary to obtain the accurate calibration of xmath0 @ xcite. In the same energy region, the gsi-fair (the German Stazheta-anstalt for antiproton and ion research) @ xcite and the fermilab @ e906 @ xcite should be of great value for the detection of nuclear antiquarks in the whole range – xmath6.

Although the uncertainties are large for the antiquark and the gluon distributions at mid and high @ xmath6, they are not very observable in Figs. [xmath 1] and [xmath 2] are shown for the proton, lithium, aluminum, iron, and lead at xmath 7. [xmath 7] The powder antiquark distributions vanish in the isoscalar nuclei (at xmath 1 ) . In the Xmath 6 distributions (Wu xmath ) are shown. "Electronic density is usually independent of the mass, which means that the average separation of nuclei is constant in nuclei. However, the deuteron is a special nucleus because it has a radius of about four fm, which is much larger than the average separation of ordinary nuclei (at xmath193 fm). These differences are due to several reasons. The first is that the analyzed experimental data are slightly different. The second is that the strange-quark distributions are produced by the dglap evolution, by assuming xmath192 at the first @xmath7 scale, and the charm distributions are neglected in ref. These differences lead to the discrepancies in the modifications of the gluons. The calculated npdfs and their uncertainties can be calculated by using our code, which is located on our web site at xcite . if one needs to calculate the npdfs and their uncertainties at the first @xmath99 scale, one can read the instructions in appendix . . . . . . the shadowing of ref. @ xcite, which was used in the mrst analysis, is 1 . 1 % at @ xmath6 = 0 . 015 and 5 % at @ xmath195, as shown in the table [Tangible] d.]. Now, as a matter of fact, exact nuclear modifications are important for examining quark-hadrone interactions, for example, in heavy-ion collisions such as deuteron-gold reactions, as against deuteron-hadrone reactions at rhic@ xcite. More importantly, such corrections tend to be more significant in comparison with the theoretical models, because the nuclear modifications obtained by hkn-04 correspond to 6 and 8 % corrections in antiquark-and-gluon distributions at small- and at xmath6 (at xmath196) and if at xmath6=4 gev at xmath10 and if at xmath195=5 % of the nuclear modifications (and as for the reflections of Xcite), a few in the valence-quark distributions are also suitable for the discussion of gottfried-sum-rule-hundred- rule violation, because the deuteron targets are usually based on xcite. ‘ ... drell–yan . . . ’ —— — ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— if this shadowing is not realistic, the nucleonic pdfs of the Mlle. should contain nuclear effects in small xmath6 xmaths. in this way, the nucleonic pdfs should contain some deuteron effects. The adjustments are calculated in a vector-meson-dominated system, and the shadowing in the Mlle. is about 1 percent at xmath202 according to this model; if this shadowing is not a real correction, then the nucleonic pdfs of the Mlle. should contain some deuteron effects. , and this is the possible reason why the second analysis yields a smaller xmath-142 value.

The solid, dotted, and dashed curves express the results of the analyses 1 (again xmath200) and 2 (again xmath-201), and 3 (again xmath199). In the third experiment the modification parameter xmath199 is determined from the global analysis. This modification parameter xmath199 is determined from the experimental tests. No deuteron modification is visible in analysis 2 as it is obvious from the definition of eq. (eqn: w-d) . There is a tendency that deviations from the data become larger as the deuteron modifications increase. There are various analyses that agree on the same results in the middle and the upper regions. All the curves of the analysis 1 ( @xmath200) and the analysis 2 (@xmath201) are within the uncertainty bands of the analysis 3 (@xmath199 = free) , though the analysis 1 curves are at the edge of the error bands at the lower regions of the error bands. This is due to the error of the parameter @xmath199 , which is a parameter which makes the calculations in the other direction also consistent. , therefore, they all explain the experimental results . . . the changes of the pdfs for the deuteron are shown in fig. [2][3][5][6][7][7][7][8][9][10][10][10][10][10][10][12][13] The solid and dashed curves obtained by the analyses 1, and their uncertainties are shown by the shading. In contrast to the theoretical values in table d . . . , we can see that the antiquark shadow is reduced by about 30 % at @ xmath7 = 4 gev @ xmath10, which might be slightly smaller than the theoretical ones. The adjustments in fig. npdfs - d are not very serious because deuteron changes may be somewhat partially included in the nucleonic PDFs. This suggests that precise deuteron changes cannot be found at this stage. The ratio of the antiquark shadow to the negative half is about 2 % at @ xmath214, and the valence-quark effect is about 1 % at @ xmath7 = 0 and @ xmath7 = 4 gev @ xmath10 in the Matst fit. * But, in this case, the valence-quark effect is about 2 % at @ xmath214, and the valence-quark effect is about 1 % in the Matstfit. These two corrections ( 2 % and 0 %) are slightly different from the assumed correction ( 1 % at @ xmath7 = 0 and @ xmath7 = 4 gev @ xmath10) in the Matst fit. The uncertainty peaks in Fig. 7–“see the curve,” “The conclusion is that the uncertainties of the determined npdfs have been computed according to the hessian method. For the valence-quadrark distributions there were little to no differences, but they were large at xmath6 . [12] and in the valence-quadrunk distributions. The nuclear modifications were discussed in comparison with the experimental data of xmath5; however, this was difficult, because deuteron effects could be partially contained in the nucleonic trigs. The accuracy of the nuclear trigs was estimated by using the codes in the table [13] ; the npdfs and their uncertainties can be calculated by using the codes in the table [14], and the uncertainties are calculated by the hessian method. the first thing is that the uncertainties were obtained for both lo and nlo, so that we can discuss the nlo improvement in the determination. nuclear modifications were discussed in comparison with the experimental data of @xmath5 . But it is difficult to obtain accurate modifications in this stage, since the deuteron effects may be partially contained in the nucleonic pdfs . an appropriate nucleonic pdf analysis is necessary in addition to accurate measurements of the ratio xmath5. our npdfs and their uncertainties are calculated by the codes in ref. xcite.

The numerical values of the nucleus for each given exon at exon xmath6 and exon xmath7 can be obtained for any given exon, for any given exon, for any given exon, for any given exon, if distributions are needed at different exons, one has to formulate the npdfs by using one’s own extension; if one does not have such an extension, then one has to formulate one’s own extension by means of the code in appendix b. As regards the connoisseurs of nuclear data and their uncertainty, the example given above has been used as an example for the estimation of the uncertainties of the npdfs.
