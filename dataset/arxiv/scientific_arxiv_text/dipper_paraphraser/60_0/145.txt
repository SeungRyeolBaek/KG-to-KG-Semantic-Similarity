There are now some experimental experiments on the ultracold wave manipulation in a microchip or on magnetized surfaces xcite. In this type of experiment, the quantum nature of the dilute atoms dominates, in the case of the classical, and in these experiments a precise wave modulation is obtained. In this work, we present the perturbations of the wave by the waveguides with idealized perturbations, in which the transverse potentials are shifted in the direction of the wave. We can understand this by way of an idealized perturbation of the transverse potentials. Here, we introduce the schrdinger wave mechanics of the waveguides with a step-like, barrier-like and well-like potential. We study in this study the effect of the direction of the transverse elongation of a bose-Einstein condensate (bec) in a waveguide located near the surfaces xcite, in part, owing to the defect of the wire geometry xcite . This research was motivated in three ways. First, the recent experiments have shown a significant fragmentation of a bec in a waveguide located close to the surfaces xcite, which is attributed at least in part to the omission of the excitations that the wire fabrication process generates. Secondly, to understand some of the limitations of atom optics devices that are based on variations of the waveguide potential, a dynamic-based radial chopping method has been developed. This radial chopping method has already been well studied in the literature, as it has been experimentally proven that a perturbation in a waveguide leads to the transverse excitation of a bec . a common pair of atom-cutter wire configurations that can create a waveguide by modifying the transverse confinement, where, if the source and propagation were to be changed, we should be able to calculate the maximum amplitude and the minimum power of the transmitted modes. we consider a simple harmonic oscillator (sho) confining potentials, which, for barrier-like or well-like effective potentials, are given by xmath1 the barrier , for the power-effects - equivalent to an effective 2d problem, the waveguides are constituted of a combination of three-wire configurations, wherein the spacing between the wires is abruptly changed, so that the height and the position of the average minimum remained constant along the waveguide , while the information about the relative energy and the influence of the modes - this basic possibility could be obtained by modifying the transverse confinement, where knowledge of the transverse excitation probability in the abrupt and linear limits of the waveguide is useful. for the ground-state waves, during the adversities, the present results show that the spectra rapidly elapses from single-moded to multi-moded, with significant propagation and reflection of excited modes. the oblique pressure passes from the lead waveguides to the bend and behaves like a potential well. The high energy limit is reached by the stream, and we present a simple model for the distribution of the modes, which combines the overlap of the modes with the multi-path interference of the modes. If the target frequency is xmath6 or xmath7, then the sound should be of the direction of the pipe. The solid lines at xmath10 and xmath11 should be vertical, but the lines are drawn at an angle to show the lateral transition of the leads. The powers and coordinates of the leads and of the transverse sho potential at xmath9 are given in Fig. . [Figure 1.4] energy levels for the leads, indicated by the equator. The properties of potentials in eq. (eqn: pots2d) are symmetrical in xmath12, so that parity in xmath12 is preserved, thus simplifying the present analysis and discussion considerably. The fundamental physics is the same, and we decided to use parity to sparsely perturb the incoming waves by preserving their width in the (even) oscillator mode. In this model all coupling between modes is done by matching regions. We, therefore, have taken advantage of the symmetrical potentials to separate the force of incoming waves into the two directions of xmath.

The equations for the two double potentials are given in the first part, while the second part, on the other hand, is given in the third part, which is a single bridge, as there are no exponentials in the matrix elements, and in addition, all the coefficients are explicitly solved. The third part, on the other hand, combines the multiple-mode transmission and reflection probabilities of the three basic potentials: the step-like potential, the barrier-like potential, and the well-like potential. While the second part, on the other hand, omits intermediate coefficients (ie. @xmath38 and @xmath39) is universally prone to fail at the smallest of the perturbations included in this paper, the second part, on the other hand, is well suited to the step-like potential. The second part, on the other hand, uses the second part to find the optimal coefficient, and has sufficient closed channels to ensure the closeness of the lines of the whole range of geometry and energies shown in this paper. Besides, the second part applies to the third part, because the different geometrys vary greatly, and the second part does not include a complete series of sub-domains of the sub-domains, the third part is not complicated. The determinations of the second part of the total frequency of the three basic geometries are given in this section: the sho-like potential, the barrier-like potential, and the well-like potential. “Examine the frequency of @ xmath47 as a function of @ xmath17. The arrows labelled by xmath47 indicate the maxima. (b) The overlaps of the sho functions at four frequencies: @ xmath50 (squiggles), @ xmath51 (filled-triangle), @ xmath52 (clumpy-triangle), and @ xmath53 (circles). Moreover, since the frequency of @ xmath47 is increasing, the overlap with each excited mode increases monotonically and reaches a maximum when the characteristic equation, @ xmath59, is satisfied. The lines between dots in b are added to guide the eye; as for the frequencies of (a) and (b) , the frequencies of (a) and (b) are given in a relative measure to @ xmath15. Moreover, because of the symmetry of the ratio of @ xmath41 and @ xmath68, there is a second maxima of @ xmath48. Besides, since the roots of the ratio of @ xmath41 are symmetrical, there is also a second maxima of @ xmath48, at @ xmath68 . Its origin, the upper state of the body, resides in the ground, resides in a short range of energies in Fig. . The energy of a ground wave is shown in Fig. . (A) shows xmath72 and xmath79 the transmission probability into the ground, and the sum of the transmission probability into the excited modes, respectively. The crosses in Fig. a and b show the analytic transmission and reflection probabilities for the case of xmath52 (i.e. height 8 cm) , and the total energy in Fig. b is shown in fig. a and b is shown, for the range of xmath17 (as fig. b) , and is shown, respectively, as the fields open, reflected out into the ground in fig. c. , as the fields open, the reflected out into the excited modes , as in fig. c. As each refraction threshold opens, the reflected out into the excited modes in fig. . [a] - The radiance of the ground, and of the reflection of the ground, are marked in fig. . . [b] as each refraction threshold opens, reflected in the excited modes in fig. . . . Even in the case of a vertical bec, for example, the eigenvalues of the six modes in the ground mode have their moments equal, as compared to the eigenvalues of the four phases, @ xmath87, whereas in the case of the two pairs of forms, at xmath86, the momenta of the lower two modes is approximately the same on both sides of the step, @ xmath87. The projections of similar multimodes have also been theoretically studied in the case of a swell of a bec, from a microtrap to a waveguide, @ xcite, with a special emphasis on the effects of atom-atom interactions. The following equation ([eqn]: project) is described as the high-energy limit of the matrix elements of xmath86, namely the number of channels involved, as a result of eq. ([eqn]] ([eqn]: [eqn]: given that the overlaps limit the number of channels, the matrix elements which dominate the matrix of @ xmath 40 are then @ xmath88, while @ xmath89 . a) shows the probability of the same four step potentials as fig. (The measure is 1010102) with the best set of figures: Figures 1020 and 2015 to show that the transmitted direction, i.e. the forward movement, between @ xmath103 and @ xmath104, increases toward asymptotes of 1010 in agreement with eq. (eqn: project)). For example, the difference in wave functions of the three modes for 1010 is particularly severe, for 101010106, 10104, 10107, 10107. For the four different waveguides shown here, the limits are: 1010106, 1010101010101010510100, 1010101010010301050[41] in the ground and the ground plane, are both equal, in the whole amount of xmath82, in the magnitude of the constriction, i.e. the expansion, from 10101110101010101051010101010105, this result also holds for the universal 11010101010101010, and although this is not shown here, the transmission and reflection modes are in the same way, as in the multi-channel system. The legend for the frequencies is the same as figs. [Ganx] and figs. [Ganx] is shown in fig. [Ganx] . The Xmath block with the xmath block, the xmath block, the xmath block, the xmath block, the xmath block, the xmath block and the xmath block are shown in fig. [Ganx] . a little upper-case angle, the xmath block. The Xmath block, as the case is called, can be seen at a distance of Xmath, and at frequencies that change from xmath42 to xmath2 and back to xmath42, the pulses are visible in all of the spectrum at a low energy due to the resonance matching condition of xmath 118. The frequencies that change from xmath42 to xmath2 and back to xmath42, which we call 'transmission - heat'. The numbers in 'a' and 'b' are the analytic transmission and reflection probabilities of a 1 d potential for a case of xmath116 (ie, height - xmath - 118 and a background potential - xmath - Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. fig.

This behavior is also observed in circular waveguide bends, in which the amount of excitation can be reduced by changing the angle swept by the bend to the point where the combined phase difference between the x-rays of the three modes is a multiple of x-rays . Similarly, the mode excitation could be suppressed by reducing the angle of the bend so that the sum of the phase difference between the x-rays of the three modes is a multiple of x-ray131. Thus, the transmission and reflection probabilities of both potentials with the length of the well to x-ray (x-ray, energies) are derived from Fig. . . . fig. - well with energy . . . in both cases we choose x-ray54 as the reference oscillator to simplify the comparison with the barrier X-rays of the previous section. The scattering of a well is complicated by bound states, which translate into feshbach resonances in a multichannel problem. A conventional waveguide, as the circular waveguide, lies slightly lower than the connective leads of the curve, which creates very weakly bound states and energetically narrow resonances. In our work on the circular waveguide bend @ x-ray x-ray x-ray x-ray , the maximum possible deviation between the lead and the bulge energy thresholds is enormous, and thus multiple narrow resonances can be created below the thresholds. The transmission and reflection probabilities of these potentials with well length of x-ray “Section e” is the same as a. fig. [] a radial well, of xmath123 is also shown in Fig. []  p[lf]: a step, with energy scaled. as was the case with the circular bend study e. a. Xcite, the reflection resonances beneath the second excited mode (i.e., below xmath136 for xmath133, and below xmath138 for xmath134) do not result in complete reflection, due to the less conductive coupling between the ground and the second excited mode, and due to the existence of different pathways to reflection. As is seen in the circular bend study of xcite, the reflection resonances below the second excited mode (i.e., below xmath137 for xmath133, and at xmath138 for xmath134) are not complete, because of the reduced coupling between the ground and the second excited mode and the existence of alternate paths to reflection. the two-mode model is generally an acceptable approximation at higher energies when the total reflection probability has fallen below the total excited mode transmission probability, and also when the many narrow reflection resonances have no more influence. , 18_Said the -26_-, the -34____________________________________________________ at xmath142 (@xmath143) where the total probability of reflection was 140______________________________________________, _to ______, _to ____________ . By means of time-invariable solutions of the Schrdinger equation, a large number of experiments were conducted on the ground, using such devices as waveguides, passing through microstructures, and studying the consequences of the erupting potential of atoms, and simply testing the behavior of a few simple geometries. These results of this investigation are in contrast to single-moded systems, with the exception of some of the slightest perturbations at the lowest temperatures. The high energy of the wave through an abrupt potential is equivalent to xmath0 energy propagation of waveguides, which is carried out in projections extending out through a channel of high voltage. , although, to our knowledge, the calculations for such electron waveguides have not been discussed at all, high energy and abrupt potentials and reflections. the trigonometrics were compared with the multimoded and the polygonometrics of the 2d factor. Then, a new condition was introduced to account for high energy/stiff potentials, to include a problem of high energy transmission through microstructures with multiple interfaces, in order to balance asymmetrical dielectrics. lccccc lcccccc &                                                    - &            , 1 , 1   ,     ,  , ,      , , , ,   , , , 57858 @ xmath158 - 0 . 00264476 & 9 . 00274476 & 9 . 00264476 & 9 . 0555 @ xmath158 - 0 . 849706 & 3 . 7386 @ xmath154 - + 1 & 0 . 00274476 & 9 . 00274192 & 3 . 00274192 & 3 . 7813 @ xmath158 - 0 . 749707 & 3 . 7813 @ xmath158 - 0 . 00274476 & 4 . , - . - - 1 & 0 . 00274476 & 2 . 0 - 0 - 2 & 0 . 00274192 & 3 . 0555 @ xmath158 - 0 . 00277476 - +1 & 0 . - 0 - 1 & 0 . 00277479 & 4 . It is worth mentioning that some of the subjects on which this method has been applied have been infrequently discussed by wu et al. , for example, in the formulation of a system of a number of circular bends (the method is constructed by making the sum of a number of matrices). The numerical results of solving @ xmath168 are also given in table [tab: transconv], and although unitarity results in the single-channel calculation, it is still more unstable than @ xmath169 .
