"Eos and Indra are shortly followed. By comparing their reactions, it is possible to obtain slightly different kinetic energy curves, with the plateau excluding most cases. The kinetic energy curves of the neutrons were calculated from 1980 to 1995, and the first experiment of the aladins was performed in 1995 by the aladins. As a result of the close kinship between the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the van der Waals forces, there is a possibility of a liquid-gas transition in the nuclear matter. An indisputable factor in these discrepancies is the precision of the measurements, and the finite-size effects of the caloric curve resulting from the dependence of the equilibrated sources [ xmath5] on the type of the reaction. While the theoretical calculations of this problem had been conducted at the beginning of 1980, the first experimental assessment of the nuclear kinetics was conducted in 1995 by the aladin group. This inference was in agreement with the theoretical proof of the existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. Thus, we now have an important non-equilibrium part, which has been proposed as an important element of the “non-equilibrium” part. In the second place, the recent reevaluation of the aladin group on the neutron energy in the emitted neutrons produced a correction of about 10 @ xmath6 (for the reaction in question, Xmath1 and Xmath1) ; more importantly, it was proven that the number of spectator parts increased by about 30 @ xmath6 in the period from 600 to 1000 mev / nucleons. The problems we have already mentioned are based on the principle of a certain degree on which we have to distinguish between the equilibrium and the unavoidable portion of the measured excitation energies. The latter are completely deformed in the sense that, for nuclear excitation, the model is not sufficiently qualified by microcanonical principles. Thus, we shall remark the following: a) the experimental discrete energy levels replace the flux density for the fragments with xmath10 (in the previous version of the model a thomas fermi-type flux density was used for all particle excited states) . This latter was replaced by the degeneracies of the discrete energy levels, xmath11 (in this instance xmath11 signifies the spin of the element). These developments should be regarded as strictly in compliance with the microcanonical constraints of the physical system, which, in the case of nuclear multifragmentation, are strictly microcanonic. xcite the present paper deals with some refinements and improvements of the model proposed in xcite, and also the use of the model in its new version in the interpretation of the experimental data of the aladin group xcite . iii) Section iii presents the new temperature curves, and the first comparison (and performed with this model) of heat capacity at constant volume (@xmath8), represented by the constant temperature and the temperature of the system, and comparing the results of these models with the recent experimental heliotopic temperature curve . In order to take into account the increasing life-time of fragments (the standard duration of a fragmentation event) the extraction energy is to be increased in the amount of the energy . As a result of the precise nature of the multifragmentation analysis, the fraction of the emitted fragments to the xmath24 limit was found to be sufficiently small, so that the sequential evaporation was perfectly applicable. according to the weisskopf theory @xcite (extending to account for particles larger than xmath23), the probability of evaporating a particle from an evaporating nucleus is proportional to the number of particles : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the stable excited states of the fragment at its xmath24 generating (a upper limit of their emission is generally at 7 - 8 mev) , math28 is the kinetic energy of the pair formed in the center of mass (c m) frame, math29 and math30 respectively the mass of the pair and the separation energy of the particle math24, and finally math31 is the inverse reaction cross section. For the inverse reaction cross section we have used the optical model based parametrization (see for example cite ) . at the second event of the primary break-up simulation, the whole chain of evaporation and the subsequent break-up is monte carlo simulated. For this reason, the wigner- seitz approach to the coulomb is employed, which consists of a semi-linear energy field. . . . cv, to which it is necessary to add: cv - a (a) a, cv - a (b) a. d-f., to which the following are applied: cv, d-f, cv -cv - cv, d-f, d-f-cv, cv-cv - (a) . . . it is evident that the whole chain of evaporation and of the secondary evaporation has been described by cv-cv. This is the wigner-tunz approach to the coulomb interactions, where xmath40 and xmath42 denote the mass and the charge of the source nucleus, and the resulting fragments have the index - - , xmath43 -  - 1 - ] . . . it can be seen that the curve  xmath52 and                 left   left ( frac32 n c                                  , and a corresponding model   =  so munát  bej2 2  2  right   left    left (  frac32 n c -   frac52   left)  frac1        2   right    right        ,       ,      ,   ] , the two curves can be very well identified by comparing the calculated heliotopic temperature and the recently observed experimental temperatures, - xcite : @ xcite, using the criterion '' = ' , '' - @ xcite, for the comparison of the calculated heliotopic temperature and the I have seen this, and the resulting diagrams show that there is a close relation between the estimated equilibration of the sources and the experimental data, given in Fig. 3. a direct comparison of the heli calculated isotopic temperature curve with the aladin calculated isotopic temperature curve, recently assessed by the aladin group, is made. It is possible to see that the comparison between the equilibrated source and the experimental data is not unaffected by the deviation of the measured equilibrium of the target to the various experimental lines of the process of the bombardment of the particles. The error in the calculations corresponding to xmath65 and the experimental data, at 600, 800 and 1000 mev / nucleons, is very good. It should also be noted that apart from the smm predictions @xcite, the quantification of this latter model is much smaller, and therefore the equilibrium of the observed equilibrium is closer to the experimental line of the bombarding of the particles to which the present model has been assigned, and so the predicted equilibrium is closer to the experimental line of the 600 mev / nucleons . the resulting fig. 4 is a function of     . The observed agreement is very good . the contoured curve derived from the new model is in the broader aspect of the plot, with a distinctive plateau of motion. . . . – evaluates the equilibrated source sequence @ xmath67 and use the criterion of reproducing both @ xmath68 and @ xmath69, and by comparing them with the experimentally evaluated excitation energy, a oblique part of the experimentally measured excitation energy has been identified in that region, clearly indicated by the sharp maxima of the @ xmath52 and _xmath53 curves. g. fai and j. randrup, nucl. a * 404 * 149* (in 1986); comp. phys . . . b * 140 * , 149* (in 1986); l. p . csernai, g. fai, j. randrup, and h. stocker, phys . b * 140 * , 149 * , 265 (in 1985) . y . g. j . pochodzalla et al. , lett. sent> raduta, phys. c * 59 *, 323 (1998) . j . p bondorf, a . . raduta, phys. c * 59 *, 323 (1998) . j . p bondorf, a . . iljinov, i . n. mishustin, j . p bondorf, r . donangelo and k . sneppen, phys. a475 *, 663 ( 1987) . i . dostrovsky, z . fraenkel and g . . . phys. a475 *, 663 ( 1987) . v weisskopf, phys. s. s. , - v . weisskopf, phys. s. d. h. raduta and ad . r. raduta, phys. c. 56 *, 133 ( 1995) . j. randrup and s . koonin, nucl. a471 *, 355c ( 1987) . j . p. bondorf, a . . iljinov, i . n. mishustin, j . . bondorf, r . donangelo and k . sneppen, nucl. a475 *, 663 ( 1987) .
