Two, open ring geometries have been used as interferometers to study the phase of the particles in the dot–blocking regime. The coulomb-blockade spectrum has been studied in depth by tunneling spectroscopy in order to probe interaction and spin effects when a gate voltage is used to successively add electrons to such artificial atoms. qty and qty0 simultaneously, and under symmetrical conditions . qty and qty0 simultaneously and in symmetrical conditions . . . a theoretical treatment of the dot–blocking phenomenon was originally developed to scatter cross sections of nuclei and optical spectroscopy, but recently, in many mesoscopic systems, such resonances have been addressed. qty the discrete spectrum of coulomb-blocking quantum dots has been extensively studied, using tunneling spectroscopy to study interaction and spin phenomena, when a gate voltage is employed to successively add electrons to such artificial atoms . . . . this axis of asymmetry is strongest. The mathematical implications of the fano effect in mesoscopic systems have been discussed for both resonant and open cavities, resonant and with rings. In some cases, fano resonances are observed in a tunneling current through a single cobalt atom on a gold surface. This axis of asymmetry is the strongest . . . In one of these axis of a sphere, an ab-shell with a non-resonant quantum dot embedded in one arm of the sphere, the fano resonance is found to be a violation of a broad resonance (in a quasi-circle) in one of the ab-shells. In this axis of a sphere, the fano is caused by the interference of a Bock-Wavefield resonance in one of the arm axis of the sphere (a strongly resonant quantum dot) and a continuum channel in the other arm of the sphere. In this axis of a sphere, the fano is a consequence of the interference of a broad resonance (an intermediate dimension) with a narrow resonance, which results in a fano peak. A contrast between the dotted lines of a ring and the ring are measured at xmath4 as a function of xmath4 when the channel between the ring and the ring is split. The dashed lines indicate the height of the ring peak as a function of xmath4 when xmath4 = 50mv, 46mv, 42mv, the thickest line indicates the strongest tidal bond. In section ii, we discuss the experimental realization of the ring-dot structure and discuss low temperature transport. The paper is divided into sections: in section ii, we discuss the logical synthesis of the ring-dot structure, and we explain the low temperature transport, . in section iv, we give a model of the ring-dot system in the scattering matrix, and we relate it to the fano formula in eq. [4] . we see the weakest and strongest currents, while the shortest one shows the asymmetric curves characteristic of the fano effect. But when the jar was shut up , there was no ring . . . The jar was sprayed with the ac and at xmath24 was applied to the two leads of the ring, at a frequency of 21 Hz, and the same for the two leads of the dc, at a frequency of 14 Hz . . . the ac is then passed through the jar into individual circuits ( tq4 , tq3 , tq4 , tq1 , tq2 ) as indicated by the gray lines. and further details about the measuring procedure are found in ref. . and ref. . . . the measurements were performed in a dilution refrigerator with an electron temperature of xmath21mk. , at xmath24  % ,                                                                                    left [ t   30 “The xmath2 of the ring and xmath3 of the dot show cb-resonant frequencies as a function of the magnetic field, applied perpendicular to the sample, and the period of xmath29mt is in agreement with the addition of a single flux quanta to the area enclosed by the ring, with an average radius of xmath30135 nm. To this end xmath15 was set to - 75mv in order to deplete the channel between the two structures. meanwhile, the magnetic field is used to control the interference between the phase sensitive ring and the dot, which, by side-by-side, will act as a fano scatterer (see below) . In our system, we can simultaneously detect the resonance position in the dot and the interference pattern in the ring current, without changing the coupling or the gate voltages. We do this by measuring coulomb diamonds. The ab-oscence is about xmath2 and xmath3 in a scale of c, d, and f. our average addition of energy is about xmath33ev for the dot. a figure of xmath2 and xmath3 with the central gate closing the channel between the two structures is shown in Fig. [P. ] [D.] [Figure 1] (c, d.] . [K.] At the top of the ring the electrodes tgr and tgd - respectively - enable us to change the density of electrons in the ring or the number of electrons in the ring, without altering the coupling to source and drain. However, where possible, we restrict ourselves to the in-plane gates, since in this case the structure is more stable, and the gate voltages are fewer. Consequently, the current @ xmath0, dotted lines, xmath14, and xmath1 - where thicker lines correspond to less negative @ xmath15. Therefore, we increase the xmath15 in order to join the two structures. Figure [fig 2] (b) shows the three currents @ xmath0, @ xmath14, and @ xmath1 - where thicker lines correspond to less negative xmath15 . in this case, the difference between xmath0 and the perfect symmetry is larger than in the phase-module, an effect which is expected for the transition from a two-sided to a multi-sided device. The currents @ xmath14 are not greatly affected by the increase in xmath14, except that the source-drain coupling of the dot is a little affected, which results in a larger current for the strongest coupling. [vej] .. these are all the values from the heights of the peak lines. The white lines are the positions of the peak lines in , m; the corresponding direction is a lorentzian line. the white vertical lines are the positions of the peak lines in , vej. It was previously demonstrated that a ring is wired and that the fano effect is produced. We have examined the properties of this fano scatterer by embedding it in a ring with two terminals. By increasing the flux of the ring by half a flux, the quantum is modified by a shift at each gate in the system. In the following, higher and higher values of xmath were added to improve the channel from the ring to the dot. Note that, in particular, Xmath41 and Xmath42 were increased from 0mv to 200mv to be optimal for the connection between the ring and the dot. , the white vertical lines are aligned with the peak of c. , width = 326 ] the fano effect can be observed. . . . This is in contrast to xmath0, which has a strong xmath28 background. the slight yaw-lifts as a function of magnetic field are due to the influence of the magnetic field on individual orbital levels of the dot. The vertical white lines again represent the peak positions determined by fittings to xmath14 shown in fig. fig. d. The unitary scattering matrix of the barrier is given by xmath49, where xmath50 is the reflection probability and xmath51 the free phase parameters. Hence the reflection amplitude of such a dot is calculated from a sum of all feynman paths in xmath52. As a consequence of the three terminals, the different ab geometry of xmath46 and xmath47 retains an equilateral ab-effect. - The minor peak-shifts as a function of magnetic field are caused by the influence of the magnetic field on individual orbital levels of the dot. - as a consequence of the symmetry of the structure and the couplings, we conclude that xmath1 measures the difference between the two transmissions xmath46 and xmath47, and therefore, if the structure geometry and couplings are ideally symmetric , the ab-effect for xmath46 remains net . ... (a) a figure of the cross-section of the cross-section of the cross-section of the ring. (b) an analysis of the flux quanta passing through the ring and over the change in xmath62 in the dot phase. (c) the crossing and reflection amplitudes of the cross-section are then, @xmath67, where @xmath68 and @xmath69 express the direct transmission from the cross-section to the cross-section and the direct reflection from the cross-section to the cross-section. The white dashed lines represent the peak position in fits to the xmath14. The amplitude of the cross-section is given by the ratio between @xmath70 and @xmath71. , @xmath72 . the cross-section of @xmath70 is calculated by the figure 'fig 'b'. The cross-section of 'fig' can be mapped on an imaginary triangular transport network 'see 'fig' (fig 'b'). the cross-section of 'xmath' will be shown in Fig. ' Fig. 'B', for the cross-section of '0', it becomes clear at h78 . The four cylinders of the ring were fastened together with two ideal semi-infinite leads at the junctions 1 and 2. Consequently, the ring-dot structure in the experiment could now be represented by placing the disc mxmath95 in one of the arms of the ring, as shown in Fig. mxmath94. The three cylinders, in combination with the disc mxmath94, divide the ring into three equal sections. The triangle is composed of three sections of equal length. The electron wave traverses the segments, acquires the fermi phase @ xmath96, where xmath97 is the fermi wave-number, and a magnetic phase @ xmath98 (opposite signs for clockwise and anticlockwise propagation), where xmath99 is the magnetic flux enclosed by the ring, and xmath100 is the magnetic flux quantum . if we count the number of flux quanta that penetrate the ring with @xmath110 and @xmath66 , a good, perfectly true agreement is found, which reflects that our simple model of the integrated ring-dot structure quite accurately reflects the experimental situation of the linked ring-dot ring. This agreement is robust against variations in @xmath50, but sensitive to variations in @xmath84, because @xmath84 is linked to the fano factor @xmath10. the sign of the asymmetrical sign of @xmath0 is continually influenced by the flux penetrating the ring. In the figure fig. [E] (a) we show the calculated conductance at xmath108 as a function of @xmath108 and the number of fluxes penetrating the ring with @xmath110 and @xmath66. This way is qualitatively similar to our recent results in ref. 4, where the whole ring structure, with a dot embedded in one of its arms, is considered to be a fano scatterer. This correlation is qualitatively similar to recent results in ref. 4, where a complex q is introduced to accommodate the magnetic field dependence of fano lines. However, we have not been able to transform eq. [tw] into a complex q which corresponds to the magnetic flux through the ring @xmath113 as a phase in the complex q, and therefore we confine ourselves to the real @xmath10 parameter, which consists only of the fano effect of the ring with the side connected dot. The properties of this fano scatterer are then probed by ab The index, as you can see, is the fine curve of a coulomb, marked with arrows in fig.5 (a). In this case, the lines were drawn across the coriolis effect, marked with arrows in fig.5 (a) and each value of xmath5 were shifted in xmath5 (a) such that the peak maximum in xmath14 was increased by a factor of two or three, and in xmath14 (only @ xmath) was suppressed. This transition was also complete in the experimental data, where only small dips in xmath0 were found. This transition was more complete in the experimental data, where for xmath118mv only small dips were found. (For the xmath1170, see figure Fig.6 ). In Fig.6 the traces have been taken across the resonance marked by arrows, Fig. 5; and for each value of xmath15, they were shifted in xmath4 to such a point that the peak maximum in xmath14 (only @ xmath14) is diminished. ‘ , –  - Xcite at xmath123 = 0 , - 68 . – - 69 . – - 69 . - - – - xcite at xmath123 = 0 , width = 326 . – – -   -      –      -  - - xcite at xmath123 = 0 ,   at xmath123 = 0 , for each value of xmath15 we add an offset to xmath4 in order to get the peak of xmath14 to be at xmath126 . - d -               ,       ,      ,    , width =   ,   ,   ,  , ,  in the previous fig. , 7 ,     ,  ,    , , ,  , , . “If there is a noise, we add the normalization of the phase on the axis of the ray, a loss of phase is a loss of phase. We then add the two-way conductances to the ray by a change in phase @xmath132, where @xmath133 is the length of the ray through the ray and @xmath32 is the phase coherence length. The figure, Fig. 6 (a) and the graph with the grey solid line, show the measurement of the rays of the rays in the fully coherent case. The high resemblance of the measured data at Xmath143 (a) shows that decoherence leads to a broader circle of fano line shapes and a strong amplitude reduction, a fact which has been suggested to be a measure for decoherence in a quantum dot in the fano regime  xcite . The dissolution of the coherent channel is asserted by the addition of a term in the two-terminal conductance xmath134, where 135 is the probability for (135 reflection) injected in lead , detection in lead , and this is formulated by math136 and math138, the re- injection asserts a degree of probability conservation in the structure and hence the symmetries required by the two-terminal onsager relation . . . The figure Fig.6 (a) shows                absorbed amplitude ’ xmath148 – (not shown) at xmath150. The coefficient of variation between these two variables is given in the following table, and it is resolutely found to be true for xmath149 , xmath152, xmath64 and xmath153 . . . note that the cross-coupling of xmath15 has the opposite effect, and the coulomb peak width at xmath14 increases as the temperature increases. This is clear from the ab pattern in the conductance observed. . . . . that is, if the coherence of paths through the ring converges, the ab pattern in the conductance is formed, leading to an ab pattern in the conductance . . . . when the temperature increases, decoherence becomes important also for the xmath64 case, and the fano effect is almost completely lost at xmath151 . The scattering model reproduces all the characteristic features of the experimental data, but there are some obvious details that should be noted in Fig. . As I've said, our model is limited to the correction of the convolutions, and therefore we hypothesise that the additional leads on the dot are the chief source of the convolutions of the fano. - by means of a two-sided geometry which neglects the effects of the two contacts on the dot in terms of the symmetry of the current in relation to @ xmath35. - by removing the correspondingly non-discretionary features from @ xmath35, we estimate that the contribution is two times smaller than the dips (peaks) in @ xmath30 and so we assume that it has little influence on xmath30. - From the simultaneous measurements of @ xmath1 we estimate that this contribution is about two times smaller than the dips (peaks) in @ xmath258. This is not included in our calculation, and may explain the slightly stronger modulation of the gate voltage from the experimental data when compared to the model at xmath156k in fig. Fig. - c - d . Nevertheless, in a quantum dot the addition of energy between two resonances is not only determined by space doubling but also by coulomb interactions between the electrons on the dot. As evident in Fig. 1 , fig. 4, it is apparent that the fano effect is not observed, and the kondo correlations are insignificant. In conclusion, we have shown that the current through a ring with a coherently side-linked dot leads to asymmetrical line shapes, if the gate voltage is tuned to the differential levels of the dot. The gate voltage was adjusted by adjusting the angle of the dot to the xmath12 parameter. The gate voltage tuned the conductance between the ring and the dot. . In this way, we have shown that the symmetry of the observed fano line shapes can be tuned by a magnetic field. We conclude that spin is not the main factor of the observed overlapping line, and kondo correlations are therefore negligible .
