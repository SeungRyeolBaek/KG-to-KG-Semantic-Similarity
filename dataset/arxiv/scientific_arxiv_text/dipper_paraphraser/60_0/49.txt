However, a vast number of very active tauri stars have been named exors, or sometimes sub-exors, for the two names indicate a kinship with the so-called fu orionis stars (fiors). By observation of photographic and spectroscopic curves over a century of observations, it was observed that exors had a characteristic irregular photometric behavior akin to the so-called fu orionis stars (fiors) .. In particular, in some cases, in such cases, outbursts of five magnitudes can occur, but normally, in such cases, there are only small and irregular variations.– Even in a high-rise outburst, fuors tend to have low mass accretion (*110 - 10 - 4 – 670) and they have strong winds (e.g. calvet et al. 1993), and they may be the frequent and the most prominent. For the last few years, there are only a few stars known with similar qualities. Herbig, 1950, emphasized the similarity of ex-lup's spectral characteristics with that of tauri stars with strong emission lines of h, caii, feii and hei. Similarly, in one of the spectral studies obtained in 1949/50, the h and caii lines showed a inverse p-cygni profile . . . The differential ccd spectroscopic observations have been made at the 0 - 9m, and the 0 - 54m - danish telescopes. We use this spectroscopic data to follow the outburst in march, and to follow the spectroscopic observations in august 1994, when the star had little activity before the eruption. The amplitude of the outburst was about @xmath2v = 2 . 0mag and @xmath2b = 2 . 6mag. The star's refractory phase was shown in Fig. . . . the diffraction of the star was obvious. figure 2 shows the colour change in b - v, in the absorption. There are some typical errors in the differential spectrometer in the differential spectrometer: a normal error of 1 = xmath1b = 0 and a normal error of 0 = xmath2r = 0 , whereas the absolute magnitude scale is accurate to 0 ,0 in all three colors . in the absorption of the star is a linear decline, which is closely observable. The maximum occurred between the 25th of February and the 4th of March (herbig, priv.). The intensity of the eruption was about a 0  2 2mag, and a  22mag - he showed a clear color change of b-v, a very large change in b-v, a very large change in color. On fig. 3 we show two different spectra of ex lup, one close to maximum and the other at low activity almost half a year after the eruption. In fig. 3 we present two different spectra of the eruption: one, close to the maximum, and the other, low, almost half a year after the eruption. In fig. 4 we show the difference between an eruption (mars 3), and a post eruption (july 18), which represents normal low-level variability. The primary source of variability may be a featureless continuum. the diffracted spectrum, which is normally low-level, is bluer than the diffracted spectrum. The powerful method to determine the blurred spectrum is to compare the spectra of stars of the same type and luminosity, but without the disc signature of the disk (hunigan et al. 1989; 1991) , whereas the degree of blurring decreases rapidly when the spectra exceed the photospheric luminosity. In the case of ex lup during its eruption, we therefore did not intend to obtain the blurred and true blurred spectrum by comparing with spectral types and luminosities, but we could examine the spectral variability that the eruption caused. The most intriguing feature of the curve is the lack of photospheric absorption (upper spectrum in fig. 3), but they appear in the post-scratch spectrum. The large scale of the blurred spectrum, displaying normal low-level oscillation, is bluer than the spectrum of the swarm. , "see," and "do not" . . . but) "in _theory_ _[5][6][10], "and _ann_____ , [10] ... and [11] [15] ", ""in _theory_, " Theory_; _Atheist, _______________________________,[11] + _h 11[10] [[16][12] _________,[15] [30] [30], [35] [39]] [31], - 297; _9] ; 1 , _________, [3] [3], _______] [41] ; - 0 , (35], '__________], [30] __________ , "___________, _________,_________ _________, __________, __________, [32] ... ... ; _____________, _________, _________, __________ ________ _________ ________, _________, __________, __________, ___________, _________, _________, ___________, __________, _________, _________ __________, __________, __________, _________, _________, The difference between these two spectra no longer corresponds to the absorption line, and the change in the flux by about 40 % is due to continuum emission rather than to photosphere variability. In a similar way, the inertia of ex-lup can be understood as a mass accretion event that generates the emission of the continuum in a hot region, near the surface of the star, where the infalling matter is at last releasing its kinetic energy. Thus, the detailed description of the outburst is rather difficult. The photosphere and the hot region are domineering the inertia, and therefore the outburst is much bluer than before. Moreover, the inertia of all the lines are also strongly veiled (assuming that r = 1 at minimum light, then the veil in the outburst is r@ xmath1420). Using this representation, the total absorption of the t tauri star is made more vivid by the superimposed spectral spectrum. Moreover, all lines are greatly veiled (assuming that r = 1 at minimum light, the veil in the outburst is r@ xmath1420) . The additional spectrum of the line spectrum conceals many of the absorption lines. the difference in the ratio of the emission of the t tauri star and the photosphere, is the dominant feature of the star, and hence the sun is bluish during the outburst. - we thank g. herbig for the alert of ex-lup in early March 1994 . . .
