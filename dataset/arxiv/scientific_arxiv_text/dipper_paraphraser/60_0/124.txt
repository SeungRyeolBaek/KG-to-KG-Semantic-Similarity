As in our previous study of the data from run 1a, we do a general search for new particles with a narrow natural width that decays into difluors. Among the list of particles we are looking for the following: axigluons @ xcite from chiral qcd (@ xmath7), excited states @ xcite of composite quarks (@ xmath8), color octets @ xcite (@ xmath9), new gauge bosons (@ xmath10, -@ xmath11), new gauge diquarks at xcite (@ xmath13 and -at xmath14) . The first and second spectra are compared with the third and the fourth, namely the three highest xmath15 jets, and that they should be pseudorapids, and a cms skewed angle @ xmath17. Xmath24 1000gm 106*sqrqrrr_g -23, 450m qrr_qrrc 8*6(7); 850msqr (7)  16sqr_3; we notice that the flux in qr-1-qrrj, and a simulation of the ae-arrangement, is huge, and the long tail is as big as gluon. , Fig. 7prf Section 8bd(9399): this flux is all about the xrj-na-c-h1 and the mv rpf = , this value is coincident with qcd alone, and also xr3rhrm=3 in qcd (informal) . The angular distribution is also compatible with the qcd alone, and with 3 12333,3 in the 2r , the amount of excited quark is coincident with . The angular distribution is also compatible with qcd alone and with = 3 .331 in qcd, the long tail from gluon radiation is . in fig. [informal] we will show the best fit and 95 % confidence level for a 550 gev The calculations are below-the-top-end @ xcite, in which we take account of a cteq2l parton distribution of the fourth generation, and a one-cluster @ xmath39, which require a minimum of @ xmath16 and a minimum of @ xmath40. The large mass of the top quarks shows that the third generation may be special. octet @ xcite assumes that the top mass is large mainly because of the dynamical @ xmath5 condensate produced by a new strong dynamics coupling to the third generation. The top fermions are produced strongly and decay mainly in the third generation (@ xmath45) with a relatively large natural width (@ xmath46) . This makes the calculation below of the highest order @ xcite with the cteq2l parton distribution and the one-loop @ xmath39 required @ xmath16 and @ xmath40. We seek the top fermions in the -cell of the @ xmath4 channel . . . the large mass of the top fermions suggests that the third generation may be special. There are massive color octets, top-gluons @ xcite, which couple mostly to @ xmath4 and @ xmath5; the top-gluon is highly generated and decays mainly to the third generation (@ xmath45) with a relatively large natural width (@ xmath46). - we start with the search for dijets in the first data in 19 pb at xmath0 of run 1a, and it is necessary to also include the flag of the two leading jets, which is a bullseye, and a cdf detector. - the b-tag requires a vertex to be turned off in the secondary vertex detector. in fig. - btag - we show the mass of the b-tag corrected for the efficiency of xmath4 . Moreover, we estimate that the sample is about 50 % of the bottom, 30 % charm, and 20 % mistags of the plain jets. " - we estimate that in a network of fits the distribution is roughly 50 % of the bottom, 30 % of the charm, and 20 % of the plain jets. . . . if the b-tag is better, we can take advantage of double b-tag events, like the one in fig . . . [fig btag] We add to the b-tag the mass distribution, and compare it with our standard parameterization . . . At xcite the cdf detector is shown in Fig. . [fig . bbar . res] and the mass resolution in Fig. . [fig . btag . res] is shown. The theoretical cross sections are the lowest and the least, in that they are based on the lowest order and are fitted to cteq2l parton distributions. We start by resolving the mass of the whole sample to w + four jets of btag at the beginning of the python, which led to a top of w-64 (stat ) , a top of xmath64 (stat) , a top of xmath65 (sys) gev / c @ xmath1. . . . . . The mass of the entire sample for the top hypothesis, we discard the whole event for the top hypothesis, and that analysis fetched from the whole event the whole event for the top hypothesis, discarding the whole event for the top hypothesis, which we have discarded. In fig. ttbar , the rightmost diffraction z_xmath3 and s_m_xmath5 simulations demonstrate that in this sample we are sensitive to xmath6 up to a mass of about 600 gev / c / c . Hence, in fig. ttbar , we present the distribution of mass compared to the predictions of the standard model of cdf. Here we used pythia _xmath67. . . . Then, on the right in fig. ttbar , we present the representative mass of cdf in comparison to the total mass of the standard model . . . . . from cdf , we found on the left and right a mixture of the color z @ xmath3 to the sm / xmath5 simulations that in this sample we are sensitive to the color z @ xmath6 up to a mass of roughly 600 ev / c . . . In general, this proportion was rather good overall. . . . in the dijet channel we have fixed the most significant mass exclusions to date for the hadronic decays of axigluons (excluding @ xmath70 ev / c @ xmath1), excited quarks (excluding @ xmath71 ev / c The search for the topcolor of the [xmath57] channel is now in progress, the limits are definite; the main thing is to see if there is any signal. The search for the topcolor in the [xmath57] channel has just begun and the limits are in progress. f. abe et al.
