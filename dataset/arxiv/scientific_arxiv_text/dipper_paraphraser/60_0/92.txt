Suppose that Xmath3 is a closed surface of the class Xmath1, from which Xmath2 descended, so—called punctures—have been eliminated. Consequently, we call Xmath0 an oriented surface of finite type, i.e., a surface of genus Xmath1 from which Xmath2 descended, so that the punctures—calling them punctures—have been removed. For the axiom of a quadratic differential, Xmath9, to define the axiom of all quadratic differentials whose vertical lamination is the multiple of the vertical lamination of the axiom . Thus this axiom morphs into the axiom of the axiom of a teichmller metric. The smooth fibers of Xmath10 over Xmath9 of all quadratic differentials, one can naturally think of them as the unit cotangent axiom of Xmath9 for the axiom of xmath9. And the smooth layer of Xmath10 over Xmath10 of all holomorphic quadratic differentials, we are naturally to call the axiom of Xmath12 the unit cotangent axiom of xmath12 for the axiom of teichmller. a foliation of xmath10, invariant under the group of aggregations, projects to a singular foliation of xmath4 called the unstable foliation (or the strong stable foliation). - this measure is invariant with respect to the strong stable and the unstable foliation, it is ergodic and mixing, and its metric entropy equals xmath6 (note that we use a normalization for the teichmller flow, which differs from the one in xcite) . recently avila, gouzel and yoccoz have established that the lebesgue measure on the moduli space of 'abelian' differentials is even exponentially mixing, that is, exponentially resolving observables for hlder observables. This proof of this result depends on the fact, independently of athreya - Xcite, that the teichmller flow is _excaustively recurrent_ to some fixed compact set, i.e. there is a compact set - xmath27 and a number - xmath22 such that for all xmath24   e   - ct  / ct  - ct - ct xmath30 and a number xmath32 the poincar series of the mapping class with an exponent @ xmath32 and a base point @ xmath33 is defined as the series @ xmath32 and a pulse @ xmath33 is defined as a pulse @ xmath32 the critical exponent of the mapping class equals @ xmath6 and the pulse converges @ xcite . venerable earlier veech@ xcite established a count for all periodic orbits of the teichmller flow, that is, a count for all periodic orbits of the teichmller flow on @ xmath4 of period, at most @ xmath39. Moreover, we can be given an estimate of the numerical result by @ xmath41, which is far from the conjecture, but which is, however, a little higher. for a fixed point @ xmath30 and a number @ xmath32 the poincar series of the mapping class with exponent @ xmath32 and a base point @ xmath33 is defined to be the series @ xmath32 the critical exponent of @ xmath11 is equal to @ xmath6 and the poincar series with exponent @ xmath32 converges @ xcite . “So we consider the group of this paper to be as follows: firstly, we discuss some properties of trains and of the geodesic material required in the second part of the work; and secondly, we discuss the properties of geodesic material needed in the third part of the work; thirdly, we use the curve graph of @xmath0 to show that the restriction of the teichmller flow to any invariant compact subset of @xmath4 is a hyperbolic flow in a topological sense; in section 4 we construct a bounded roof function for our subshift of finite type, and a semi-conjugal conjugacy between the suspension of @xmath6 with the roof function @xmath49 in the teichmller flow, which is shown in Section 6 to prove the second part of the second part of the second part. the organization of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we review some properties of the train tracks and the geodesic linings needed for the sequel.

Thus, for each bounded function of xmath142 there is a perfect number of closed curves of xmath32 on xmath0 whose hyperbolic length at xmath138 (i.e., the length of a geodesic representative of the free homotopy) does not exceed xmath139. therefore, for every bounded function of xmath140 there is a uniform value of xmath143, in the weak xmath51-topology.

The shortest path is called a 'time-and-half' path, which is the distance of @xmath212 from @xmath210 to @xmath217. let @ xmath219 be the round-trip distance on @xmath220, and define a distance of @xmath221 on @xmath222 by @xmath223 . The shortest path is called the shortest path, since a class of lines is defined, a set of roads, which we use in the following sections to study the geodesic flow. The projection of @xmath214 from @xmath184 to @ xmath4 is compact. This section consists of train lines to form a subshift of finite type which we use in the following sections to study the geodesic flow. The homeomorphism of @xmath208 then defines a metric for every @xmath110, a distance of xmath219 is defined on @xmath220, and a distance of xmath49 on @xmath215 . Let xmath219 be a partition of unity for this covering, and let xmath49 be a distance of xmath49 on @xmath215 . a transformation of the branches of @xmath58 produces a numbering of the branches of @xmath76 in such a way that the branch with number @xmath110 is large (or mixed or small) in @xmath58, if and only if this is the case for the branch with number @xmath110 in @xmath76. This is called the numbered class of a numbered train track, which is acquired from @xmath58 by a numbered shift. Now let the train track numbered @xmath231 be a numbered train track and let the numbered class of xmath232 be such that xmath233 is contained in the numbered class of xmath58. [So if xmath234 is not the identity, then, in the natural identification of complementary components, @ xmath234 induces a non-trivial multiplicity of complementary components in xmath235. now, for each fixed complementary component xmath235 of xmath231, the numbered track of xmath231 is called the train track. for this reason, since xmath234 can be obtained from xmath234 by a sequence of numbered shifts, there is a natural bijection between the complementary components of xmath234 and the complementary components of xmath233. What is the meaning of '#numbered' in the numbered class of @xmath58? If a number of branches of the train is equal to the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of @xmath58 and therefore a number of the number of the number of the number of the number of a numbered number . Therefore, a numbered number of the numbered class of the numbered class is equal to the quotient of the numbered classes under the action of the numbered class. Let xmath237 be the set of all numbered combinatorial types. Let a numbered class, if the numbered class, if the numbered class, if the whole train track is obtained from the complete train track, then a numbering of the branches of xmath2 naturally induces a numbering of the branches of xmath236, and therefore such a numbering defines a numbered split. We call a numbered traverse an “unnumbered”, numbered traverse, such that for each xmath110 the numbered traverse can be obtained by a shift of xmath246 by a single numbered traverse. “Recall from xcite the definition of a train track in a standardized form, if it satisfies the following properties. . . . for each xmath110 the numbered traverse can be obtained by a shift of xmath246 by a single numbered traverse. In a train track, we call a train track in a standardized form if it satisfies the following properties. Each of the sections of our railing is complete. Each of our sections has a complete geodesic laminate, whose least components are the pants curves of xmath0 and which make each pair of pants contain exactly three leaves of xmath0 , which spirals about mutually distinct lines of edge-curves. We call a numbered combinatorial type at xmath247 an numbered complete traintrack, such that for each of xmath110 the numbered train track can be obtained from a shift of xmath246 by a single numbered split. Let @ xmath231 be any numbered train line in special standard form for some frame xmath0 and let @ xmath253 be the set of numbered combinatorial types of all complete train lines that can be obtained from @ xmath257 by a full-numbered split and a complete permutation of the numbering. Let @ xmath259 be the large branches of @ xmath77 different from @ xmath77 and suppose that the numbered train line @ xmath259 is obtained from @ xmath257 by a split at each large branch @ xmath67 , then there is a numbered combinatorial type obtained from the numbered combinatorial type @ xmath57 by a full-numbered split and obtained from the numbered combinatorial type @ xmath57 by a permutation of the numbering . . . the above means the following . . . let Xmath259 be any numbered train track that contains a spinnaker @ xmath79, consisting of a large branch @ xmath77 and a small branch @ xmath67. . . . A point in the Xmath11-Earth orbit of Xmath59, a permutation of the number , as the list of all permutations of the number xmath58 has the first property stated in the lemma, as the third property follows from Xcite in the same way. xmath263 Let xmath263 be the cardinality of a set Xmath253 as in lemma [numerical type], and let xmath264 be the cardinality of a set Xmath253 as in lemma [numerical type] and number the xmath264 elements of xmath268 in an arbitrary order. the matrix xmath268 represents a _subshift of finite type ” . the phase space of this subshift is the set of biinfinite biinfinite sequences, with the property that @ xmath270 if and only if @ xmath270 for all @ xmath110 . In the second place, since the free action of @ xmath11 on the set of numbered train tracks is free, a point in xmath273 determines an xmath11 - orbit of biinfinite full-numbered splitting and shifting sequences, unique only to replacing the train tracks in the sequence with the same numbered and shift-like train tracks. - Let xmath26 be a subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate to the finite alphabet - xmath290, and with transition matrix - xmath268 - the subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate to xmath290 is subordinate to the subordinate subordinate subordinates. The following observation is immediate from the definitions. Let xmath284 be arbitrary - namely, if we have defined a subordinate subordinate subordinate of points - xmath282 as permissible if @xmath271 for all @xmath110, then @xmath283 equals the number of all permissible sequences of length @ xmath46 connecting @xmath110 to @xmath266 . The subordinate subordinate subordinate of finite type, defined by the matrix @xmath268 , is ‘topologically mixing’, if there are some @xmath276 such as @xmath283 for all @xmath284 . the subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate subordinate if it is formed from our assumption @ xmath265 we conclude that @ xmath297 is a Topological Mixing. Having confirmed that @ xmath299 is a Topological Mixing, it is necessary to find some numbered combinatorial types of train tracks on xmath0 such that our transition matrix @ xmath268 satisfies @ xmath268. if you take, for instance, the train tracks @ xmath304 and @ xmath305 are numbered Set Equivalents, and the same goes for the train tracks @ xmath306 and @ xmath307. Here we are dealing with a sub-set of the sub-set of the Type by the Set of Numbers, the two Trains of the List. This Sub-set is of the Finite Type, as we have just described. By that sub-Type we will conclude that xmath297 and ymath295. So let @ xmath310 be the set of all uniquely ergodic sequences. if @ xmath310 is any numbered and semi-numbered sequence, then @ xmath311 is well defined and non-empty. note that if @ xmath257 is a sequence equivalent to @ xmath286, then the maximum weight of @ xmath257 on a large branch of @ xmath286 is one. so, by the considerations in section 4, every sequence @ xmath270 has an orbit of the action of @ xmath11 on the space of compact subsets of @ xmath53. so by the definition of a uniquely ergodic sequence, there is a special uniquely ergodic measured geodesic lamination @ xmath63 which is carried by each of the train tracks @ xmath246 and that the maximal weight of this measured geodesic lamination on a large branch of @ xmath286 equals one. Hence, by the considerations in section 4, every sequence @ xmath270 determines an orbit of the action of @ xmath11 on the space of compact subsets of @ xmath53. we have . . . let xmath122 be a numbered sequence of all transverse measures for xmath318, with the topology of the family of weights on the branches of xmath318 forming a closed subset of the set of all measured geodesic laminations equipped with the weak xmath51 topology. This subset is . . . let xmath315 and xmath321 . . . so that for every xmath328 the logarithm of the maximal weight of a large branch of xmath318 defined by xmath329 is contained in the interval xmath330, and that the logarithm of the maximal weight that xmath329 dispenses on a large branch of xmath326 is contained in the interval xmath330. . . . let xmath314 be a numbering sequence which realizes xmath314. However, the value of the value of xmath49, when it is combined with xmath320 of the cylinder xmath340, is contained in xmath320. [bounded] 2 . . . as a result, there is a number xmath160 such that for every xmath315 we have a number xmath345 . . . the next lemma gives further information on the value of xmath344 . . . . to show the first inequality, choose a numbered full, spline and shifting sequence @ xmath272 that resolves @ xmath274 . . . if the support of a measured geodesic lamination defined by @ xmath315 is maximal, then @ xmath344 . we have to prove that there is a number @ xmath345 such that @ xmath346 for every @ xmath315 . we have to show that there is a number @ xmath346 such that @ xmath346 for every @ xmath315 . . . If the support of a measured geodesic lamination defined by @ xmath315 is maximal, then @ xmath344 . Because for every transverse measure, # xmath329, in a complete train-track, # xmath58, the maximum of the @ xmath329-weights of the branches of # xmath58 is assumed on a large branch of # xmath360, so let the branch # xmath360 be the branch whose value is xmath36. the branches in # xmath318 aren’t more than the @ xmath358-weight corresponding to @ xmath357. Thus the @ xmath349-weight of the branches in @ xmath318 isn’t greater than the @ xmath63-weight of the corresponding branch of @ xmath336 . . . let’s suppose that the branches in @ xmath318 are linked together with the branch @ xmath357. Moreover, let’s suppose that the branches in @ xmath358 are split in such a way that the branch @ xmath357 is linked to the same end of @ xmath360 as @ xmath357. . . . This is the third part of our lemma. And the next stanza is a biinfinite sequence if every finite sequence occurs in xmath371 in a forward and in a backward direction. Because the maximum weight of a transverse measure on a complete train track xmath58 is assumed on a large branch, our function xmath49 is uniformly bounded. By the definition of xmath238, by the Lemma numberedtype, and by the considerations in section 5 of xcite, tight finite sequences exist. On the other hand, by the switch condition for transverse measures on a complete train track xmath58, the maximum weight of the two winning branches xmath81 of a complication of xmath286 on a large branch , is not smaller than half the weight of xmath63 - weight of xmath77 . since the maximum of the weight of a transverse measure on a complete train track xmath58 is assumed on a large branch, our function xmath49 is uniformly bounded. By the definition of xmath238, by lemma numbered type and considerations in section 5 of xcite, tight finite sequences exist . “If, for example, the train path to xmath245 is obtained from xmath246 by a single split at a large branch, Xmath246 defines a parallel and a parallel measure on xmath245, and a diagonal measure on xmath246. In other words, if Xmath246 is lost in the split connecting xmath246 to xmath245, and if Xmath82 is the diagonal branch of the split, then we have Xmath380, that is, a convex cone on xmath245 which corresponds to the convex cone on xmath379 of transverse measures on xmath245. . . . followed by xcite, this map can be described as follows: . . . Let Xmath270 be normal and let Xmath373 be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence, which realizes Xmath274; then Xmath312 consists of a single projective measured geodesic lamination. For all of xmath394 the projective linear map of xmath394 can naturally be identified with the map of xmath394 (see xcite). The jacobian of this map is bounded from above by a number xmath403 independent of xmath266 , so that the jacobian of the projective linear map of xmath394 tends to zero at all points of xmath394 . . . . and the maps xmath406 are uniformly quasiconformal and so their pointwise dilatations tend to zero as well (see xcite). . . . the intersection . . . . in particular, the intersection . . . consists of a single point . . . . . the jacobian of this map is bound from above by one at every point of xmath407 . . . well, if the maps xmath402 are, namely, quasiconformal, and their pointwise dilatations are not uniform (see xcite) . . . And since the intersection @ xmath312 consists of the unique point @ xmath19, the laminations from the set @ xmath36 contain a single minimal component @ xmath419 which is the support of @ xmath419 . . . if the intersection @ xmath419 does not fill up @ xmath0 then there is a simple closed curve on @ xmath419 that intersects a complete geodesic lamination on @ xmath420 in a finite number of points . . . so that the space @ xmath418 is maximal and if, besides, @ xmath418 can be approximated in the hausdorff topology by simple closed geodesics. The space @ xmath416 of a geodesic lamination carried by @ xmath246 is a compact non-empty subset of the compact space @ xmath417 of all complete geodesic laminations on @ xmath0 (compare @ xcite ) and consequently @ xmath418 is non-empty. As a result, we have a non-decreasing map at xmath434, so that the method of the assignment at xmath434 is a uniform quasi-geodesic. Moreover, the axiom in xmath426 represents a convex cone in xmath425 of all transverse measures in xmath425 . If xmath426 is the graph of a complete train, then Xmath428 is the graph of a complete train in xmath426. This is a contradiction and means that the support of xmath19 fills up xmath0. This is a contradiction and implies that the support of xmath19 fills up xmath0. In the graph of Xcite it is shown that there is a number of xmath430, such that the image under xmath431 of each splitting and shifting sequence in xmath432 is an unparametrized quasi-geodesic in xmath84 . The figure under xmath434 is an unparametrized quasi-geodesic . . . The sequence of Lemma, let us call it normal, and let us give xmath270 a numbered-stacking sequence that realizes xmath270. Then we have xmath440 a single projective measured geodesic lamination that fills xmath70 and which satisfy the following additional requirements. This sequence of Lemma, let us call it normal, and let us suppose xmath270 to be normal, and let xmath270 be a numbered-stacking sequence which realizes xmath270; then xmath440 is a single uniquely ergodic projective measured geodesic lamination that fills xmath70 efficiently. (Second assumption that xmath270 is doubly ergodic as we have said, and if in addition for each (and therefore every) numbered-stacking sequence Xmath441 which realizes xmath270 the intersection Xmath414 is a unique point . . . by lemma [normal] and lemma [flat] , each normal sequence is doubly ergodic, and therefore the set of all doubly ergodic sequences @ xmath270 is thick. Then, in consequence of lemma bounded, we have: ‘ a single number of such complete numbers’ as defined by ‘ xmath444 is a quadratic differential of the total area over a given point in moduli space. a double number of such double number of each such double number of consecutive numbers in the phase space ‘ xmath450’. The “one number” is the “noble number” of the such number. if the preimage of any point is at least a certain number of the corresponding number . . . a semi-conjugal of @ xmath459 into a space of flow (semi-continuous): a circle in which @ xmath459 is the space @ xmath459  mid-python (x i)    u     u    u                            / Now let math445 be any pair of unique uniquely ergodic geodesic laminations with math446 . by the results of Section 2 of xcite, there is a complete train line of math58 which carries math347 and hits math446 well. The continuity of math28 follows the formula of lemma . . . if math466 are the measured geodesic laminations for math15, then the length of math372 with respect to the metric set by math15 is contained in the interval math469 . for a suitable numbering of the branches of math48 and modifying math48 by a sequence of shifts, the results of math444 show that we can choose our train track so that it is in the set math438 .  . by construction, we can make an infinitely complete and equivocal split and shifting of math272 such that the intersection math312 consists of a unique point which is only the class of math448 and the intersection math465 is a unique point which is only the class of math446 . rafi @xcite showed that for each quadratic differential @xmath15 acre of surface, one on the riemann surface corresponding to @xmath33, the xmath15-lengths of the short-sleeved curves of that short-sleeved curve (i.e. the lengths of the represented geodesics) are bounded from above by a universal constant math468. For instance, let us recall from cite the definition of a vertex cycle for a railway track on math58 . . . such a vertex cycle is a simple closed curve math79, carried by math79, and such that the transverse measure defined by math79 spans an extreme ray in the convex polygon of all transverse measures on math58. For a better explanation, we will identify math273 with a subset of our suspension space. For the following explanation, recall from cite the definition of a s cycle for a train math58 . such a s cycle is a simple closed curve, @ ms79, which is carried by @ ms79, and which, transversely, crosses an extreme ray in the convex polygon of all transverse measures on @ ms58. let xmath445 be the pair of transverse measured geodesic ribs which are defined by the lift xmath475 of xmath476, as determined by xmath444 . now, the number of cycles is uniformly divided, and therefore, we have xmath478 for a universal number, and xmath449 for a universal number, and xmath110 for a universal number, and a single xmath110 for a universal number, xmath449 , so the weight of the tangential measure xmath446 on any branch of xmath67 in the image of xmath480 is bounded from above by xmath449, so that the intersection of xmath449 and the vertex cycle xmath482 is bounded from above by xmath449, and hence by the choice of xmath480 this total weight is uniformly bounded. Xcite, since the space xmath66 of transverse measures on xmath58 is occupied by the vertex cycles, there is a decomposition @ xmath478, where @ xmath479 and @ xmath480 are the vertex cycles of xmath286. Therefore, the total weight of the tangential measure xmath446 disposed on a large branch of xmath286 is one, and therefore the total weight of the tangential measure xmath446 in the image of xmath480 is proportionately proportionately proportionately proportionate. [bounded] it follows from the lemma, bounded by a general observation of the piecewise Euclidean metric, defined by the quadratic differential of xmath489 and its relation to the preimages of xmath15 in xmath489 . let xmath485 be a number which is mapped by xmath485 to a periodic point of the teichmller Flow. Let xmath485 be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence, which realizes xmath272 and xmath474 be the lift of xmath15 defined by xmath475 . . . Let xmath485 be the calculated geodesic laminations defined by the quadratic differential xmath475 . . . for this let xmath495 be the subgraph of xmath286 of all branches whose weight with respect to the measure xmath63 given by xmath496 is at least @ xmath496 . . . A mapping of xmath498 implies that xmath498 is very small (depending on xmath157) , if xmath329 is the tangential measure on xmath286 defined by the vertical measured geodesic laminate of xmath15, then xmath499 is proportional to xmath500, so that xmath500 is proportional to xmath500. Therefore, if xmath498 is small, then the minimum of all xmath498 of the xmath498 of the xmath498 lengths of xmath79 is very small. The above-mentioned analysis, the result of @xcite, is that the assignment of xmath506 is quasi-geodesic. Now, if xmath498 is the tangential measure on xmath286, measured by the vertically measured geodesic lamination of xmath5 is so small that xmath500 is uniformly bounded , and xmath501 is very small. Hence, if xmath504 is small, then the minimum of all xmath503 is very small. Moreover, if the orbit of xmath15 under the teichmller geodesic flows is periodic, then, for sufficiently small xmath321 it does not intersect the subset of teichmller space of hyperbolic metrics whose systole is smaller than xmath157, it does not intersect the subset of teichmller space of hyper It is well known that a new and systematic estimate of the proportions of the space in which a quadratic differential of areas of one area is created in the lebesgue measure. It is a measure that is invariant, ergodic, and mixing under the teichmller flow, and is precisely measured in the space of quadratic differentials whose vertical and horizontal measured geodesic laminations are uniquely ergodic and filling up a specific space of xmath4 . . . so that the maximal weight disposed by xmath329 on a large branch of xmath58 is equal to one . . . a consequence of which the sequence xmath517 is contained in a compact subset of xmath464. . . . Masur and veech . . . have constructed a probability measure in the lebesgue measure class on the space Xmath4 of area one quadratic differentials over moduli space. This measure is invariant, ergodic and mixing with teichmller flow, and provides the whole measure to the space of quadratic differentials whose horizontal and vertical measured geodesics are uniquely ergodic and filling in xmath0. Moreover, the measure is absolutely constant with respect to the strong stable and unstable foliation. After a test of masur @ xcite, for every @ xmath522 there is a number @ xmath523 such that @ xmath524 for every @ xmath525 . . . if xmath519 is an @ xmath519 invariant borel probability measure on xmath526 . . . Suppose there is no such measure . . . that is, the calculation is measurable. . . . . Note, however, that xmath526 can be represented as a complex set of compact sets and therefore there is a compact subset @ xmath36 of xmath526 with xmath521 . Note, however, that the subset xmath526 is a countable union of compact sets and so that there is some compact subset @ xmath36 of xmath4 with xmath520. thus it is possible to choose a measurable function for xmath526. The map of xmath531 is continuous . . . since xmath531 is a compact metrizable space, the space of all probability measures on xmath531 is compact . . . and if we only show that whenever @xmath534 in @xmath531 in @xmath537, then @xmath535 . . . then we have the measure in @xmath538, which is the measure in math538, that is, a measure in math538, which is a sum of dirac measures backed by the endpoints of all lifts of the closed geodesic to math538 . since the angle between @xmath537 and @xmath537 is slender, the map in math537 is slender, we have the . we have . there is a one-to-one correspondence between the space of all locally finite @ math11—invariant borel measures on the product of @math538 which give full measure to the pairs of unique, uniquely ergodic points, and the space of all @math5—invariant borel measures on @math4 . The teichmller geodesic is known to be dense in @math538, and the two-to-one point is the pair in @math538 which consists of the horizontal and the vertical, projective measured geodesic lamination of a quadratic differential defining a lift from the closed teichmller “a word of nonsense about the zero bounds of the tiling flow for a finite fraction, and so for a tiling flow of a certain fraction, let us assume that there is a tiling flow of a fraction of xmath5 with respect to xmath5 . . . This is the tiling bounds of a fraction. It is called the pendulum. ‘As a result of this the plumage flows to a certain fraction of xmath5 – for some fraction of xmath5 , we might assume that a fraction of xmath5 is contained in the last image of the closed orbit of xmath5 under the map xmath28. – for xmath544 – be a hullum-thrusting chancel, in accordance with xmath545 – for xmath544 – and, in the alternative, as before, the axis of the slide is xmath544. By the logic of the proof of lemma, the support of these measures is contained in a compact subset of xmath464, which is a subset of xmath27 . Nevertheless, it follows from the discussion in the proof of lemma, that the support of @ xmath63 is contained in the preimage of the closed orbit of xmath15 under the map . . . . So the expression “math” — a ratio xmath6— with the stochastic matrix xmath25—creates a markov probability measure on xmath26 of finite type which is invariant at the moment of the shift and gives the full measure to the set of normal points . . . note that the identity xmath561 for all xmath266 is equivalent to the invariance of xmath329 under the shift. Then the probability vector xmath163, together with the stochastic matrix xmath25, defines a Markov probability measure on xmath273 of finite type which is invariant at the moment of the shift and gives the full measure to the set of normal points . . . since by corollary (submix) our submix is topologically mixing, namely, the submix @ xmath562 is equivalent to a bernoulli shift (p. 79 of xcite) . . . note that the identity of xmath561 for all @ xmath273 is equivalent to the invariance of xmath329 at the time of the shift. , we call a bernoulli measure for the teichmller geodesic flow . . . let xmath569 be the borel set of all projective measured geodesic laminations on xmath0 which are unique ergodic and whose support fills up xmath0 and denoted by xmath570 the diagonal in xmath571 . . . if a bernoulli measure for xmath5 is constant with respect to the strong stable and unstable foliation . . . the quadratic differentials in xmath10 with uniquely ergodic horizontal and vertical measured geodesic laminations filling up xmath0 are (non-canonically) homeomorphic to xmath579 by choosing a borel map which connects a pair of transverse projective measured geodesic laminations in xmath574 to a point on the teichmller geodesic determined by the pair, and extending this map so that it commutes with the natural xmath575 - actions. As we follow @xcite and conclude that there is a non-constant function in xmath208 which is almost sure to have cesaro averages of xmath234 of the form xmath587, i.e. for positive and negative times . . . so there is a continuous function in xmath590 on xmath4 with a compact support and a firm root, so that xmath590 does not converge weakly to zero as in xmath586 . so the radon measure in xmath580 on xmath580 is absolutely continuous with respect to the product of xmath578. . . . then there is a continuous function in xmath590 on xmath4 with a firm root and a firm root, so that the rise from xmath590 to xmath10 is well defined and continuous on the lines in xmath575 . by replacing xmath208 with the function xmath588 for sufficiently small xmath587 guarantees that there is a subset @ xmath589 of full measure, so that the rise from xmath590 to xmath10 is well defined and continuous on the lines in xmath575 . the periods of the function xmath590 define a measurable measurable map of @ xmath11 invariant to the set of closed subgroups of @ xmath575 that is constant by ergodicity. The cross ratio function in @xcite is unique and fills up @xmath0. Since @xmath602 is a typical point for @xmath63 on the same strong stable manifold in @xmath4, then @xmath602 for a suitable choice of a distance function, @xmath29, on @xmath4 @ xcite , we deduce that @xmath603 has the same magnitude as @xmath606 for both strong stable and unstable manifolds. As we deduce from the continuity of the function @xmath234 and absolute continuity of @xmath63 with respect to the strong stable and unstable manifolds, we deduce that @xmath603 has the same magnitude as @xmath690 . Thus, there is an @xmath11—invariant subset of @xmath6—of full mass which is full for every @xmath609 and every @xmath618, so that for every @xmath618 and every @xmath618, the function @xmath690 is constant almost everywhere along the strong stable manifold @xmath17 and the strong unstable manifold @xmath102 . We recall that there is a natural action of the group xmath633 on xmath10, where the diagonal subgroup of xmath633 acts as a geodesic flow. So the pair xmath633 intersects xmath626 in a unique point xmath626, the pair xmath624 intersects xmath625 in a unique point xmath626, and finally the pair xmath627 intersect xmath628 in a unique point xmath629 . . . recall that the group xmath633 operates on xmath10 in a natural manner, with the teichmller geodesic flow of xmath620. The resulting function xmath631 is continuous and satisfies xmath630 . The value xmath630 does not depend on the choice of quadratic differential xmath15 defining the pair xmath627, the resulting function xmath631 is continuous and satisfies xmath632 . We conclude that for every @xmath321 there are points @xmath642 such as @xmath643. In other words, the function @xmath590 has arbitrarily small periods, which is a contradiction to the assumption that the number of periods of @xmath590 equals @xmath595 for some @xmath596 . . . .

[29] let . . . be an admissible sequence, with the additional property that there is a certain . . . and that the sequences . . . and . . . are both tight . . . . . . by Xcite , . . . . . In this respect the corollary is that the cavity function of our borel is in the mode of semi-conjugal equivalence to the teichmller flow. In this manner, the quadratic differential of @ xmath659 consists of horizontally measured geodesic laminations, and of vertically measured geodesic laminations, is contained in the lift of @ xmath36 to @ xmath10 . . . for every @ xmath663 choose a numbered train path of combinatorial type @ xmath664. . . . let @ xmath665 be the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations carried by @ xmath664 . . . let                                             , , , , , , , , , , ,  , , , ,  , , , ,  , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  , ,  , I took a full divide.

By the movement invariance of the measure invariant under the action of the mapping class, the probability of the equivalence measures of @ xmath63 is dependent on the combinatorial type of @ xmath672 and on the choice of a representative from the shift equivalence class of @ xmath266.
