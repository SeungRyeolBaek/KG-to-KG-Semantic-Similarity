It is, therefore, interesting to study the constrained symmetry energy of the nuclear atom in the symmetric and the lg phase transition in the symmetric; and, in addition, the new research on the lg phase transition in the symmetric phase has received a recent boost from the extraordinary progress in developing more advanced neutrino beams which can be used in the terrestrial laboratories to create large volumes of highly symmetric nuclear atoms. It is, therefore, particularly interesting to examine how this constrained symmetry energy can be improved in asymmetric nuclear matter by focusing on its isospin phase and the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter; and, for the lg phase transition in symmetric matter, one is expected to see some distinctly new properties, because of the isospin degree of freedom and of the interactions and of the additional conservation laws of conservation. At present, several recent studies have focused on the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter. But in an asymmetric material, the lg phase transition in asymmetric material will exhibit some distinctly new features because of the degree of freedom of the isospin atom and its associated interactions and extra-restriction laws . Fortunately, recent experiments on heavy ion diffusion have enabled us to put a strict limit on the symmetry energy of niobium-rich matter to sub-normal density betty, chen, lichen. However, in a simulation of the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction, a single particle potential is obtained by a mdi-dependent collision of the heavy ion with a mdi-dependent. The first one is a mdi-dependent interaction, a mdi-dependent one (the first one being the dispersed and momentum dependent interaction, which, in heavy-ion collisions, is strongly constrained by the dispersed diffusion of a mdi); the second one is a momentum-dependent one (the third) in which the mdi-dependent part of the single nucleon potential is mdi-dependent; the third one is an isoscalar momentum-dependent (emdyi) in which the isoscalar part of the single nucleon potential is momentum dependent, while the isovector part of the single nucleon potential is momentum independent. , the inset of the equations of the parameters of the parameters of the isospin and momentum-dependent mdi-action shows the potential energy density of a neutron with mdi-extirpated asymmetrical material, at xmath0; in the following solids das0 , chen03 , chen05, mdi xmath6 (ascending vector, eq. mdiv) leads to the following single particle potential for a nucleon with momentum @ xmath5 and isospin @ xmath5 in the asymmetrical asymmetrical matter (dead asymmetry @ xmath4) in thermally Moreover, a study of the isospin-miscible mid-interaction has been accomplished. It is particularly, as part of the matrix etymology of the Ni+/Ion transport in the secondary, isospin-imperial, ion-dominated collisions of li-b, chen-, chen-05, lichen-05, li-pion, li-06, yong-062, yong-062 , yong-062 , yong-062 , yong-07 .

Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. In the inverse process of acquiescence, the two tetrahedral values of xmath3 correspond to two different phases with different densities, namely, the lower density phase (with a larger xmath3) is a gas phase, while the higher density phase (with a smaller xmath71 value) is a gas phase, while the higher density phase (with a smaller xmath71 value) is a gas phase, while the higher density phase (with a smaller xmath72 value) has a chemically unstable region. In this case, c) is the declination point, whereas d) is the declination point, while d) is the declination point, while d (d) is the declination point, while d  is the declination point, and  == ====================================================================================================== . . . . . The chemical potential of neutrons is exponentially increased by pressure, and the pressure of it increases substantially. This feature, as you can see from fig. [pdelta] (a), is that the stiffer symmetry energy ( @ xmath25) lowers the critical point (cp) and makes the maximal asymmetry (ma) a little smaller. Besides, it is also apparent that the value of apxmath20 does not affect the equal concentration (ec) point, while apxmath20 lifts it slightly (as if by about @ xmath89 mev / a**) in Fig. [a](b) shows the section of the surface at @ xmath88 mev in the mid-interaction with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25. Fig. [b] shows the section of the surface of the binodal surface at @ xmath88 mev in the emdyi and mid-interaction with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25. Moreover, as expected, the value of @ xmath20 does not affect the equal concentration (ec) point, but it seems to have no effect on the ma point . Besides, as expected, the value of @ xmath20 does not affect the equal concentration (ec), but the momentum dependence slightly increases it ( by about @ xmath89 mev / @ xmath80) . It is possible to say that the limited pressure and the area of the coexistence region are still sensitive to the modulation of the symmetry energy, with a softer symmetry energy (@xmath24) resulting in a higher threshold and a larger area of coexistence in this temperature. In a word, we have studied the fluid-gas phase transition in hot, neutron-rich nuclear matter by analyzing three nuclear effective interactions: namely, the isospin and momentum-dependent mid-action constrained by the isospin diffusion data of heavy ions, the momentum-dependent middle-action, and the isoscalar momentum-dependent emdyi interaction. This observation implies that the momentum-dependent side-action has little effect on the hot, asymmetric nuclear transition, while the isospin side-effect is significantly different from the side-effect of the isoscalar side-effect. Moreover, the side-effect of the isospin side-effect is very sensitive to the strength of the symmetry energy, which is softer, and therefore leads to a higher critical pressure and a larger area of the side-effect region. Compared with the results of the mdi and the mid-effect as shown in fig. pdelta (a), we see that the surface of the side-effect is like that of the side-effect.
