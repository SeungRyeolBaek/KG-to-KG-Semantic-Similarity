The release of  226cc was first observed by [Dya] (pounds 1990, nandra & pounds 1994) and later by other authors such as ginga (pounds 1990, nandra & pounds 1994) from the emission of neutral iron. Recent reports on these lines include gondoin (2003; ngc 3227) and page (2003; ngc 766) , pounds (2003; ngc 766) , turner (2002; ngc 3516) , obrien (2001; ngc 359) , reeves (2001; mrk 205), and many others. There are very few broad lines in xmm - only very few, for example, Mcg @ xmath76 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 (seeking for example mcg@ xmath730) (seeing that the metal is sulfide in k@ xmath7); but the asca of -705 showed rather wide profiles, although re-analysis of some data suggested that these lines might be narrower than the original measurement. The broad-red line seen in M.K. 509 is also apparently ionised. the narrow-red line of m.k. 509 was also apparently ionised. The baldwin effect was well known for optical and uv radiation lines, and the first report of baldwin (78) was that the ew of the c-iv (@ xmath8 = 1549) line decreased with increasing uv radiance. the anti-correlated effects of the ionization spectrum of different ions were also identified. In baldwin (77) , he noted that the ew was actually more strongly associated with redshift than with luminosity, and this had led him to say that the anti-correlated results were rather weaker than the positively charged ones. It must be noted that although the baldwin effect is generally considered to be an anti-correlated correlation between equivalent width and luminosity, green (2001) asserted that ew was more strongly associated with redshift than with luminosity. croom (2002) found that, in 12 of the fourteen lines tested, the stronger correlation was with absolute magnitude than with the temperature. In other words, although baldwin (1997) was a general term of anti- correlation between the diameter and luminosity, green (2001) asserted that ew was more strongly correlated with redshift than with luminosity. epoch data, including a sample of epochs which we call ‘the li’ or ‘red-shifted’ z-dt1 galaxies, for a sample that includes both epochs and qsos. We have also obtained for this sample five other epochs which are called ‘the li’ or ‘dt1 galaxies’, which consist mainly of our proprietary targets and public observations obtained from the online xmm’ archives. The luminosities were computed for the 210 kev rest-frame, and at an error of 90 per cent the maximum accuracies for the rest-frame equivalent widths were given. The narrow epoch shows that the epoch has declined in intensity with increasing luminosity, but it is concluded that the entire baldwin effect is due to the broad epoch. .. the figure epoch–lum plots the rest-frame epoch against the reddened 210 kev luminosity. the type i agn which were included in this sample, grouped into three groups: pf 5506 matt 2001; pf 3516 turner 2002; 1h 0707–019 boller 2002; ton s180 vaughan 2002 and vaughan 2003, private communication . . . in this paper we demonstrate, and explain, a baldwin effect for the narrow fe k in fe k. A weighted linear regression is used to find the slope of the best-fit line to the log log plot of ew to luminosity, that is, the power law fit. Then the regression is carried out by weighting the best-fit line with the log log plot of ew to luminosity, that is, the power law fit . this process is carried out using two different methods. First, the upper limits were completely eliminated; this gave a value of xmath70.17 xmath12 0 . 04 . . . it was found that, agreeing with the simple spearman rank, the ew- luminosity correlation was the dominant one. , which explains the increased line strength as the consequence of the higher luminosity. Moreover, the influence of the highest luminosity on the line strength was apparent. However, even when one considered only those at z@ xmath5 0 . 1 , the inverse relationship between ew and luminosity was consistent (slope 0 . . . xmath12 0 . ) with that found for the entire sample. Nevertheless, it was found that even for only those at z @ xmath5 . 1 , the inverse relationship between ew and luminosity was stable (slope 0 . . . I am sure that in such a case the contrary reaction cannot simply be explained by beaming. To illustrate the general effect, I have created the figure - bins . . . if there is an upper limit of the size of the value of the ruler, a smaller bar was placed at the same proportion; there was a similar decrease in the decrease of the ruler even if the upper limit were dropped, although the range of values observed is not very large. - if the ratio of the material to the line of the alpha is agn, then e = lv, 0dada, where e = lv and  = e = e = e = lst; since the inclination of the slope is often considered to be a reflection, one might assume that the line would be of stronger emission (as the fluorescence might come from reflection) but the 210 kev band is not very sensitive to reflection; this is not the case; in the inclination, on the other hand, there is a slight trend, some of the steepest slopes show the highest ews. The ew of lst is shown in a number of wavelengths: a [fek] or a gamma (y ] is the energy of fek, a [fek], where ek is the energy of fek[fe] (ek] of the surface of the fek (zhel w], where ek[b] is the energy of fek [fe The proposed ew of the iron k line in ngc 5548 is likely to be too large to have been obtained from gc5548 itself. The predicted ew is 36 ev, whereas the measured value is almost four times larger, at 133 ev. however, the change in the covering factor or the abundance of the gccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc line is one of the processes of photoionisation. Thus, it is necessary to explain the observed ew - luminosity correlation. it must be determined whether a variation in the parameters could explain the observed ew - luminosity correlation . It is possible that in the above equation the ph ew of the cloud is reduced by a systematic underestimation and diminishes with increasing luminosity . , it can be computed with modest values ( a few tenths of percent) . However, there is no conclusive evidence for very high blr ph. , the observed ph by optical uv lines can be reproduced in small values ( few 10ths of percent). The iron k line is a different physical process (ferocity) from the optical uv lines (photoionization) . . . . they mention that they use a cosmological constant of 0 for cosmological constants, if h . . . t, h . . . ; and, if h . . . . l . l . . , they say, gives a similar range, where h . . . xmath2 l . xmath27 becomes a . . . . the euphoric nature of the spectrum of x rays of light in the ephemeral medium can be produced by a corresponding morphology of the ephemeral continuum in the flux of the flint material, although it might be expected that the line of uv-like light can be observed . . . green et al.

However, the aeromodelling models indicate that blr metallicity is increased with luminosity (e.g., hamann & ferland 1993; shemmer & netzer 2002). (As an intermediate condition, there is a dependence of an ew which is linearly proportional to the column density, but yaqoob et al. (2001) note that the equation is only valid for n = xmath22 , xmath5 , if the absorption of fe ii is less than unity) . The thickness of the yang line, which is between xmath0 and xmath 8, is not of the kind shown in figure fe ii; figure fe ii, figures fe ii ews from marziani 2003. According to some blr models, the metallicity of blr is increased with radiance (e.g., hamann & ferland 1993; shemmer & netzer 2002) , however, this fact is quite undisputed in the presence of a higher density of blr. Moreover, in some models the assumption of higher density is considered, for example, radovich & rafanelli 1994; recondo-gonzalez 1997 ) , values of blr are a few thousand kilometres @ xmath6—which is an issue resolvable by _chandra_. However, lee (2002) obtain a width of 11 000 km s @ xmath35 km s @ xmath6 for the resolution of a narrow component; thence the width decreases to 3600 km s @ xmath36 for the high flux. - Here, too, there is a difference, as has been noted above, between the narrow iron line and the h @ xmath25 spectra, which may be due to the larger diameter of the grating. - yaqoob (2001) measured a fwhm of 6000 km s @ xmath6 for the ngc 5548 ngc, which also supports the origin of the blr. - - yaqoob (2000) estimated the width of 11 000 @ xmath35 km s @ xmath6 for the resolved narrow component, and this falls to 3600 @ xmath36 km s @ xmath6 for the “high” flux. - In the book of nlr, by a very recent work by yaqoob et al. (2003) he believes that such a narrowed disc is formed in a disc that is viewed face on and has a flat emissivity profile . nayakshin (2000a, b) reports that a baldwin effect is produced by the ionization of the skin of the disc, and thus a clear opacity. This hypothesis is supported by the confusion of the narrow line in M. 841 (ptrucci 2002). This line is of a rather small size compared with one single observation made over a span of 15 hours. The width of the line is limited to that of a single uv. that is, it has a range of 0.0 to 170 uv. However, there is no appreciable difference between the narrow and the broad lines, shown by the t-test and the asurv (to account for the upper limits) . In the case of M. 841 the torus is the only object in which the line has been observed. They find that, for a thomson optical depth of m37, m37=0, m37114=2 the ew of the line is of the order of m37 ev assuming an unobscured view; for m37 = 2 this value decreases to about 55 ev. there is also a small decrease in the ew when the opening angle is increased. In m37 the narrow line, with a very large change in ew, can not be explained. In particular, it is not known why the most luminous objects should have a fairly normal ew compared with lower luminosity objects, as the figure shows from the optical/uv blr lines, and that they have no corresponding narrower 6 kwv kev kev kev line. Just as he said earlier, if the structure is not corrugated metal, then no very strong reflection could be seen. As a result of observing the value of n  xmath22 = 2 math33  math22 , a fluorescent iron line with ew  80 ev is given, and if ew does not scale linearly with abundance, then the values of krolik and ghisellini should be scaled to math1 142 and msakni, respectively, to compare them with yaqoob's result. There are also some observations of this type in this spectra, though the results are generally poorly resolved. Moreover, in the spectra of the torus - which is compared with the spectra here, - one can see reflection components, though not necessarily from the torus. This is not altogether surprising, since most of the objects are very low redshift, that is, the frame bands covered by xmm do not extend as far as xmath1 10 kev, while the supposition of a compton reflection hump is expected to peak around 300 kev. Having taken the equations for the ew - at the same time, the coefficients of the refractive index should be adjusted to xmath1 141 and yata13 127 ev, the slope of yaqoob should be scaled to xmath1 141 or yata13 127 ev - we see here some spectra that suggest this ref If the x-ray baldwin effect really is caused by a decrease in the covering factor of the torus, it will have a positive effect on the number of type 2 qsos . many seyfert 2 galaxies are known, but very few qsos are discovered. This is similar to the work of mushotzky & ferland ( 1984) who proposed a concentration of the dusty gas walls in the gas walls, and that the heavier radiation of the more luminous agn may prevent them from forming. This result is similar to that of mushotzky & ferland (2001) who proposed a condensation coefficient and hence the masking factor to explain the baldwin effect. This effect is similar to the results of mushotzky & ferland (2001) who propose a more sublimated ionization parameter, and hence a greater quantity of the film thickness. This decrease in film thickness is explained by the x-ray baldwin effect for the narrow, neutral iron line that is evident in many agns. As the density of 210 kev increases the equal width of the line is reduced, the equivalent width of the line becomes smaller. This decrease in film thickness has a certain importance for the number of type-2 qsos. Many Galaxies are known, but very few are obscured. I have no proof either of the origin of the line, that is, of the clouds, or of the reflection of distant matter (i.e., of the torus).
