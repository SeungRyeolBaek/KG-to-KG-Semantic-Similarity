In general, in the infrared state of the nucleus, the nucleus is connected with a set of qubits, ancilla, in a specific reference state (if we suppose Xmath5). Xmath5 and Xmath6 are the basis vectors of the two dimensions of the nucleus and Xmath7. . . . . . - ; . . , 0 + e - i , - a . . . . . , i . . . , 1 . . . . qubits are very fragile, that is, the state of a molecule is easily changed by the environment or a random error. . . . this information is encoded in a quantum state, - Xmath4 , which is parameterized for a qubit by the notation 10, - 11, - , 0 + - 0 + - , 0 + - , 0 + - 0 + 0 + You see that the symmetric state, xmath10, is a isomorphism of the same zmath10 state , but in this case the information is scattered among the entangled qubits - the original quantum information is diluted - . so how can we extract the information from the symmetric state, xmath10, xmath19? there is an ideal, universal disentangler, which can be transformed to the unitary transformation type of disentanglement. the ideal thing would be to have a perfect universal disentangler, which could perform a unitary transformation, like the unitary transformation - but this is not possible. In the large xmath10 limit, the density of individual qubits is approximately equal to xmath28 . . . for this fidelity we find the expression - - 0 = . . . we see that the fidelity of xmath23 is equal to unity (as it should be, because it is xmath25) and in the limits of xmath27 we find xmath28 . You see, the procedure has been proposed by bandyopadhyay et al. xcite . sup> . The disentanglers we are considering are very approximate, and they have been considered by bandyopadhyay et al. xcite . . . they modeled two different operations, the first was the state of a bipartite quantum system and transforms it into a state that is the product of the reduced density matrixes of the two subsystems. The second, which is a generalization of the first, starts with a state of a bipartite quantum system and maps it into a state that is the same reduced density matrixes as the original state. We, however, introduce a probabilistic disentangler, in which, at the output of a specific measurement, we generate the desired single-qubit state. iii) The probability of the result of the measurement is state-dependent. Finally, we propose a probabilistic disentangler, such that, when a specific measurement over an ancillary is performed at the output, the desired single-qubit state is generated. “The result of the measurement is the result of the measurement to enlarge the configuration of a single-quibit state. The configuration, called the “Fine-Field,” is simply a linear projection, which corresponds to the calculation of the “Fine-Field,” and is of the same dimensions as the number of angles xmath37. [4] Therefore, by comparing the probability of the same angle and its normality, we obtain the single-quibit state, in the shape of the density operator (Meas), d = d = d (, d ; d = d = d = d = d , d = d , d = d = d , d = d = d = d (, d = d) | d = d = d (, d = d ) ( d = d) = d = d = d = d = d = d = d = d = d , d = d = d = d = d = d = d = d , d = d - d = , d = f - n = ... , - “We assumed that a priori knowledge existed that our “xmath10” qubit was prepared in a symmetrical state ([2]), and that the parameters of the single qubit were unknown, and that the integration measure on the state space of the single qubit was constant. We now want to find an upper bound for the average fidelity which can be achieved by a wide variety of measurement-based disentanglement procedures. For a fixed @ xmath53, the probability of the output being @ xmath57 is @ xmath62, and the probability of the output being @ xmath62, and the probability of it being @ xmath63 is @ xmath63 . In addition to the general probabilities @ xmath53, we will leave the conditional probabilities @ xmath61 unspecified, as that will allow us to think about a wide range of strategies. For example, suppose that our [11] qubit is prepared in the symmetric state ( [2] with unknown parameters @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 associated with a single [12] qubit state ( [1] . . . The first variable is xmath70, and then the second is xmath73, which contains the super-supernumerary variable. This high-preliminary variable is then assumed to be xmath70. Then we have that xmath72 and xmath73. This fidelity is equal to 2/3, and in the limits @ xmath26 it is equal to 1/ 2 . for other xmaths the fidelity of the universal quantum device is greater than the fidelity of the universal quantum device. , as we have already said, quantum mechanics does not allow us to construct a perfect disentangler which will perform transformations ([7]) for an arbitrary state (which we have no idea) in the state of xmath42 diluted with the state of xmath10 in the state of xmath10 symmetrical ([3] ) state . Nevertheless, we can try to design optimal disentanglers which will perform best under certain conditions . so let us suppose our disentangler, . . . , is a quantum system with a xmath77-dimensional hilbert space, spanned by basis vectors @ xmath78 (@ xmath79) . . . in the state of xmath48, we find max== . We are looking for the optimal disentangler that would extract the information in the best possible way. We have put some constraints on the use of the disentangler which determines the optimal disentangler, i.e., to disentangle the qubit in the state @xmath29 from the state @xmath10 in the optimal and the state @xmath9 . This universality of the disentangler then ensures that the information from the symmetrical state ([3]) is extracted for all states equally. This disentangler is described by the transformation: n - 0 d - d - 0 - d - 0 - d - 1 - 0 - basis vectors of the disentangler. Using these two conditions, we have found the unitary transformation that realizes the optimal covariant disentangler, that is, disentangles the qubit-state @ xmath29 from the qubit-state @ xmath9 in the optimal and the @ xmath29-state independent way (see appendix). this transformation is described by the transformation: |n|0|| d||| 0||||| |||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| - it's true that the whole study of the field of quantum mechanics does not exist in the field of quantum mechanics. This is one of the main findings of our work: the optimal covariant quantum disentangler functions better than if the information is extracted (disentangled, distilled) from the syntactically symmetrized state ([3] ) with the help of the optimal measurement. - by the decompositions : 0 - n-0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - e 0 - 0 - - It is not surprising that the quantum disentangler works better. - the optimal universal (covariant with respect to the rotation of the input qubit) quantum disentangler is given by the transformations: - 0 - n-0 - 1 - 0 - e - 0 - 5 - basis states of the quantum disentangler, @ xmath89 is its initial state, and the parameters @ xmath90 and @ xmath83 are given by eq. ( [15] ) The input state of the device is assumed to be xmath95, and the ideal output state, to which the actual output should be compared, is xmath96. This entails that the final state is only a product of the state of the particles and the entangler state, which means that the entangler states can be omitted from the problem. The calculation of the average fidelity is given in the appendix, and will not be detailed. In this case, the universality of the conditions in the case of the disentangler, the qubits at the output of which the qubits become entangled, are called in that case, a semi-conjugal device, and the average fidelity is calculated from the same input. The input state is first calculated, using the above transformation, and then the distance is derived from the disentangler, to obtain an output density matrix, @ xmath98. So, the average fidelity is a transform that maximizes the average fidelity, and this transform is a simple state swapping transformation. The average fidelity is the result of the process of 'independent' and independent of this ensemble, so that the average fidelity is independent of the ensemble. The average fidelity is, as a rule, larger than the average fidelity of the optimal universal disentangler (fig. Fig. 1). Therefore, the transformation which maximizes the average fidelity is a sort of 'swapping' transformation. - we see that the mean fidelity of this entangled entangler is equal to @xmath43, which is more than the average fidelity of the entangled entangler. Let us examine a simple quantum network that takes the -no-bits state ([3]) as input. The network is composed of two vectors of @xmath111 and @xmath110 (eq.). - and - (|| ] - - (||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ...|||= ==>||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| However, as it is the case with quantum devices, universal devices were not the best, at least if average fidelity is considered criterion. We may consider the optimal diffraction of the time series (A), a method that combines a world of inputs with the world of outputs. Unitarity immediately implies that we can use our disentangler transformations (a. 1 and a. 0) to calculate the fidelity of the actual output to the ideal output (A). The result of this transformation is given by a -a -a. we will now use this expression to find the output density matrix and to draw the disentangler itself. if we introduce the notation @ Xmath124 and @ Xmath125, then we can write the result of the transformation (a. 1 and a) at Xmath127, the output fidelity is given by @ Xmath127 . the output fidelity is given by @ Xmath127. We consider the input of the disentangler as a vector, the space spanned by the vectors @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 to be filled in with the space spanned by the vectors @ xmath117, and ... ‘As a result of this, we see that the fidelity is independent of phases of ‘A’ and ‘B’. - ‘Alpha   2  ( beta   ast )  2  sqrt  n  langle d ‘Alpha   2   rangle + – ‘ast   ast ’ – ‘ast  2   rangle   – in order for this to be independent of ‘A’ and ‘A’, the terms in brackets must be proportional to ‘A’ and ‘A’. In order for this to be independent of ‘A’ and ‘A’, it must be balanced by ‘A’. And this is the result, in order to maximise the ‘A’ and ‘A’ of ‘A’, we have to maximize ‘A’ and ‘A’ of ‘A’. In order to find the optimal input-state dependent disentangler, we find the explicit form of the transformation (a. 1 ) such that the averaged fidelity of xmath154 (with xmath141 given by eq. (a. 5 )) is maximized. , so after the integration of the parameter xmath51, we find [a . 19] ...  0   4 +  2  2 ...  0  0  2 ...  0  2 ...   0  2 ... ] —to an even greater extent —from xmath165 — to xmath102 — so that the optimal state-dependent disentangling transformation is, in fact, equal to eq — (Example 17a) , which we wanted to prove .
