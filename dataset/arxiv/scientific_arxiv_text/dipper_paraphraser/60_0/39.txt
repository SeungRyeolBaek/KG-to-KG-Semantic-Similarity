(those are the calculations he made to obtain the distribution of the symmetric, symmetric markov random flight with unit speed in the euclidean space. ) is a highly complex, tetrahedral, with constant limits whose inverse hyperbolic tangent function is of an extremely complicated form. These calculations cannot be considered independent because they are connected with one another over time (the speed is the distance traveled per unit of time, and the intensity is the mean number of reversals per unit of time) , the presence of these parameters in any process of markov random flight makes it unquestionably the most adequate and realistic model for describing the diffused state of the euclidean space. The higher the unquestionable, the lower the two-dimensional euclidean space, the higher the results. It is possible, however, to obtain in the high even-dimensional euclidean space, xmath, the distribution of the motions in clear terms (see xcite, xcite and xcite, respectively) the absolute constant part of the transition density of the symmetric markov random flight with unit speed in the euclidean space xmath1 is undoubtedly the most difficult and complicated to study. Moreover, the absence of the speed parameter of this formula somewhat impoverishes the model, since it does not allow the study of the limiting behaviour of the motion under various scaling conditions (in kacs, for example) . The difficulty of examining the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight and, on the other hand, the great theoretical and applied importance of the problem of the study of the infinite-scale diffusion in the space xmath1 compelled the researchers to employ various approaches to study this model. . . . so as to obtain an approximation to a specific case of this kind, the technique of asymptotics has been used. In the case of the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight there were certain significant results obtained for its characteristic functions . . . in particular, the closed-form expression for the laplace transform of the characteristic function was obtained by different methods in ( * ? ? ? ? ? ) and ( * ? ? ? ) (for unit speed) and ( * ? ? ) (for arbitrary speed) . The asymptotic result was obtained by applying the inverse fourier transform of the unconditional characteristic function. Moreover, in the next passage, the inverse fourier transform of the unconditional characteristic function yielded an asymptotic formula for the transition density of the process, which is described in Chapter 5 . . . this formula shows that the density is discontinuous in the central border, but it is consistent with the angle. In the course of our analysis, we calculate the accuracy of the formula and show that it gives an approximation on short intervals, which vary in length and duration. At arbitrary timestamps, the particle, with probability 1 on a given instant, is seated in a closed three-dimensional ball, in radius, xmath21, centred at the origin, xmath21. Consider the particle s position at time xmath21, which is called the symmetric markov random flight. In the first direction, a random three-dimensional vector with uniform distribution in the unit sphere, the motion is driven by a homogeneous poisson process xmath4 of a homogeneous composition (a process whose length depends on the intensity of the switchings). at each poissonian instant, the particle instantaneously takes on a new random direction distributed uniformly in xmath21, independent of the previous motion, and moves with the same speed xmath15 until the next poisson event occurs, then it takes on a new random direction again, and so on. In section 6 we estimate the accuracy of the asymptotic formula and show that it is an excellent approximation on short intervals, whose length depends on the intensity of the switchings. The error in the obtained asymptotic formula has the order xmath6 . Let xmath19 be the position of the particle at time xmath20, which is called the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight. – let – xmath36 be the density of distribution @xmath36. – let – xmath36 be the density of distribution @xmath37. The density of distribution @xmath26 corresponds to this case is concentrated in the interior of the ball, @xmath33, and is of the definite duration. In this section we obtain the series representations of the characteristic functions, corresponding to two and three changes of direction, as well as a series of descriptive expressions, which correspond to the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight @xmath4 . This technique is our principal tool, because, as we have mentioned above, there are some closed-form expressions for the characteristic functions (both conditional and unconditional) of the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight @xmath4 . the definite duration of the density (defined by a definite period) is given by the formula: @xmath42, where @xmath43 is a single exponential function, and @xmath41 is the heavy-side unit-step function, given by @xmath47. As its singular part is explicitly indicated by (denss), our efforts are mainly concentrated on deriving the respective asymptotic formulas for the absolute duration (deadly ) of the density. ‘Second’ Xmath56 is the general hypergeometric function given by (‘ Hypergeometric Function’) (‘the Hypergeometric Function’). ‘ (Footnote 34) and the coefficients of Xmath56 are given by the formula,’ he said. ‘ In particular, for arbitrary Xmath20 changes in direction, the characteristic function of Xmath57 (that is, the fourier transform @ xmath58 with respect to spatial variable @ xmath59) of the conditional density @ xmath60 of the three-dimensional markov random flight (’n) @ xmath4 of the three-dimensional random flight of a three-dimensional random markov in the three-dimensional xmath4 corresponding to xmath61 changes in direction, is given by the formula Xmath63 ( boldsymbol  alpha) =       left   left ( text  arctg    frac  c  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert          left)               Mathcal l     mathcal l                       left [ , and that we have the end-of-the-year (#4=Cae) _      -     left (K -     2     , k +        -      -       left (K -        -      -  -         -     -         -   -   -     left (1 , 1 , 1 - k -          - k -           -  -      -  -    -                   -        -      - That is, it would be more apt to calculate it from (char2); if the one you are using is: if f t is f t, f t is f t v v f v f f t c f v f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f t v f f a f d e f f f ff ff f fl f t v f f t f f f f f t v f f f f t f  f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f  ‘f f f f f f f f ff f f f f f f f f f f ff f f f f f f f f f f ff fff fff f f f f f ff f ff ff f ff For example, we cannot invert each term of the series separately. Besides, it can be seen that the inverse fourier transform of each term does not exist for xmath83 . Thus, while there are inverse fourier transforms of the whole series (char2) and (char3), it is impossible to invert them individually and, consequently, we cannot obtain closed-form expressions for the respective densities. This result is given by the following formula:  frac   lambda  2 t  c  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert  j 1 (ct  vert  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert  j 1 The result is given by the following theorem.                                                                                        , in view of sent>2 t  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert  2 t  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert  2 t  j   ct  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert  2 t  j            sin  (ct  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert )    sin  (ct  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert   j                                                                                                  left    sin endaligned ] . . .

So in arithmetic with the first term, in a square bracket of the second term, we have: @ xmath142, and for the second term in a square bracket of the (darkness) we have: @ xmath140, because the second integrand is the density of one change of direction (theorem) or (*) * formula ([12] [12])) ) and therefore the second integral is equal to 1 . In fact, the greater the intensity of the switches, the shorter the time interval, on which no more than three changes of direction can occur with large probability. In this case, we can clearly see that the function xmath147 yields a very good coincidence with the function xmath147 at the subinterval xmath155 (fig. 2 (left)) and only at the subinterval xmath156 (fig. 3 (right)). Thus, we conclude that the greater the intensity of the switches, the shorter the subinterval Xmath. Furthermore, for the values of the intensity of switchings xmath7, we can see the same phenomenon in Figure 3 where, for xmath154, the function xmath146 yields a very good coincidence with the function xmath146 on the subinterval Xmath155 (fig. 3 (left) , while for xmath156, this good coincidence occurs only at the subinterval Xmath157 (fig. 3). This is, therefore, a fact that we can easily explain. In the appendix we have drawn series representations for some powers of the inverse tangent function which have been proved in the proofs of the above theorems. To some extent, however, these results are of a more general nature, for, to the best of the author's knowledge, there are no series representations of the kind ([22]] ,[23] ], [23] [24] [25] and [26] [26] [26] (see below) , [27] [30] . The uniform convergence of the series in c|2 [26] can be proved as follows: ([27][29] lemma b1 .[31] for the arbitrary integer [22], and for the arbitrary real [22], the following formula can be used: [26] [27] . Then, following lemma b2, we have the following series representation:    & =     k +
