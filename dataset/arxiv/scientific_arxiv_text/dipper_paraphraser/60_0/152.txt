The discovery of the shadow bands of copper oxides, the temperature dependent pseudo-gap in the discarded state, and the substantial doping dependence of the quasi-particle band structure, leave no doubt that a single particle spectral description of these materials is quite inadequate. Recent advances in electron spectroscopy have argued against the apparent simple truth that the fermi surface of cuprate superconductors is simply the surface corresponding to lda bands, with the only effect of being close to the hubbard insulator being the moderate correlation narrowing of the band width. The electron spectral spectrum, which is written @xmath7 by the constrained fermion operators, is indicated by xmath10 by the spin operator at site @xmath10. This model, which reads @xmath7 in a two-dimensional, 1d, square lattice, extends to all adjacent neighbors. It is known that the shadow bands are found, that the temperature is attenuated pseudo-gap, and that the quasi-particle band structure is fully defined. We are motivated by these developments and have analyzed the electron removal spectrum in the 1d and 2d @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 models . . . . therefore a naive explanation for this remarkable property is that the hole which is created in the nel ordered spin background is decomposed into an uncharged spin, like a domain wall, into a charged spin. . . . in the case of xmath18 . . . 22so2 , a hole that is charged by a nel ordered spin is decomposed into an uncharged spin, like a domain wall. However, a physical analysis of our numerical results is necessary in order to produce an intuitive picture of the scaling of elementary excitations in 1d, which will be useful in 2d, too. . . . in order to analyse the numerical results, it is necessary first to explain the scaling properties of elementary excitations in 1d, which will be useful in 2d. Moreover, the low energy spectrum of the 1d excitation spectrum shows the same scaling of the excitations in 1d: a high energy is found in a high energy in 1d ... and a low energy is found in 2d ... and the kinetic energy is equal to the energy of the domain wall, and the exchange energy is equal to the energy of the domain wall. The optics in 2d shows an incoherent high-energy part, with energy scale xmath2 xcite - which is completely unexpected for the current operator, which is based only on the degrees of freedom. - Figure [fig 1] shows the electron - removal spectra for the ring in xmath22. We may then begin by discussing the 1d model at half-filling. - to get more information about similarities and differences, and in contrast to the spectroscopic results, we have examined the electron - removal spectra of both in the left and right. The energies are measured in units of xmath22. - there is moreover a rather convincing numerical proof, xcite, that the hole - like low-energy excitations, can be described to very good approximation as a spin, like a spin, a spin bag - i.e., the pressure of spin was very strongly increased in the local cloud of excitations. This bottom band of frequencies, where the peaks are bound to the top of the single hole, is positioned just below the threshold level of the single hole, and its scale remains quite unchanged. We first discuss the first part of the 1d model at half-filled. We will then examine the left panel, where the electrons are measured in xmath2 . When plotting the same spectra, but measuring the energies in units of @xmath0 (right panel of Fig. 1, fig. 2), there are several groups of peaks whose excitation energy follows a very systematic progression with @xmath0. in addition, the @xmath2 band' corresponds to the holon momentum, at least at the minimum of the holon dispersion, and thus traces the holon dispersion. This is a natural elution of states with different energy scales can be clearly seen in the  double peak' of xmath25 xmath13 xmath26 and momentum xmath27: the peak with the lower binding energy falls into the @xmath27 band, the one with the higher binding energy belongs to the @xmath27 band. These peaks coexist in different energy scales, which is well seen in the  double peak' for xmath25 xmath13 xmath27 and momentum xmath27. since the spinon momentum is fixed, this group of states only traces out the holon dispersion . . . Then we have obtained the following basis for the spectral function: it is in the form of the half-filled half-filled half-filled half-filled half-filled half-filled band, whose dispersion is at xmath35; this is indicated by the thick dashed line in fig.6 . a) also the measurements of the energy relative to the respective spinon energy are of the same accuracy. For all this we know, and as we have seen earlier, the first half-filled half-filled half-filled band is shifted by the fermi momentum, @xmath30, so that its dispersion near the minimum at xmath33 can be seen in fig.7 a) comparison with the numerical results (in this case for the site ring) of fig.6 (b) shows that, indeed, to the very best accuracy, the poles of the single particle spectral function are placed on these bands. then, each * xmath36 point of this band forms the base for a complete holon band, which is tied on" to the spinon band at the maximum; this holon band is indicated by the thin lines in fig.6 (a). Then, in comparison with the numerical results (in this case for the   site ring) in fig.6 (a) we can see that indeed, to a very good approximation, the poles of the single particle spectral function fall onto these bands. But here we must note that the holon band, which has a weight of at least one atom, intersects itself, resulting in a doubling of the peak weight) , sorella and parola showed that the outermost holon band in our calculation, the one which originated from the spinon’s fermi momentum, becomes a cusp, like a singularity of the spectral weight. analyzing the structure of the various features with the value of math2 and math0, one can identify branches of states that trace out the dispersion of the fundamental excitations of the tll, namely the collective spin and charge excitations. In the thermodynamic limit the density of bands increases, and simultaneously their spectral weight decreases, resulting in incoherent continual evolution . As we see, the first phase of the spectrum is at the temperature of 7°C, where the density of bands increases, but simultaneously their spectral weight decreases, which results in incoherent continual changes. As we compared the calculations of sorella and parola @ xcite, in the case of the case of xmath15, xmath16, it is evident that the outermost holon band, derived from the spinon fermi momentum, develops into a cusp—like singularity of the spectral weight. The whole spectrum of electrons emitted by the energy of atoms, namely the internal atoms and the internal atoms, of which we derived the same mathematical formula. It can be demonstrated that the dispersion of the line xmath44 @ xmath16 @ xmath45 (i.e. the lower three momenta in fig. [fig.]) scales with xmath0 to a good approximation. A peculiar feature is the peak at xmath46, whose relative power is decreasing rather than increasing with xmath0 . a possible explanation is that the hole in a 2D system has two different paths for propagation, first, by string truncation, which gives effective hopping integrals @ xmath19 @ xmath2 , and secondly by spiral paths ... cite ... cite ... and it can be shown @ xcite that the dispersion is very small @ xmath19  xmath0  xmath4   (shown by ), which is a little more weak than in 1d. Besides, the right-hand panel of fig.4 shows the photoemission spectrum for this cluster at half-filled; thereby we again focus again on energies within a few math2 from the top of the band and measure the energies in units of math2 . They are not part of the spinon fermi surface that is seen in Figures 2 and 3 above. It is a fact that, in general, the spectra are more open' than in 1d, with sharp features only appearing at the top of the band (except for the relatively sharp high-energy peak of #xmath49). Next, among these diffuse features at higher energies, there are some whose energy is exactly proportional to #xmath0. the first difference is that this number does not seem to reach the top of the photoemission spectrum, but it remains a value of @xmath19 below the #xmath2 band, which forms the first ionization states. We think that the most plausible interpretation of the data is that the separation of spinon and holon is formed: assuming a strong attraction between these two excitations, which may be derived, for instance, from the well-known string-system for the hole motion in an antiferromagnet, it is reasonable to expect a band of bound states to be forming in the continuum of free spinons and holons . the band of bound states corresponds to the band of bound states . the band of bound states corresponds to the band of bound states. Doing so may not be stable for all momenta, and we think that the absence of an xmath2-collapse at xmath49 is an effect of the dispersion. The formation of a parallel state between spinon and holon, resulting in the collapse of a spin-bag like spin at xmath21 fermions, therefore, explains this in a natural way. In this picture, the 2d analogue of the holon is not a coherently propagating excitation, since it is bound to the much slower spinon by the linearly rising string potential. In this picture the dispersed character of the dynamical density correlation function in 2d is well explained, for in 2d it has almost exclusively diffuse high energy peaks, almost no low energy peaks. Here the amplitude of    in the optical conductivity is clearly discerned in the context of the dipole excitations of a bound spinon and holon pair xcite. In Figure 5 we have a spectral spectral diagram of the ring with    26 holes. For  26 holes in  26 sites the nominal fermi momentum is 4  4               . , the holon band appears to be a horizontal radial band, but the top of the parabola is missing. The holon band now seems to touch the level of fermi energy, and the energy of the holon band is a low radial band, which corresponds to the spinon band at xmath5 @ xmath5 @ xmath5 @ xmath5 , and the negligible weak radial band at xmath5 reaches xmath5 @ xmath5 . . . . this picture of the spectral structure agrees very well with the calculated calculations made recently in the limit xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 by penc et al. , , this calculation showed a high intensity band, which is very similar to the dispersion of the holon band , which is a result of the skepticism at xmath4 and xmath5 , the skepticism at xmath5 reaches xmath5 @ xmath5 . , in addition, a zero intensity band, at xmath3 , corresponds to the spinon band in xmath3 , this is the lowest band at xmath3 , at xmath3 , which is equivalent to the spinon band in the xmath2 limit - One of the points we examine is the fermi momentum of the hole centered at xmath59, for which we have an arrow going to xmath59. For this arrow the first branch of the small sparks climbs to xmath3, and for the next branch to xmath59 the second branch ascends to xmath60. As we look at the rays from the doped case we follow the same building-up principle as for the half-filled case, only in this case we do not have the actual spinon or holon momenta available for constructing final states. For the doped case, the same spectral function follows the same building-up principle as for the half-filled case, with the only difference that there is no longer any available spinon or holon momenta for the construction of final states. This, of course, has negative implications for the numerical determination of the X-ray spectrum, which needs to be made to treat one type of etiocrine excitation as a boson. For a more quantitative description of the fermi points, we note that the fermi momentum for the concentration of holes @ xmath58 is at xmath59. For this momentum, the first branch of low energy excitations reaches xmath3; for small fields @ xmath60, the second branch of low energy excitations will be closer to xmath3 at xmath60. the two masses in the area of @ xmath57 would be considered as enclosing a hole in which a holon would be found and reflected by the holon surface. ‘But what’s more, in contrast to fig. ‘F’, we have an illustration of the emission of electrons from the X-shaped site cluster, which has two holes. As you can see, the density of the holes in a small 2d cluster corresponds almost exclusively to an open-shell lithology, in which the ground states of non-interacting particles are highly degenerate. In a full-blown, open-shell case multiplet effects are bound to occur, so that in general it is not known to be exactly the same momenta that are occupied and which are not (which is also true for a liquid, but it is also probably true for other “active” particles). However, we are not exactly clear on the subject, for the peak at xmath69 is so close to the peak at xmath68 that it is impossible to distinguish between its energy difference and xmath0. In this case, the topmost peaks at xmath70 and xmath68 are quite invariably indeterminate, which means that we can not judge whether their energy difference scales with xmath2 or xmath0 , which will be explained in due course. To start with, we will see the left-hand panel, which is numbered in units of xmath2 . Compared to fig.5 , there are many similarities: the excitation energies of the topmost peaks at xmath46 and xmath68 are indifferent to xmath0 (though the spectra of @xmath25 and @xmath13 and @xmath26 show some deviation) so that we can create a ‘formal band’ of states with , and the system, as a whole, can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their different energy scales, and he goes on to the -By xmath2 as a unit of energy, we see the familiar situation: the topmost peaks for the states of xmath77 and xmath78 are aligned (though the top of xmath25, xmath13, xmath26 also deviates a little), and several other peaks have a systematic progression of xmath0 (and an unexpected exception is xmath46, where a well defined peak is not seen) . moreover, despite the fact that the energy of the band is at xmath0, the dispersion of the 'shadow band' is much weaker than in 1d , in other words, the effective mass of this band is @ xmath19, -70, but with a very large prefactor . . . after we have taken xmath2 as our unit of energy, we see the above familiar situation: the highest peak of the states at xmath77 and xmath78 are aligned (although xmath25 @ xmath13 @ xmath26 again deviates slightly), several other peak shows a systematic progression with xmath0 (there is an exception at xmath46, where there is no well-defined peak), “In the same way, we note that the spectra of the @xmath46 site cluster actually differ from the one in the @xmath66 site cluster, i.e., the highest peaks in the antiferromagnetic zone have an xmath2 energy scale as compared to xmath0 energy scale (also the case with the xmath44 site cluster) . In addition, it is notable that the spectrum of the @xmath0 band is restricted to the outer part of the brillouin zone. As a result, it is possible to say that these extraordinary characteristics are a consequence of, e.g., the multiplet effects discussed above . . . as if this were xmath81 in the gutzwiller picture . . . it is tempting to imagine that the @xmath0 band in the @xmath66 and @xmath38 sites is not actually @xmath80 as one might expect in the gutzwiller picture . . . for the record, the @xmath46 band in the @xmath66 site is of much less significance than the @xmath80 band in the gutzwiller picture . . . . in the case of the @xmath66 site the score band, which has only @xmath0 as its energy scale, has a much lower dispersion than in the 1d. ) summary the data of 2d, doping leads to a behavior more like that of half-filled traps, where the shadow band disperses in the inner part of the barley zone and the shadow band disperses in the outer part of the trap, as well as the fact that the shadow band is almost the same as in the undoped trap. We observe, however, that the fact that the shadow band has the number xmath0 as the energy scale has profound implications for its explanation. There have been some attempts to interpret the shadow band as a dynamical replication' of the main band, produced by the scattering of quasiparticles in the standard tight-binding band, which caused the heavy antiferromagnetic spins to oscillate. Thus we believe that the shadow band is a separate branch of excitations, probably best comparable to the states of the xmath5 singularity. On the theoretical side, we think that our data strongly reject this interpretation: both the main band and the spin correlation function xcite have @xmath2 as their relevant energy scales, and it is very hard to see how the energy scale of the shadow band emerges from a combination of these two excitations. He thinks that the strong attraction between spin and charge excitations lies in the high resonance velocities, and in the high resonance velocities. In the brillouin zone there are only states that have xmath20  xmath2  xmath0    in the outer half of the brillouin zone , there are only states that have xmath20  xmath2    xmath5   xmath5   inside the non-interacting fermi surface there are a whole series of bands which are dispersed to xmath3  , the highest of these bands denotes the spinon dispersion and has xmath2                in the non-interacting fermi surface there is a whole continuum of bands which ascends up to xmath3  the highest of these bands traces the spinon dispersion and has xmath2                   ,  in the thermodynamic limit these bands turn into cusps and merge at  3 . I am not sure about that. But if you are going to compare the results of the study with aebi et al.’s experiments, you may think it more likely that one should cite the results of the Aebi et al. ’s calculations. Essentially, the numerical data for the optical spectrum of a photovoltaic light show some resemblance to the first. One can distinguish, for example, that there is a high-energy  main band with a  energy level of math2 dispersed in the inner part of the brillouin, and a low-energy  shadow band with a  energy level of math0 dispersed in the outer part of the brillouin zone (see figure [fig]). However, the dispersion of the shadow band is much weaker, that is, while the energy level of math2 is math0, a very small factor of the order of the concentration of the hole (one can only compare this with the results of aebi et al. . . the authors found that in addition to the bright part of the band structure, which seemed to be consistent with the non-interacting one, there was also a low intensity  replica, shifted about by math49, which had been consistently ignored in all the previous studies. In a word, the two oscillations that form the two classes, the zero and the zero, in the figure, are perfectly separated from each other in the image of xmath82. Using the form of xmath88, we could reproduce the configuration of xmath88 in the hamiltonian form of xmath87, where xmath88 is the dispersion of the main band, xmath89, and the operators xmath90 and xmath91 relate to the main and shadow bands, respectively. Furthermore, the above hordes of excitations in Xmath82 are mingled with the upper and lower bands, and, however, as was mentioned above, the two bands interfered at some points in the brillouin zone, so that a small mixing of the two bands, which may have originated from the spinon-holon interaction, produces a dramatic effect on the topology of the low-energy spectrum. Thus we have fixed the chemical potential by requiring that the two forms of excitations should be treated as distinct. Thus, to distinguish between the two forms of excitations, we could subsume a form of the form @xmath93, which is an example of the fermi surface topology observed by aebi et al., and that the main and shadow bands intersect at certain points in the brillouin zone (see the left panel of fig. [fig. 9] ). But as we have already noted, the two bands of excitations intersect at some points of the brillouin zone, so that a little mixing between the two bands, which in turn may be the result of the However, in some cases, at some temperatures, the dispersion of this fluid diminishes and dissolves, and at others, it may result in a misty transition to a large flint surface. This phenomenology, which occurs in so-called brittle superconductor cavities, could fortunately be made in a manner that reproduces a pseudogap phenomenology, for example, in the form of the pseudogaps of cuprate superconductors. . . . . . . . e. la rosa et al. . . . , preprint. . . . . . . . . . . . . . b. . . . , 476 (1996) . . . . . . marshall et al. , phys. . . . . c. . . . . . . . . . . . , tr. ogata and h. shiba, phys. b . . . . . . . j. r. schrieffer, x. g. wen, and s. c . zhang, phys . b. 50 *, 3350 (1996) . . . r. eder, y. ohta, and t. shimozato, phys . b. 50 *, 3350 (1996) . . . j. r. schrieffer, x. g. wen, and s. c. zhang, phys . b. 37 *, 1597 (1996) . . . . . .
