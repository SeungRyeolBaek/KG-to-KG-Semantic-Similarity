For instance, the euv dimming started behind the limb, so that the euv dimming was obscured, or the euv dimming started at the level of the corona, where there was little euv in the gravity layer, and so the euv dimming began in the lower corona, which is very low because of the gravitational layer. However, there is a case with an average euv dimming that leaves no footprints in euv (robbrecht et al.). An empirical study on the simultaneous detection of euv and euv dimming has recently been performed by bewsher et al. a statistical study on the simultaneous detection of euv and euv dimming has been performed by bewsher et al. a study on soho / cds and lasco data confirms a 55 % correlation between euv and euv dimming. Alternatively, the euv-euv association rate will reach 100 % when the stereo spacecraft are able to merge into the "xmath" and cover all equatorial latitudes of the sun. At this point, we present a four-dimensional (f = 3d + t) model of the kinetics of a coronal dome, based on the 3d phase of the dome, and on the 4d eigennum. The three-dimensionality of the dome and the interior is characterized by a strong growth of a magnetically unstable corona, from the lower corona to the heliosphere. Many studies indicate that a corona is rapid in expansion, a volume with which the corona is unstable and expands from the lower corona to the heliosphere. The dynamics of a corona often is characterized by a rapid expansion of a magnetically unstable corona that expands from the lower corona upwards into the heliosphere. For the sake of simplicity we start by taking the simplest example, for the spherical 3d geometry of the dome and the spherical 2d geometry of the dome; ( 2d) self-similar expansion in time; 3d density compression in the dome, and adiabatic volume expansion in the dome; 4d mass conservation for the sum of the dome and the external coronal volume; 5th , hydrostatic (gravitational stratification) or super-hydrostatic density. Here, we develop a four-dimensional (4d = 3d + t) model that presents the 3d evolution of the dome in time, xmath2 in terms of 4d electron density distributions, which allow us also to predict and forward-fit a corresponding euv intensity image cube for the observed wavelength. The spherical 3D geometry can be characterized by a single free parameter, the radius of the sphere. The assumption of adiabatic expansion involves no mass and energy exchange across the outer sphere, and consequently corresponds to the assumption of a low plasma @xmath4 parameter in the corona, with perfect magnetic confinement, while the spherical sphere and heliosphere will be leaking into the inner sphere, where the plasma @xmath4 parameter exceeds unity (which is not included in our model) . As a matter of fact, the self-similar expansion of the spherical sphere retains the spherical shape, so that the boundary of the spherical sphere can still be parameterized by a single time dependent radius @xmath6 . . . for the motion of the spherical centroid at height @xmath13, we assume a similar quadratic parameterization, @xmath15, where @xmath15 is the initial height @xmath11, @xmath16 is the initial velocity, @xmath17 is the acceleration of the vertical motion. We consider a perpendicularity in the horizontal distribution of the mass in the circular interior, and then define the radius of the longitudinal contour, in a rectangle of radius xmath19, which connects from the solar surface to the lowest part of the spherical bulge. The diameter xmath19 delimits the outer radius of the bulge, and we denote the inner radius of the bulge, or the radius of the bulge, with xmath18 and xmath26, which has an initial value of xmath27 . in order to ensure the magnetic yoke at the footpoints, the bulge must always be located above the cyclidrical base, which must satisfy xmath20, and the acceleration must be xmath21 . , if adiabatic expansion occurs in the bulge, the electron density in the confined plasma declines reciprocally with the expanding volume, so it drops with the third power as a function of time from the initial value xmath24 (of the average density in the bulge) . . . . we depict the model geometry in fig. 1 . And, since, we have to determine the density of the powder in the powder at this point, the total mass of the powder at the bottom of the powder corresponds to the total volume of the powder at the bottom of the powder at xmath36 minus the initial volume of the powder at xmath36 , math36     and   pi (r (t)  3   0  0                                 over 3   pi                 over 3                                    ,       over 3       pi   over 3            pi (r (t)  3    0 If you expand your plot, you can shrink the radius by the confinement of the dome. Thereby the cesspool, which would be covered with a sphere, would compress the core in the center, and the plasma, by adiabatic expansion, would become more saturated and form a cavity, yielding an average density ratio, of xmath52 inside the dome, as a result of the equation below. The numerical model of a spherical cavity has fourteen parameters: three positional parameters (the heliographic coordinates (@ xmath54) and height @ xmath55 of the initial centroid position), five kinematic parameters (starting time @ xmath11, velocities @ xmath56, accelerations @ xmath57) and 4 physical parameters (coronal base density @ xmath24, maximum density compression @ xmath47 in the cme front, the mean temperature @ xmath58 of the observed wavelength) and a vertical density scale height factor (or superhydrostatic factor) @ xmath59, that is, the ratio of the effective density height to the hydrostatic height at xmath58 , in the thickness of the column at xmath58, the temperature @ xmath58 defines the hydrostatic height @ xmath60 of the corona in the observed temperature range, and the height @ xmath61 is defined as the effective density height @ xmath61 . From the center position of the deacon — at xmath67 — [xmath67] we have, at xmath68, a symmetrical centre position, [xmath67] - y - y _0 _0 _0 _0 _0 (t) — 2 - z - z _0 _0 (t) —  2    ,   ,  ,   ,     ,     ,        ,      ,   ,   , , ,   , , ,  . and firstly, with a correction of this event, to the spherical euvus of a beam, is presented in the event of the 19th of March, 18th of March, 27-26, 20.-22 ut, when the wheel is taken to the east. This wind blows from the east limb of the solar disk and from the front of the solar disk with the wheel. In this case, the euvus emitted in white light - as usually observed a few solar radii from the sun, our model employs the lower corona, as observed in euvus. To the horizontal of the envelope, we will also show the circular fits of the tube. For the time series in question, 59 51 we will give the radii and y positions of the circular fits. The circular fits are almost constrained to the stereo / a images, so that the x-positions of the tube centroid of the tube are needed in the epipolar / b images. Here, the epipolar coordinates are then compared with the heliographic longitude, the latitude, the distance from the sun to the center, and we will solve this by the linear formula 59 , 59 from the sun center, and we shall be able to obtain the spherical (spherical) coordinates in the chronographs. Fig. 2 and 3 are plotted as baseline (we subtracted a pre-cme image at 18: 36 ut) to enhance the contrast of the Cme edge. , the cubic fits to the Cme edge of the refraction are added in fig. 2 and 3 , the circular fits to the Cme boundary are displayed in fig. 3 , a pre-cme image, which is given by the precme image at 18: 36 ut, in order to enhance the contrast of the Cme edge . . . . – We obtain a longitude of xmath86 (for spacecraft stereo / a) , a longitude of xmath87 (for spacecraft stereo / b) and a latitude of xmath88 (bottom). Thus, the mid-point of the midpoint is xmath91 behind the east limb of the earth. – To get a mean and a mean value of xmath86, we take the longitude of xmath86 (for spacecraft stereo / a) and a latitude of xmath88 (bottom). Therefore, the midpoint of the midpoint is precisely Xmath91 behind the east limb. This interpretation is based on the fact that the euv dimming is visible on the surface of post-curves, as per stereo / b. – To the heliographic point. supposing the height of the convex region is initially of negligible magnitude, i.e., at a maximum height of about 96 m, and the accelerations of 97 km s @ 98 for the expansion of the convex region, and 99 km s @ 98 for the motion of the convex region , we derived an accuracy of 913 out of the 14 free parameters of our model cosmos. , so we calculated an accuracy of 903 for the acceleration of the convex zone, based on the uncertainty of the beginning of the convex region . Observed in fig. 6 the distribution of euv ev brightness from the cone to the surface of the cone in the horizontal direction (convex) and in the vertical direction for the euvi / a 171 observation. Such is the progression of the cone towards the rim of the cone which corresponds to the compression zone at the rim of the cone . . . . in the euvi euv euv euv region, it is found that the acceleration was at first high and then fell rapidly as the magnetic forces decreasing at great altitudes. Here we conclude that the acceleration, measured here, is precisely at the origin of the cone at low coronal heights, which are typically tens of ms s s @ xmath104, in the range of 5 - 22 solar radii. and soho euv 1 also reported some slight encroachment at the top of the cone at 25 radii. in fig. 5 we show The zone's thermal mass has to be represented by the peak temperature of the instrumental euvi response function, which is @xmath108 mk. This is to say, the temperature of the region to be considered is a notch greater than a notch greater than a notch. As the line of sight between the two pixel surfaces is divided by the number of times Xmath111 , Xmath115, where the intensity of Xmath116 in the image, in units of dn s @ xmath104 , is now directly calculated by multiplying with the instrumental response function @xmath117 of the 171 filter, Xmath119 dn s @ xmath104 dn s @ xmath104 mk , and the fwhm of the 171 filter is @ xmath121 mk , . . . . in fig. 6 we present best-fit solutions for horizontal and vertical brightness profiles. The total evaporation in each pixel position Xmath110 is computed by line-of-sight integration along the xmath111 axis in our 3d density cube, Xmath113 per pixel area Xmath113, xmath115, Xmath113 from which the intensity xmath116 in the model image in units of dns @ xmath104 @ xmath104 @ xmath120 mk @ xmath121 and the fwhm of the 171 filter is Xmath123 mk .

In addition, there is a more bright beam at the eastern limb which cannot be reproduced by the model. in a certain way our model can, in principle, estimate the mass of the sphere by integrating the density @ xmath2 for the whole sphere, which is of course increasing in the course of time, but expected to reach its maximum value when the sphere is completely populated. In addition, we can see more distant differences from the spherically symmetric model of the euv , which can be seen in euvi , but not in euvi . , however, the model is less in agreement with the observations from euvi / b. Our model is able to project the true 3d motion and expansion of the crystal in a stereoscopic way and results in an acceleration of @ xmath144 ms @ xmath 143 g, which makes it within the range of earlier measurements of the crystal mass in the atmosphere. The maximal mass derived from 171 is only about a third of the crystal mass (aschwanden et al. 2009b) , which is a fraction of the crystal mass (aschwanden et al. 2009b), and so the more realistic estimation of the crystal mass is about six points higher than our lower limit, i.e., a factor of six higher than our lower limit, i.e., xmath141 g from stereo / euv observations (colaninno and vourlidas 2009b), which is in the vicinity of the former experiments of the submerged cme, which have been carried out for a half hour after the launch of the helios. Here the modeling of the helios is performed by stereoscopic measurements and reveals an acceleration of @xmath144 ms @xmath124 dyke to xmath98 dyke per minute for the vertical centroid motion and radial expansion of the helios. "Tellov et al. (2008). " Xmath149 kms s." Xmath104 . . . Patsourakos et al. 2009) , and therefore the euv angular velocity seems closely related to the propagation kinematics of eit waves. In this study, the spherical shell geometry reproduces well the euvi and b measurements, but it shows significant inhomogeneities in the euvi angular angular structure, which may require a hybrid model of convexity and flux rope geometry. The full 4d model of the initial compression is also constraint by our model, but it requires a completely homogeneous shell. The derived base density, scale height, and foot-point area constrain the mass, but accurate estimates require more complete temperature coverage with other euv filters (e.g., see aschwanden et al. 2009b) . and thus the decreasing velocity seems to be closely related to the propagation kinematics of eit waves. The main conclusion of this modeling study is that euv dimming can be understood quantitatively and that it is possible to directly measure the loss of coronal mass by a cme. A full 4d modeling of the initial euv femur may also be useful for the comparison of the physical parameters and the kinematics of cmes . . .
