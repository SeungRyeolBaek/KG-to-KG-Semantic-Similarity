What is known is that the ism is turbulent on a scale of 2400 to 1000, which is an ultrasonic vortex. The temperature of the magnetic field affects almost all its properties. It is known, for instance, that the ism is supersonic, on a scale from austerity to kpc (see armstrong et al 1995, elmegreen & scalo 2004) and, in addition, that it has an embedded magnetic field, which influences almost all its properties. The problem of qualitative measures of turbulence, especially of turbulence spectrum, is not a trivial one (see lazarian 1999, ref. 7) . The mathematical descriptors for turbulence, in particular the turbulence spectrum, have recently been made more important also because of advances in the theory of mhd turbulence. This is the mathematical descriptor, the turbulence spectrum, which is most often used by scientists in the sphere of ism., as we know, the astrophysical fluids are magnetized, and it is assumed that the relationship between astrophysical turbulence and mhd models of the phenomenon is almost universal. As we know, astrophysical fluids are magnetized, which makes it possible to believe that there must be a connection between astrophysical turbulence and mhd models of the phenomenon (see Vazquez - semade) . Note that in this paper we use the term xmath4 to signify averaging. The quantitative measures of turbulence, especially the turbulence spectrum, are now more important due to advances in the Then we can observe the nub of the equator in the predicate octane or the dash of the equator in the midpoint. Indeed, very high astrophysical 0 and its magnetic counterpart - magnetic Reynolds 0 can be as high as 0 , are a great problem for numerical simulations that can never get near the astrophysically motivated numbers. even in the case of very simple oceanic (essentially incompressible) turbulence, studies of spectra allowed to identify meaningful energy-bearing scales. In other words, the spectra obtained from observation provide integrals of either emissivity or opacity at each velocity along the line of sight. observations can contain at xmath5 and xmath8. both scale as the size of the box to the first power, and the computational effort increases with the fourth power, and so the brute force approach cannot resolve the arguments related to ism turbulence. Spectra obtained from observations are long established. While density fluctuations are easily obtained by interstellar scincillations and analyses of column density maps, the most desirable velocity spectra have been difficult to obtain reliably until very recently. The observational study of turbulence velocity spectra provides valuable insight into ism physics. The turbulence is associated with an angular change in the motions of the electromagnetic ring, and the interaction of different interstellar phases. . . . that is, a complete analysis of the spectra of the turbulent velocities and the observable spectra of the spectral intensity was obtained in Lazarian & Pogosyan (2000; and therefore lp l) . by aquiring the variations of the spectra of the spectra of the spectral intensity with the vca and the vcs, one can compare observational data with the turbulence . For instance, the above turbulence indices are very useful, for example, the velocity indices which are steeper than the kolmogorov value of xmath11 are likely to reflect the formation of shocks, while the lower ones, or with reduced aggregates, may reflect the suppression of cascading (see beresnyak and lazarian 2006 and ref. therein) . in vca and vcs, observational data can be compared with the turbulence axis , in which the vcs is taken into account , and in which the vcs is related to the turbulence axis, as a 'sense ' .. in the vcs, we can connect observations and simulations to the turbulence axis. in vcs, we can correlate both observations and simulations to turbulence - for example, turbulence indices are very useful , e.g., with velocity indexes higher than the kolmogorov value of xmath.2 The 'sense' indices reflect formation of shocks, while the The estimation of the absorption lines in the spectra of stars and the absorption of them in a spectra of water and gas is useful for showing the gross characteristics of gas kinematics in milky-like way. In our earlier publications (lp00, lp04, lp06) we concentrated on the absorption lines, particularly the radiance lines, e.g. hst, and co. , absorption lines are of a clearly defined advantage: they are used to test the turbulence of a pencil beam, they are less constrained by uncertainties in their path length . in a word, we can only look at absorption lines if there is a line available to it. We will describe the new method of turbulence in the following: in particular, we develop a theoretical explanation that can compare the fluctuations of the absorption line with the underlying velocity spectra in the saturated regime. Similarly, in our earlier publications (lp00, lp04, lp06) concentrated on emission lines, particularly radio emission lines, e.g. hst and co., absorption lines offer the researchers many advantages: for example, they allow to test turbulence with a pencil, suffer less from errors in the path length. The problem of this paper is to improve this situation. xmath12 ranging from 10 to xmath13. The intensity of the absorption line at frequency xmath15 is given as xmath16, where xmath17 is the optical depth. The optical depth is determined by the density of the absorbers in the ppv space, xmath30. The density in the ppv space is accounted for by the density of the atoms. We have studied this by means of structure function and power spectrum. In this connection we have taken into account the statistical properties of xmath30 in the context of emission lines, which we have given as the upper boundary of lp00, and this is the value of xmath30. The efficiency of the absorption line at frequency xmath15 is given as xmath15, where xmath15 is the optical depth. the integral width of the line is accounted for by the convolution of xmath25, or more precisely, by xmath27, by the profile of the lorenz form @xmath27, the inner integral is the slanted voigt profile @xmath28, so we have another representation of xmath29. we can clearly see from eq. (eq. tau-h) that the line is affected by both doppler shifts and atomic constants. he goes to the elbow, and there’s no need for any other arithmetic in this context. This is the new regime we’ll examine in the present paper. in this regime the data is available only over a window of frequencies limited to a maximum of a hundred and fifty Hz, and that window is also as high as a lorentz tail defines the line. Thus the data is available over a window of frequencies limited to a maximum of a few hundred meters, but not quite as high as that which would define the line with a lorentz tail. Thus the optical depth is not statistically homogeneous in the wings of the line. The statistical properties of the optical depth are not homogeneous in this frequency range, and the mean of these fluctuations must be accounted for. The first descriptors of the random field are, here, the ensemble average of the values of the field at isolated points, the two-point correlation function, and the reciprocal, the average square of the amplitudes of its (fourier) harmonics, which decomposition the power spectrum. In this case, the fluctuations of the optical depth in the wings of the line are superimposed on the wing-profile of the line. In this regard, the statistical properties of the optical depth are inhomogeneous in this frequency range, with the mean value being proportional to the frequency. It is necessary to account for the variations of the optical depth in the wings of a line. , but the sum of -3% is not as confined in the contiguous zone, and is sensitive to certain particular sampling-of-the-shade, discretization--which in turn leads to aliasing of power from one scale to another. The significance of this aliasing is considerable. It is important to note that in our present studies we deal with limited data in the field of the absorption lines, which makes direct measurements of the structure of functions impossible. For instance, the distribution of ppv density fluctuations along the surface of the turbulent field is at xmath56, where xmath57 is the index of the line-of-sight component of the velocity structure function, where xmath61 is the index of the line-of-sight component of the velocity structure function. Similarly, the determination of fourier harmonics is not local in configuration space, and is sensitive to specific factors sampling the finite window, the discretization of the data, which, therefore, produces an aliasing of power from one scale to another, which is bad for the imbalance of power. However, at each separation it combines all contributions of all scales, and even mixes the physical effects of different scales. Similarly, the structure function can be considered as regularized version of the correlation function, which is closely related to the power spectrum, if you exclude the @xmath55 mode. So we took a quadratic representation of Xmath67 and a power spectrum of Xmath66, and to express the normal average velocity and the corresponding vym-sima, of which the differential force for the absorption is Xmath66 and the respective variance of the absorption from the line of sight, which is in varying convexity. In our earlier work (see Lp. 82 and Lp. 76) we argued that in many cases they can be considered uncorrelated, and so that Xmath74    , labeled  eq: maxprof  average    ] , where Xmath75 is the correlation between the density of the absorbers and xmath76 is the structure function of their lateral velocity from a turbulent whirlwind. Xmath77 is assumed to saturate at xmath78 for separations of the size of the absorber, xmath78. Introducing Xmath82 and integrating over xmath83 one obtains Xmath84, which is useful to express in terms of angular terms, the average velocity, Xmath67 and the power spectrum, xmath66 w (k - v-k - v -        ) [366]  right  rangle, So to show the effect of the mask, let us assume that we choose the wing with a gaussian mask centered in the middle of the wing, at xmath92 . . . xmath92 . . . at xmath92, at xmath93, all integrals, then, can be performed, and thus the various fourier components are linked with each other.     sqrt  2  (d  + 2  delta  2 )   exp  left  [ frac  2 a  2 d  d  d  -  delta  2  right ]  mathrm  erfc   left   exp  left [ frac  2 a  2  d   d   d    d   d  - d  d  - + 2  delta  2    right ]    &   times  exp  left [ frac  2 a  2  d  d  d  - + 2  delta  2   ]    -   -   -       -   -     left The mean and median power varies little, math103 over all the scales defining power at xmath64; whereas the power spectrum at xmath106 is always kept up to xmath100. The vertical line shows the corresponding law of the power Law at xmath110 as expected under ideal conditions. The left panel shows the power aliasing effect due to the small width of the window. Indeed, the power Law at xmath99 is distorted, but still maintains the turbulence statistics for xmath100. - the power Spectrum is corrupted at xmath99, but it still retains information about turbulence statistics at xmath100. The underlying scaling of the turbulent velocity is kolmogorov, at xmath58. The underlying scaling of the turbulent velocity is kolmogorov, at xmath58. This last expression shows particularly clearly the effect of the window, which is naturally limited by xmath98 in the wing. The axis of the arrows is neglected. The underlying scaling of the turbulent velocity is kolmogorov, @ xmath58. The horizontal line indicates the power law of xmath110 expected in ideal circumstances. The underlying scaling of the turbulent velocities is kolmogorov , - xmath58 . the aforesaid gaussian mask, from the upper to the lower, reveals the underlying spectrum of the power law @xmath110 expected under ideal observations. The axis of the doppler-strength is neglected. The axis of the axes of the axes is kolmogorov, - xmath58. (See that the gaussian mask provides an ideal example of the aliasing of power because the fourier image falls quickly off. The effect of the turbulent motions, and not spatial inhomogeneity of the axes, is neglected. Thermal effects are particularly important for narrow wings, since the range of waves, due to the thermal movement and the mask, is restricted, - xmath115, and exists only for the smallest wings - xmath115. We observe that the gaussian mask is an ideal example of aliasing, since the fourier image falls off very quickly. This recipe is restricted by the assumption that the gas temperature is relatively constant for the absorbers of a given type. - We can note that the gaussian window is an ideal example, limiting the aliasing to the highest extent, since the fourier image of the window falls off very quickly - one of the worst cases is represented by the sharp top-hat mask, which, despite its fourier image, falls off only when the power is spread out from large scales into small scales - that is, for a very steep spectra, all scales may experience aliasing. lp06 will see if Xmath121 is a triangular distance. . . . if Ymath121 is the low-flow volume, it will be a sufficient volume, and with all its ancillary quantities the integers are defined to illustrate the spatial inhomogeneities of the absorbers. Having formulated Xmath121 and Xmath124 the concept of the density of light is developed, as in lp06 , in lp06 we have obtained Xmath122. . . . This function, by contrast with the ordinary correlation function, is only apparent after xmath129, i.e., for xmath129 the second order structure function has been defined. The first term of the expansion contains information about the underlying field, and the power law series of the boundary conditions represents the effect of the boundary conditions on the cloud. . . . .  h - p  gamma (- p)  left ( h - p  - p)  left ( h - p  gamma (-p)  left ( h - h - h - h - o)   g - h - h - o  hat v  4 + o  hat v - The Mean profile of ppv density is reflected in a curve drawn from the standard-model of lp06. . . . which pfsrtise in a straight line as in a straight line in a vector in a figure. Here, the least error that may occur is in the error of the solution of the instability due to noise. The basic order of a function, like structure, is affected by noise. In this case, xmath138, the correction of the structure function is that of the mean-field as a function of ppv density, at xmath139, whose correction of ppv density is smaller than that of xmath139, and its intensity is of the first order. However, complications arise when the density of the aggregates is “extremely large”, i.e. the corresponding structure function of fluctuation grows. At xmath139, the correction of the structure function by mean-field is as small as @ xmath140 and is of subordinate importance. Besides, if one uses a one-dimensional fourier transform, one cannot rely on ordinary structure functions, while the one-dimensional fourier transform employed by vcs corresponds to the power spectrum. However, we must also bear in mind the steepness of the spectrum on the v-axis and so we used an additional window function of the most narrow type to mitigate the effect, but it limits the range of turbulence that can be studied. Our approach to the high-order structure functions (see the subsection above) is also suitable for the practical application. in the first place, in analyzing the radiative transfer, we neglected the effect of stimulus, which is well satisfied for uv absorption lines (see spitzer 1979). In our approach, however, this assumption may be very questionable. Indeed, it is well known that the variations of temperature affect absorption lines. Here, however, the effect of the variations of density is limited. Thus, our formalism can be extended to include a more sophisticated radiative transfer and the spatial extent of the source. Here, we have to account for the differences in temperature and the normalization of the density, which we have already already quantified. first, the radiative transfer, we neglected the effects of stimulated emission. In the first place, we assumed that the radiation is coming from a point source, which is an excellent approximation for the absorption of light from a star or a quasar ., and we did not exclude the differences in temperature and the air, and in our first and second models, the effects of temperature are limited. So our higher order structure functions, in the second case, are advantageous in the practical examination. The principle of higher order structure functions, as we will see in the second example, are advantageous in the vca technique. We have previously discussed the application of vcs to the absorption of a star or a quasar . . . To study the turbulence, a modified vcs technique was proposed in lp06. and formulated the criterion for the fluctuation of intensity to correctly reflect the fluctuations of turbulent velocities. whereas in the lp06 paper, we tested the vcs technique in the presence of absorption and found the criterion for the fluctuation of intensity that could inevitably reflect the fluctuations in the turbulence . But in this paper, however, we used logarithms of intensities and showed that this allowed us to study turbulence in a way that is beyond the level at which fluctuations of intensity might be useful. and thus the spherical wing of the lines was capable of capturing information. it is, for example, necessary to have more complicated analyses, if the shutters of the lines are saturated, which makes the wings of the lines capable of capturing signals. For this purpose, it was necessary to apply a higher order function to these measurements if the measurements required higher order functions. as the lines were saturated in a saturated way, there was no light in them, and therefore no one could be analyzed statistically. But the advantage of this approach was that it might allow studies of velocity turbulence when the traditional vca and vcs failed. The analysis of the data may also be carried out by means of a set of models that do not specify the spectral index but also specify the density and the velocity of the turbulence, as it is described in chepurnov et al. (2006). Note that a set of models are needed for a more precise investigation of the turbulence and that the actual data may be analysed by taking the , but if only a single powerful absorption line is used, then an analogy of a two-piece radio interferometer is necessary. In the latter case, the spectra of the measured spectra are not a line of the power law, but they are at a fine resolution, so that, when it comes to the actual data, which is of a rather limited size, the range of spectra is small. We have seen, as a rule, in [10] that the introduction of windows proportional to the width of the line wings, leads to additional distortions of the power spectrum, and it may be possible to increase the amplitude of the range of a given measure by a factor of xmath64. In this approach, the comparison of the light - irradiation is not necessary, the contrast is higher, and there is the opportunity to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the resonant fields. In this method, in addition to the simple radio interferometer, the ratio of the two radio interferometers is the same. In lp06, the main object was to obtain asymptotics. In lp06, a special interest was laid upon the extraction of good asymptotics . . . But the final results of some of these studies showed that some of the methods may be confusing, if not error-free, if theoretical knowledge of the matter is achieved. For example, we mentioned in the introduction an example of the error-free application of velocity-complexity centroids to supersonic molecular clouds. Note that clumps and shells can be used to find a hierarchy of clumps and shells for synthetic data obtained with _incompressible_ simulations. Moreover, our research revealed that certain techniques may have confused, if not erroneous, output, unless theoretical understanding of what they are measuring is achieved. This is why, when we consider the results of our investigations, we consider them to be more cautious than they appear. We use different wavelets for the analysis of data in the literature, as different statistical techniques of turbulence (gill & henriksen 1990, stutzki et al. 1998, cambresy 1999, khalil et al. 2006) in addition to or instead of fourier transforms and correlation functions. For instance, in the introduction we mentioned in the introduction an example of an erroneous application of velocity centroids to supersonic particle cloud data. Although the convergence of the three forms of measures is quite inhomogeneous, we found that in the case when the correlation functions of centroids are increasing, a popular angle measure (at xmath38) of the inclination of the mach number was also failing (cp. esquivel et al. 2006 , esquivel et al. 2007 ) Since both velocity and density fluctuation is affected by ppv, it is not possible to compare the density with ppv. Moreover, it may also be due to the problem of locating the underlying relations empirically with the data. scf. - spectral correlation (Scf) - (see rosolowsky et al. 1999) is another way of studying turbulence. - The SCF technique (see the page on the scf of rosolowsky et al. ) is one more way of studying turbulence. - mathematically, scf contains a large number of square roots and normalizations, compared to vca, so that the vca's measures are not as meaningful as vca's. In fact, we figured out several physical reasons for studying turbulence. We further developed the scf technique in padoan et al. (2001) and had removed the fixed parameters from the original expression for the scf, making it more like vca in the observable analysis. Moreover, we argued that, in the case of centroids and not normalized centroids introduced by Lazarian et al. (2003), the difference between the measured density and the scf is not significant. This might be a reason for the fact that, in the case of centroids and not normalized centroids, introduced by lazarian et al. It seems that the analysis of turbulence with absorption lines can be achieved with vcs if, instead of intensity Xmath161 in the presence of light, one has adopted the logarithm of the absorbed intensity Xmath162 which corresponds to the optical depth Xmath163 which is equivalent to the optical depth Xmath163 in the hardness of the absorption line. However, this requires very large data sets, while for vcs a sampling of 5 or 10 is sufficient to achieve good statistics (chepurnov & lazarian 2006). Hence, if one is dealing with the absorption line, the optimization of the absorption line may be made with the vcs technique. As for the vcs, which we have mentioned earlier in the fourier series, it is unique, as it does not require spatial resolution . This is why, dealing with the absorption line, where good spatial coverage is an obstacle, we have employed the vcs. vcs, for example, is a statistical tool that deals with the fluctuations of the ppv along the velocity axis of the ppv. Among all the tools that use spectral data, including the vcs, it is unique, because it does not require spatial resolution. For vcs, as a function of the reflected intensity, it is usually well defined; so the formulation of the theory (also presented in this work and in our earlier papers on the fourier transforms) is simple; and, at the same time, analysis of the data with the reflected intensity is advantageous, especially in the case when one has to deal with window functions. the following eqns. , the “ptau gen” is, for example, a relative equation, a corresponding one, an equation of the lorentz transform. Here, in a lorentz transverse way, the absorption is confined by the lorentz wings of the line, and therefore there is no information on turbulence. For the power spectrum of the optical depth, the range of fractio is at xmath165, where xmath85 and xmath86, while at xmath69 and xmath166, as the mask is real, he writes, only, rewrite, over dk-v, d-v, prime, -t-- 0  d-k-v   prime  d-k-v d k v The theoretical and computational fluid dynamics, 19 , 127 cho , j . , lazarian, a . , pogosyan, d . , cho , j . , esquivel, a . , lazarian, a . , pogosyan, d . , esquivel, a . , esquivel, a . , lazarian, a . , pogosyan, d . , cho, j . , esquivel, a . , esquivel, a . , esquivel, a . , esquivel, a . , esquivel, a . ; d . ; e . ; ed. by j . franco, a . g . willis, ed., nds.  . stutzki, j. 2001 , astrophysics and space science supplement, 277 , 39 sunyaev, r. a., norman, m. l . , & bryan, g. l . 2003 , astronomy letters, 29 , 783 von hoerner, s. 1953 , apjs, 4 , 199 —
