The study of polluted white dwarfs (in the form of a suffix Z), which is described in detail, is a useful study of the fate of the planets. Although the stars have not yet been observed around white dwarfs, the evidence for the presence of planetary debris is available. In recent years, using the cosmic origins spectrograph of the Hubble space telescope, xcite - and based on the ultraviolet spectra of a sample of white dwarfs (19000 @ xmath0 k), xcite showed that the abundance diversity in the accreted material is similar to that observed in meteorites of the solar system, though the effect of selective radiation pressure on the accretion rate was neglected. a consequence of this effect was that at least 27 % of the white dwarfs which it includes - and also the sample of xcite - would be accreting, while in 29 % of these objects, usually the warmest in their sample, the effect of radiative levitation dominates the abundance pattern. This effect also led to a reduction in the estimated accretion of some objects with xmath1 k (e.g., wd0431 + 126) . This happened in a similar way with sdss j124231. , we gave details of the new observations in a separate section: we have new low and high density spectra, as well as archival photometric measurements that allow us to calculate a sse of x-rays. And a particular finding, but with a higher percentage of water, was recorded in the case of sdss j124231 . . . . . (Cursed as it may be, the measured amount of oxygen relative to the heavier elements is of a significant amount, in the case of a parent material, it is believed that the parent material is water-soluble. We present an in-depth analysis of the surface of a white dwarf, a form of sediment which has yet to be described in the revised catalogue of nltt 19868, a white dwarf unknown in the catalogue of nltt 19868 (nltt 19868), from the revised catalogue of nltt 19868 (nltt 19868 ) [Miscellaneous,17], from the revised catalogue of nltt 19868 [qasar], where we present the analysis of the surface of a white dwarf, a dark, polluted, desalinated, hemisphere, of a cool (6000 K) hydrogen-rich white dwarf, and for much longer (a few years) for the cool helium-rich white dwarf . “Miscellaneous,” he says, “then water is a common contaminant in the surface of the white dwarf.” ) at the la silla observatory on march 3 . , and then two peaks of 1800 s each revealed a cool daz fir-white dwarf with strong h and k lines. we followed up our initial observations with four peaks of echelle spectra, using the x-statograph attached to the ut3 at the paranal observatory, may 1 , 29 and june 1 . the slit-width was set at 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 . xmath, xmath11 , xmath12 , xmath13 , xmath14 ) from the aavso photometrical all-sky survey (pass) conducted by the aavso atlas in five filters (johnson avso) . first we measured the instrumental magnitudes of nltt 19868 and a shady (and brisk) star (ra j2000 = 08h 36 m 03 , dec j2000 = xmath101005525 ) with published photography (at xmath11, at xmath12, at xmath13, at xmath14, at xmath14) from the aavso photographic survey (Apass) conducted in five filters (johnson, 2013). xmath11, at xcite, at la silla observatory on march 3 , and at Xcite, at midday, at noon on March 29, on June 1 and 3, 2014. the slit width was . . . for nlt 19868 . . . note that the uncertainty of nlt 19868 and nlt 19868 is statistical and ignores any systematic effect. we gathered ir photometric measurements from the two-micron all-sky survey (two-mass; ? ? ? ? ) and a _m rnspec e syrst-t e w e irst-field explorer (W e rnstrass; ? ; _m rnstrass_ (eds), since the psf of the two-mass and e syr-ts are six- and six-six-semester ratios, respectively, the  m rnstrass measurements listed in table tbl e phot should combine nlt 19868 and the nearby object . the crowded star does not share the proper motion of nltt 19868 and therefore does not physical relate to each other. we examined the e gsm images, which show that the nearest star and e gsm is clearly visible from nltt 19868 . . . if the e gsm images were taken ( 2010) , the distance between the adjacent star and e gsm would have been five . 2 arcsec at p . a . = 108 @ e gsm2 when the e gsm images were taken ( 2010) . in this case a pattern of diffusions would be introduced that would lead to a delay in the determination of the abundance ratios, allowing an investigation of the physical conditions at the base of the convection zone. In that regard, the study of the cool dwarf nltt 19868 and similar objects is timely. The calcium abundance varies by several orders of magnitudes, which are matched by other studies (e.g., a [? ? ] ; a[ ] , [10] ; a[10] , a[10] ,[11] and[12] (fig. ) (above panel) shows the calcium abundance of all known cool dwarfs with temperatures below 7000 k. Only three of these dwarfs have temperatures below 7000 k: g174 - 14 (@ xmath31 k, @ xcite ), nlt 10480 - @ xcite - and g77 - 50 (@ xmath33 k, @ xcite ) . The average of the two measurements of @ xcite and @ xcite . On the Xcite spectra of white dwarfs, shown in xcite, it includes white dwarfs of the xmath 39 k to xmath 40 k. This temperature difference might have been due to the fact that in the hotter, more dispersed sample the dispersion was less than in the cooler, thus bringing down the dispersion in xcite . So, compared with the population of white dwarfs of the 60 deposited with xmath 39 k to xmath 40 k, the sample of xmath 41, the sample of xmath 39, the sample of xmath39 k, is a higher sample than in the cool Dz, a sample of xmath 41 and a sample of xmath 40 , the ratio of xmath 39 is a little lower than that of xcite 41, the ratio of fe / ca in xcite 41 is slightly lower than that of xcite 41 ( xmath 47 - - - xmath 48 - - xmath 48 = - 0 - ? 2 - , xmath 40 - nltt 43806 - xmath48 = - 0 - - 2 - ? ? 2 , ? ? - . But the diffusion timescales for the upper part of the convection zone are uncertain, for the whole region is assumed to be homogeneous. It is important to note that the study of the abundance of fe / ca in the extreme cases of nltt 888 and nltt 19868 is not unlike that of nltt 888; but for the case of nltt 19868 the fe / ca ratio is nearly the same: averaging the abundance of fe / ca in the extreme cases of nltt 888 (at xmath59) and nltt 19868 (at xmath58) shows that the abundance of accreted material is a little less than that of fe / ca in the bulk (at xmath6213) and of the mantle (at xmath621 )—providing that nltt 888 consists of 66 % of the core and 34 % of the mantle. The study of the fe / ca abundance ratio in the extreme cases of nltt 888 and nlt 19868 (at xmath59) and of applicable conditions confirms the approximate abundance in the abundance relative to the parent material. In both cases the steady-state accretion regime has not changed the observed ratio, but the relative abundance of the accreted material will not differ significantly from the parent material ratio. Therefore, the estimated ratio of fe / ca in nlt 888 largely exceeds that of bulk (@ xmath6213. 4) or mantle (@ xmat But this does not mean that the iron in the atmosphere is much lower than the composition of the parent material, i.e., much lower than the composition of the earth’s mantle. At the other hand, in the case of stars in the sample of Xcite, the relative abundance of iron is observed to be in the core, whereas, for the case of the mantle, the abundance of silicon is probably much lower. There is an accretion of a mantle-like material that has not been removed by a little. Thus, the accretion of a mantle-like material can still be assumed to be largely absent, and the absorption is most likely to be of a mantle-like material. For example, if the iron content of the atmosphere is low, then it follows that the material of the mother material is also low, i.e., below that of the earth's mantle. It should be noted that, in comparison with the material of stars in their sample, galex 1931 with the highest fe/ca ratio is only slightly lower than that of nltt888. , and this difference is due to the fact that the convection zone is deeper than the envelope models of xcite, where the convection would be greater. The longer time that it takes for the calculations of @xcite to calculate the initial iron content of fe / h @xmath70, with the shorter time that it takes for the calculations of @xcite, we can find the beginning of the calcination of fe / h at xmath70 using the following equation: - @xmath71 , where the elapsed time since the event is @xmath72 years and the diffusion time is @xmath73 years . In summary, we have discovered a new, polluted white dwarf showing strong, swollen, calcium lines, between swollen magnesium, aluminium, and iron, a determination of the calcination of the mineral to be much lower than the accretion of the sublimated white dwarf, with the strong and weak calcium lines - we have considered the data of a heavy element diffusion model to be the biggest of all the cool, polluted white dwarfs, with the lowest ratio of calcium to iron. And, using the shorter time required by the calculations of @xcite, we calculate the earliest iron abundance of fe / h @xmath70. According to our calculations, the accretion of the sublimated white dwarf was more than xmath68 years. If the convection zone was larger than the submerged zone, even calcium would have disappeared below the detection limit (@xmath81) after xmath80 years.
