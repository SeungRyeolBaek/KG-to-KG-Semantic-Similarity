- When one considers the centrality of a component, most critical components are conformal, entanglement entropy provides a powerful tool to detect and calculate the centrality of the underlying cft. However, although many theories have been written about measuring this centrality in the laboratory, it has never been attempted in the laboratory. The results obtained in the Xcite project show that the shannon and rnyi mutual information of the ground state of a component, expressed in a special local way, as in the case of the shannon and rnyi entanglement entropy, has the same logarithmic behavior as with the shannon and rnyi entanglement entropy. Generally speaking, the central charge of quantum spin chains has never been measured experimentally. Recently some new results regarding the shannon and rnyi mutual information have been introduced, which are based on the same principle as those of the shannon and rnyi entanglement entropy. One of the major problems in the possible analytical derivation is the presence of a discontinuity in the line at xmath15, and this discontinuity prevents the use of the replication method, which is usually the necessary step for the analysis of the shannon mutual information. In this paper, with the above-mentioned motivations in mind, we firstly calculated (with exact diagonalization) the generalized mutual information for several critical quantum spin chains. We considered models with xmath1 symmetries like the state-potts modes for xmath17 and xmath18, the z (4 ) ashkin-teller model, and the xmath1 parafermionic models with xmath19. Our calculations were based on numerical analysis, especially for systems with central charge less than one. Many of the results regarding the shannon and rnyi mutual information, except for harmonic chains, were based on numerical analysis, especially for systems whose central charge was not equal to one. The purpose of our calculations was twofold. First, this definition is more appropriate as a measure of shared information among parts of the system, since it has the expected properties. We first calculated the generalized mutual information for quantum critical harmonic chains (a discrete version of the klein-gordon field theory) and also for quantum spin chains with xmath4 symmetry, like xxz and spin—1 fateev—zamol. In this paper we shall call this new quantity generalized mutual information. With respect to special basis, generally those which are hamiltonian in orientation (see @ xcite), the definition ([renyi2]) for the renyi mutual information gives us a logarithmic behavior with the size of the subsystem, for arbitrary values of xmath5 .  xmath23, for xmath23, is the probability of finding the system in the particular configuration given by xmath25. xmath23 is the shannon entropy. This limits @ xmath25 to the shannon entropy @ xmath30 . a certain local basis has been given, Xmath21, where Xmath22 is the eigenvalues of some local operators, defining the lattice. However, as we have observed numerically, for several quantum chains (see xcite), it shows a discontinuity at xmath15, which forbids the use of large-scale-adjusted xmath5 analysis to find the most interesting case where xmath15 is, that is, the standard shannon mutual information. It is the first step in calculating the generalized mutual information of two important quantum spin chains with slightly different structures. In the first step we calculate the generalized mutual information of systems with discrete symmetries such as the klein-gordon field theory, the xxxx model and the fateev-zamolodchikov model, with different values of their anisotropy. in the second step we calculate the generalized mutual information of systems with complex symmetries, such as the klein-gordon field theory, the xxxz model, and the fateev-zamolodchikov model with different values of their anisotropy. This definition of the generalized mutual information is obtained from the natural extension of relative entropy to the rnyi case and measures the distance of the whole distribution from the product of two independent distributions. Our results will be numerically computed for a set of distinct quantum spin chains with slightly different structures. In the first place, we will calculate the generalized mutual information for systems with discrete symmetries, such as the first part of the xmath16, the state potts models with xmath17 and xmath18, the ashkin-teller model and the parafermionic xmath1-quantum spin chain with xcite values for xmath45 and xmath46. In the second part, we will calculate the generalized mutual information for systems with xmath4 symmetry, such as the klein-gordon field theory, the xz model, and the fateev-zamolodchikov model, with different values of anisotropy. q-state potts model and ashkin-teller model have a hamiltonian geometry and the hamiltonian structure as a result of @xcite.@xmath51, where @xmath49 and @xmath52 are the same matrices introduced in the model of @xmath63. . . . xmath56 = s i, s j , = 0 , 0 $ ] the model is critical and conformal, for @xmath65 with the central charge @xmath66. The model is critical and conformal invariant for @xmath65 with the central charge @ xmath68. . . . It is worth mentioning that in the model of q-state potts we have the model of ashkin and that in the model of ashkin the model is equivalent to the ashkin model. If we look at the flow of the coefficient of logarithm in the equation ( [Arenyi mi potts]) it is quite possible that the coefficient of the logarithm in the equation ( renyi mi potts] is not continuous at   15 and so any attempt to reproduce the simulation using this definition of  mutual information will be useless. It should be noted that in the equation           (future) numerical results it was claimed that for   15 the coefficient of    70 might not be exactly equal to the central charge . As (218) was explained in [27], it is quite probable that (34] is not a continuous function around (15) and therefore, any attempt to re-enforce this definition of  (25) rnyi mutual information will be in vain. The ashkin-teller model at the isotropic point (74) is equivalent to the (19)(19) ((27)). This makes the analysis difficult. (19) with this in mind, we computed the (19) for (17) and (50) potts chains, and the ashkin-teller model in the (61) and (50) basis. , title = fig.4 , tb_; 0592 4, * * .3 . . as we can see, our results do not exclude the existence of relevant terms in ([renyi mi potts]) in the larger values of xmath5. The coefficient of the logarithm @ xmath10 in ([renyi mi potts]) is a monotonically decreasing function of @ xmath5, and it follows the following formula in the @ xmath50 basis: @ xmath79, where @ xmath11 is the central charge, and @ xmath80 seems to be an independent universal function without regard to the model, as we can see in Fig. 4 . We see from these figures that for the subsystem size @ xmath76 we get the logarithmic behavior for the subsystem size @ xmath7, as we can see from Fig. 4 . as we can see, the results does not exclude the existence of relevant @ xmath7 terms in ([[]]] for large values of @ xmath5 . We see from the figure that for subsystem sizes @ xmath76 we get the logarithmic behavior given by ([[] renyi mi potts] as well as in the parameters of the interposed model ([11] with Xmath47 sites and ground state eigenfunctions in the ([12] xmath5 basis. But the coefficient of logarithm in the base of @xmath50 always remains zero, as in the base of @xmath61, whereas the coefficient of the coefficient of xmath51 is unique from the base of @xmath51. It may be said that in the continuum all the probabilities in the base of @xmath50 are positive, but in the base of @xmath61 some of them are zero. The numerical results indicate that the base of @xmath51 is a continuous function of the base of @xmath5 at an angle of xmath15. However, the technique in which it may be employed is still unclear. We find, however, that the basis of the Basis of the Basis of Xmath17 and the Basis of Xmath51 is an extremely small one. For the description of the Basis of Xmath85, see Fig. 3. and 4 for the Basis of Xmath17 and the Basis of Xmath61. This figure also shows that the ashkin-teller model has a higher error rate than the basis of Xmath50. The result is shown in Fig. 4, i.e., up to xmath83, that the coefficient of logarithm is always zero, as it always is in Xmath84, not in Xmath61, which, by its very nature, seems to be of an insignificant size. The described subsystems, as a result of this measurement, are given, as a whole, an estimated value of xmath10, which differs by a few percent. As an example, we consider the corresponding fittings, obtained from the data of fig. 1, and the ising quantum chain with xmath47 sites, and the eigenfunction in the xmath50 and xmath61 basis, respectively. [cv] [distribution] of the periodic xmath90 sites of the periodic xmath90 spin chains, as a function of xmath48 , [cv] , [cv] , cv [cv] of the periodic xmath90 sites, periodic xmath91, cv, cv, cv, cv, cv, cv, as shown in cv . The model is critical and conformal, with a central charge cv, cv , cv, cv, invariant with a central charge cv, cv, cv, cv . . . . in this subsection, we consider the generalized mutual information for some critical spin chains with discrete xmath symmetry and central charge larger than one . "What is the function of the logarithm of (Red 'Renyi Mi Potts) and the central charge of 'Renyi Mi Potts'? in figs. 7 and 8 we show the ratio of 'Renyi Mi Potts' with the central charge of 'Renyi Mi Potts' and 'Renyi Mi Potts' for the @xmath50 and @xmath61 basis, respectively. All the five properties we have just described in this subsection are equally applicable for the @xmath1 parafermionic models. The maximum spacings we used for the @xmath1 parafermionic models are @xmath97 and @xmath98, respectively, for xmath45 and 8 respectively. In Fig. 7 we show the ratio of @xmath86 of the logarithmic coefficient of equation (1  1) and the central charge @xmath11 of the @xmath1 parafermionic models with ground state , expressed in the @xmath51 basis. Probably, the fit of these curves is not perfect, especially for xmath100. htb. [fig. 6] The sizes of the models and the subsystems (sizes at xmath10) are shown in the following sections. In this section we consider the general mutual information of critical chains having a continuous xmath4 symmetry. Here, we examine a set of coupled harmonic oscillators, which are also deformable versions of the klein-gordon field theory, as well as the spin-1 / 2 xxxx, and the spin-1 fateev-zamolodchikov quantum chains. The last two models are interesting because, like the ashkin-teller model, they have an anisotropy that produces a critical line of continually changing critical exponents, but with a fixed central charge. The square root of this matrix, and its inverse, can be split into dimensions of the subsystems at xmath105 and xmath106, using the matrix [ harmonicosc] defined in [ harmonicosc]. xmath0 we first find xmath115 and xmath116, as xmath118 and xmath119 . we will then consider the integral version of the equation (renyi new) as follows: xmath121, xmath122. Note that the above quantity is an independent basis and is considered an ordinary measure of the converging interactions. To calculate the generalized mutual information for a system of coupled harmonic oscillators, one must first determine the basis. Here, we work on the spatial basis, but the results are also valid on the momentum basis. As a result of the canonical transformations from the spatial basis, we can easily compute the generalized mutual information of xmath121. eq. - ( renyi mi hoc ) makes sense only if xmath127 is a symmetric positive definite matrix. In principle eq. ( renyi mi hoc) makes sense only if xmath127 is a symmetric positive definite matrix. After calculating xmath121, we can write the following determinant formulas: xmath123 and xmath123, where xmath124 and xmath127 the following determinant formulas are available: xmath123 and xmath124 . , title = fig. ; height = 35 . . . we find that xmath143 is in the thermodynamic limit. . . . our numerical tests show that in short-range quantum harmonic oscillators the matrix xmath127 is symmetric positive definite, to xmath139, but not exactly equal to xmath139; on the other hand, when xmath137 is increased in size it approaches xmath140. . . . In this case, we conclude that for integer values xmath148 the coefficient of logarithm is xmath148, [htb] [fig11] in the equation renyi mi potts . . . [27] We can conclude that for integer values of xmath147 the coefficient of logarithm is xmath148 [36] [35] [8] in the equation renyi mi potts . The above result is in one dimension, and it is the result of the well-known entanglement entropy @ xcite , @ xcite , mc. The dots are the leading terms . . . . . _ [6] we can look to the von-Gerdon-theory for a non-complex version of the action (the compacted boson) . . . , as we have seen, the generalized mutual information is not defined beyond xmath83; in this case we expect the same behavior for xmath152. The model is critical and conformal for xmath154, with a constant central charge, xmath66, which gives us a good example of the universality of our results in the changing of the anisotropy. . . . note that our numerical results have some spurious calculations for the generalized mutual information, even for xmath158, but we expect that they will all go to infinity at the thermodynamic limit. We have also considered the results of the chain of harmonic oscillators. The coefficient of logarithm in _[2], in _[3]222, as you see in fig. 13, is also given by _(2]2, which fits perfectly to the results of the chain of oscillators. The long-range critical fluctuations are ruled by a cft with a constant central charge @ xmath66, and the action of a compacted boson (composited boson) is given by a compacted boson whose action is given by _ xmath155, where the compactification radius depends on the values of _____ and [3] , title = “fig. ”, 0 % ] , wd. – Fig. - 0 % ] we found a very similar pattern as in x z quantum chain, as shown in fig. - The second - x -symmetrical model we considered is the circle of critical points (@ xmath168) with a hamiltonian number of @ xcite, and @ xmath164 are a hamiltonian number of @ xcite, where @ xmath164 are a circle of @ xmath165, @ xmath166, @ xmath167, @ xmath168, @ xcite , on xmath164, xmath165, a matrix of @ xmath164, , , xmath165, @ xmath165, math168 , the second , , symmetric model of xmath168, math169, math168 , math169, it is in antiferromagnetic mode, math168, math168, math169, a cft with central charge, math172, cite, math66 cft, cite . . . You see, besides the general form of the operation, the effect of expressing the ground state wavefunctions on some special basis are indisputable. The principal result was the calculated universal sum of xmath4 in the sense of “Encyclopaedia”, which he described as ‘Zero—blue’ – as a concept of the dynamics of such quantum systems with continuous or discrete degrees of freedom. In this paper, we have calculated the general sum of xmath4 as defined in ”Zero-Supplement” [Lexis] (Lettah 238) (Supplement). In other words, we have considered the discrete version of the von Kröttenhoff–Gordon field theory, which is based on a set of harmonic oscillators. In addition, we have examined several integrable spin chains, one of which has a @xmath1symmetry (like the potts-and-porter models of the state potts with an @xmath17 and 4, ashkin-teller models and the @xmath45–8 parafermionic models of the @xmath45 and 8), or the @xmath4 geometry (the quantum chain and the fateev–zamolodchikov model) or both a separate @xmath4 geometry (a xxz quantum chain and the spin-1 fateev–zamolodchikov model) or both. We have thus to assume that in the case of the "modest" entropy the mutual information is of the same kind in the subsystem size @xmath7 as in the rnyi entropy, namely, the same corresponding function at xmath78 is universal (for any model and for any basis) in the case of @xmath0 we find that the function at xmath78 depends on the special basis chosen to express the ground state eigenfunction of the model , for example, for the basis of the ashkin model , our results indicate that the @xmath80 function, for @xmath158, also depends on the anisotropy of the model - on the other hand, for the continuum models - we have good evidence that the mutual information of the models is not defined , on the contrary, the models with continuum models have only a similar behaviour only for @xmath158 , on the other hand, the models with continuum symmetry showed the same behaviour only for @xmath158 - on the other hand, models with continuum symmetry showed only for xmath157 - on the other hand, the models with a continuum symmetry showed some similar behaviour only for @xmath157 - on the other hand, the equilibrium models only showed a similar behaviour for @xmath158 - . " we thank j. a. hoyos, r. pereira and v. pasquier for the helpful discussions. In this appendix, we review the definitions of relative entropy and their generalization, the rnyi divergence. The relative entropy is defined as the expectation of the difference between the logarithm of the two distributions of probability, xmath190 and xmath184, and from the point of view of xmath185, i.e. , xmath184, . in short, the relative entropy is just the relative entropy between the distributions of the whole system and the product of the distributions of the different parts. The relative entropy is defined as the expectation of the difference between the logarithm of the two distributions of probability, xmath190 and xmath184, from the point of view of the distributions of the two parts, i.e., xmath186, xmath184, the especial case, which is xmath26, gives the usual relative entropy. comparing (renyi divergence) with (convergence between relative entropy) and (convergence between relative entropy) and (convergence between relative entropy) and (convergence between relative entropy) and (convergence between relative entropy) with (convergence between relative entropy) and (convergence between relative entropy) with (convergence between relative entropy) and (convergence between relative entropy and relative entropy) . . cable, t. paterek, and v. vedral, rev. j . cardy, j . . phys . d . abanin, and e . demler, rev. phys . a 42 : 504005 (2009) j . cardy, phys . . . j . m stphan, j . stphan, phys . f . c . alcaraz, m . . rajabpour, phys . a b . j . m stphan, j . . . . . j . stphan, j . . . - , . . . a d . . . . abanin and e . demler, phys. . . . b . b . . . . , ----*-- ****- b - 89 - 127204 (2014) a . rahmani, g - w chern, phys b - 89 - p - 58 * - a . rahmani, g - w chern, phys b - 87 * , 054426 (2013) o . cohen, v rittenberg, t - sadhu, b - - f - a - p - - a - b - stphan, s - inglis, p - fendley, r - g melko, phys b - b - 89 * , 105* - f - b - b - p 10010 and j - m - stphan, p - fendley, r - g melko, phys b - 89 * , 155* (2014) - p10011 j - m stphan, s - inglis, p - fendley, r - g - melko, phys b - 87 *, 195126 (2013) - o rahmani, p - rittenberg, t - sadhu, - m . cramer, j . eisert, m . b. plenio, j . dreissig, phys. rev. a, 73 , 012309 (2006) h . casini and m . huerta, j . phys. a, * 42 , 504007 (2009) a . b. zamolodchikov and v . a. fateev, yad . fiz .
