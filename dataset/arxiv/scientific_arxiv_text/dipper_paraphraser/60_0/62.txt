Panu sun:r:r, cos tirado , brandt, lund , 1992, greiner, morgan, remillard , 1996; muno, morgan, remillard , 1999) . only the large, radiated, x-ray sources exhibit a wide temporal range, from milliseconds to years. Perhaps none of these are as exotic and diverse as the one observed by the microquasar microquasar microquasar rm 1915 + 105 (castro tirado, brandt, lund 1992, greiner, morgan, remillard, 1996, morgan, remillard, remillard, 1999, remillard, remillard and greiner, 1999; Muno, morgan & remillard 1999) . (may not be noted that the whole object, of the size of the object, is very far from the sagittarius arm, at a distance of 12 . 5 kpc. ( mirabel et al., 1996) . and it is suspected to be a binary object, because of its spectral and temporal similarity with the other, galactic x-ray source with superluminal jets, gro j1655 , which has a unitary mass in terms of the black hole system (baileyn et al., 1995) . The calcination-mapping of @xmath7 and @xmath8 was derived from the data, and the shakura-sunyaev viscosity was unexpectedly low (which may mean that the standard viscosity is not valid for this source) . these rather small values of @xmath7 have been calculated by these authors and can be used to distinguish between different models of the accretion flow in Gr. 1915 (see Appendix A) . however, it appears that the analysis of abramowicz et al. . . . and taam et al. (1997) contained an error in the heat and cooling equation for the disk which, when corrected, renders the model of accretion to have the same stability as a standard accretion disk, and therefore is not able to explain the observations of Gr. 1915 and 105 (see Appendix B). . . . abramowicz , chen et al. . . (1994) suggested a model for the low frequency quasi-period oscillations (qpo) seen in selected xray binaries, in which a corona over the standard accretion disk leads to an oscillatory phase. This model, with some modifications, could fairly account for at least part of the temporal variability of grs 1915 and 105 (taam et al., 1997). and, with the use of this new viscosity, we calculate the characteristic light curves. We conclude that this more elaborate model agrees with the grs 1915 and 105 observations in the following way: the characteristic cycle times and duty cycles are reasonable. Then we take a more elaborate model and (see a) present the results of our calculations. We show that this more elaborate model agrees with the spectra of the grs 1915 and 105 observations very well, perhaps indicating that we are finally developing a zeroth-order understanding of the geometry and the most important processes in this enigmatic source. We therefore propose a more elaborate model in the subsection “jet”, where the inner disk, according to the observations (e.g. mirabel & rodrigues 1994) gives the power to escape in the form of a non-perturbed jet. In the case of the structure shown in figure 1, the absorption periods are about 2400, 60, 1200 and 800 sec, respectively. In the cases of c and d there are also those periods where the accretion is not observed in x-rays, but which produce radio emission .. Figure 1 shows four typical x-ray light curves from grs 1915 obtained with the satellite (see, e.g., Morgan, Remillard, greiner 1997) . Then we have the inertial curve, Xmath12, which has an average thickness of ten thousand thousand. a speedy convection of the energy is not important. The inertial curve is generally defined as a multi-temperature disk, and afterwards a thermal component, a proportionate power law. . . . but in the global sense we shall examine in the global sense the relationships between the various disk configurations. In accretion disks around black holes, the time-related properties of the gas lie beyond the influence of time. This idea has not been introduced in the past; e.g. chen et al. 1997, taam et al. 1994, and there are also references in this section. . . . the viscosity spectrum, in general, is usually composed of a multi-temperature disk, afterwards of a thermal disk, and a power law component, with varying spectral degrees. The proportion of the amplitude and frequency of the qpos is, therefore, strongly correlated with the spectral content of grs 1915 + 105 (see frank et al. 1992) , even though this is hardly possible for this source (belloni et al. 1997b). As we have already seen, in the standard Shakura-Sunyaev formulation the stress tensor is proportional to the total pressure, and we now combine equations (eq1 ) and ss to exclude the variable h and thus obtain an expression for the -math12 -math13 curve for any particular viscosity. In figure ( fig. Scurve) we show several illustrative -math12 -math13 curves to help in the selection of -math12 -math13 . such a model is thermally and viscously unstable when the slope of the -math12 -math13 curve becomes negative (e.g., frank et al. 1992) , which might be useful in view of the instabilities observed in Grs. 1915 -105 . This oblique (see, for instance, belloni et al. 1997a, b, and taam et al. 1997) is motivated by the fact that, in some cases, the upper -math12 and the lower -math13 are of even longer duration than the lower -math13, which is probably the stable gas-poise branch. In fact, when the xmath12-xmath13 relation is produced in an s-curve, the unstable region of the disk oscillates between the two stable branches of the solution, which gives rise to high and low luminosities. For the sake of our study, we have not thought of adafs (diaf-dominated accretion flows) as well (see Section 2. Adafs) will be discussed in Chapter 3 (see Section 3). However, the s-curves presented by these models have only the upper stable branch for the logarithmic equation at logarithmic intervals (e.g., fig. 2 in chen taam 1993). This is not the case in the sense of output of luminosity, since most of the energy is absorbed in the interior, and the luminosity of the disk is absorbed at logarithmic intervals (see fig. 2 in chen taam 1993). in a word, if the logarithmic intervals are positioned on the logarithmic figure (i.e. fig. 3) then the higher branch of the logarithmic curve would appear similar to the corresponding steady branch of the solid curve in our figure, but positioned higher by a factor of about @ xmath32 (at a given @ xmath13) . the constant logarithmic rate of the inner disk must increase by a factor of several hundred and a thousand, in order to reach the stable advective regime . . . . and when the same, stable accretion rate is quite much greater than the low accretion rate, it is only very short to destroy the excess mass in the inner disk - that is, it would be impossible to preserve the mass conservation if the accretion rate persisted at the high accretion rate for very long. so we conclude that the tenuous disk will not adequately explain the behavior of grs 1915 + 105, at least if we look for some theory which can explain all the variations in this source. We describe the eulerary equations which we use to follow the temporal evolution of the disk, and they are applicable to any local viscosity law. - a b a partial r f r h -t m ,  -l  + j ,  label  eq5    end  aligned     , a b    -  ,    ,    vr    (the radial velocity  ,   ) is the radial energy flux carried by radial thermal diffusion,      , where    ,  ,     ,      ,  label  eq5     end         ,   , ,   ,   , , , ,  , , , , , , , , , , , ,  , , , , , , , , ,   , ,  , , , , , , , , , ,  , , I'll explain the process in a moment, but it will have to be done in detail. In this second, if our model produces light curves that are in good agreement with those of the energy structure of G[152] + 105, it would be necessary to extend our study to this part of the world, where, if necessary, a special study would be necessary to study the differences between the different spectral components. Then, we employ a simple, explicit, and fixed scheme for solving these equations, where we use a variable time step, where we choose the hour in accordance with the smallest thermal time scale of the disk (i.e., in its inner part) . For a given radius, for example, about xmath64, we say xmath65 and xmath65, where xmath65 and xmath66 are the temperature and the density of the shakura-sunyaev formulation at that radius for the given xmath67, xmath10 and xmath68, where xmath69 is the viscosity parameter for a gas dominated disk. Often we speak of the radial coordinate in dimensionless form, i.e., math58, where math59 is the radius of the Schwarzschild radius. , we have a thin layer of thickness. , we have a halo, a thick layer of thickness, and a wick, a thick layer of fat, a thin layer of color, a texture that is not painted and the material which is painted and is dry. The wick is empty and there is no gasket. The physical state of the gasket changes with the change in the physical state of the gasket, and it is difficult to see how it should not change . the book , that is, the book of Alexander and the eerily brothers, the "guest" is said to be zr '73, 'xmath' : 'xmath' - said, 'xmath -' the proportion of the difference in zr 's averaged magnetic field strength. ' a certain recent study has indicated that the prefix ' xmath' 'is a significator of the power law - it is a prefix 'm m m' - if xmath - is in fact not dependent on 'xmath' 78 , e.g. 'mm' - to explain the observed increase in the luminosity of the dwarf nova outbursts (cannizzo et al. 1995) ' '. ' It has the quality of being stable even when @xmath80 is below xmath 80, as indicated by the positive slope of this model for the track in the space between @xmath12 and @xmath13 (see the dotted curve in fig. [Fig. 3]) . but the only problem with this viscosity prescription (as we will call it lightman-eardley prescription) is that the pressure can’t exceed the gas pressure (because @xmath82) so that the sr84 argument is futile . . . . the conclusion of le74, sr84, and sc89 would be at best qualitative, for the heat and the magnetic fields were not yet able to be formally and quantitatively compared. Hence, the conclusion of le74, sr84, and sr84 should be regarded as qualitative, at best, since it is not yet possible to describe the turbulence and magnetic fields in a fluid filled with radiated radiation in quantitative and model-independent terms. In this paper, we adopt the view that it may still be possible to couple the radiation with the particles, and thereby to permit the radiation pressure to contribute to the viscosity, when xmath82 is not too great. In this sense, our viscosity law is proportional to the total pressure, for small and moderate values of xmath42, while for large values of xmath85, it is proportional to the gas pressure. We took the mass of xmath89, which is typical of the mass of galactic black holes in binary systems (see, e.g., Beck et al. 1996) , we took the average decay rate of xmath10, _iii _ the viscosity parameter, _xmath69, for the gas-dominated region, _iv _, _xmath87, the critical ratio _xmath82, and _v _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ v _ _ _ v _ _ _ v _ ] , the fraction of a luminous mass which is transported vertically by mechanisms other than radiated ferromagnetics. Besides, we also tested a few other values (from xmath90 to xmath94) and found that xmath94 reproduces most closely the Gs 1915 + 105 observations. – as shown in Fig. 2. (Second illustration of a fire-like throbbing occurs at the innermost region of the disk, when a few zones, at the smallest radius, make a transition to the higher stable region of the disk (the higher system). This process is termed the "intermediate warming" or "extension" – although it is not visible from Fig. 2. – whereas the evaporation occurs in the lower system and the high system, and the air is therefore disposed of more quickly, and the air is subsequently disposed of more quickly into the black hole. But the inner region is stabilized by a heating process. Having radiated outwards, the material in the inner system becomes warm, and the material within it shifts into the high state. Hence, although it is difficult to discern from Fig. 2. – fig. 3. – The viscosity of the high system is larger than in the low system, because the angular momentum of the gas which plunges into the black hole is transferred to the high state, where it produces a excess of angular momentum, and hence, by means of this effect, some matter does actually flow to higher levels of the higher system, as can be seen in the right-hand side of the figure (fig. 3. – fig. 3. – The higher level is reached by a process of heating. The heat wave propagates from the inner disk, and its momentum increases rapidly and is transferred into the innermost disk, where the material is continually plunged into the hole. , they have now become very thin and their mass inflow is severely depleted. The intensity wave dies away, the outermost regions are cleared of the excess mass and cool. At last a new cycle begins, the accumulation of the excess mass (because the local accretion rate is lower than the average) . . . and with the other parameters we tried many different values of xmath67, and found that xmath106 was the most appropriate, since it complied with the general energy transport fraction of xmath67 . . . . , the magnitude of the highest luminosity of xmath114 ergs and xmath115, is shown by a measurement of the minimum density of xmath114 , ergs and xmath115, and this measurement corresponds to the low density of the disk and cooling of the outermost region. . . . . . , but it seems clear to me that the initial luminosity of xmath114 ergs and xmath115 is proportional to the maximum luminosity of the eddington, and therefore the instability seems to be intensified. . . . In a similar way, the ratio of maximum to minimum luminosity through the cycle grows with the increase of xmath10. the degree of stability of the disk is not a function of the value of xmath120. For xmath119 0 . . 0 . . 0 is the most stable accretion rate, as given by dmo; and a small increase in xmath10 above xmath111 can lead to a substantial decrease in the cycle time. The equilibrium is based on the assumption that there is a critical excess mass in the inner disk, and that the instability is first triggered by this excess; therefore the cycle time decreases with the increasing xmath10 . Besides, in general, we can see that as the value of xmath10 increases, the duty cycle (i.e., the fraction of time that the source spends in the high state) increases, from about 5 % at xmath118 0 , to approximately 50 % at xmath118 0 , After this, there is a long-term lapse in the count rate, a halcyon, which is known as the hot halcyon. The differences with fig. 1a are chiefly due to the fact that the outburst in the data does not seem to completely clear away the excess mass, and more oscillations follow, with a gradually decreasing intensity, whereas in the simulations the hot halcyon persists until all the excess mass has been swallowed up by the black hole. This physical reason for the cycle time getting shorter with increasing xmath is that the excess mass builds up faster for higher accretion rates. Fig. 1b is similar to fig. 1a, in that in the data it seems that an outburst will not completely clear away the excess mass, and that more oscillations follow, gradually reducing their magnitude, while in the simulations the hotness persists until all the excess mass is swallowed up by the black hole. Next, the c in fig. 1 (fig. : data) is somewhat similar to fig. b in fig. (fig. : data) and the progression of time scales and average luminosity (i.e., count rate) from fig. b to fig. b is also somewhat similar to that of the simulations (fig. : data). If we assume the high or the low state to be stable, the local density of the disk is proportional to the density of the column density in the inner disk, as can be seen from figure (fig: data) . thus, the profile of the outburst in the simulations is such that the second derivative of the second derivative is always negative, and not positive, as shown in figure (fig: scurves). The simulations are also obvious that the disk is getting bigger and larger as it progresses, because it is accumulating more mass in the inner disk region than in the outer one, which is evident from the greater and greater inflow of the masses from larger radii. Thus, the outburst profile of the simulations is such that in an outburst the luminosity of the disk decreases only after the outer disk cools down and the mass is stopped, and the inner disk becomes smaller. This is very interesting from a theoretical point of view. . . . and in all of our simulations, it is seen that the amount of mass in the inner region grows as the external mass grows greater and greater from larger radii. So, the first derivative of the second derivative of the second derivative is always negative, not positive as in figure d. (Let us note that in a number of panels in figure d (fig: data) there is a unique aspect of the second derivative of the figure d. Therefore, in the simulations, the total number of excitations is always negative, and not positive, as in figure d. if the emitted electrons from the corona to the disk are, in general, of little value, but there is some great influence on the outburst (puno, morgan, remillard 1999) . Therefore, if the blackbody flux is, in fact, more than the blackbody component in the heat spectrum, then there is a contradiction with the observation of gs. 1915 + 105. As noted by Nayakshin and Dove (1998) and Nayakshin (1998), the integrated albedo of the reflected spectrum in a strongly ionized disk can be much higher than the standard 0 - 1 of the neutral reflector (i.e., g. g., g. g., g. g. ) of the neutral reflector ( neutral in the sense of high-z elements like oxygen and iron)) , it seems that the blackbody flux might exceed the thermal flux by the ratio xmath125 (see eqs. 15 in haardt & maraschi 1991 with their parameters xmath126 and xmath127) . It is interesting to note that the graph (fig. c) in Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – shows rapid chaotic oscillations as fast as xmath1 seconds at the end of the high state, whereas our simulations do not show such a response. Secondly, the vertical averaging procedure (i.e., a one-zone approximation) in the standard disk theory is not capable of a substantial underestimation of the horizontal radiation flux of the disk . . . one could put it that these rapid oscillations are attempts by the disk to revert back to the high state . . . it seems to us that this rapid oscillations are made by a failure of the disk to undergo a transition from the high to the low state. The inner part of the disk (that is, its innermost region) in fig. A reduction in the coefficient of friction of the inner disk (as shown in fig. (the variable alpha)) in this way would seem to be not a sufficient explanation for the rapid chaotic oscillations that the data reveal. This type of rapid oscillation is what is found in the thermally ionization disk - as follows. In fact, the value of the coefficient of friction, given the size of the inner disk, is a little smaller than that of the outer disk - this is due to the fact that when the inner disk begins to reach a high state, the large mass of the inner disk force the inner disk to remain in the high state and remain in the high state. Similarly, in the simulations, the inner disk does not decouple from the outer one at the beginning of the eruption, as it does in the sv229 data. In the resulting light curves, it is obvious that this same time scale exists. in a single process, the temperature, the kinetic coefficient of the sv229 coefficient, can be divided by the radial distance, and the deviation from the standard scale of the disturbances is insignificant, because the excess mass of the inner disk is small compared with the amount of the mass of the outer disk. although we will not present light curves, we should say that we have attempted to include the fraction @xmath67 in the equation of xmath85, because the transition from @xmath140 to @xmath141 results in a significant change in the physical state of the disk. The following considerations have guided us in selecting the additional component. although we can reproduce several general trends in the light curve of grs 1915 + 105, the rise and fall time scales are always shorter in the data than in the simulations. The fast rises and falls, perhaps, are perhaps the reason why the profile of an outburst in some of the light curves of grs 1915 + 105 (e.g., panel c of fig. [fig.]) is more equilateral than rounded. Although we cannot model the speed of the hot state outwards, the speed of the transition wave, which has been studied by e.g. meyer, meyer , menou, hameury & stehle, 1998, both studies prove that the movement of the transition wave is @ xmath143. The time horizon to traverse an unstable region of r is @ xmath144 . The fast rise and fall timescales of the transition wave are perhaps the reason why the profile of an outburst in some of the light curves of grs 1915 + 105 (e.g., panel (c) of fig. [Fig.] [Figure] [Figure] appears to be more like a wave of a wave rather than the rounded shape that the outburst has in the simulations (see fig.[Figure]] d) . But if some physical process could produce the simulated light curves at xmath146, so that the outburst of the disk - that is, above this value - does not occur - the profile would be much more logically consistent with the data. So let us suppose, if some process were to cut off the light curves, say, at xmath146, so that anything emitted by the disk beyond that value is not seen by the observer, then the profile of the outburst would be much more coherently. - with some physical operation we must remember that strong x-ray ejections occur in grs 1915 - 105 (e.g., mirabel and Rodriguez 1994). The fluxes of radio, emitted individually (e.g., gliozzi, bodo, ghisellini 1999) were found to be as high as X-mass - a factor of x-mass few - x-mass - -mass - 598 , the plasma ejections took place in the innermost part of the disk. Thus, if the mechanism for x-mass cut-off, if we 'taken' into account' the simulated light curve, we should recall that powerful plasma ejections are known in excess of 105 tc's in kt -515 1515 tc's (Mirabel and Rodriguez 1994) must, in order to be successful, there should be at least some X-mass is injected into the jet, which is as large as the most large x- We therefore assume that the jet power is not visible in x-rays, but only in the radio or other non-x-ray wave bands. The jet power is then estimated at x-ray155. - the albedo energy is then calculated at x-ray155, where x-ray power is then given by equation (fvert ), where x-math155 is the fraction of energy that passes from the disk to the jet. - This parameter (@x-math158) can be a constant, or it can be a function of the disk conditions, or it may be a function of some global variable, e.g., the total power of the disk. we must mention here that the mass carried away by the jet is small compared to that accreted in the black hole, and so we neglect the latter in the mass conservation (eq-eq-4). in our calculation, the jet power is attributed to the disk, the corona and the jet, and to the following equations: equation (fvert) (see below); where, as before, we will again assume that the coefficient of the disk power is = = = = = = , and the coefficient of the jet is equal to the fraction of the jet power, at x-math153. The point is thus: if the ultimate source of the jet power is the underlying accretion disk, then to generate a relativistic-based relativistic model of it, we will say, the equation of the aerosol, the corona, and the jet are divided into the following order: at x-math154 the aerosol is split into math154 “Contain” is to be compared with the accretion rate through the disk, that is equal to xmath167, where xmath168 is the radiative efficiency of the disk, and xmath152 is the total strength of the disk. We therefore will accept a parameterization of xmath158 such that it is close to zero when the disk is in the low state, and a relatively large number (although still smaller than unity) when the disk is in the high state. This is quite conservative. But it is also necessary to take account of the angular momentum that the disk particles, when they are going through the disk, receive in the jet. Likewise, if the jet is dominated by magnetic fields or by electron-positron pairs, then the mass carried away in the jet is smaller. Moreover, this analysis is especially appropriate for the effects of jet particles going through the disk. But the air of the jet may not be the final driving force of the jet, the pressure of the jet may be non-existent . . . In our later work, we plan to explore these effects in more detail. we have to consider three different ways of expressing the fraction of xmath158 in terms of the fundamental function: xmath171 , xmath172 is the total power of the source in terms of its eddington luminosity. We can draw this equation qualitatively reasonable, since it is expected that the particles are ejected from the disk when the luminosity of xmath102 is nearer (and then exceeds) the eddington limit. and by the simple choice of xmath67 and xmath10 the proportions of the xmath35 are identical. The jets are ejected by the disks, and there is a local maximum, since most of the energy is ejected by the jets. [See sect. A.] In a second example, we experimented with the following correction for the jets: xmath173 (a correction that is, in contrast to eq. Fj1 is given), was chosen, in contrast to eq. (fj1 ), among several that we tested to reproduce the xmath173 and d of fig. (fig. d) in fig. (fig. d) . notice that the profile of the light beam in xrays is now inverted with respect to the actual disk power, namely, that the xray beam's rise and fall appear sharper than those of the model with xmath174, thus allowing us to reproduce the characteristic angularity of the light beam (see fig. d) . . . Note that the total luminosity of the system is as follows: (Fig. d) (fig. d) , (fig. d) And the latter is to be avoided from the unnecessary complications of the outer boundary of xmath185, which consists in a setup that consists in a gas-filled disk. The disk has a constant @ xmath180, and if @ xmath180 is large, it is the shape of the function @ xmath180 that is equal to the constant @ xmath180. The shape of the function @ xmath187 is almost completely irrelevant to the resulting light curves, as long as @ xmath186 is large, as most of the disk power is absorbed in the inner disk. it is worth comparing Figure (Fig. xandj) with Figure (Fig. lcurves), in which the plasma ejections and random fluctuations in @ xmath67 were not in the same way affected. At last, although the second term on the right-hand side of the equation (ft.) seems to be complicated and model dependent, it is not necessary, and only serves to make the curves seem more random. finally, although the second term on the right-hand side of the equation (ft.) seems to be complicated and model dependent, it is not necessary and serves only to make the curves look somewhat more random. Figure (Fig. xandj) shows the resulting x-ray light curves for four different absorption rates. “If I can show you the sharp square wave and the inverted square wave in Fig. 1 with the same prescription for Fig. e.—(Fig. 1) . This is precisely the same process as the plasma injection, which allows our model to reproduce the data (Pieces [C] and Pp d] of Fig. 1); the only difference is that in Pp. d the fraction of energy released from the disk into the corona and the jet is much larger than in Pp. d. , the jet ejection is the same process as the radiation, i.e., the ejection of plasma, which is our accretion. In this case the fraction of power released from the disk into the corona and the jet must be calculated from the time averaged variable. In view of the relatively good agreement between our model and the observations of G. 1915 + 105 we think we have better grasped the important features of evaporation in that source. For the present analysis, we also plot the fraction of the plasma output in Fig. (fig.: Jet1); the corresponding figure in fig. b (fig. Xandj) However, in the low state the inner disk is quite dim (up to a factor of a few), compared with what should have been, for example, if the disk were stable . . . and therefore looks comparatively dim compared with the equilibrium luminosity. This means that the inner disk may be mostly unobservable and is therefore called  missing' . our results are qualitatively similar to the framework of instability discussed by belloni et al. in the heat of the simulations. The radius of the inner disk, as defined by belloni et al., is defined by the largest radius of the thermometer in our simulations. In the high-state, @xmath7 is defined as the radius of the innermost stable orbit, whereas in the low-state, it is approximately equal to the largest radius in the disk in which @xmath191 (i.e., @xmath191 for fig. [45] ) is equilibrated. In our simulations, the inner disk is never completely empty, although the difference between the inner surface density in the high- and in the low-state is a factor of a few to 10 (see fig. [45]). “We consider that the time-dependent flux of X-rays, as explained in Sect. 3.0, is unsuited to a macroscopic disk. So it may be possible to make the disk thin in the optical sense, and therefore radiate as a modified blackbody rather than as a pure one (Taam et al. 1999). This configuration of ours, although largely consistent with that described in belloni et al.’s study (1997), we think there is a good correlation between the length of the burst and the last time before it (Taam et al. 2003). For a Macroscopic disk, the optical element may become quite thin and radiate like a modified blackbody, rather than a pure blackbody. In other words, the amount of macroscopic air is the maximum flux for a given temperature, and the smaller the blackbody the greater the coefficient of excess fluorescence. This number of observations, as mentioned in the Appendix to the Geometry section, is unacceptable for this source because they would produce bursts—of the sort that would be impossible to calculate by data, at accretion rates smaller than the eddington rate. In other words, since we are discussing here, the number of macroscopic airs is relatively uniform in our model, and we can conceive that there is a correlation between these three quantities and those of the belloni et al. infra. But a critical reader may be wondering if the relatively large number of parameters that have been introduced in this work allows us to show the actual values of these parameters. We believe that the answer is “yes” because the physical constraints, which have been applied very sparingly here, may be quite restrictive in future studies. as we have shown in this paper, it is indeed possible to obtain a good general agreement between the theory and the observation, and to grasp particular features of the light curves in the context of fundamental physical processes. So, for example, we have shown only the total luminosity of the light curves, while the data also contain numerous observations of the spectral evolution in the starry-ball clock, belloni et al. 1997; muno et al. 1999. We also want to investigate the fact that other transient and persistent black holes do not exhibit instabilities similar to that of the starry-ball clock, at least not to the same degree. Moreover, it is necessary to see whether other transient and persistent black holes do not exhibit instabilities similar to those of the starry-ball clock, at least not to the same extent . Thus, putting together all these observational and theoretical constraints, together with the physics of the spiral, might be quite useful in further studies. From the result of muno et al. (1998), we see that qpos is present when the law of entropy dominates the spectrum, which usually happens in the low state. , it is not very accurate, in fact. It is possible that the ejections of plasma occur at the sharp dips in Fig. 1 (d) instead of at the longer dips (e.g., from xmath195 to xmath1960 sec in this figure) , in which case it is possible that the ejections of plasma occur in the two dips (d) in Fig. 1 (d) and the ejections of the two others (a-c) of Fig. 1 (d) are, therefore, at the lower rates of accretion than at the lower rates of accretion (because the excess light escapes into the jet) , the ejections of plasma in Fig. 1 (d) are not entirely good, and the physics are probably more complicated than the radiation pressure, which is still unknown to us, but it is certain that a s-curve is present in this source, and that this s-curve is very close to the viscosity of the system. , it is also possible that ejections are taking place during the sharp dips in Fig. 1 (d), rather than during the longer ones (e.g., from 195 to 203 sec. in this figure) , it is possible that the ejections of plasma occur during the sharp dips of Fig. 1 (d) rather than during the longer ones (e.g., from 195 to 205 sec.) . However, based on the results presented in this paper, we feel sure that there is an s-curve in this source and that this curve can be approximated by the viscos , r. taam, m. muno, e. morgan, e. vishniac, and d. kazanas for a great deal of information.
