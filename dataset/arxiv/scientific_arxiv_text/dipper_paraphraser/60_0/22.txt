We have selected six local group dwarf irregular galaxies, visible with the 0 m telescope of our institute at mt. . A small complete census of the variable stars in the vicinity of dwarf galaxies will enable us to make important contributions to the star formation history of these systems. The names and additional data from the literature compilation of mateo (1998) are shown in table 1 . The variable stars, which are well-known and whose axis is high, can provide better distances for the host galaxies, while the others will provide important constraints for the population analysis. In our project, the data will be especially suitable for studies of the contents of red long-period variables, and to investigate the decline of cepheids, as sandage et al. (85) . these observations were obtained during three observing campaigns at the 0 . 23 m telescope on calar alto, observing for three two-week periods. These observations are based on the data presented by Mateo (1996), for which we have also given the table. (and a LOT of images to do so). The LOTSAL COLUMN CORE is a method developed by alard and lupton (1998). To extract lightcurves from the reduced data, first all the pixels which were deviating significantly (at xmath10) from the reference image in the minimum number of epochs (at xmath11) were flagged, utilizing the complete per-pixel error propagation of our data reduction pipeline. Finally, using these coordinates as inputs, the values and errors were extracted and the lightcurve data compiled. The results of the visual calibration of the galaxies leo a and ugca 92 were obtained, and in the Leo a data set we found 26 variable stars, of which we have identified sixteen acquisitive long-term variables (typical average values @ xmath12, and @ xmath13 period = days) and eight more candidates for lpvs. and in addition, we were able to make two good candidates for the xmath0 cephei stars with periods of 6 . 4 and 1 . 69 days. The later one was described in the same way by Dolphin et al. ( 2002) as c2 - v58 with a period of 1 . 4 days. The latter was described earlier by dolphin et al. (2002) as c2 - v58 with a period of 1 . 4 days. We also present preliminary results from our survey of variable stars in a sample of irregular local group dwarf galaxies. The right hand panel of figure 2 shows the period-to-numeracy (p-) relation of the smc shifted to the distance determined by tolstoy et al. the short-period variables measured by dolphin agree with the measured p-value of the calculated distance, and we compared this result with the shorter-period variables described by dolphin et al. the measured p-values for the two cepheids from our survey (crosses) also confirm this relationship in the presence of long periods. in the latter case, the leo a dark-star, the best of all analysed cases, we already identified 26 candidates for variability, of which 16 were long-period variables and 2 = cephei stars. These results, however, were supported further by the search for the short-period variables with the Wiyn astroscope in 3 consecutive days in December 2000 (discussed by dolphin et al.). we are most grateful to drs i. drozdovsky, c. maraston, r. e. schulte-ladbeck et al. . . . we have found, moreover, that our cepheids support their analyses and the resulting distance estimates for leo a . this result is in good agreement with the trgb distance (tolstoy et al., schulte-ladbeck et al.) . sent> & riffeser a. 2002, 381 , 1095 gssl, c. a. & riffeser a. 2003, asp conf. 295 , 229 lomb n. l . 1976, 39 , 447 mateo m . l . 1998, 36 , 435 sandage, a. & carlson, g . 1982, 122 , 1464 schulte e. et al. 1998, 122 , 1464 scargle j . d .
