i is the moment of inertia of the neutron star, i is the speed of its rotation, i is the moment of its magnetic moment, i is the moment of its magnetic moment, i is the moment of its magnetic moment, i is the moment of its magnetic moment, i is the moment of its magnetic moment, i is the moment of its magnetic moment, i is the moment of its magnetic equator , i is the speed of light . It is the accepted fact that pulsars are halted by the magneto-dipole radiation of the rotating magnetic star. In many of our works ( malov & nikitina, 2011a, b, 2013) various methods for calculating the angle i is given and applied to various catalogs of pulsars ( keith , 2013a, b, 2013b) have been introduced and applied to some catalogs of pulsars ( keith , 2013a) and the catalogs of pulsars (see, for example, Manchester et al., 2005) contain i=i=i=i = i=i=i=i=i=i=i=i=i=i=i=i=i=v=v=v==i=v=2 where i=i=v=v=i=v=v=v=v ==xmath6 . To compute the angle of polarization at xmath0, a usual polarization measurement is performed in the pulse-length. From this calculation, we obtain from the dependence of xmath22 on p by the least squares method, to obtain xmath24 , we find xmath26 from the least squares method, that is, from xmath28 and from xmath28 the value of xmath25 is obtained from xmath26, from which we have obtained from the result of xmath26, that is, from the dependence of xmath22 on xmath22 by the least squares method, from which we obtain xmath28 , from the number of p and from a matrix, to obtain xmath27, xmath29 from xmath26, y  2 2 2 - y  2 2 2 2 - y  2 - b  2 - b  2  2 ( 1  c  2 ) - 0 - - from xmath28, y  2 y  2 + 2c - d - b - d - b - 2 (  -  ) - 0 . It is worth noting that the solution of the system (14) can be numerically obtained for any value of n. (fig. 1), for example, if xmath46 is given, then xmath47 can be obtained from the equation: ymath47 y  4 + 2c  left [c  2 (1 + 2 ) ) ) - left [1 d  2] - right - y  4 + 2c  left [c  2 ( 1 + 2 ) - right - y  3 - c  2 d  2 - right - y  2 + 2 c  2 - left - c  2 d  2 - d  2 - right - y  4 - c  2 ( 1 + 2 ) - 6 - 7 - right - c  2 ( 1 + 2 ) - right - c  2 ( 1 + c  2 ) - c  2 - left - c  2 - left - c  2 - left - c  2 - left - c  2 - left - c  2 - left - c  2 - 2 - 1 - left - c  2 - -            end        - The distribution of the angles @xmath0 from the table 1 (fig. 2) shows that the majority of pulsars have rather small inclinations of the magnetic moment. This explains partly the dominance of the small values of @xmath0 . * . . there is no measured derivative of @xmath54 for the pulsar j1713-3949, and this is excluded from the study. (c) we will add some additional assumptions and estimate the magnetic inductions at the surface of the neutron stars. We calculate the magnetic inductions at the surface of 375 pulsars . . . the distribution of the magnetic inductions can be described by the gaussian, with the maximal value of @xmath55 and the width in the logarithmic scale nearly 1. (c) xmath55 . we must note, however, that the angles calculated by the method *) , * are the lower limits of this parameter. We will also use this method to calculate the magnetic inductions at the surface of 375 pulsars. . . . There is no measured derivative of the power at xmath54 for the pulsar j1713-3949. This is excluded from consideration. . . . dagkesamanskaya i. m . pugachev v. d . , 1984, soviet astron. letters, 10 , 357 lyne a. g . , manchester r . n . , taylor j . h ., 1977, pulsars . . . , 1977 pulsars . . . freeman and company, San Francisco r . n. et al., 2004 j . 129, 1993 . . .
