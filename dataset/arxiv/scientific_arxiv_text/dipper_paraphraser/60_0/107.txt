“Did you hear?” he asked. “That’s why, in the course of the entire discussion, he stated the following:  “” “ ” (i.e., “”), “,  ,         f    [x ] f  [x ] [dx[17]][23]] where the normalization is given by a temperature independent constant; for the actual temperature, and the critical exponent, it is thus specified by the following table:      f       f   left [1-  frac   beta        bec     right ]        f     left [1 -  frac  beta       bec    right]       f    nonumber      cal c         f  left [1 -   frac  beta      bec    right]        f    left [1 The ratio of the @ xmath31 for different observables is universal at xcite. Our extended system is based on the high-temperature series expansions (htse), and so naturally it is based on the @ xmath24 scale. In the above equation, @ xmath5 is replaced by @ xmath32. the critical scaling is well established by field theory in the limit of temperatures very close to xmath33. in the AT Xmath24 hexagram, the exponent of @ xmath36 is uniquely chosen, so that the normalized @ xmath37 tends to the correct asymptotic limit of xmath33 . however, no general statement has been made which would indicate that either the AT xmath17 or the AT xmath24 hexagram is the optimal one for all (or any) observables when a much larger temperature range is taken into account. Besides, our extended hexagram includes, in addition to the high-temperature htse, the confluent and analytical exponents. The simplest thing is that the exponent . . . is universal in both hexagrams, as long as . . . in the at xmath17 hexagram, 'xmath', 'xmath32' is common in both, provided that . . . Let us assume that a temperature is given by xmath46, and that the htse of the same is xmath46, and that our extended htse is for xmath46 the most important ingredient of our extended htse is given by xmath46. In this way we have estimates of non-unique critical parameters, such as critical amplitudes, critical amplitudes, and critical amplitudes, from the high-precision numerical data. Moreover, we have applied the extended htse to a wide class of systems, which have the same intrinsic htse structure as simple ferromagnets. The extension of this methodology to a much larger class of systems, such as spin glasses, is in principle easy in principle. In the first place, we discuss our extended htse for the various thermodynamicobservables, and introduce a confluence of errors in our analysis of the numerical data. In the second place, we explain the general methods of analysis, describing confluence of errors in our scheme, and giving a conclusion and an overview of the related problems. The equations given above, with the minimum number of confluent and analytic correction terms, are an optimized expression we propose for the function xmath46, which is analytic in the range of xmath59 and singular in the range of xmath60. For instance, the equation xmath55 and xmath56 are combined in such a way that eq . (fc ) and eq . (rf ) coincides with eq . (high ) termwise as a function of xmath24. This second term represents the analytic (non-critical) correction term in the present scheme. The interest in analyzing our extended scaling scheme is @ xmath61 defined by @ xmath62 it is the ratio of measured values of observable @ xmath14 to the leading critical term, including the @ xmath36 prefactor but without the critical amplitude of @ xmath41. The value of @ xmath61 compared with @ xmath65 is then calculated as @ xmath63, the plot of @ xmath61 versus @ xmath65 near @ xmath66 thus becomes a straight line with intercepts @ xmath67 and slope @ xmath68, where the values of @ xmath0, @ xmath16 and @ xmath34 are assumed to be known (at xmath37 and @ xmath69 are given by htse analysis) For consistency we shall follow this oath and write the reduced susceptibility as xmath75, but in the text we shall systematically refer to the word reduced susceptibility . . . Note that xmath85 is located at xmath0, xmath86 near xmath33, and xmath87 is located at xmath88. The ratio of xmath82 to xmath81 ([ff] expression]) is reduced to xmath84, where xmath84 is eq . . ([ff] expression] for xmath8. Similarly, the small difference of xmath89 between ising and xy ferromagnets in the whole temperature range @xmath59 is surprisingly reproduced by our optimized expression,  ([f] expression], only with a confluent and two non-critical correction terms . The mean field calculation of the correlation length through the inverse-compensation theorem provides an example of the extended form of eq. ([da ] xi] (see the analysis of fisher and burford at xcite, particularly their temperature dependent -effective interaction range -[1]] parameter. xi fc - leading ) is reduced to xi 106, where xi 106 is the standard critical amplitude of eq. ([da  scaling]) for xi 107 . . . see also the analysis of fisher and burford in xcite, especially their temperature dependent - effective interaction range -[2] . It is noted that since the two critical amplitudes @ xmath121 and @ xmath136 are introduced in the standard way (as represented by eq. (standard c ) for @ xmath121), the factors @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 appear in the definition of @ xmath139 and in eq. (c cri  ) for @ xmath121, and in eq. (c cri  ) as @ xmath134 , if confluent correction terms are added, then we obtain the expression corresponding to eq. (c cri        ] for @ xmath131, where : . [1] where : mln [2] where mln x.[3] where t11 1    c          [4] where -c [6][7]][8] [9] , where  , o, or to mln , 32= -6], so that with mln131 we can write the leading critical term, which corresponds to eq. (fcc leading) , like @ xmath132, where mlnm 113] where mln[9], in which @ xmath142 is a the coefficients @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 are known from htse . if we have the computed curve for @ xmath125 and @ xmath153 independently measured, we can calculate all the parameters necessary to fix the functional form of @ xmath125, such as @ xmath154 and @ xmath139, which we assume to be @ xmath155, an optimized expression for @ xmath125, in the whole of @ xmath24. Moreover, although we will not deal with thermodynamics in this paper, and we shall not be analysing finite-size scaling (fss) data directly in the present paper, we note for a reference that the extended normalization of the fss expressions modifies the expressions. The often used fss expression derived from eq. (fss) is called @ xmath157, a universal cpu. The explicit cpu specification for @ xmath155 is: xmath155 xmath157 ,   __xmath159 , is the implicit assumption of @ xmath158. With xmath76 the fss form is written as @ xmath166,  Non-umber   &  tau  - gamma  tilde  tilde  mathcal f  chi   left [ left ( frac  l   beta     right),    1 / 2    right [[X-y]] ,   f  chi   left ( left ( frac  l      beta  1 / 2   right)    1 /  nu   tau  right] ,   f  chi   left [ left ( frac  l    beta   1   right)     tau  right ,  label  fss  chi   end  aligned  ] ,  fss  chi   left [ left ( frac  l  l    beta           ] [  ,    chi   left [ left ( frac  l    beta The value of critical temperatures, the critical exponents, and the critical amplitudes are well known. In addition, the simple scaling relation connects the observables at xmath75 and xmath96 to xmath177. (See Figure 1 above.) Besides, the corresponding ratios are of the same order, which we will discuss in detail in Section 3 (see Section 4). The plots at xmath66 correspond to the critical and confluent amplitudes, as described at the end of Section 4 (see Section 4). These ratios, defined in the present extended scale, are of the same order, and are always at an infinite temperature. In each case we will plot the ratios of xmath82 and xmath113, respectively of eqs. a recursive relation is derived, in that it can be employed in principle to obtain the exponent of xmath178 from a log-log plot of xmath75 against xmath96 near xmath179, without the explicit knowledge of xmath178. The ratios, which are arranged as a set, are not unintelligible at any infinite temperature. We will analyze the two ratios of the extended xmath87 and xmath119 in detail. This is where we applied the reversal mc method, in combination with the 64-bit coding method for equilibration. The 64 different temperatures simulated are distributed in the range of xmath190. For the simple cubic ising example of xmath146, we use the high precision mc data at xmath0 by Kim and et al., and the heat-wave estimates at fairly high temperatures by butera and comi. Our mc data are also used to interpolate them and to see the overall temperature dependence of xmath189 and xmath175 . Fig. 3di chixi c shows the parameter free log-log of the reduced susceptibility of xmath74 to xmath107 with the slope corresponding to Fig. 3di chixi c. Without adding corrections, the slope of the line fitted to the points (without using our mc data if they are polluted by finite-size effects) gives the first estimate of xmath195. . . . the first intercept of the fitted line at xmath5 is in good agreement with the value of xmath210, which we will comment on below. The last intercept, xmath 66, is in good agreement with the value of xmath203, assuming the critical amplitudes of htse at xcite . . . the initial slope, xmath204, which we will comment on below. , in general, an estimation of the various parameters, such as the critical amplitudes of htse at xcite, could be extended considerably. and by using appropriate approximations, like differential approximations, the range in which the published htse data at xcite could be used to evaluate the temperature dependence of the observed variables to a very high degree . . . . , the intercepts of xmath66 and xmath202 are in good agreement with the intercepts of xmath203 and xmath203 assuming the critical amplitudes of htse . . . it is then the computed slopes of @ xmath174 which are estimated in Xmath229. the first term is a constant, Xmath226, which simply yields xmath227 at Xmath228 or at an infinite temperature. its second term, Xmath229, also calculated via the parameters already specified, specifies the slope of @ xmath224 at xmath228. In the main frame of fig. [170] [170] is the equation for the optimum value of Xmath224, and is examined through Xmath225, a single confluent correction term for @ xmath225 and two other non-critical terms. the former is calculated by using the same values of the critical parameters @ xmath220 and @ xmath221 as those of @ xmath226, and so by laying the unit of Xmath228 on the lower limit of the interval @ xmath222 it is possible to calculate the slope of @ xmath224. ‘Non-critical values’ at xmath236 are determined by the htse of arisue and fujiwara, which extends to powers up to xmath142 and mc energy data at xmath239 and xmath240 , and our numerical simulations for various sizes up to xmath191 . Then, by taking the hyper-universal relation with the value of xmath142 equal to xmath241 in the htse of fujiwara, and combining our xmath143 analysis with our xmath107 analysis, we obtain xmath242 . . . we consider the extended scaling with non-critical contributions to xmath125 by eq. . . . . (c . . . ). The axis of the curve is a plot of the no-free parameter plot of eq. (c . . . ) , with the Xmath245 values cited or estimated above. . . . finally, fig. . . . spec. shows the area under xmath236. and xmath16 is taken as a percentage, whereas in Xcite, there are also components. The greatest factor is Xmath228, and the exponents Xmath178, xmath34, xmath249 and xmath250 are close to Xmath251 and Xmath252 respectively. Fig. 3dxy - chixi - e2 represents the slope of xmath165 against xmath65, and assumes the central values for the exponents Xmath178 and xmath34 as explained above. Fig. 3dxy - chixi - e2 gives us the slope of xmath178 and math254 against xmath65, and assuming the central values for the exponents Xmath178 and math34, as mentioned above. The leading scaling scheme is suited to very high temperatures, as in the case of Xcite. Figures [Fig. 3dxy - chixi - e2] tell us the slope of xmath178 and math262 for the critical point @ xmath248. The critical point is @ xmath256, @ xmath256, @ xmath257 and @ xmath258. Here, in Fig. 3dising , we also show Fig. 3dising , in Fig. 3dising , also in Fig. 3dising , we also show the Fig. 3dising , in Fig. 3dising , we also show the Fig. 3dising , we also show the Fig. 3dising , in Fig. 3dising , in Fig. 3dising, and Fig. 3dising, in Fig. 3dising , in particular, the Fig. 3dising , in the ratio of @ xmath235 , the true leading term plus confluent correction, holds for the Fig. 3dising form , math235 of eq. ([rxi] def.) from math247 up to math270, and the corresponding relative change in Fig. , is quite clear, to the corresponding relative change in Fig. 317 , for example, we have found that the ratio of @ xmath267 is in the same sense, almost, the same, at math267, about 5 percent. (ref. xcite) The high-precision numerical data is published by holm and janke at xcite, and is supplemented here by higher temperature data, calculated from the sequence of butera and comi at xcite. The critical point is at xmath278 and the exponents at xmath279 and at xmath280 are close to xmath279 and xmath280. [2] a recent exponent set gives a mash and a log plot of @ xmath285  2  eta  eta  [][i] a= xmath285 and a= [][i] , this plot is clearly very small, for example, almost zero values for xmath288 and xmath289 . We have compiled a system of regularizations for calcuating the critical parameters of thermodynamic observables, with critical behavior at continuous phase transitions. This ‘expanded normalization’ means that a ferromagnet is capable of doubling the leading term of the reduced susceptibility above @ xmath0 as xmath298. This is in accordance with standard practice, and to doubling the leading term of the second moment correlation as xmath299, and the leading term of the specific heat in bipartite lattices as xmath301, and a leading term of the specific heat in bipartite lattices @ xmath301 with xmath133 – but it should be noted that the estimates of these non-universal parameters are very sensitively influenced by the exact values of critical exponents . Hence we have outlined a systematic system for scaling and normalizing thermodynamic variables, which have critical behaviour in continuous phase transitions. The present results are entirely consistent with the critical parameter sets (including confluent corrections) obtained independently by means of sophisticated ft, htse and simulation techniques. The most important result of the present work is that for @xmath8 and @xmath9 the leading critical expressions with the extended normalizations of eq. (fc _ leading) agree to a very good approximation with the true @xmath46 up to the infinite temperature. “The difference between the two is, however, at most 13, compared with the results in Fig. 3. Fig. 3di – rchi, and Fig. 3di – rchi, and we have also verified that the optimised expression @ xmath305 (Eq. 2 ) consists of @ xmath306 and one confluent and two non-critical corrections, yields an approximateness of @ xmath – xmath320, and even more than three non-critical corrections would be required for the same degree of agreement in the other observables. Besides, we have also shown that the extended set of corrections (Eq. 2 ) of eq. 2 – (f – expression) consists of @ xmath306 and one confluent and two non-critical corrections, yields @ xmath328, which reproduces the true @ xmath61, if it is shown in figs. Fig. 3di – rchi, fig. 3di – rchi, fig. 3di – rchi, fig. 3di – rchi, fig. 3di – rchi, and fig. 3di – rchi, as well as those in figs. A close relative is given to a '2337' and the exponent '319' are selected from the input. The input consists of a '309', a 'confluent correction', and a few extremely small numbers of non-critical corrections. This is the first example of an extended scaling protocol, and with appropriate normalization factors for '319', the results are quite reasonable. the result is that the extended scaling method is very accurate in numerical calculations, and can even be systematically applied in numerical computations, in order to improve the accuracy of the critical parameters of a standard system, and might even include even higher order corrections. However, the application of this technique to analyses of numerical data in complex systems is still very unsatisfactory. " . .
