—**** - the construction of background field formalism for n = 2 supersymmetrical theory (sym) in projective hyperspace (@xmath0) is an open problem. The construction of such a formalism is desirable for any (non-supersymmetric) supersymmetric theory, since it simplifies and even passes through intermediate calculations respecting gauge covariance. The principal problem for solving this problem for n = 2 supersymmetrical theory was the lack of knowledge concerning gauge connections to the tropical hyperfield (@xmath3 ) , which described the sym multiplet for all practical purposes. Thus, by using the rather higher dimension background fields (like @xmath7), they could be represented by a rather larger dimension (such as in n = 1 superspace)—that is, by setting the background fields to be in the ‘real’ representation (@xmath5), and the quantum fields to be in the ‘analytic’ representation (@xmath6). This representation is a resemblance to the quantum chiral but background chiral representation used in n = 1 superspace . . . here the problem of constructing the background field formalism of harmonic superspace is well studied. Although this has some nuances, it has been refined in a series of papers, which contain some relevant calculations. We have a minimum of the very shallow low-fisted "memory" of a field: an in-line "quad" with minimal Integration (that is, the integration is effectively vanished from the effective action, and, as is expected from the supergraph rules, only one integration survives at the end of the calculation. Besides this, we have added two more ghosts, namely, true-bosonic @xmath12 and complex fermionic @xmath13, which are, in addition, the all-fisted (miscellaneous)-plus, and the double-boom, which are, for example, very close to the average of n = 4, heuristically, one can even see that the vanishing @xmath16 function would have a vanishing @xmath16 function for n = 4. moreover, the contributions of the ball and the ghosts of @xmath1 and the extra ghosts of these two figures have spurious divergences, which occur in the numberless (multiple) phases of the loop. this is in contrast to the ordinary projective superspace construction of n = 2 , it is discussed briefly below, and then for continuity . This section is mostly built on the ordinary projective superspace construction of sym, detailed in @xcite . we will briefly discuss it here for the continuity of the proceedings. But in the case of @xmath0 the similarities are quite striking. There are two extra ghosts, namely real bosonic @xmath12 and complex fermionic @xmath15. The equations of gauge covariant derivatives corresponding to these extra xmaths form a projective hyperfield (math22) through the constraints of xmath22. The algebra of covariant derivatives will be explained later, but we must note that in the real' representation (called reflective in @xcite, and that is what we often use in this work) the xmath23s are xmath10-dependent. so, we simply write: math26 (with the usual factor of math26 being suppressed) . so, the projective measure simply reads: math26 (with the usual factor of math26 suppressed).     w  a     a       a We can solve the commutation relation for @ xmath35 by writing @ xmath36, where @ xmath37 is an unconstrained complex hyperfield. We can do a background division of @ xmath37 (as in n = 1 superspace), such that @ xmath37 is the background covariant derivative. Here, in addition, the quantum part of the covariant derivatives can be chosen as in analysis’, math42, math44, and math44. Thus, the vector hyperfield is formed as it is in the ordinary case; the difference is that the entity is only an expression for the entity in question, and therefore the analysis’ representation of quantum hyperfields is a consistent choice. We can find the commutation relation for math35 with @xmath36, where math36 is an unconstrained complex hyperfield. Therefore, we can define a background projective hyperfield whose background dimension is math47, such that math47 is the background covariant derivative. Moreover, the quantum component of the complete covariant derivatives can be chosen to be in  analytic’ representation , math42 , math44 and math44 . The expressions of the exponents of the series in the exponents of the series, the kinetic operator, remain the same. The kinetic operator has the same kinetic coefficient, as in the ordinary case, but the structure of its action remains the same. The quantization procedure of the exponents in the exponents is as follows: atherial, covariant, and atherial. As quantum connections are not apparent explicitly in the calculations, we shall drop the usage of curly characters to denote the exponents of the background field (as was done above) and also substitute with the subscript “At xmath55” a subscript: “At xmath55” a. as the ordinary derivatives are now exponents of covariant derivatives, and so atherian, dalembertian, and dalembertian are all replaced by @ xmath55. - where @ xmath52 is the exponent - covariant dalembertian and @ xmath53 . 1   4                                                                                                                                                                         left —             left — After the form  , dx  1   2   dx  1   2    dx  1   2  dx  1  left [1 +  frac           4   2  dx    2  dx  2  dx  4    4    2   dx  dx   4    4   2  dx   dx   4     4    2  v                                             []]          2             []] [                    [ I will refer to the harmonic case of xcite. I will add nielsen-kallosh (nk) ghost to account for the resulting jacobian. To incorporate the effect of @xmath86 directly into the path integral, I will introduce a real scalar + a complex fermion + a complex fermion + a complex fermion + a scalar with adjoints in a superplex and, together with the joint fp and nk ghosts, the same formula is applied to the n = 4 in a complete algebra, the joint fp and nk ghosts cancel each other’s joint fp and nk ghosts. Moreover, the other two terms have spurious divergences, which result from multiple fp and nk ghosts, but their joint contributions have to be finite, which will happen later. Hence, if the effect of fp and nk ghosts is to be considered direct, we choose to introduce a real scalar in xmath14 and a complex fermion in xmath15, and in a single quantum act, for n = 2 syms in correspondence with matter, read: 4  dx dx dy   1 , 2  , x   left (   y  12    right)     y  12         right)      left (                                                                                                          ,              ,              , What’s more, in the form of this new form of the background field formalism for sym, one can now apply it to the calculations of contributions to the effective action of different hypermultiplets. For example, the quantum propagators form the internal lines of the loops, and the external lines correspond to the background fields. To calculate the contributions to the effective action of a scalar hypermultiplet, we must expand the operators of @ xmath58 and @ xmath57 into the vertices of @ xmath105 (the independent part of @ xmath56) and produce the vertices with the vector connection and background fields . Hence, we can remove these ghosts from the very start and work with the revised propagator and vertex for the calculating of diagrams. . . . let us now collate the relevant Feynman rules below. The following rules, as described in 12107, will be applicable to the classical case of sym, and are the same as those described in 239. The @xmath 58 and @xmath57 operators in the propagators need to be extended around 107106 (the co-determinant part of 119) to generate the vertices with the vector connection and the background fields. The extra ghosts, in addition to the exponential of the Gravitational ‘Ghost’ property, can be removed from the first, and we can then use the recast propagator and vertex to calculate the diagrams. - a     -    -   - , -    -      - , -   -    - , -   - -  -  -  -  -  - - , - d - d - d - d - - -  -  - ,  -  -  -  - , - -     -  -   - - -  -   - , -   -  -  -   -    left -  w - n,   ,   -  -    left -    left -  left (  - 1 - y - y - y - y -  -  -  -  - right -  -    left (  w - 1 ) -  -  -  -  -  right ) -  - d - 4 - d - sent>w  (n)    ,    ,   right             , ,             ,              ,          [302    . and it is even more sane, if we are referring to the number of the indexes in the graphs, the division of the values in   is the complete 4 point effective action. assuming they are momentum independent, one can in the case of the u (1 ) gauge group and run the integral over the  and get    and so @ math120, where we have used the reduction to 4d for math120. This result is like the one we got for the  2=, the first non-vanishing contribution is from  xmath116, which has the same nature of the vector in                        [ ] -   [ ]         , We took the classical notion of the background field and its equations as real, for we had the illusion of renormalizing theorems, since the lowest-dimensional fields we could think of were spinors. But this is easily supplanted by the doubling-edged argument of @xcite that directly leads to a proof for finiteness beyond the first loop. The principle in this was to see that different representations were required for the background and the quantum pieces of the hypermultiplets. This firstly required a replacement of the ordinary super-Feynman rules with the background covariant ones. In addition, we needed extra ghosts (other than fp and nk ghosts) to calculate the effective action of n = 2 sym. moreover, we needed additional ghosts (other than fp and nk ghosts) to evaluate the full extent of the sym effectiveness. for n = 1 background formalism, the present super-feynman codes have been improved in several ways, and we hope that these methods may be applied to the formalism we have developed in this paper.
