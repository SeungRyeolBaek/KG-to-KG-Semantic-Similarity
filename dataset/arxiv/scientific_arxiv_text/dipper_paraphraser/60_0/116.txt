With a clever combination of different interactions and synergy, they have formed a large intergalactic shock wave, first observed as a narrow filament in the radio continuum, and later detected in the x-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray X-ray, -P-R-X, -v; and -v and 226twaddle of the slow motion, -v athax, 636, k-v, i2> and 73010191t-falced and 188es are shown in Figure 1 and the es are shown in Figure 1: the central element of the -flexiv; and   1100 262  12115 of the intruder galaxy, 7318b, in the 8432l7galactic medium of the group -flexiv, was suspected to be responsible for the thermal heating of the es rays of X-rays. The group of -flexiv is dubbed the second group. During the time of the detection of the small earthquake, several other systems with similar features have been found. Besides, we have prepared several other studies on the correlation between uv / x ray emission and dust . . . Since the discovery of the large earthquake, several systems, displaying similar h - x-ray emission, have been discovered. Besides, several other papers have been prepared by our group which will explain the relationship between the uv / x-ray emission and the vapor emission of dust. Besides, there are several papers to be gathered in the future, besides which will explain the relationship between the uv / x-ray emission and the formation of dust. " . . . , et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera ; in the second part we will present the detailed excitations of h @ x-ray emission across the face of the x-ray absorption and contrast them with models. The very large scale (10 kpc) of the x-ray absorption is well suited for this investigation. In addition, we will show the density of h @ x-ray emission in two-dimensional layers of the X-ray absorption. In the third part we describe the formulas for various lines. In the fourth part we describe the theory of clustering. The work was performed by the Alps Observatory, Version s17.0 .4 and s17.2 .0 for sl and ll, and in a scr, which operates on the basis of ramp fitting, dark current subtraction and flat fielding. The first data reductions were carried out by the Alps Observatory (ssc) instrument, version s17.4 and s17.2 .0 for sl and ll, which are in a general reduction mode, which is observed very early after the mapping. , which operates on short-cuts (@ xmath19; @ xmath20), and on long-cuts (@ xmath22) , whose length is from the x-ray emission of the shock. These observations consisted of 60s integrations, and 5 cycles per step. fl spectral mapping consists of two separate, partially overlapping maps, centered north and south, on the x-ray emission of the shock. The sl spectral mapping consisted of two separate, partially overlapping maps, centered north and south of the x-ray emission of the shock. In sl, where for scheduling reasons the targeted observations were too far from the destination to be optimal, the backgrounds were produced by observations at the periphery of the map that did not contain spectral line signatures. Figure 1 displays the outline of the regions observed superimposed on a composite image of the group. The required data for the CTDs were of good quality than the standard CTDs. The coloured spectra were then assembled into spectral cubes for each module in the program, the cubism software. Spectra of each module were assembled into spectral cubes using the cubism software, which is called cubism at xcite . a round-trip mcd image of sq was obtained from the ssc archive; the resulting image was reduced by using the Scan tool . . . . to a cubic mcd image of sq, taken on a square-trip, of 8mcd. – for all dimensions the wide-band image at 16 and 24 mcd was obtained with the ssc blue peak-up imager (pi), and the mips instrument . . . – the mips instrument . . . got 24 pictures of sq on the 27th of July, with a spatial resolution of xmath66. A reconstruction of the spectra, a contour, a continuum on either side of a feature, was carried out with the averaged continuum of the point at which the line-colored emission line was extracted, and then the spectra were extracted from the spectra by using matched apertures. The coarse and coarse transitions in the absolute rotation of the images in the final mosaics have a pixel scale of 0 . . . The pure rotational line ratios are not particularly good diagnostics for the differentiation between these mechanisms, for all three mechanisms are thermally stable and can be thermally anodized in the lower-level rotation. Moreover, the spectral curves were used to find the exact number of rotational lines of the water-vapor material that were detected in stephan ’s specimen, namely, the 0 – 0 s ( 0 – 0) – 0 – 0 s ( 0 – 0) and the 0 – 0 lines mapped by the ll module, while the s ( 0 – 0 – 0 – 0) lines mapped by the ll modules, while the s ( 0 – 0 – 0 – 0) and – 1 lines mapped by the ll modules. in the stephan s quintet the distribution of large-scale x-ray and radio emission and of optical emission line diagnostics indicate that the giant filament as shown in figure 1 is the result of a strong shock. in the spectral analysis of h at x-math5 emissions, some rotational lines of molecular hydrogen were obtained, namely the 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – – 17 – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – and – – – – sent> heptagonal emission from the star-forming region, sq-a, which was associated with ngc 7319. The figures 2a-d show a new h at xmath5 structure that extends eastward from the main, 'shock-relay ridge'. The structure is observable faintly in the chandra- xcite and xmm-xcite x-ray images, and is pronounced as faint h at xmath5 by @ xcite, but is not strong in radio continuum. Among these lines, the s (0) and s (1) maps show that the h at xmath5 in the bridge ends in a large clump a few arcsecs west of the nucleus of the Neyfert 2 galaxy, ngc 7319, and, moreover, a little detour to the north (especially in the s (1) map, which has the highest s / n) . as you can see, there is a certain slight difference in the distribution of the warm h at xmath5 emission in the bridge. Despite the very limited coverage compared with the ll map, the base of the bridge is visible and sq-a is partially covered. sq-a is partially covered by the sl2 module (for some reason, for its late  ). The s-0 and s- 1 maps demonstrate that the warm h at xmath5 consists in a large clump some distance east of the nucleus of the galaxy ngc 7319, and, in a slight detour to the north ( The warm gas is distributed along the length of the main north-south x-ray ridge, and along the   bridge   —abroad 50 newton x-ray ray image of stephan’s quintet. Although the warm gas appears to follow the x-ray, there are subtle differences. The cooler s (0) line has its emission concentrated in the north and follows the x-ray less closely than the warmer s ( 3). In the center of the shock, there are peak peaks at both wavelengths. To illustrate the close connection between the warm gas and the major global shock wave, we will now examine the distribution of the warm gas to x-ray and radio radiation. The central spectrum of the hot x-ray, which is described in Figure 1(a) and Figure 2(b), will be shown. But as we can see, the s ( 3), which is precisely parallel to the x-ray, is not yet connected with the strong x-ray emission, but in a manner that suggests a causal connection. The warmer s ( 0) line has a concentrated southward peak and is weaker than the warmer s ( 3), which is seen in the center of the shock, in which there are peaks in both wavelengths. The intergalactic star formation zone, whose formation is explained by a universal star formation, is not included in the x-ray emission, as seen in figure [fig: xray rad] a, but as we shall see in figure [fig: xray rad] a, this is not only a smaller region of heat in which the x-ray emission is reflected, but That is, the synchrotron smear from the very core of the shock is limited to the very bottom, and only weak or no emission is visible from all but two metals, namely xmath10neii xmath11 $] 12 . 81 , xmath10nei xmath11 $] 12 . 82 (this data has been re-analysed and is presented in appendix b) . the spectra of Xcite were limited to the very core of the shock, and only weak emission was observed from all but two metals, namely xmath10neii xmath11 $] 12 . 82 , xmath10neii xmath11 $] 12 . . . . . . . . . . . . , Xmath10neii Xmath11 $] . . . . . . . . . . - There is no evidence from the spectra of high excitations from the medium, for example, the xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ - in a similar way to the xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ - and yet Xcite have shown that the xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ - ratio is low, suggesting low excitation conditions for the ions in the shock, further supported by section em. - in the centre of the shock (as indicated by the hotspot in fig.

You can see this by comparing the 123 pah map with the 133 pah map of the Xcite sky-lite. – We discuss in this section how the observed ’, which has a different spatial distribution than the observed gas, are correlated with the ’ and pah in the irs spectrum. In the figure that follows (see Figure 6) there is a clear and considerable correlation between the parameters of the 113 pah map and the warm dust in figure (see Figure 6) showing the ’ and ‘’ in both the ’ and ‘’ maps of the ’-lites. v ‘‘‘. In this section we will consider how these regions, which have a different spatial distribution from the gas, are correlated with the pah and uv emission we detect in the irs. The strong correlation is illustrated by the figures in Figure – ‘dust’ where we overlay the 11’ map on the 105 band, which is dominated by the 7, 7, and 8 5 features. We may remark, however, that regions with strong 11‘ emission during the shock do not appear to be as strong at the 8 – 9,8 – 9 –  . and this point will be referred to in Section 4 ‘Squads’. In this connection it can be seen that the dust, pah, and uv emission are associated with the regions of previous star formation, and not any additional star formation is observed in the – 218–3 – Among the results of the light intensity study (Guillard et al., 2010; natale et al., 2009) is a new result which is less obvious than that obtained by previous studies, that the dominant regions of the formation of a star in the xmath region lie not at the head of the galaxies but at two strikingly strong, almost symmetrical regions, at either end of the xmath region. This is particularly the case for the south region, which is known as the South Sea, and which is very powerful, as is the case with 7318b and 7318c, and the latter is also very powerful, as we will see later in section 6.1. The dim emission of the main shock is not so much due to the destruction of very small grains (vsgs) as it is due to the destruction of the larger ones (vsgs), or to indicate that the grains are cold and radiating at longer wavelengths, where spitzer has the least spatial resolution. Nevertheless, despite the faintness of the main shock, the pale pahset of the m map gives a new result, which was not previously apparent, namely that the main sources of the formation of stars in the m zone do not lie in the galaxies themselves but in two strikingly powerful, almostsymmetrically arranged regions, at the extreme end of the h-xmath5 field. [1] So, xmathset - -c [2] he said he felt that the warm molecule of hydrogen in Stephan’s quintet was following the x-ray distribution in the main shock and in the bridge ’s structure. In the main shock, the heat of Xmath5 emitted by the main shock and the bridge’s structure, it is possible to suppose that the heat of x-rays is induced directly by the x-rays. In order to measure the strength of x-math5 emission, he had to use cubisms which were built on each irs module and whose sizes were joined to form a composite spectrum. The spectra of the sub-regions of the main shock and the sub-region of the bridge are shown in figure [Fig], a, b, and c. Spectra of these sub-regions are shown in figure [Fig], a, b, and c, as shown in figure [fig], b and c. all three have the characteristic feature of being overshadowed by molecular hydrogen . Thus the warm hydrogen in stephan’s quintet follows the x-ray distribution in the main shock and in the bridge. The sub-region (fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. ] a, b, and c are chosen for the south of the central shock, for the risk of intrudering. The sub-region (fig. Fig. b) is not in the vicinity of the center of the shock, for this reason avoids the regions contaminated by star formation, which have been discussed in the previous section. This is because the mid-ir spectrum of all three regions is the most powerful, with strong h @ xmath5 lines and weak spectral lines, and there is an almost even detonation in the iron lines, which is consistent with a transitional phase, as the previous optical observations show . . . this confirms the spectral properties, which are noticed in the xcite data, and that the  bridge  has the same xray properties as the main shock (you will see later) , that is to say, the bridge is a -scaled down  . The new irs observations appear to suggest that more than one large-scale group of shocks are present in the group. This might be the result of previous tidal interactions, implying that multiple shock heating events have occurred in the region, which is consistent with the previous xray  xcite  . In this case, although the h @ xmath5 lines are still strong, a rising continuum and an increase in the strength of the metal lines in comparison to the h @ xmath5 is consistent with a spectrum that is increasingly dominated by star formation, a fact which we already know from our xray  xcite . so the new irs observations seem to suggest that more than one large-scale group of shocks is present in this group. The weaker radio continuum emission at this location is significant. In a set of sample lines (of which some even have an observed line and some added to the ones whose fluxes are not observed) and an extra 28 % emission from unobserved lines (see the models that match the excitation diagram below) resulting in a total h @ xmath5 flux from the main shock of 9 . 7 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ergs @ xmath13. In the model, we are told to take a model that fits the temperature of the main shock and, in fact, it is a pity that in reality there are many different temperatures in the shock, and the three-element model can only be a rough estimate. In paper ii we will consider a more extensive simulation of the temperature at which h@ xmath9 lies (t @ xmath37 = 158 @ xmath38k, t @ xmath9 = 412 @ xmath39k, and t @ xmath40 = 1500 @ xmath41k) , resulting in a total h@ xmath9 of 9 . 7 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ergs @ xmath13 . Figure . [fig. ] shows the model of the low - i 0 - h @ xmath5 transitions for the main shock . a complete reanalysis of the XMM newton observations of sq using the latest calibrations (see section C, for details), in order to determine the fluxes and luminosities of the x-ray emission to a ratio of 2 . 9 . the results indicate that, throughout the expanded regions of sq, the molecular hydrogen cooling pathway dominates the x-ray during the early stages of the process. , and therefore, in the whole of the extended regions of sq, the molecular hydrogen cooling pathway dominates the x-ray during the late stages of evolution. the result is a very significant one, and reaffirms the old idea that the x-ray emission always dominates cooling during the later stages of evolution in compact groups. . . . , so that it is probable that the h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-n-h-h-n-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-d-l-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t- The X-ray emission of X-rays (xdrs) is made, but it is well outside the normal range of values, even for agn that has been well studied . . . for example, the ratio of X-rays X-rays X-rays X-rays X-rays is very high, compared to a normal galaxies X-rays X-rays X-rays, x-rays , shocks, etc., the ratio of X-rays X-rays x-rays X-rays X-rays, the ratio of X-rays x-rays , the excitation of the agn and the depletion of dust. As a matter of fact, this large aperture is contaminated by the emission of stars from X-rays and the intruders of the outward galaxy . . . . This ratio is, however, a measure of the hardness of the radiation field, which is sensitive to the effective temperature of the ionizing source. in the main shock, this ratio corresponds to a shock velocity of between 100 and 300 kms at xmath13 (with preshock densities of xmath56 and xmath57 and the magnetic parameter xmath58 = 0 and 3 ) . however, it is clear from its spatial distribution relative to the 8 and h @ xmath5 that most of the neon comes from the star formation and so that the shocks are an obvious source of excitation. The qa of the swarming galaxies has a ratio of only xmath55, which indicates a lower intensity of radiation north of the central apogee. . . . . in star-forming galaxies the qa of the swarming subregion has only xmath55 , it indicates a lower intensity radiation field north of the central apogee. At xmath 60 / xmath61 kms xmath11 — it is determined from xmath 60 / xmath61 kms xmath11 — (two lines of the same ionisation state) to one. (26) from the density of Xmath 60 / xmath61 kms xmath11 — that is to say, the average electron density is at xmath 60 / xmath61 kms xmath11 — we have ruled out the possibility that x rays heat the h . . . . . since the h . . . . is the dominant luminosity. So how can we explain these similar distributions? do we see that this mass of hydrogen and the x ray rays appears to be one of the same distributions, and we have rejected the possibility that the phenomenon was caused by the heating of the h . . . since the h . . . has the predominant luminosity. In other words, this very basic mechanical picture appears plausible, as is shown in figure [fig: hi + h2] which shows how the h . . . [10] fills in the 'h . .' at the back of the hi tidal tail, as shown by vla . . . . The kinetic energy of the excitation can be reproduced by low-speed ( @xmath62) magnetohydrodynamic shocks within a dense h @ xmath63 gas. The immovable h @ xmath5 gas, which was described by the name of 'solar mass', may also be interpreted as the case with 7318b-south. Here, as outlined above, the combination of excitations of the area of the shock in the region of sq can be understood in terms of a spectrum. This spectrum, as outlined above, shows that the h @ xmath5 excitations in the region of the current shock are the result of a multiplicity of atoms, which may have been embedded in the H-gas, are a natural consequence of the multiphase medium of the pre-shocked material. These tests are consistent with the broad h @ xmath5 linewidth (in 870 km @ xmath13), and the velocity center of the warm h @ xmath5 (based on new irs measurement - see Appendix B) which places the gas between the intruder and the group igm. Both these measurements are consistent with the acceleration of h @ xmath5 in the turbulent post-shock layer. . If this is the case, then it would be necessary to explain why two such gmcs were placed at the extreme ends of the current shock. Xcite find optical emission line ratios consistent with a shock model that does not have a radiative precursor xcite. silicon and iron have very similar first and second ionization potentials. Their first ionization potentials (7.9 and 8.5 ev for fe and si, respectively) are lower than hydrogen's, but their second ionization potential is higher (as much as 16. 19 and 16 ev for fe and si) . . . we also detect abundant . . . . . . -as a main point of the shock. . . . the mir . . . . . . . . . . . . the high . . . . . . ] - xmath10feii . . . . ] . . . . . and 97.3 in the case of a coarse gas, the neon line strength scales with the temperature of the ionized gas. – The -sse – X-se – X-se line – -se – line – x-se (excl.; ha, and keto, 2007). In the case of a gas-surge that’s in the form of at least -sse, and an -se, as described in the -se section (see section 4), the -se line – -se – line – is a measure of the strength of the ionized gas – see section 5; in the case of a gas-surge of -se, the line’s intensity is the proportion of -se to h-se, and a contrast with the -se, –se, –m – -se, -m as discussed in section 5). in the figure –se – sil – ne – we give the region in grey (based on the upper and lower limits determined for the @ xmath10–se–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–ne–n As expected, the proportion of the skewed fractions indicated by the arrows (@xmath650% and @xmath660% for fe and si) should be considered lower. This is because there is a possibility of a contribution from non-ionizing shocks to the xmath10feii @xmath11 $] and xmath10sii @xmath11 $] line emissions from non-ionizing shocks into molecular gaseous. we consider the magnitude of the offsets indicated by the arrows (@xmath650% and @xmath660% for fe and si) in figure [fig: sil ne] [calculated) , for the fe and si depletion of the suboptimal shocks, which are no more than the intensities of the gaseous gases. Moreover, the contribution of non-ionizing shocks to the @xmath10feii and the @xmath10sii, and the fe/si depletion ratio, which is greater than that of shocks grouped in figure [calculated] , should enable us to estimate the proportion of fe and si depletion of the suboptimal shocks. The absorption of the suboptimal shocks by non-ionizing - fe and si can be calculated from the coefficient of substitution for the suboptimal flux, fe, and si. and also in an ocular image of sq, a co traces the mndi0 of the hndi10 that it encounters on the orbit of ngc 7319, that is, the South, that of the Jiang, in which there is a ridge of dust over which there is concentrated the steam; and the nuclear steam around ngc 7319 is concentrated in two regions. As is observed by @xcite, the steam around ngc 7319 is concentrated in two regions: the dominating complex is located in the North of the Nucleus, within a dusty tidal feature. In the regions occupied by NGC 7319 the nuclear steam is still contained in the North, and the predominant complex is found at the North. Compared with the heat h @ xmath5 of the shock, the nuclear steam is also inherently divided from the steam h @ xmath5 to the warm h @ xmath5 of the North. The radiocarbon is not observed to coincide with the locations of warm h @ xmath5 emission, particularly around ngc 7319. These observations indicate that most of the co generation in the shock has been missed by the interferometric method, because the series is very narrow, and show that it is both present in the shock and extends along the warm h @ xmath5 beam and towards ngc 7319 . This paper will be presented in a future paper (guillard et al., 2010), and will describe the recent detection of    co ( 0 ) and 2  0 We analyze the formation of stars in the warm h-emitting medium, by considering the sub-region of the shock (fig. Fig. 1). The sub-region of the shock contains a large quantity of warm hydrogen (55 . 0 @ xmath210 @ xmath43m @ xmath44) which acts as a fuel for star formation, if the shock cools down (see section spec). We examine the emission of pah in the warm h-emitting medium by examining the sub-region of the shock (fig. Fig. 1). In the sub-region of the shock (Fig. ) the flux of 6 . 2 pah of xmath74 wm . xmath75 is quite weaker than the 11 . 3 as well, which when strong are mostly produced by neutral pah molecules . . . . a suppression of the 7 . 7 . 11 pah ratio is observed in agny agny (e.g., low luminosity agny in the sings sample of ... ) There is a parameter x[a] - -x363; and if we combine this with a measure of the x[b] and the h[a] in this region we can obtain a star formation rate (sfr) given that they are complementary (h] in the young star population, and x[a] in the absorption of the stellar light). , we find x[a] with x[b] and find a sfr of x[b]290, ... @x[b] . We have found a sfr of x[b] , but we caution that this sfr is also the result of the slumber-excitation and therefore the upper limit of the estimation. Using the relation of x[b] with the stellar dust in this region we find a sfr of x[b]290. But, however, caution is advised: this sfr is already biased, for it seems that a suppressed sfr of x[b] is made up of some source of astro-radiation which is derived from known localities in the group. X[c] has a sfr of 0 - 408 mjy, corresponding to a spectral luminosity (@ xmath78) of xmath79 . And the present observations suggest that in dense clumps the thermal superhearing of the helium dissipates a significant fraction of the kinetic energy available in high-speed shocks. The magnitude of a cold pool of molecular gas in the shock is very important in this case, as explained in section . . . a second explanation of this case is given in the following way. iii The total h  5 of the whole group exceeds x 5, and is still the most dominant gas. The total h  5 emission from the whole group exceeds 55 and is still the most dominant h  5 coolant, indeed the luminosity of the rotational h  5 lines is so great that it could be detected at high redshift with the next-generation spica and safir instruments, such as spica and safir (appleton et al.). this would be consistent with a picture of the hydrogen warming the turbulent medium . . . . well, the temperature of the gas increases, and the shearing and entanglement of the shearing objects will prevent the collapse, the cold 5 52555698, and at least a large fraction of the 55555556655510, what about the assembly of galaxies? But our observations have shown that, under the right conditions, even in extremely metallic environments, molecular hydrogen can be very powerful in this case, by ten times a factor of its usual power, at the place of Xmath10siii@Xmath1134. Therefore, we assume that molecular hydrogen is a cooling agent in gas, which forms the first major structures (e.g., bromm et al. 2001, santoro and shull 2006) . But we have observed that, under the right conditions, even in extremely metallic conditions, molecular hydrogen can be very powerful in this case, by ten times over the normally strong Xmath10sii@Xmath1134. Moreover, this is not a trivial problem. In this paper, we have presented the results of the mid-infrared spectral mapping of the stephan's quintet with the spitzer space telescope. We can see here our five main conclusions: the powerful h @ xcite emitting by xcite surprisingly represents only a small fraction of the broad warm h @ xcite (at xmath89 kpc) which dominates the cooling over molecular hydrogen. On the other hand, this will not be a trivial matter. The dominant h @ xcite emission (from the first stars) in the vast, turbulent medium, in which heavy shocks destroy dust in certain places and in others are sufficient to evade it - thus encouraging h @ xcite to a great extent , 7318b, 7318b, 7318b, 7318b, and 7318b, are at the extreme ends of the shock ridge, as we can see at the radio wavelength, suggesting that both are starbursts. Using a comparison of Xmath10neii@xmath11 $], Xmath10neii@xmath11 $] and xmath10feii@xmath11 $], we find that both silicon and iron are depleted in the dust. This result proves that dust is not destroyed in the shock. Xmath10 infrared lines are a better cooling agent than x-rays on the shock structures, and shows a new cooling pathway in the size-regional muddle. The results confirm that the mir h @ xmath9 lines are stronger than x-rays in the vicinity of shocks, and indicate a new cooling pathway, known as the path of the compact group evolution. The star formation in sq is dominated by a and 7318b in the southern region, which, in addition, are both part of the shock ridge, suggesting both were starbursts. As h @ xmath9 forms on the surfaces of dust, we would expect dust emission in these regions, but a low-intensity radiation field only yields slight emission at 24 . We are glad to provide the opportunity of making use of the astrophysical equipment of the Herschel space observatory. We also thank tom jarrett for the use of his irs pixel cleaning software and irac / mips photometry software. This chemistry is supported by the nasa through a grant from jpl/caltech under contract number 40142.8 the rotational emission of h @xmath5 and the contributions of lines such as @xmath10i @xmath11 would be quite important, and if we consider the spectrum of h @xmath50 @xcite is to be considered important, then it is highly possible that strong uv lines will be able to compensate. 1997, 52903223142217757* and the spectrum of h@xmath50@xcite is likely to be a good one. 101721324273983624236327;74219164441010101010101010227" D.

From the side, we talk about the discovery of ngc 7319, a seyfert galaxy, h-v-xcite lying to the east of the same sq group. (See fig. 6) Figure (Fig. 6) shows that the nucleus of ngc 7319 produces strong x-ray radiance @xcite, and is highly visible in radio wavelengths @xcite. The specific intensity curves of h-v-x-math5 and h-v-x-math5 (v and v) are defined, as follows, as is outlined in the following section: Figure (cm): xray rad. figure (cm): xray rad - x-ray rad - Fig. 2a and b, depict emission from the galaxy, seemingly connected to the rest of the group by the h-v-x-math5 -b bridge [2a, b] , Fig. 2a, b and c are indicated by the region in which the h-v--b bridge was discovered.

' The declination is a special case of an 'altered' galaxy, but, like other galaxies, - although the more extensive heated regions in glimmering stars, such as glimmering ones, are not all the same. In the N10neiinenenenenenenenenenenenenenennnn  is a measure of the flux of electrons, and the value of 0 indicates a typical flux, and a small 'ma' (the average of @xmath10119, and it is quite apprehensive for a 'ma' in the general cosmic average, and the mean of @xmath It should be noted that the h-atom resembling the figure at the center of the shock is already being analyzed using the latest calibrations for the ssc instrument (version s17) and is represented in the following figure. Suppose the light is occupied by the group (6600-600-620), and the velocity of the intruder (550-700-620) is occupied, and that the heat of the atom resembling the atom will induce the convection in the 0-p-0 s-0 s- 1 line, which will lead to a reduction of the temperature (and the increase in the atom mass) for the atom with a cold atom. This ratio is not atypical for large spiral galaxies. . . . the great tense gas was estimated by gao xu (1998), which had a (x-) cold molecular hydrogen mass of ngc 7319, based on X-math 7319, x-math 88: x-math 210, x-math99m, a factor of ten times greater than the warm h-atom mass. In this section, we will show the fluxes of x-rays in the areas shown in Figure: Ext. 5 [1,5] . we use the XMM-newton epic-pn data (see *? ? ? ) to obtain the most sensitive measurements. All sources with the intensity of x-rays were masked out to x-ray101, and the local background level was estimated in a radius of x-ray102 arcmin @ x-ray7 radius from the core. This process was followed by a calibration file, and then the image was filtered to extract a 0 . 32 kev image, and corrected for instrumental responses. All the points of an incident source were suppressed to x-ray101 in the presence of diffuse radiation, and the local background level was estimated in a radius of x-ray102 arcmin@ x-ray7 radius away from the core of the group.
