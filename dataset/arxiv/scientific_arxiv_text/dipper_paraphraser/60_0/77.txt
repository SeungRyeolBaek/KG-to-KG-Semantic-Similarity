the superconducting junction qubit is one of the most promising candidates for implementing quantum computations at xcite . This double-quad coherent oscillations of superconducting junctions have been demonstrated by xcite . furthermore, in xcite, suffocating two-quad coherent oscillations and cnot gates have been observable in two-quad coherent oscillations, and these have been successfully demonstrated with spectroscopic measurements of spherical coil currents related to the phase differences of the junctions between the two-quad connected qubits . thus, in xcite, two-quad coherent oscillations and cnot gates were observable by two-quad stable oscillations and spectroscopic measurements were made only for inductively coupled flux qubits. We now propose a scheme for providing both the strong and the weakest potential of the two phase-coupled flux qubits. Our irradiated quasi-conducting concentric qubits have been shown to exhibit a single-quad coherent oscillation and two-quad coupling and entanglements in charge qubits. For the flux qubits the schemes used inductively are used, but they are too weak to perform efficient two-quad gate operations. The coupled qubits of charge qubits are characterized by the induced loop current, resembling the phase- difference across the junctions in the qubit loop. For the coupling of two flux qubits, the mutual inductance of the qubits will be too weak to perform discriminating cnot gate operations @xcite, because the mutual inductance @ xmath1 , and can provide for a correct coupling between two phases, phase-matched flux qubits. The following explanation shows two different dc-squid connections in a connecting loop: dc-squid. dc-squids are connected in the opposite direction, so that when two fluxes are in the same direction, the change of fluxes creates an additional current flowing in the connecting loop, causing a shift of the qubit states as well as a change in the strength of the coupling. The substitution notation dc-squid, dc-squid and dc-squid, in which we introduce two dc-squids, interrupting the connecting loop, as shown in fig. dc-squid. In the pseudo spin language there are four current states of connected qubits, dc-squid 12, dc-squid13, dc-squid14 and dc-squid15, and one of the different current states, dc-squid14, in fig. dc-squid. The phase dc-squid, in fig. , is diamagnetic, and in fig. dc-squid . . . At the right (left) qubit, dimensionless reduced flux is drawn to the left (right) qubit, where, with self-inductance @ xmath26, the induced current @ xmath2 is the induced flux of each qubit, and Xmath27 the current of the connecting qubit, and Xmath28 and Xmath29 are integers. Then, as the external fluxes @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 thread the loops are also in the opposite direction, since they are connected in a twisted way in the scalable design of ref ... but for only two qubits, one can choose the directions of the external fluxes which thread the loops arbitrary. The hamiltonian in the connected qubits can be described by the following: the kinetic part of the hamiltonian is given by the charging energies of the josephson junctions, such as @ xmath41, where @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 are the capacitances of the josephson junctions of the left (right) qubit loop and the connecting loop, respectively. Since the induced flux of the flux of each qubit is so weak as @ xmath36, the large value of @ xmath37 in the phase-coupled qubit can give a strong coupling compared with the inductive coupling. First, we take into account the fact that the two electro-fields, @ xmath6 and @ xmath7, have opposite directions, such that @ xmath82 note that the boundary conditions in eq. (‘switchbc’) already have opposite signs . . . so as to get the effective potential of the pair of co-boques by a function of @ xmath83 and @ xmath84, we express the latter as @ xmath86 by means of the boundary conditions in eq. (‘switchbc’) and the expression in eq. (‘switchbc’) to get the force of the junctions in two-qboine loop and that of the connecting loop, with the force of the junctions @ xmath61 and @ xmath5 . . . if we change the angle of the counter , it will become @ xmath88. It would be the case that the constant induced motions, @ xmath6 and @ xmath7, have opposite inclinations, such that @ xmath82 note that the conditions in eq. (transitionbc) have already obtained the same signs . . . . As the induced energy math55 is negligible, the total effective potential math96 in eq. (uquibit) is given by the sum of the energies in eq. ( uswidiff) , we can get math98 from the remainder of the variable math100 in eq. (math101), math101 when math102 is set. In math104, we obtained the value of math105 at local minima of the same spin states, math112; and math113 the value of math114 at local minima of the same spin states, math115, math115 with math116, thus the energy of the same spin states, math117, is lower than that of different spin states, math119, as shown in Fig. math103, in the form of four local minima, the value of local minima of case ii can be obtained from math104, and we have found that two local minima have the same value, math105, for the same pseudo-spin state, math106. Similarly, we get math107 of case ii from math104, and we have found that two local minima have the same value, math105, for the same pseudo-spin state, math105. . . . so that if we combine this case with the instance of Xmath120, @ Xmath120, @ Xmath70, and @ Xmath102 we can see four stable states, Xmath138 and Xmath15, energies xmath139 and xmath140, as shown in Fig. . . . . ; however, although the above four states are stable states in the xmath141 plane, it can also be unstable in the other dimensions, if they are saddle points. The equations of the phase difference of coupled qubits in several coordinates with Xmath119, Xmath120, Xmath70, and Xmath102, are also in the same direction ... and although these four states are stable in xmath141 plane, they can also be unstable in other dimensions if they are tamed by saddle points. We would like to note that, since the external fluxes @ xmath30 and xmath31 threading the left and right qubits are already in opposite directions, diamagnetic currents of both qubits in xmath12 (xmath13) state are also in opposite directions ... In Fig. 1 the hamiltonian of the coupled qubits is given in Fig. 1 . The first two terms are qubit terms, the second is coupling, and the third two terms are tunnelling, which are terms that rely on the kinetic term of the hamiltonian. Fig. 1 The hamiltonian of the coupled qubits is written in Fig. 1 as Fig. 2 , where Fig. 2 and 3 are the corresponding eqs. 1 and 2 respectively.1 These eqs add up to a function of the number of qubits, of which Fig. 3 shows that the corresponding eqs and potentials of four states of coupled qubits in various coordinates. The first two terms are qubit terms, the third is a coupling term, and the last two terms are tunnelling terms, which result from the quantum fluctuations enumerated by the kinetic term of the hamiltonian .2 We will assume that the resulting eqs and potentials are stable in the xmath146 plane. [Computable] b; the energy in the same state, @ xmath145, is given by @xcite @ xmath156 in fig. [Fig.] . in fig. . . [Fig.] (b) We write the coupling strength @ xmath165 to xmath164, so the strength of a pair of flux qubits increases by varying the control fluxes @ xmath164. Thus, the force of a pair of flux qubits increases by varying the resistance fluxes @ xmath157 threading the dc-squid loop in the connecting loop. When xmath102 is small, xmath155 is of the order of xmath5 so that we can obtain a sufficient and strong coupling . Since the momentum-power curve has recently been tested in practice, using four - josephson junctions instead of three - josephson junctions, the force @ xmath173 is large, so that the value of xmath173 is about xmath174 , thus the experiment has not produced much strength. Xmath2: The joint-knit element is drawn from the equilibrium state of the left and the right side, such that the current of the loop flows in the form of a differential pair of dc-squids, which is equal to xmath2; and if two controlled fluxes are in the same direction, i.e. xmath197, the pair’s synchronization energy, i.e. xmath195, which is the equivalent of the relation of i.e. , the resulting equation (i.e. ) becomes a coupled pair of dc-squids. The maximum of a quadratic cohesion, i.e. xmath195, as a reference, for the coefficient Xmath198, to obtain the weak current in the connecting loop and the residued coupling energies of the two qubits. In the case of two control elements, such as xmath198 and xmath198, the electric coupling energy of the connecting line becomes xmath198. Then if two control elements are in the same direction, that is Xmath198, the electrical coupling energy of the connecting line becomes xmath198 , then the electrical coupling between two qubits becomes zero , so that the magnetic coupling between two qubits is tampered with. You can see the effect of the more effective fluxes _xmath_205 and _xmath_206 on the left and right qubits of the hamiltonian equation _ - *. _hcoup __3_ (bottom panel) for _xmath_204 , you can see that when two controlled fluxes are in the same direction, the energy of the two controlled fluxes _xmath_ and _xmath_7 becomes different, and the value of _xmath_157 increases from zero ____________ . Thus, if two control fluxes ________________________ and ___________ are in the same direction, the energy of the different ______ ____________ in the hamiltonian of eq. __________________ become different from each other, _____________________________________ increases from zero. ______________________ . - the resolving flux of the right dc-squid in the connecting loop is qualitatively the same as that of the right dc-squid in the connecting loop - hence, the behaviors of one dc-squid in the connecting loop are qualitatively the same as those of two dc-squid in the connecting loop - for example, the motion of the right dc-squid becomes in the opposite direction to that of the right dc-squid in the same direction - and thus the two control fluxes are in the same direction, for example, dc-squid in the same direction, and therefore the dc-squid, of the left dc-squid in the connection , both the flux of the left dc-squid in the connection , and the dc-squid in the tunable coupling system, namely, the difference in the two signals in the connection , so that the two signals, in the other hand, are of the same type as each other, and the two structures of the connection are in the same form. The recently published work argues that the dc-squid oscillator is the main source of the decoherence of the coupled qubits in xcite. However, in the tunable coupling scheme of ref..1, there is still the decoherence of two dc-squids in the connection , and therefore two counter-fools threading the dc-squids in opposite directions in order to be able to realize the controllable coupling. “Xmath216” and “an ideality of conservation” [xcite] when we use two dc-squids in the connecting-shaft with threading fluxes in the opposite direction. The result is that a hamiltonian relation can be omitted when two dc-squids are in the same direction, or when one dc-squid is in the opposite direction, then the dc-squids are unable to describe their related qubits. In the following sequence we analytically show that the coupling strength of the phase-coupled-shaft qubits can be adjusted by varying the threading fluxes of @ xmath157 from @ xmath217 to @ xmath192; this can be as strong as o @ xmath218 and zero at the transition-off point. i . chiorescu, y . nakamura, yu. a. pashkin, and j. s. tsai, nature * 398 , 786 (1998) . y . yu, s . han, x . chu, s . chu, and z . wang, science * 304 , 889 (1998) . i . chiorescu, y . nakamura, c . j . p . harmans, and j . sent> , d. v. averin and c. bruder, phys. 91 , 057003 (2004) ; j . b. majer, f . g. paauw, a . . tsai, and j . e m . harmans, and j . e m . mooij, phys. lett. 89 , 057003 ( 2004) ; j . q . you, j . s tsai, and f . nori, phys b b b b b b c . tsai, j . s tsai, and f . nori, phys. lett. a blais , alec maassen van den brink, and a . m . zagoskin, phys. b b b . b . b . f . t . , 115014 (2003) . . . f . g . d. kim, d. shin, and j . hong, phys. rev . . .
