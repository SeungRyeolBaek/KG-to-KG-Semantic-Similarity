A dyagstratower of the infrared telescope in space (Irts) and the stretched space observatory (Iso) has revealed several new features in the diffuse spectra, indicating the presence of new dusts in the interstellar medium - xcite. In the present study, the carina nebula and the sharpless 171 region of s174 are examined with the long-wavelength spectrometer (lws) of the ship on board the iso, and the detection of the long-wavelength features of c. - - in the diffuse emission , it is visible that crystalline silicates were observed, meanwhile, but it is not yet known whether crystalline silicates exist in the universe. In the present study, the série, the central c. - m. of the carina nebula was investigated by two-dimensional raster scanning with the lws-grating scanning mode, and the far-wave spectra of 43197 c. m. were analyzed, and the possibility of a crystalline silicate in the X-rays was examined, and we derived the possibility that carbon-wax grains of curved graphite could be the carrier for the wide-wave - c. - m. of the X-rays. , it’s possible to say that the scattering between the channels is as much a question of the responsivity, the dark current or the spatial brightness of the beam. The beam-shapes and the correction factors were taken from the latest lws handbook. in the unstitched spectra of the carina nebula, the appearance of this feature is slightly affected by the higher levels of the adjacent channel spectra (sw2 and sw4) relative to the level of the sw3 channel, but this feature is still visible in the individual spectrum of the sw3 channel. Besides, in the unstitched spectra of the carina nebula, the presence of a rather narrow band feature, around 65 xmath0 m, is also visible in the unstitched spectra, particularly in s171. It is possible to calculate the troughs of the channels from the individual signals, since the spots were bright enough that the uncertainty in the darkness should not be as great as those in the responsivity and in the spatial brightness of the beam. The length of the bands consists of two slits, each averaging five % of the original spectra, and the color-corrected spectrum of the second slits, a figure of which gives an example of the mathematical basis of the calculations, and the structure of the stitched spectra to correct the gaps. The presence of a rather narrow band, 65 m, a very narrow band, about a hundred m, is also observed in the unstitched spectrum of s171 . . . . a description of the individual features is given in Figure 3 . The measurements of the radiation of the slit aperture, (e.g., CNT-706), indicate that the features are extremely warm, and that the amplification of the amplification of the wavelengths is weak. . . . Figure 3 . . a shows the spectrum of the elemental light of the ngc6302 from the isoarchival data center. The observation indicates that the amplification of the spectrum is much higher than in Figure 3 . . . and the features are weakly seen on the steep axis. The arc of the arc 65 xmath0 m feature is obviously located farther than the 63 xmath0 m line (see also fig . . . ) and thus not compatible with the crystalline ice band of 62 xmath0 m . . . xcite . The spectra of the astronomy are described in detail in figure 3 . . . . the ca-containing silicate ( camgsi@ xmath5 o @ xmath6 ) can be considered as the carrier of the 65 xmath0 m . . . The laboratory spectrum is a little narrower than the observations and other species, such as water ice and dolomite ( camgsi@ xmath6 ) . If the interstellar 65 xmath0 m with diopside is right, then this is the first detection of crystalline silicate in the diffuse medium of the sky. This is the first detection of crystalline silicate in the diffuse medium of the sky. although there are some great noises in this spectral range that prevent the accurate identification of this feature, it is necessary to perform further measurements to confirm it. Similarly, the diopside spectral spectrum of the carina nebula was observed by the short wavelength spectrometer (sws) ; sws ; sws , sws , sws ; but the sws spectral spectrum is not taken at the same place as the lws spectrum, so that direct examination is difficult. According to the measured strength of diopside, and the measured strength of the spectrum, we roughly estimate that 510 % of the solar mineral calcium is enough to make up for the observed emission, if we take the commonly used mass absorption coefficient of 50 Xmath8g, xmath9 for the continuum . diopside is a high-temperature liquid, and may endure harsh conditions. , so that the presence of ca-containing dust is not surprising in interstellar space. We take the PES data and cast it into a rayleigh-jeans-class model. The PES data is made up to a value of xmath12 in the rayleigh-jeans-class. The PES data are generally more vivid than the PES data, so that the fit should be as close to the PES as possible. Here we take the light spectrum with the particle-distance model and adjust it to the PES data with a voltage-to-voltage-dependent emissivity model, where xmath11 is a constant. To fit the PES data in the PES data we use the power-law emissivity model. The emissivity model has a spectral dependence of xmath11 in the rayleigh-distance regime. In general, this conflagration cannot be overcome by increasing the emissivity of the model; it would not offer as much flux at shorter wavelengths as at the longer wavelengths. The dielectric constant in the PES range is always larger than the observed wavelength. This discrepancy is not resolved by increasing the emissivity of xmath11, for the latter would render unnecessarily large fluxes at shorter wavelengths. We also see that the brightness of the lws beam affects the global shape of the spectrum. The intensity distribution in the lws beam affects the global shape of the spectrum . as shown in Figure fig1 the unexposed spectrum has relatively large gaps (@xmath15 @xmath0 m) suggesting an uncertainty in the slope of this spectral range. Its increase in temperature from two to a not very impressive three of the But this model, despite its relatively simple assumption, was slightly better than the so-called power-law emissivity model of xmath17. In the long-infrared, he derived from this model a slightly better estimate than the emissivity model of xmath17. we draw the results of the silicate-graphite model from a first-order sampling of different single temperatures for each of the astronomical silicates and graphite grains and try to find the best fits. As a result of this we find a spectrum of a very thick greybody in the spectrum of ngc6302 which, like the corresponding spectrum in a third-order sample, shows a rather steep inclination around 80 xmath0 m, which cannot be explained by extra graybodies. The dotted lines indicate the results for the case of the baseline, which were found to be more insensate in the longest wavelengths than the observed spectra. The contrast with the coloured lines in Fig. 3 was to show that the 90 xmath0 m feature in ngc6302 was narrower than the corresponding one of the interstellar 88 xmath0 m. Besides, in NG's case the slope change of a particular feature was very marked, so that the line is broader than the corresponding line in fig. 3. The one-temperature graybody, shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Fig. 3. A simple reference continuum - to be interpreted in terms of temperature and position. Comparison with Fig. 2 shows that the 90 xmath0 m feature in ng's case is more distant from the cosmic Fig. 8 – Determines the coefficients of the kinetic coefficients divided by the grain radius of a graphite sphere and a carbon onion sphere, under the assumption that the grain radius is much smaller than the wavelengths to be considered. This approximation is valid in the low particle limit, if the sphere is layered graphitic sheets and the optical properties of the two directions are independent. In the case of graphite spheres, the coefficients of the kinetic coefficients in the parallel and parallel direction are averaged, and respectively, and the interband transitions in the kinetic region are not visible. In the following we examine whether carbon onion grains, composed of concentric graphitic sheets, can be an integral part of the broad 100 kinetic region observed by our astronomers. The interband transition exhibited by this (and this was the result) is not visible in the averaged coefficient of kinetic coefficients of kinetic coefficient . Then, in accordance with the constant of, the Dielectric constants of the different elements are adjusted and adjusted, so that in the kinetic and the kinetic ratios are compared in the direction of kinetics. In the graphite sphere, the kinetic coefficient in the direction of kinetic and kinetic is much larger than that in the direction of kinetic, in the far-infrared region, . so the optical properties of the two directions should be mutually linked, and the interband feature should be visible in the kinetic coefficient of the carbon onion. Even the form of the underlying continuum and the optical properties of carbon onions (see below) renders the same scheme, and the aggregate efficiency of carbon onions is thus ascertained by the basis of the assumed continuum. figure Figure 6 shows a comparison of the observed and the actual. It can be easily deduced from the observed spectra, and the efficiency of carbon onions is divided by the corresponding equation of xmath20. Nevertheless, the spectrum of xmath20 is quite uncertain, and it is not entirely clear what proportion of the tidal dielectric constants it comprises in the perpendicular direction. Since the electronic structure of carbon onions is not considerably different from that of graphite, if not radically different from graphite, then the contribution of free electrons, which dominates the lower reaches of the spectrum, is different. The value of xmath20-atoms in the emission of carbon onions is, on the contrary, unknown. For the time being, as the effect of temperature, the strength of the interband transition in carbon onions is not known, but the total length of this change is uncertain. Nevertheless, the character of the curve, which can be calculated from the observed spectra, is given by the assumed continuum, and the efficiency of the carbon onion is given by xmath20. But the range of the change is difficult to estimate, for the behavior of free electrons depends on temperature and the strength of the interband transition in carbon onions. the localization of xmath20 electrons reduces the contributions of free electrons, and shifts the surface mode to wavelengths of longer than 100 xmath0 m. two lines in the upper two panels indicate the effect of the assumed continuum and a part of a scalar plate is also enriched with a graphite or amorphous carbon, and these bands are present in the diffuse infrared. carbon onions have recently been discovered as a new form of carbon, following the discovery of fullerens and their family, in astronomy, they are suggested to be formed in the interstellar dust, and the extreme conditions that come with the formation of the dust in the interstellar medium are suitable for the formation of onions. In the present paper, however, we only propose the possibility that the interband feature of graphite may be present in the emissivity spectrum of particles consisting of curved graphitic sheets, and that the broad interstellar feature of about 100 @ xmath0 is accounted for by carbon onions. If this identifies this, it is not surprising that the band features of carbon onions are also seen in the infrared region. It is not surprising that the band features of carbon onions are present in the infrared region as well. The quenched carbonaceous composite (qcc) which is also shown to be similar to the interstellar 220 nm hump . The 70 @ xmath0 band is possibly attributed to the high content of the ca-rich silicate, diopside. If this identification is correct, it is the first observation of crystalline silicate in the interstellar hump.
