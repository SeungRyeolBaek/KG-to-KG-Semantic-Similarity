The open connectome project (openconnecto.org) aims to annotate all the features in a 3D volume of neural data, connect these features, and compute a high-resolution wiring diagram of the brain, known as the connectome. This project is aiming to annotate all the features in a 3D volume of neural data, connect these features, and compute a high-resolution wiring diagram of the brain, known as the connectome. The brain data we are working with is color corrected using gradient domain image stitching techniques, in order to adjust the contrast between the slices. axoplasmic reticula are only present in axons, indicating the identity of the surrounding processes and facilitating automatic segmentation. where  w p   p   sum  q        p             hspace  4mm   hspace     hspace  4mm   hspace  4mm  hspace   hspace  4mm       hspace  4mm Sir, the laplacian filter computes the difference between the intensity of a pixel and the intensity of its neighbours. Therefore, by adding a filtered image to the original image, the intensity of the surrounding pixels is higher than the intensity of the center pixel, the intensity of the surrounding pixels is higher, and there is no change in the intensity of constant intensity. . . . so, we use the 3x3 laplacian filter to highlight the edges of dark features, such as axoplasmic reticules. Finally, we verify the accuracy of our annotations through the volume, verifying their correctness, and finding axoplasmic reticules that were missed at first. We implement this by iterating over the filtered image and looking for dark pixels, where a dark pixel is defined as a pixel whose value is less than a certain threshold, a drop in intensity where the average is greater, and no change in the intensity of an axoplasmic reticules. The current algorithm is adapted to detect transversely sliced axoplasmic reticula. It is currently able to detect axoplasmic reticula with 87 % precision and 52 % recall. Moreover, it is possible to adapt the morphological region acquiring algorithm to also find axoplasmic reticula dilated, and to add a more robust tracking system, such as kalman or particle-filtering.
