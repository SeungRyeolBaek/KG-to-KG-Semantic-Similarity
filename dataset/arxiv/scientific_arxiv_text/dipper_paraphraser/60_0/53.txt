If we examine a given sphere, we will find that it has a certain side-splitting edge (stretched uh-h). It has long been known that due to the surface and the mutual focus of a sphere, the colliding waves of the plane are space-like, if we are to take the view of a cone with a relative cross-polarization, a cone with a narrow rim (stretched uh-h) predominates. That means that a cone – in other words, a cone-shaped surface – is more vigorous when the waves are given a relative cross-polarization, at the time of collision. The cone-shaped surface, as a result of a linear perturbation of a cone, is transformed into an essential singularity. a second factor that has proved effective in reducing the strength of a cone-shaped surface in cpw is the electromagnetic field itself. Generally speaking, the angle of the curvature in which a cone-shaped surface is encountered is more profound in a cone-shaped space than in a beam formed by gravity. It has long been known that due to the planarity of the scalars of colliding cpw result in space-like singularities. a cone-shaped solution was given by yurtsever and showed that it is unable to be sufficiently formed in the face of plane-symmetric perturbations. The ch formed in the centre of the cpw region was shown to be removable by a slicing from the null boundary, however, it contains in fact essential curve-scalar singularities that cannot be dissolved by any means. In this connection He has put the issue afresh, in order to examine the aforementioned problem in the form of cpw whose solutions have not yet been tested. For the purpose of this paper we are looking at the space of the sphere: a) the plane wave with its added test fields, and b) the plane wave with its added test fields, whose thermic region in the sphere of the test field is null, are finite, and if the stress energy tensor at xmath4 is finite in all parallel frames of orthonormal (ppon) frames, the ch remains non-singular. This is our main reason for approaching the problem of untested solutions in cpw. Unlike the tedious perturbation analysis of cx and yurtsever, the equilibrium conjecture seems to be very economical in the case of a direct calculation of the stability of a ch. In four-dimensional spacetimes the classification of singularities is divided into three basic categories: quasi-regular (qr), scalar curvature (sc), and non-scalar (nsc) singularities. a) If xmath1 , xmath2 and any null density 3 are finite, and if xmath4 is finite in all parallel plasmon frames, then the ch remains non-sequat. b) if xmath1 , xmath2 and any null density 3 diverges, then xmath4 is non-sequat. The insertion of test-bogey dust into the background space and its exact return temperature are found in Appendix B. a complete generalization of the bs approach to scalarity is given in Appendix B. the results are seen in section v and a discussion of these results is given in section v. the derivation of weyl and maxwell scalars is given in Appendix B. The totality of the scalars is represented in Appendix B. a completely different metric of bs approach to scalarity was given by cx [12]: in the first metric the terms are as follows: @ xmath5: the concept is @ xmath6; xmath6 is constant in the second polarization, xmath8 is constant in the energy, and xmath9 is the usual null coordinates. In a word, the metric describes em waves interacting with scalars [13] = 7 - @ xmath5; in this representation of the metric our terms are - @ xmath6; whereas our notations are - @ xmath6; where xmath5 is a constant, a constant in energy and a constant in xmath9 for the usual zero coordinates. Nevertheless, this solution is a very small extension of the bs metric. We concentrate our attention on the incoming region ii, @xmath21. Our metric is in the form @xmath23. We observe that @xmath24 is a bounded positive definite function, which implies that no additional singularities will occur except those which are already occurring in the bs case, that is, at @xmath26. To investigate their stability we will test geodesics and behaviour of scalar fields by estimating stress-energy tensors in local and ppon frames. For this purpose, we have derived all riemann components in local and ppon frames (see Appendix A) and found that all riemann components vanish as @xmath27. Observe that the metric in this region is expressed in the form @xmath22  [0][4] where [5] we observe that for @xmath24 , [6] is a positivedefinite function, which implies that no additional singularities could arise except those that are already present in the bs case, that is, at xmath26 . . . -       x - 0        - 0      tan   0          0        -       -                                                        left [                        left [p   2    x   0                left     left [    epsilon   4      1 + 3  sqrt The surface of the interaction region is neither scs nor scs, and there is only one scs, math48. The same scs is fixed on the null boundary. math47 we find that math47 is given in terms of math48 by math49 for math50 and math51, otherwise . the equivalence of this quantity predicts the existence of nscs, and therefore qr singularity must be unstable. It may be predicted that, in the incoming region of bs, the qr singularity structure formed in the incoming region of bs remains unchanged in the polarized version of the same problem. As we have said, the interior of the interaction region does not have scs. However, the same scs is not properly indicated by the existence of scs. clarke and hayward have examined these singular points in a collinear bs space and found that the qr singularity of surfaces @xmath52 and @xmath53 is qr. ‘The right–hand side (if a frac  a sec  2 (au) f (v)    8 pi f   2                                   (         left (    sec   2 (  tan    f    2         f                    left )  left (    sec   2  tan   2  f      f    f   2                 left)  left [   a  2 tan   2  (au) f  2             y if we add generic waves, he is certain that qr singularities will be converted to scalar curvature singularities. he explains that the stable qr singularities of the cross-polarized version of bs spacetime will be unstable. This is also the assumption of the stable qr singularities of bs spacetime. The stability of the qr singularities was proved in the previous sections in the cpbs spacetime. . . . , a hypotheses and emphases in the conjecture are stated. Here he gives a graph of the density of the system and the interpolation of the emphases (with a coupling constant of xmath73), where xmath77 and xmath75 are the components of the killing direction. We thus conclude that the curvature singularity formed is an scs. . . . - Let the metric be: xmath70  ] , the new solution is obtained from the electrovacuum solution. – And – e – v – v –  left (i.e., isinh – frac – w –  2 – – sinh – frac – w –  2 –  right) b – v –  left (i.e., if isinh – frac – w –  2 –  right) – a – a – a – a – a – a – – as follows –  –  –  –  – as follows: the penrose spinors for em plane waves, as follows: –  –  – penrose spinors for em plane waves as follows: –  non –  –  – phi – – 0 – – – & –  – u – –  –  – e – – u –  –  –  – – –  –  –  – –  –  –  –  –  – – –  –  –  –  –  – –  – –  –  – e – – – u – –  – –  –  – left ( isinh He said: "Such an indication of the aforementioned scalar is given in the appendix. We illustrate the direct solutions for cpbs scalars. Suppose first, in the background, the first null test dust. For simplicity, we consider two different examples, the @xmath98 and the @xmath99 projections of spacetime. Here, we can use the coordinates at xmath100 according to xmath102, the energy-assor tensor for two oppositely moving null dusts can be chosen, according to the equation xmath103, where the xmath104 and xmath105 are the finite energy densities of the dust. The trace of the energy-assistence is obvious, so we have to extract information from the scalar @ xmath115. In the first case, the metric @ xmath115, which reduces our line element to the bs, diverges on the horizon @ xmath115. This result is in complete agreement with the stability conjecture. ‘With these numbers the corresponding components of the energy and momentum tensors are also calculated and they all correspond to the expression (42). Consequently, the components of the energy and momentum tensors diverge as the singularity approaches. Hence the totality of the metric for cpbs and collisions is a singular one, as the conjecture dictates. We have, therefore, here an exact metric for two null shells that occurs in the interaction region of cpbs. the interaction region is transformed into the space of de sitters, in other words the tail of two null shells is energetically equivalent to de sitter space. This metric is expressed by the variable ratio @xmath130, where @xmath132 is the metric function of the cpbs solution. in this way the scalar curvature, which was zero in the case of cpbs, becomes nonzero, and diverges as we approach the horizon. The equation @xmath136 is also defined by the substitutions @xmath131, where @xmath132 corresponds to the metric functions of the cpbs solution. Thus, the solution of the cpbs and cpbs is a singular solution. This is also shown by the fact that the choice of the conformal factor @xmath131, with @xmath129 positive constants, becomes isomorphic to the anti-cpbs space. sent> waves creates an unstable horizon in the de sitter space, which is otherwise regular for @ xmath137 and @ xmath138. In this paper we have examined the stability of qr singularities in the cpbs space. Three test fields are used to probe the stability. The first test is em field, which we have tested on the background cpbs space. In our study we found that the qr singularity in the incoming region becomes unstable according to the conjecture, and transforms into nsc singularity. however, the exact reaction guarantees that beside the true singularity on the null boundary of xmath139 and xmath140 there are quasiregular singularities. as he observed in the case of colliding em waves, the conjecture is not correct, and so the qr singularity is transformed into a scs. However, the exact reaction solution for the qr singularity is unstable and transforms into a scs. This is the assumption of the conjecture. In this paper, we have analyzed the stability of qr singularities in the cpbs spacetime. We examined the weyl and maxwell scalars, and observed that the Xmath142 and Xmath143 disintegrate when the singularity is approached, and the scalar as a parameter is not changed. In the scalar, the two em scalars differ in terms of angle and length, and the contrast between the em scalar and the em scalar, the result of which is: the qr singular At xmath144 the tensors of the Riemann tensors are found in the region ii.
