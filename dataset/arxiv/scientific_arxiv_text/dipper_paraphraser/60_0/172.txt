The recently unconventional electronic properties of monocrystalline graphene have attracting great attention, despite the fact that they were not studied theoretically before the fabrication. The structure of monocrystalline graphene is quite different from conventional metals, because the conduction and valence bands touch at xmath1 and xmath2 points in the brillouin zone, around which the dispersion becomes linear like a relativistic particle. In multi-layer graphenes, the interlayer coupling makes a complex structure around the Xmath 4 of the band. The electronic properties of graphene bilayer were studied theoretically, for the Xmath3 of the band, and the transport properties of the film. In this paper we present a theoretical study on the orbital magnetism in multi-layer graphenes. In the research side, the band structures of graphenes from one to four layers were measured recently using a local and sharp X-ray spectra. The electrons of the monolayer graphene were first studied in monolayers as a simple model to explain the great diamagnetism of graphite. This study was found to be extremely diamagnetic at xmath4 (band touching point), although the density of states vanished in that place. " We analyse the dependence of the susceptibility of a single layer on the number of layers. Then we introduce the model hamiltonian and its subsystems in sec. [cfr.] [cfr.] We present the calculations of the magnetic properties in sec. [cfr.] we give the abscissa of the system. (a) - we divide the atoms of carbon into two groups, as the atoms of group i are arranged along vertical columns normal to the plane of the sphere, and the atoms of group ii are above or below the center of hexagons in the adjacent layers. The total volume of the system contains at least @xmath6 and @xmath7 atoms on the layer @xmath8 a cell is occupied by @xmath6 and @xmath7 atoms on the layer @xmath8 a unit cell contains @xmath6 and @xmath7 atoms on the layer @xmath8 . let Xmath13 and Xmath14 be the k and p functions at the xmath1 point, and let Xmath15 and Xmath16 be the sublattices at the xmath17 point , respectively , of layer @xmath17 . And between the atoms of group ii in adjacent layers (at xmath28) and these, which are estimated to be @ xmath29 ev , @ xcite and @ xmath30 ev . Next, we arrange the basis in the order of group i, and then in the order of group i, i.e., @ xmath19, @ xmath49, @ xmath50, @ xmath41, the effective hamiltonian for the multilayer graphene around the point @ xmath1 becomes @ xmath43, the effective hamiltonian for the multilayer graphene around the point @ xmath1 becomes @ xmath43, with @ xmath41, if we look at the interaction between layers 1 and 2 the matrix element @ xmath31 corresponds to the vertical bond and the matrix element @ xmath31 corresponding to the vertical bond is @ xmath25, and the effective hamiltonian for the point at xmath2 is obtained by exchanging @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 and replacing @ xmath25 with @ xmath47 . –send> the nearest-neigh coupling with -math51 is given, giving a set of eigenenergies @ xmath51 with -math62. Here -math63 is an odd integer when the layer number -math5 is even, and -math63 is even when -math5 is odd, and therefore -math64 is only allowed for odd -math5 . -math72 to the atoms of group i and ii as -math72, and attempt to rewrite the Hamiltonian ([-h] ) . . .  Non-umber  !       !      !        !  !     ! You can read it in the table. For Xmath82, the basis is written as Xmath82, where Xmath82 is taken without loss of generality. We take Xmath82 and Xmath82 as the basis, and we take Xmath84. For Xmath86, we multiply Xmath84 by Xmath89. This is equivalent to the hamiltonian of the bilayer graphene, except that @xmath25 and xmath87 are multiplied by xmath89. We have introduced many parameters for the description of the band structure of graphite. The parameter @xmath92 pairs atoms of group i and ii on top of each other layer, such as in case of double layer graphenes. Such a theory was also proposed for trilayer graphene, without xmath26, where it was found that the energy spectrum was superposed to that of monolayer and of bilayer. At xcite the parameter @xmath92 couples group i and ii atoms with one another on the layers next to each other, such as in the case of a stacked layer. ‘The ratio of the index @xmath63 and the index @xmath100 is derived from comparing the eigenenergy of @xmath60, eq. ” [1d] to that of the 3d limit, @xmath101, which, for the dielectric effect, @ xmath102, can be obtained by replacing @xmath25 with @xmath103, and by replacing @xmath25 with @xmath104 in the bilayer. – In fig. “Impossible” corresponds to the maximum amount of trigonal warping. The eigenstate with @xmath103 becomes a superposition of opposite-moving waves, @xmath99, along the stumbling course. (Heavenly panel shows zoom out to the left.) The middle two subbands stick together at @xmath106, while the remaining two bands appear only at the energy range of @xmath107. @xcite (above) we plot in Fig. (Fig. 1) the dispersion of @xmath105 which has the highest trigonal warping. Four fermi points at @xmath4 are indicated by dots . [0] As a rule, the energy of a few layered graphenes is calculated by the density functional model, the tight-binding model, as follows: the aggregates of xmath124 are given as xmath125, while we have included xmath23, xmath25, xmath26 in our graphene model, the additional parameter which has been neglected here may cause some changes in the electronic structure. figure xmath123 shows the distribution of the energies around the xmath1 point in the matrix of xmath124 in the multilayer graphenes with xmath122, 3 and 4 and xmath123, respectively. The maximum of xmath89 becomes equal to xmath120 mev. the maximum of xmath89 is more than 2 as the layer number increases, so that xmath118 becomes the size of xmath120 mev. these results are, mainly, very different from ours, in that the center of the band centre shifts somewhat according to xmath63, and that a narrow gap opens between the conduction and valence bands (with a single xmath63) and the other bands (with different xmath63) touch, and that different bands (with different xmath63) cross. These losses are attributed to couplings such as xmath95, xmath96, and xmath97, which have been mentioned above. Xmath123, Xmath129, Xmath129 , Xmath130 , where Xmath131 is valley-degeneracy, Xmath132 is spin-degeneracy, and Xmath133 is the size of the system. The implication of the mathematical formula valid for the hamiltonian ( [eq] bilayer low energy) is described in appendix - Appendix - Appendix b. by combining by parts in the chi - , we have          -  - 1  ] , we have   -  - 1  - 1   ] , we make         -    ,     - 1 ,    - - ,  - --1  , width -   ,   - 1 X-cite, with respect to x-cite, is given by x-cite with respect to x-math151, whereas x-cite is the step function defined by x-cite. In the presence of disorder, the delta-function is widened into a lorentzian with a width of x-math149 and the same area, x-cite, within the present model assuming a constant x-math150 . the shape of the peak depends on the model disorder, and may be in some other way widened in a more realistic form . . . in multi-layer cases, the effects of disorder are more complicated, because of the presence of other bands. This problem is out of the scope of this study. In the case of a bilayer graphene, the hamiltonian, as shown by a linear hamiltonian ([eq ], hm] , was analytically calculated for the case of xmath154 . , if the mixture of xmath 149 and xmath 156 were conceived, it was shown in a self-contained, born approximation that xcite had a much sharper peak at xmath151 than the lorentzian, and also a very large tail proportional to xmath153 for xmath153. The general effect of xcite on the phmian (eq. hm) is calculated by the hamiltonian (eq. hm): if there is a disorder, the delta-function is broadened into a lorentzian with , width = 315] The results of the mathematical calculation show that, except for the trigonal warping, @ xmath164, the low energy structure of the elasticity ([eq chi ]) is greatly altered by the fine structure of the elasticity around the ring , it is also analyzed numerically in the multilayer graphene with @ xmath169, @ xmath123, and several disorder strengths @ xmath149 . , for example, we also calculate the result without the trigonal warping, @ xmath164, by means of the slanted curve , [ Figure ] , shown the curve of @ xmath166, where the absorption is less than @ xmath166 , and a sharp inclination of @ xmath172 , a slanted curve (for reference, a slanted curve is shown) in the multilayer graphene with xmath166, Xmath123, xmath123 and several disorder-powers @ xmath149 , and for the hamiltonian (eq hm) we will show the finite behavior of the electrostatic apex (eq hm), in the case of maximum trigonal warping, @ xmath164. Moreover, the weak peak centered on xmath4 is taken to be a consequence of the linear dispersions around zero energy . Fig. - chi - multi-layer graphenes have been studied for the intercalation of graphite in graphite . . . in the isolated multi-layer graphenes that have been constructed recently, we can have some variation in the condition of the layer, which we can also adjust by the external electric field, as has been mentioned . . . a bilayer subband is formed by a central trigonal warping and a logarithmic tail in the high energy direction, as follows Fig. . . for Fig. . . in Fig. . . . we can see that the graphenes of odd layered graphenes exhibit a particularly large peak, which is mainly derived from the bilayer subband. A bilayer subband, in the form of a bilayer, contains a central peak through trigonal warping and a logarithmic tail in the high energy, as follows in Fig. . . . . . the result of odd t-shaped layered graphenes is always to be found with a monolayer-like component, exactly the same as x-math176, and thus omitted in the inset. The insets of odd t-math5 always contain a monolayer-like component, exactly the same as x-math176 and thus omitted in the insets. In the bilayer-like components of a matrix, the ratio of the landau levels of the central pocket is approximately to become x-math177. In addition, if the potential is not too strong to change the whole band structure, When @xmath164 and @xmath123 are compared, and therefore the singularity is not too small compared with the monolayer. , he is divided into the three subbands of a lorentzian, width @xmath149, and the area of the delta function (eq chi - fine) as long as @xmath185. . . . we have a hamiltonian named Xmath188, which contains only the terms of the linear group in Xmath121 and Xmath126. This can be shown by dividing the energy and the number by anarbitrary factor, then the hamiltonian becomes formally identical in this case, since the coefficients of the linear group in the hamiltonian remain unchanged. The function Xmath141 is linked to the Delta Function in Monolayer of graphene. In Xmath189, the factor Xmath199 is defined by the equations of (eq chi) and eq f (eq f) , the function Xmath199 must depend on the quatrain in xmath196. This can be shown by a scaling-shape. We consider a hamiltonian of xmath188, which contains only the terms linear in xmath121 and xmath126. Second form. . . . if a person has ‘chi’, he will get the equation as ‘chi’, he would, in fact, be real. In the present system, he would give the integral of ‘chi’, ‘’-doing it at once. Nevertheless, it can be proved in the effectiveness of the equation that the integral of a susceptibility over ‘xmath165’ is independent of all matrix elements without ‘xmath148’ and ‘xmath148’, which are responsible for the inter-dependence of the xmath165 equation. So it may be thought that the gap would reduce the diamagnetic diamagnetism at the point of its touching.’ There was a point about the external electric field that caused the gap to be widening. (It was also pointed out that the electric field along the stacked axis would open up an energy gap. We can see this by substituting ‘xmath199’ for ‘xmath199’, which is real. ‘ We have to start from the landau-level equivalences. In our model (the eq. h) the value is mainly determined by the dominant parameter xmath207 , whereas xmath26 imposes a correction in a more than half of the order of xmath203. Hence the integral of xmath216 in the hamiltonian is almost twice as large as the monolayer s, and the sum of all the subsystems of xmath5-layered graphene is approximately xmath5 times as large as the monolayer s. In our holologous (iq h) we use the equation xmath207,  long                                                                                      ! “#221 is the thermodynamic potential of a monolayer of graphene. ” (A)    rm v  g  rm  rm s   rm s   gamma  2  over 12  pi l  4   int               int           int    int      int        lim  delta        lim   delta     lim    delta   right arrow –      lim   delta   lim   delta       lim   delta      lim   delta    lim  lim  delta      lim   lim   delta ‘  rms s  over 2 pi l  2  1  24 (hbar  omega  b)  2 int          over 2      int    , , int      int   end -         int    end  aligned       ,  and      int    end                           int    ,     (   ,           int    end  aligned           end  acverted       int    ,  , ,  ,  , ,   , if we are comparing the magnetization of two-dimensional electron systems with a quantum interference device (squid) @ xcite, we will prove that the detection of graphene magnetism is also possible with such tools. xcite, the hamiltonian equation ([eq]: bilayer - low energy]) has such terms proportional to @ xmath243, we have the formula for the triennial ([eq chi ]] with the [eq f] ( which is not valid any longer, for it was derived originally from the systems in which @ xmath245 and @ xmath247 had an adjoining constant of @ xmath243, and in a single instance we have the hamiltonian ([eq chi ]] with [eq f] as the formula ([eq chi ] is, however, not to be modified, since the hamiltonian ([eq chi]] containing terms which correspond to @ xmath243, which converges with @ xmath244 and @ xmath243, and we have shown that the hamiltonian and hence the chariot are only those which correspond to the monolayer or to the bilayer bands , and so the chariot is always a monolayer or a bilayer band. This also leads to a logarithmic dependence of @ xmath141 on the fermi energy, which coincides with ([eq chi] bi , whereas So in a difcult-based model, the wave function is written as xmath251: Xmath255,  xmath253 is the wave function of the orbit of a carbon atom at its origin, as a function of three-dimensional position Xmath255.   gamma 0  hspace  0 mm  –  gamma 0   l) –  hspace  0 mm  –  gamma 0  l – & -  gamma 0  l –   hspace  0 mm  +  gamma 0  sum  l – – the following is only an extension of the monolayer case. –  xcite in a close-fitting model, – where xmath25 is the layer index, – xmath253 is the wave function of the orbital of a carbon atom located at the origin, as a function of three-dimensional position – xmath255 . –  mbox  boldmath – rho –   b – j – –  gamma – At xmath266 we set a boundary between the b and the nearest neighbouring a points by the formula: xmath266 (in xmath264 we use xmath264) and we set xmath264 as a boundary between xmath266 and xmath264.  label  eq  hspace       - [ psi  a  j -                        (  mbox    boldmath $  rho $    b  j   -   mbox   boldmath $  tau (  mbox   boldmath $  rho $   )  gamma k   (  mbox   boldmath $  rho $   )  gamma k   left [f  a  j - 1   (  mbox                   )         left [f  a  j - 1 — we will have the thermodynamic equation @ xmath 206, where @ xmath 288 is the vector potential and @ xmath290 is the vector potential , we consider an isotropic system and assume the vector potential _xmath294 , & _xmath295 , where @ xmath 295 is the long wavelength limit, for which the field is as different as that which is due to a spatially uniform magnetic field.
