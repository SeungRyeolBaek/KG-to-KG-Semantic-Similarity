They have recently been extended to cosmologically interesting distances in the deep field (Df) surveys, which have reached a depth of 1 ms ( Hornschemeier et al. 2001b, hereafter paper v; Cdf s: tozzi et al. 2001b; p. rosati et al., in prep.) normal galaxies probably represent the most numerous extragalactic x-rays. Normal galaxies contribute 510 % of the x-ray flux in the 0 k band. In the x-ray surveys of pretty normal galaxies, with high rays, which obviously do not clearly correspond to the active galactic nucleus (agn), are increasingly being carried out to cosmologically interesting distances. The deep field (cdf) survey, now reaching 1 ms, is almost two orders of magnitude fainter, detecting substantial numbers of normal galaxies among the population of x-ray sources, making the diffuse x-ray background (xrb; xrb; paper ii; a . . . barger et al., in prep.) . . . galaxies with xmath8 are detected in large numbers at 0 kev fluxes, erg @ xmath6 erg @ xmath6 erg @ xmath7 (erg@ xmath6 , ii; p . rosati et al. Hence, it is anticipated that the x-ray luminosity per unit of x-math2 - band luminosity will be larger in the past, as a result of the increase in energy output of x-ray binary population in x-math203. The results of this study suggest that measurements of the x-ray luminosity of the average galaxies in the hubble-dark area (‘the deep field of north’) of the Nicolai (brochure, 1, 2, 2) epoch. Nevertheless, as the rays emitted by individual galaxies are not easily detectable at x-math21, it is possible to estimate the rays at extremely faint flux levels using statistical methods, such as stacking, which have been successfully tested on the cdf-n sample of several previous studies. Moreover, the X-ray luminosity of typical galaxies is not easily detected at x-math21, but it is possible to estimate the emission at very dark flux levels by statistical methods, such as stacking, which has been successfully tested on the cdf-n cdf-n data in several previous studies. These are the studies of normal galaxies in the plus-feet region, now focusing on galaxies at x-math25 to supplement the study of galaxies at x-math26. , you know, the absolute flux of stars in a galaxy is proportional to the width of the starfield (e.g., david, jones, & forman 1992; shapley et al. ). Observable redshifts of galaxies are drawn from the catalogs of cohen et al. (2000, cohen et al.) and from dawson et al. (2001) for the redshift interval xmath32. The spectral redshifts in the range xmath32 are given in barger. Xmath33 is the lowest xmath33. spectral redshifts in the range xmath32 are hard to find because of the absence of any strong features in the observed - frame optical band and the lack of the lyman break feature useful for detecting higher redshift objects. For the spectral redshifts, the xmath33 magnitude was used to filter the sources by optical lightness, because it is the best fit for xmath33 over most of the redshift range we are concerned with. We refer to these two samples as the spectral sample and the photometric sample throughout this letter. For the spectral sample, the xmath33 magnitude was used to filter the sources by optical light, as it is best matched to the xmath2 value of the light. , we have, to simplify the morphological filtering, confined the galaxies in the catalogue of van den Bergh et al. (2001) to the four classes: (i) e-s0 and e-s0, (ii) merger, (3ii) sa-sc, which includes proto-scales and irregulars, and (4ii) irr, a peculiarity and a tadpole . compares of the sources shows that, within the area surveyed by the two methods, more than 70 % of the galaxies identified by the two methods are in common. Since the evolution of x-ray properties with redshift is of interest, we have been trying to study objects with similar x-ray luminosities at different redshifts. , since we are interested in the evolution of x-ray properties with redshift, we have made an effort to study objects of similar optical luminosities at different redshifts. For this reason, we have used the spectral-energy distribution (sequential) classifications of Fernndez-soto et al. (2001) for galaxies of the type e-. , which is known in the area occupied by the two methods, about 80% of the galaxies of the two methods are in common. The numbers of galaxies, the median redshift, the median inclination, and the median optical flux for each bin are listed in table 1. These calculations were performed by the same technique used by poggianti et al. (1997) to calculate the * xmath33 and * xmath42 for a sed in the spectroscopic domain. These galaxies were then classified by optical flux into several bins; these bins were constructed so that there were  xmath42 galaxies in each bin. The table of objects in the sed diagram is also indicated by the color that indicates the different redshift bins. The sed above shows 151 galaxies in the spectroscopic domain with spiral or merger morphology, and 651 galaxies in the photometric domain with sed class other than e [ ]. This exclusion zone is very strict and prevents our measurements from being degraded by the wings of the psf wing of the psf of very bright x-ray sources. Moreover, this exclusion criterion is very strict, as these galaxies meet the optical morphological and the optical filtering, and are rejected only in case of x-ray detection. This exclusion criterion is very narrow and too broad. In figure 1, we show all the objects in the sc sed sample marked with color, indicating the different redshifts. We also compute the number of galaxies that have an x-ray detection in the next circle in table 1; the x-ray images at each position were stacked in the same manner as in paper vii, keeping in mind the 30 pixels with their centers in the margins of an aperture 15 . . . the number of galaxies detected in the next circle in the same way as on paper vii. we stacked galaxies in the second circle, according to the table of tables and the figure of tables, found significant detections in the second circle in the third circle (see table 2 ) , although the test results for the two spiral galaxies were nearly identical, except for the first (at Xmath 50) in the highest circle (at Xmath 50) . the flux of the first circle in the second circle, as for the first circle, was equal to zero. Assuming the ratio of effective area and background in the three regions of the power spectrum was increased by energy, the signal-to-noise ratio for sources with the assumed spectrum is higher in the soft and in the hard, and so it is expected that this has occurred. We thus give the number of galaxies with a x-ray detection within 15 in Table 1. The x-ray imaging of the x-ray images of each position was stacked in the same way as in Table vii, without a source dominating the distribution, demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection criteria. We have looked into the properties of the sources that have been rejected from the stacking samples by the X-ray detection near the position of the galaxy (the number of such sources is given in the last column of table 1) . we have also taken into account the values of the less significant detections in the full band, for those redshifts which have highly significant soft-band detections. We have studied the properties of the sources which were rejected from the stacking samples by an x-ray detection at or near the position of the galaxy (the numbers of such sources are given in the last column of table 1) . Among the 15 sources, three are of a broad-line nature, which are clearly not normal galaxies . . . a very close object, strongly identified with a narrow-line agn, is most certainly not normal . One object has a photometric redshift which is considerably different from its spectral redshift, i.e. , since the optical properties of this object at its spectral redshift place it outside our sample boundary, we have rejected it. The x-ray-emitted galaxy set may include some lower-emission agns, i.e., the agn candidate (see papers iii and v) . So there are, in fact, about 10 normal galaxies positively identified with x-ray sources, in a sample, a small minority of the galaxies under study here. Figure [SBM] shows the histogram of the x-ray-emitted galaxy, with the median figure of x-math55 . eg., where the x-ray to optical ratio of x-math59 is calculated for the whole frame 0 , in brackets 0 . 52 kev band . . . In the figure [lxlb] a we plot the x-ray to optical ratio of x-math59 for each stacked detection, where x-math13 is calculated for the rest of the frame 0 . . . ”—we also plot the sensitivity of our detection in figure [lxlb] a, which is simply the corresponding x-ray luminosity detection limit obtained for a 30 ms stacked analysis divided by x-math61. The difference between the two populations is significant at 93 % as determined by the fisher exact probability test for two independent samples (see siegel & castellan 1988). The galaxies in the sample of shapley et al. (2001) include a total of 234 spiral galaxies, whose x-ray emission is clearly dominated by the nucleus . . . The galaxies in shapley et al.’s sample all have x-math59, their average redshift is x-math64. The results become somewhat sensitive to the sed that we assume for the determination of optical properties. By taking this sed, we find that xmath69 is slightly more prominent (@xmath70 times) at xmath50. However, the xmath74 xmath14 is quite different (by an order of magnitude) from the xmath72 xmath72 value. Our sample, with the same range of xmath65 as used in this study, has a xmath72 yrs. higher (@xmath72 times) , which grows to @xmath73 yrs. , because the average xmath72 luminosity of the spiral galaxy in the shapley et al. (2005) sample is xmath72 yrs. higher (thus @xmath73 times higher) at xmath74 . The obtained average height of the zeta, to xmath73, in a ratio of 0.2 to 0.25. For a zeta, the brightest object would be sufficiently bright to be detected with acis exposures of the xma.6 over the zeta. Many of these objects would be sufficiently bright to be able to be detected with acis exposures of xmath86 ms, which would be achievable within a few years of the study. ccc thanks alice shapley for helpful discussions and for sharing information.

That's all, and it's not the end of the world. What it says is that if you haven't, you will fail and the day will come; you will die, and that's the end of the matter; you'll die.
