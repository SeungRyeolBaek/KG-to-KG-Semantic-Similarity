Then assume, at xmath9, a gas of fixed density, constant in density, xmath10, is brought to the contact of a spherical absorber of radius xmath0, of xmath3 dimensions. At xmath14, and the probability of a particle not to hit the absorber until xmath2 is examined, the process is characterized by the diffusion equation, [i.e., label difeq  difeq   ], where difeq  difeq    ][15] , , , , , , [19] , -[19] , - -[20] , -[23][24] the best possible history of the gas, predicated by the non-falling until time xmath1 , -[27] what is the most likely history of the density of the gas at the time of non-falling until time xmath2 ? Moreover, the study of the diffusion of gas in the simplest case, in which the searchers are random walkers (rws) - the simple case, where the searchers are random walkers (rws) - and in this case , , , , - , - - , - , - - , - , - - , - , - - , - , - - At first, we will consider a lattice gas of a kind that - in the interdependence of searchers - has an inverse exclusion – the ssep – in which a particle is able to hop into another ssep site if that ssep site is not filled by another ssep, then the move is forbidden – we will also discuss the ssep in a third way. Generally speaking, the ssep and ssep are similar in structure, but the time-asymptotic of the target survival probability (*) is different from that of the rws: this expression has the same structure as eq. * * * *, but it increases much faster with the density of the gas, – see the table - arcsinsquared. The target survival problem is a special case of the general problem of quantifying the complete statistics of the absorption by the sorber by the sorber . This problem has recently been studied in ref. - xcite. The eq. * * * is independent of xmath0 and the parameter xmath6 is irrelevant . * Thus, eq. * * becomes valid as soon as xmath2 is much larger than the inverse microscopic hopping rate. However, as we show here, the long-term asymptotic of the target survival probability of xmath1 is different from the rws: xmath2 the expression has the same structure as eq. * (SurvivalDecay3), but it is much faster for the density of It is precisely this v-shape that determines the main term (perth) of the survival probability. In the following section, we will illustrate how the two basic one-dimensional solutions, annealed and quenched, serve as the central solution in higher dimensions when we are interested in the intermediate asymptotics of @ xmath1 for @ xmath26, that is, when the diffusion coefficient @ xmath22 is much longer than the lattice constant, but much shorter than the depth @ xmath0. In the next section, we will explain the mft formulation of the target survival problem, and how we can apply it to a whole class of interacting, diffusive gases. For the rws, the results for @ xmath7 are, for most of them, almost stationary: @ xmath27, ,, where the radial coordinate is rescaled by the density of @ xmath22 . this density profile is the dominant term (Act result) of the survival probability. Finally, we extend our analysis to another class of additional interacting gases . 1 to a number of other interacting gases. In our extension, we extend our results for 9 to a broader class of interacting gases. Here, in the second subsection, we enumerate the mft, referring the reader to the above references for further details. the macroscopic fluctuation theory (mft) was developed to study non-equilibrium states of lattice gases. subsequently, the mft was extended to a host of non-equilibrium conditions. 92cdot  right [ sqrt  sigma (n)   , text  eta [1] ,  eta [2]] (a mathbf  x , t) ,  eta ,  [2] ][3]  eta ,  eta ,  eta ,  ,   ,  ][4] , [6][7][7] and the sub-mft is inverted to the right and to the left [8], where xmath35 is the zero-average gaussian noise, delta correlated in space and time xcite . [9]The macroscopic fluctuations theory, adapted to a wide class of interacting gases . . . Strictly speaking, the hamilton equations are in a common form and can be written in terms of variational derivatives. In a common sense, the spatial integration in eq. ( hamilton) is performed over all the space outside the target. This is a deterministic, or quenched, initial condition, see ref. . . . the horizontal boundary conditions are at @xmath39, and in the following sections - for the blunder - at @xmath42. . . . - d (q)  nabla  2 p - frac  1  2   ,  frac  1  2  ,  sigma    prime  (q)  nabla p - p -  frac     frac  1     2  ,  sigma       frac   1  2    ,  sigma            , ‘All things equal,’ is to say, to say, to say ‘all things equal’. In the case of ‘all things equal’ (with respect to ‘all things equal’), we need ‘all things equal’ (with respect to ‘all things equal’). ‘All things equal’ in this case is the total flux from the target to the target – at all times, including the days. In this case, we are dealing with ‘all things equal’ (both number and pt), we are to give ‘all things equal’ (all things equal) ‘all things equal’. In the case of ‘all things equal’ (all things equal) ‘all things equal’ (all things equal) ‘all things equal’ we are going to demand ‘all things equal’ (all things equal) ‘all things equal’ – for ‘all things equal’ we mean ‘all things equal’. . . . And so when @ xmath77, the leading order contribution to the action @ xmath80 ([actionmain]) is the permanent solution of the mft equations, which obeys the boundary conditions in space, but not the boundary conditions in time. Hence @ xmath77, and from eq. [sed] ([delta]) – a (d] – a (d) – a  (d] – a, a       , a  d – 1   , a                   d   – a     –                  –                      –        –       –              –               – embed  q3   v (r) ,  frac  2  ell  arcsin  sqrt  n  0   r  2  sin  left [2  left (1 - frac  ell  r    r  r   right)  arcsin  sqrt  n  0   right] . , and the divergence of the asymptotic of X-99 in X-100 is quadratic in X-100. Further, each of the two terms of flux, see eq. (ZEROFLOCK) vanishes separately. As it turns out, these features, including the asymptotic of X-104 (also called vdiverge) are universal: they are seen for X-104 in the quenched and annealed settings and in all dimensions (except @ x-math17, where the solution is not stationary) for all lattice gases that behave as non-interacting rws at low density. , as we will see in sec. [nostat], the situation for the xmath17 is altered, and it is changed for any xmath3 if it is xmath 34 . . . as we shall see in sec. [nostat] the situation for the xmath17 changes, and for any xmath3 when it is xmath34 . The figure _3dthnum_ shows the density history obtained from the full numerical solution of the mft problem for the xmath6 and xmath31 . . . the solution for qd and vd , or qdrw and vdrw, has not satisfied the boundary conditions in time. These boundary conditions are not so great as to be satisfied in time. As a result of this, the full time-dependent solution of the mft problem has to develop very narrow boundary layers in time at xmath9 and xmath113, cf. these boundary layers only contribute to xmath114 . if the line is of the second dimension, the absorption is measured at a deterministic rate, and the deterministic rate is, for any at a deterministic rate, deterministic in every respect. The assumption of a cutoff, on the other hand, of a third dimension, of the second dimension, is that it is the equivalent of the characteristic diffusion distance a deterministic theory of absorption. Then, for the third dimension, it is of the order of the characteristic diffusion length a deterministic one, where the deterministic solution inevitably diverges into the time-dependent one. The relative uncertainty of the cutoff affects only the reasoning of the logarithm. Thus, for the third dimension, eq. ( action2) reduces to eq. ( survival decay2) with the same logarithmic accuracy. . . . so, for Xmath123, eq. ( action2) reduces to eq. ( q2] and v2 are correct with logarithmic accuracy. The same is true for the second dimension, for Xmath26 the deterministic theory of dispersive absorption is non-stationary. We will take a one-sided problem and set the wall at Xmath127, so that Xmath130 will be xmath127. Taking Xmath 115 and Xmath 136 as the base, we obtain Xmath137, where the subscript in Xmath 138 corresponds to Xmath17 . . . to ensure that the reader has an underlying condition of xmath129, namely, a hydra density ( a hydra density), which becomes Xmath125 , and in most of the subsequent chapter on hydra and hydra, we put Xmath 126. based on these results, we compute the next-order correction in hydra . . . . , in the limits of hydra, we can drop hydra in the hydra density ( ham) and the corresponding terms in the mft equations, reaching the hydra model. – For example, @ hydra is the hydra solution. The lower panel shows a density void forming. To the right of the density void is a very small p-point, and the dynamics are basically governed by the deterministic equation ([difeq]) and corresponds to the equidiment of the gas. . . . at xmath113, we get xmath155, and as you can see, xmath155 behaves linearly in xmath131, at xmath131. At xmath155, however, xmath156 behaves quadratic at xmath131, as compared with the stationary solution derived above. this asymptotic already holds at xmath12. . . . the inverse (qrw) of the diffusion equation (qt) is obtained at xmath9 . It can be obtained from the same, exact mathematical interpretation of the first class of perturbation, when the particles are randomly distributed in space, see ref. @xcite, sec. . [ Appendix 1], then the coefficient @ xmath174, however, is different from the coefficient @ xmath171 obtained for the random initial condition ( ref. @ xcite, sec. . annealed) and appendix . We can then derive a little correction @ xmath172 from the action ([ actionrw2], by treating the term @ xmath173 of the hamiltonian ([ w]) hamiltonian ([w] ) ... We can compute a little correction @ xmath172 to the action ([1dquenched]) by treating the term @ xmath173 of the hamiltonian [w] hamiltonian [v] ... the axis of the final density ([qt]) can also be calculated from the metrical ...

The mathematical solution obtained for small and moderately large @xmath10 has shown an excellent agreement with the universal asymptote ( [signal3] ) , at small and moderately large @xmath13, the density history of the system is similar to that of rws, with a rapidly forming density void accompanied by a density peak. The density peak is lower than for rws, and it becomes progressively lower and wider as @xmath10 approaches xmath108. Figure ssepnum shows the numerical solution for the deterministic initial condition and @ xmath17 . a spherically symmetric three-dimensional version of the iteration algorithm was used to verify the fixed solution for xmath31, as shown in sec. . . . the numerical solution becomes prohibitive at xmath10 very close to 1 . The data available indicate the Xmath192 divergence between xmath192 and xmath192. The cost of the optimal fluctuation now includes the cost of creating the optimal initial density profile. In a stochastic realization of the process, the equilibrium probability distribution corresponds to the density of xmath20. Consequently, xmath199 here xmath200 is proportional to xmath132 rather than xmath2 . In particular, for xmath31 @ xmath201 the case of xmath18 is not special, and eq. ( sfast) holds: ( sfast) [i]; in the annealed setting that we consider, one can make an equilibrium (the equilibrium) curve and average it over the curve. Moreover, in the annealed setting, that we consider, one can make the most probable initial density profile, based on the target survival until time, xmath2; 2 =  lambda ,  theta [i] . [i] . . . [i] [i] . [ t02] . . . At times, at xmath113 and xmath9, the optimal density at xmath113 is the same as predicted by the deterministic theory, eq. ([difeq]); at times, at xmath113, the optimal density profile at xmath115 is a quadratic function of xmath113, at times xmath113. Thus, we can calculate xmath224. In the new variables @ xmath217 and math218, the first condition ([inannrw]) yields: with this first condition and the boundary conditions @ xmath220 and @ xmath221 we obtain @ xmath223, where @ xmath147 is the same as before. To solve the diffusion equation ([qt]) we solve the diffusion equation ([qt]) with this first condition and the boundary conditions @ xmath220 and math221, we obtain @ xmath223 where @ xmath147 is the same. Moreover, at times @ xmath157 the optimal density profile is quadratic, a quadratic function of @ xmath115, at xmath113 the optimal density profile is a quadratic function of @ xmath115, at times @ xmath155 the optimal density profile is a quadratic function of @ xmath115 as before. assuming xmath110 we can calculate a small correction to xmath110 by eq. (s0s1] , where xmath176 still remains the same as eq. (vrw), but xmath175 is now given by the annealed history eq. (qann). t> [ The probability has been previously unknown.] - Let us return to smath110. if we take xmath110 we can calculate a small correction to xmath138 to xmath230 by the integrand of eq. (freeensep) in a small amount from eq. (freeensep) to xmath200. Adding up xmath238 and xmath239, we obtain, for the annealed version, a correction of xmath240. After @xmath27 the result for the annealed setting is the essential building block 'in all dimensions @xmath194 . . . At xmath23, the results for the annealed setting are different from the corresponding results for the quenched and the annealed setting. . . . if we use the term 'steady state', we can add to the analytical results for @ xmath244 and @ xmath244 a whole class of diffusive gases of interacting particles. This is how the system is empty at xmath223, p. . . , and if the system was devoid of oblivion (as an atom), it can be calculated numerically. Moreover, we can transform 'steady state' (as steadyeqgen) into a linear ordinary differential equation (ode) of a given given ode, which is at xmath247, and its general solution is a 'xmath249', i.e. 'sigma' [q (r)]          ] where 'xmath250' is arbitrary 'spirit' . Then the integrals converge at @ xmath255 if and only if @ xmath255 for the ssep and the rws are called @ xmath257 and @ xmath258 . therefore the condition (crit) is satisfied, and the solution (qgeneral) exists. This closed form solves the target survival problem for a wide class of diffusive lattice gases. (Eq . (pgeneral)) and the steady-state relation eq . (Eq . (Eq . ) in general have eqs. (Sep .) and (P . ) in general. Moreover, this closed form has eqs. ([eq .] , [eq . [eq . ] and ([eq ] [eq ] [ ] in general, where we have the rescaled action: a)  .  . [v] [2] - on the contrary, if the solution ( q general ] exists, then the action is bounded, which leads to a nonzero target survival probability. If the radius of the target is small and the radius of the target is small, @ xmath2 it is mostly due to the very precise solution of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (mft), which we have found. In this work, we have assessed the survival probability of a spherical target of radius of xmath0 in a gas of unbiased diffusive particles (searchers) which interact with each other by exclusion as described by ssep . – when @ xmath2 is small and @ xmath7 it is mostly due to the effect of the exclusion of the particles (in the case of the larger @ xmath6 in the one dimension), which is a non-empty solution of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. These effects (for large @ xmath6 and for any @ xmath6 in the one dimension) are also observed in the absence of exclusion: for non-interrupted random walkers. For the case of the size of space, @ xmath3, and the basic parameter @ xmath4—this, in turn, yields the long-term asymptotic of the target survival probability. The results depend on the size of space, @ xmath3 and on the basic parameter @ xmath4 . In summary, the macroscopic fluctuation theory opens new directions in the classical problem of target survival probability. The jib is supported by a grant from the binational science foundation (bsf) . for xmath7, we demonstrate that xmath272 is always as long as xmath2 in one dimension, whereas for xmath17 it is always as long as xmath132 . Several people, bm and pl, thank the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics for the hospitality, and the inn for partial support during the completion of this work. We also show that, for xmath17, @xmath1 depends on the initial condition (randomized or deterministic) , we also show that, for xmath18 and xmath33, the leading term of the asymptotic of @xmath1 is independent of the initial condition . In all these calculations we set @xmath126. in all these calculations we set @xmath126 . we start with random initial conditions and first consider rws on a large but finite interval , we conclude that for xmath1 the result is exact at xmath1 in the random case , and finally we derive, for xmath31, a more precise asymptotic of @xmath1 for deterministic conditions. As all the particles at the site are independent, the probability that none of them hits the target is @xmath282   n    ,  ,       ,                             left (- frac               left) ,  label  anmicro      label  anmicro    end  aligned         left (- frac  2 n - 0                           anmicro xmath297 . We now follow the same procedure as we used in one dimension. In the long time constraint, Xmath27, we have only to use the following asymptotic that is true to logarithmic accuracy (see e.g. @ xcite): xmath300 here xmath301 is the incomplete gamma function . . . Now we repeat the calculations, and the result is at xmath297 the same exponent as in eq. (rw: periodic) but a much larger pre-exponent. In two dimensions, the probability @ xmath298 that a rw starting at the radial coordinate will not hit the target at the time @ xmath2 is a difficult expression . . . in two dimensions, the probability at xmath298 that a rw, starting at the radial coordinate, will not hit the target at the time @ xmath2 is an impossible enumerable expression . . . In the third dimension the probability that a particle starting at a radial coordinate, at a moment math298, does not hit the target is given by @ xmath298 by solving the backward diffusion equation (which is mathematically identical to the forward diffusion equation) – is derived by solving the backward diffusion equation (which is mathematically identical to the forward diffusion equation) – is obtained by dividing the logarithm by math34. . . . . [10][11] and forming the most positive values of the first order of the result ([13] in contrast to two dimensions, the solution has a simple form: in the case of the first order, where there is a random set of locations, the first order is a spherical annulus, and the second order is a square one. In the case of the second order of the form, we find that the probability of not hitting the target is given by the probability of xmath312, i.e. in the case of the third order, the probability of not hitting the target is given by xmath317  nonumber                                                !   !  ! – if the first term is the first, it is the second which yields the eq. ( sfastan) with eq. ( sfastan) with eq. - even in the long-time limit, eq. ( - two) is more accurate than the second order asymptotic which arises from the steady-state mft. – if the second term is in the opposite position of eq. – eq. ( - two terms) is more accurate than the leading-order asymptotic, which is an integral of the mft formalism. The equation of the mft of the most probable gas density history, in the original (unscaled) variables, is @ xmath318. – eq. (_none_) is replaced by _none_, and all integrations over _none_ from @ xmath321 to @ xmath322 are replaced by integrations over the whole space outside the target. Here the initial conditions affect the leading-order result. s . f. burlatsky, m. moreau, g. oshanin, and a. blumen, phys. lett. ; 78 *, 585 (1996); d . p. bhatia, m. a. prasad, and d . arora, phys. lett. , 73 *, 586 (1996); k . seki, m . wojcik, and m . tachiya, j . chem. : 134 *, 094506 (2011) ; l . bertini, a . de sole, d . gabrielli .
