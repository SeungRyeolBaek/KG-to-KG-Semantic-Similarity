In a hierarchical cosmology, both the seeded formation of supermassive black holes (SMB) , which, with their masses of less than Xmath3 m, Xmath2 are quite ubiquitous in local galactic bulges (e.g. magorrian et al. 1998, ferrarese 2002) and quasars [ which have been detected at redshifts of up to Xmath5 (fan et al. 2001, fan et al. 2003), i.e. quasars, which are derived at redshifts of up to xmath4 (fan et al. 2001, fan et al. 2003) are estimated to be between xmath5 and xmath5 (see e.g. shields et al., sent> , it is confirmed that in a hierarchical cosmology there are smbhs of smbhs in existence and therefore in a model for smbhs of smbhs. a little from a hierarchical cosmology the presence of smbhs in halos is incongruous with the present. “By virtue of the uniqueness of the signal and its magnitude (of the sensitivity curve) , a lisa-guided calculation of the lisa-guided detection of bbh coalescence, is now being employed to elucidate the ratio of snrs to the detection of bbh coalescence. The estimated rate of coalescence of bbhs is a function of the nature of the signal and the sensitivity curve of the instrument; earlier estimates of the number of incidents have used only characteristic (and not time-dependent) gw signals to determine approximate limits for the detection of the sensitivity of bbhs (Wyithe & Loeb 2003) or have estimated the number of incidents by comparing the sensitivity curve with the total gravitational wave background due to the coalescence of bbhs (Sesana et al., 2004b) estimated the expected rate for a detailed physical model of smbh growth. In [x], we describe our calculation of the smbh merger rate, including our halos merger rate predictions, estimate the employment fraction of smbhs in halos, and the xmath9, xmath10 relationship, and finally conclude by saying: concl. [x] (Haehnelt 2004) . Therefore, the detection rate is capable of constraining the global smbh population (with the important caveat that there is no reliable efficiency of binary black hole (bbh) coalescence (Sesana et al. 2004) . At this point, however, the relative rate of hardening is reduced by the preferential depletion of stars in the loss cone (a region of parameter space where the angular momentum is low enough for stars to pass close to the bbh) resulting in a deficiency of stars that can extract energy from the binary system (see yu 2002). A numerical analysis of the bbh wander within the star field (due to the 3 bbh interactions with stars) has shown that this process is capable of extending the effective size of the loss cone, which prevents the coalescence from stalling. Two bbh interactions with stars ejects the stars into highly elliptical orbits, lowering the density of the inner stellar density and slowing the burning process (eg. volonteri et al.). - Depending on the orbital parameters of the binary and the background distribution of stars, this process may lead to a hardened bbh system, i.e. a binary separation where energy losses are dominated by gws, the binary will coalesce. a weaker-than-normal growth rate, in the second phase, is compounded by the preferential depletion of stars in the loss cone (middle-brain area, where angular momentum is low enough for stars to pass close to the bbh) and leads to the deficiency of stars in the binary system (see yu 2002). It is a fact that Yu (2002) argues that the efficiency of bbh coalescence depends on the time scale of bbh coalescence. ‘Choose the entanglement of gravitational waves. The phase of the gravitational waves may be divided into three main phases (here hughes 2002). The binary begins in the ’inspiral’ phase, while the smbhs gradually spiral into tighter orbits due to the adiabatic loss of gw energy; eventually the smbhs, violently entangled, collide to form one single object (the ring-down phase). The data contained in this paper are proportional to =xmath24. The last gw signal is described by the notion that the merged system is a perturbed kerr smbh (‘the merger’ phase) . a match-filter filter is therefore needed to detect the gw signal from an individual event. We are well aware of the dynamics of the ring-down phase, and have derived theoretical waveforms for the gws. However, some of the parameters of the ring-down model depend on certain unknown details of the merger phase, and must be guided by the results of numerical simulation (see [ring-down]). a match-filter detection algorithm is therefore necessary in order to detect the gw signal from an individual event. “With an earthly touch of the same density, the body will be able to detect the sound at frequencies as high as @xmath36 hz. Generally speaking, @xmath36 hz is required for the safe detection of signals (Hadkins et al., 2001). To calculate accurate snrs in the passage of an incoming signal, one needs to compute the absolute scale of the emitted radiation spectrum (@xmath39) from a quadrupole approximation for the gravitational wave luminosity ( @xmath98) where @xmath9 and @xmath46 are the individual masses, corresponding to a reduced mass , @xmath48 and total mass , fh98 . the equations of the fractions of a gravitational wave snrs are easily calculated from the quadrupole approximation for the gravitational wave luminosity ( fh98) @xmath45, where @xmath9 and @xmath46 are the individual masses corresponding to a reduced mass @xmath47 and total mass  xmath48 . as the orbital separation of the binary increases, both the amplitude and frequency of the spiralling strain increase. In general, @xmath38 is required for the sound of a signal (Hadhes et al. 2001) . The lower bound of integration between equations (en spec snr) is fh98. The corresponding time-dependent strain is represented by an exponentially condensed sinusoid with absolute (observed) amplitude (@ xmath57) whose value depends on the fraction of bbh energy that is radiated during the ringdown phase (@ xmath59), the weight of the component mass, and the spin of the merger product (@ xmath60) . The numerical simulations predict that the corresponding strain is of an inverse nature (bakker 2001) ; the equation corresponding to  is a sinusoid with an exponential amplitude (@ xmath57) whose value depends on the fraction of bbh energy that is radiated during the ringdown phase ( @ xmath59), the weight of the binary mass, and the spin parameter of the product of the merger ( @ xmath60) . the final factor of equation ([ xmath] in equation ( [m] explains the reduced signal amplitude for the unequal mass bbh coalescence (fh98) . , we adopt @ xmath68 .

That is, if the signal is yanked at a low frequency and / or degrades with frequency, then the search for the ring-down signal will probing more bbhs. As we say, ______ is the first phase of the ring-down phase , smbhs that emit gws at lower frequencies emit gws at lower frequencies, and for the binary system the ring-down signal is at a higher frequency , we calculate the snr in equation ( f1nr] and (rd fits1). hughes and blandford (2003) note that the value of ____ is affected by the function of smbh merger , There are a number of smbh masses (@ xmath98 m @ xmath1 - @ xmath99) whose smbh mass is only discernible in the ringdown phase. - as the characteristic frequencies decrease with the redshift, the ringdown mass is analogous to the typical smbh mass observed in the local universe (@ xmath102 m @ xmath1) -, therefore the ringdown signal is larger than in the ringdown signal for @ xmath97 m @ xmath1 - . . . . . , it is expected that the resonant sources of spurious acceleration will produce a steeper low frequency curve (firma 2003) . In addition to the instrumental noise, unresolved gws from various classes of binary systems are expected to limit the sensitivity of lisa (sesana et al. 2004b) calculated that bbh coalescence only dominates the gws above a frequency of xmath104 hz, which is an order of magnitude less than the suggested sensitivity. Moreover, it is expected that the background of the unresolved gws should not have a large effect on the sensitivity of lisa. We assume an observationally motivated dependence of smbh mass on host smbh mass [At xmath110] (e.g. wyithe & loeb 2003) by integrating the halo merger rate (At xmath111) over the press-schechter dark matter halo mass function (At xmath112) as below: a@xmath113, where a @xmath113 is the comoving volume per unit solid angle, the difference a@xmath115 and the factor a@xmath116 accounts for the time dilation. The product of the halo smbh occupation fractions [A@xmath11] relates the expected merger rate to the halo merger rate. We remove halo mergers where the accreted satellite halo takes longer to sink to the center of the merged system than the merged system does, since the bbh will not have time to form. This last assumption may affect the distribution of our expected count (though this effect may be small). we exaggerate the rapidity of halo smbhs. We also assume rapid smbh coexistence. The merger rate is based on the proportion of bbhs which will merge into the gw regime (see mbh ). “To the side of gravity, you have seen that the velocity dispersion of the local galactic bulges correlates with the circular velocity at the flat part of the rotational curve at xmath127, and therefore @ xmath127.

Therefore, to describe the concentration fraction of dark matter halos, at xmath139, we will compare the observed velocity distribution of local galaxies with a mass function, generated by the mass function of press-schechter, and which assumes a relation between cooled baryonic and virial velocity (see gal-vel ), which explains ... . simple galaxy formation models consider the effect of adiabatic cooling of baryons on the density and density of galaxies, but ignore the heat due to star formation ... adalanton, spergel & summers 1997, mo, mao & white 1998; gonzalez et al. 2000; kw2001 . We assume, as a matter of fact, that there is one circular velocity of which galaxies have an occupation fraction of unity. . . . To elucidate this notion, we assume that the normal centrifugal force may be masked by the average centrifugal force at xmath147 m @ xmath139, by xmath148 m . . . [49] and, if, as is supposed, so, so , the ellifugal force is reduced by the constant, variable @ xmath151, and at xmath150 for a baryon fraction whose fraction is independent of mass, so that this prescription results in a masked dependence of cooled velocity on halo mass. In addition, the concentration of the nfw profile may be related to the argon mass, @ xmath147 (@ xmath139) by @ xmath148 (bullock et al.). The circular velocity is assumed to be the one circular velocity for which galaxies have an occupation fraction of unity. Hence, we have taken the argon velocity function of kw2001 from psmf, with @ xmath156 in place of @ xmath157 In the calculation, the occupation fraction grew rapidly. In the determination of the halo mass conditional luminosity functions, the relation between the (precise) observed galaxy correlation lengths and the scale of the matrix (see van den Bosch et al.) we get a minimum mass-to-light ratio (a measure of maximum halo formation efficiency) for dark matter halos with a halo mass of xmath164 (xmath164, xmath164 ) , which corresponds to the halo mass of xmath164 at xmath164, which corresponds to the peak in xmath164, at xmath164, at xmath164 , at xmath164 , at xmath164 , at xmath164 , it is also convergent with the circular velocity of xmath164 at xmath164 (@ xmath164 m @ xmath) . and in their calculation of the minimum mass to light ratio ( indicative of maximum galaxy formation efficiency) for dark matter-halos with @ xmath138 at xmath140 m @ xmath1 , the occupation fraction also decays quickly, and at higher temperatures , it is very hard to cool the lower igmt. He may not go further, but I will tell you the following: the above equation (‘ mvir’) gives a minimum smbh mass (===  1 ) which is independent of the change in temperature.

Figure 4 shows the redshift distribution of events in relation to the minimum virial temperature. . . . - This calculation considers a particular model of the formation and evolution of bbhs embedded in an isothermal stellar distribution. Sesana et al. (2004a) apply the seeded bbh growth model of volonti et al. (2003) in which (large) bbhs formed in @ xmath193 and accreted and coalesced in major halos of giant haloes. Although we assume the physics of physics that entails the absence of galaxies (and by extension smbhs) in large and small halos, we have shown that the inclusion of the occupation fraction substantially affects the coalescence of smbhs. , whereas we also rely on the merger rate of dark matter halos to calculate our coalescence rate, our calculation differs by presenting empirically motivated estimates of the population of smbhs in halos. [18] – and b for binary coffins of more than @ xmath195 m @ xmath1 . – and c for binary coffins of heavier than @ xmath195 m @ xmath1 . – in the case of a high-rise black hole (in our case, a member heavier than @ xmath195 m @ xmath1), we have calculated the density and the radius of the coalescence of a high-rise black hole (in our case, one less than @ xmath195 m@ xmath1), and we have calculated the snr of both the inspiral and ringdown phases of the coalescence, and have calculated the mass and the redshift over which bbh coalescence will be detectable by lisa , if the higher density of ringdown signals is present, the higher the density of ringdown signals, the more inscrutable the coalescence of larger black holes, the greater the density of ringdown signals, the greater the rate of coalescence of larger binary systems. prompted by the observation that the number of both large and small galaxies does not fall within the expected number of dark matter halos, we computed the empirical galaxy occupation fraction. This is obtained by comparing the locally observed star formation rate with the cooled press-schechter (1996) velocity function.
