. . . . (by the fact that the absolute values of xmath5 are dominated by factorials, therefore xmath5 is analytic at least in xmath5 . . .) the result of the elliptic connections, as determined in section (lat-sec), is an expression of pseudo-factorials as sums over a hexagonal lattice. This is a simple consequence of the elliptic connections, which we will call pseudo-factorials, because the lack of the sign alternation @ xmath2 in the equation determines the sequence of factorials, @ xmath3 at the suggestion of one of us (bacher, 27 September 2004) they have been included in the encyclopedia of integer sequences @ xcite, which is brilliantly maintained by sloane and a group of dedicated volunteers. The purpose of this note is to show that these numbers, although not classical, have a host of interesting properties. This is the exponential generating function @ xmath4 which we will speak of next. Next, we introduce an additional fraction of a new type relative to the ordinary generating function of pseudo-factorials, where the denominators are successively disposed . . . in the case of pseudo-factorials, the radius of convergence is 0 . . . , as kindly suggested by the referee and the editor of the ramanujan journal, we make a few comments about the motives behind such studies. We begin by examining the relations between elliptic functions and continued fractions. This complex but somewhat inaccessible class of special functions seems first to be observed by pollaczek in xcite. It is remarkable that apery’s continued fraction, which has been the first proof of the eirrationality of riemann’s fraction, has a tessellation of cubic and sextic coefficients, which is also shared by the conrad continued fractions, relative to the dixonian functions, which are closely related to pseudo factorials (section  dixon - sec). , we may observe that the continued fractions in xcite are arithmetic, which is in keeping with the hankel determinant product evaluation. in a different register, the relation of elliptic functions to continued fractions is a long-standing topic, dating at least to eisenstein, stieljes, rogers and ramanujan. It is interesting to note that the continued fraction in xcite, which first led to the irrationality of riemann's fraction, has both cubic and sextic denominators, a feature shared by the conrad continued fractions, relative to the dixonian functions, themselves very closely related to pseudo factorials (section dixon-sec). , that is, orthogonal polynomials associated with series of expansions of elliptic functions have a long history, at least to carlitz and brillhart, and they form the subject of the whole book by lomont and brillhart. This section serves to establish the first connection between pseudo-factorials and elliptic functions. to make @ xmath6 explicit, you take the functional equation and add to it, so that @ xmath23, since by doing so you have @ xmath24 and @ xmath26 , unless of course you have @ xmath24 and . . . . the discovery of a new class (section [ ortho-section]) is of interest in this respect. In this respect, the continued fraction of the exponential, defined by tanguy rivoal, has recently been obtained by tanguy rivoal, which is of the duodecimal type (!). This and the previous observation reflect that our understanding of an orbit of questions, involving pollaczek continued fractions, elliptic functions, elliptic polynomials, and diophantine approximation properties is still insufficient; but they suggest that hidden' structures are still to be found in this area (refer to our brief conclusion in section "concl-sec"). Finally, pseudo-factorials are tightly coupled with @xmath2, as seen from our discussion of lattice sums in section "Lat-sec" . A - in the algebra of pseudo-factorials a - in the algebra of pseudo-factorials a - in the algebra of a sine and a cosine - in a - (let us call these mathematical functions - in the -) and - in the - we find - xmath46. We can find a - in a simple calculation. Then we will define the - in the form of the equation - in a word, we will be able to define the - in the form of the - - to which we can call the - (see also the work of lundberg and lindquist - in the original memoir - for the general solution. For example, in the case of pseudo-factorials there are two higher-order trigonometric functions, - - xmath39 and - xmath50, where - xmath39 and - xmath50 correspond to a sine and a cosine function, respectively. This simple calculation shows that - the basis of the new elliptic function @ xmath46 is as follows: the reciprocal of xmath41 is as follows: - We first claim the identity @ xmath71, then the first condition of xmath72 is that the left-hand derivative is 0 and we then take the final condition @ xmath33 as a parameter of xmath73. It is possible to a priori to reduce the exponential function xmath6 of pseudo factorials to any of the several canonical forms of elliptic functions. We will first claim the identity @ xmath71, and then claim the identity @ xmath72 which is derived from the distributary of the left-hand side of the equation, which is of the type of 1 . . . . a priori, it is possible to reduce the exponential function xmath6 of pseudo factorials to any of the many canonical forms of elliptic functions. The first step is to determine the basic elliptic relationship by the differential relation @ xmath75, which is clearly of the type of the weierstra . . . we note that this function @ xmath63 is classically defined by the nonlinear differential equation @ xcite, which has a corresponding initial condition @ xmath65 as @ xmath66. The first step is to determine the identity @ xmath72, then by means of the partial solutions we can get an elliptic curve @ xmath75 . . . . We have, for example, the sufficiency of the exponential function of pseudo factorials. Thus, because @xmath92 is the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of xmath79, it produces a series of indexes @xmath83, whose shortest elements are given by the six numbers @xmath83; the latter are, however, the shortest non-zero elements of the period lattice of @xmath79. As a matter of fact, the series of @xmath79 is a product of the exponential generating function of pseudo factorials. As xmath80, the series of xmath77 represents the expansion of the weierstra function of @xmath8 around the unique real, xmath81, torsion point @ xmath80 of @xmath79 . . . . [weierstra] is a general function of elliptic functions, as xmath88 is odd; hence, xmath97 is the root of the third-degree polynomial associated with @xmath8; thus, xmath98 is the real root of xmath100; so, if xmath8 is the inverse of an inverse of an inverse, he will be denoted in the short term the real half-period. The function xmath105 is determined by xmath33, and by the functional equation deduced from xmath112, the function xmath115 is determined by xmath110, which concludes the proof of the statement. Xmath110 is a general function, and if xmath109 is an even function, then the left-hand side can be written '1', where the numerator xmath113 is '2' , then '112', and '112' is 'alongside' xmath112'. '12 > ': ' -- ccx(8a)' . Then we conclude '13 - '_1' . . .  exponents, from the donuts and from the eulerians, such expressions as '11 ' (cpcx). as '111' is an even function, and is '112'periodic', the left-hand side can be represented by 'xmath112', where the numerator of '112' includes '11'11 at '115.' The expression '11' for any '12 is '12', which concludes the proof. ... but let __ _ _ __ be the lattice of periods, and ___ ___ be the set of poles contained in the fundamental domain of _______________. __________ [1,2,3], is the proportion of ____________________ which we have ___________ (32, 35, 34) [30] the extension of ____________ of ____ of ____ and ____ of the _[16] Primary_ Lattice of Fractions, thick lines.

Then, as we have said, _________, one has ______ ____ , _____________________. [A] Theorem ... the weier-thm (x) shows that it suffices, to the affine transformation, to There are three poles of Xmath56, at Xmath157 and Xmath158, which, upon translation by Xmath131, constitute a secondary Xmath56; the result of which is a partial fraction of the secondary Xmath56. as shown in figure [lat-fig] the singular structure of Xmath56 is quite known. As seen in Figure [Lat-Fig], the lattice of periods of Xmath56 is a hexagonal lattice with generators at Xmath156; we may call it the  primary Xmath56 lattice. As we have seen, the enzymatic phase of @ xmath56 is of the form @ xmath56 at a point of the form @ xmath56[17] , this corresponds to a 3coloring of the secondary hexagonal lattice (because @ xmath56 is the third root of unity) . The corresponding fraction decomposition is based on this fact. And in the case of the square beam, which has been considered by hurwitz, the average constants for the two boxes have been studied by hurwitz in the course of his study. ‘Let’s first say that a measurement of the constants for the two boxes xmath168 is required, and if there are nonzero constants at xmath168 and a power series at xmath169, then @ xmath169 has a valuation of xmath123 and is normalized by @ xmath172 . if the value of @ xmath174 is not sufficient, the normalization at xmath174 being merely a convenience. this section presents the basic technology needed to produce explicit continued fraction expansions from an addition theorem of a suitable form. The computation of the addition formula is then a symbolic or series-wide procedure. After defining the basics of this technique, a second stage of experiment, in section (prohibition) follows. Here the first stage is the definition. Here the corresponding function, xmath168, has nonzero constants xmath168 and a formal power series xmath169, such as xmath169 where xmath171 has the valuation of xmath123 and is normalized by xmath172. In this sense the valuation of xmath173 is essential, the normalization of xmath174 is only a complication of what follows. However, if the choice is made, then the corresponding function of the same number sequence is permitted to accept an oblique form of addition . . . , then the corresponding function of the corresponding function of xmath194 admits a jacobi-type continued fraction expansion, or an associated continued fraction . . . which is of particular importance in the last section ( experadd - sec.). this construction also determines the broad class of functions in which the addition of the oblique form of addition . . . As an illustration, following oblique and oblique views, we examine the case of xmath200. As an illustration, we examine the case of xmath200, where, when xmath201 exists, each oblique (if it exists) must be of the form of Xmath202, where Xmath203 is a polynomial satisfying Xmath203 . . . he has in mind the first idea, which is similar to the second case, namely, “xmath211 for some function or series” – xmath212. However, all such formulae are of a class of special functions, which consists of five parametrized subclasses, of which some of the prototypes are @ xmath213 (that is, a rephrasing of a classification of orthogonal polynomial systems by meixner – ) but, as a matter of fact, elliptic functions are not among this class. we shall proceed in an experimental way to infer the possible form of such an addition formula . . . in the case of pseudo factorials, we must develop a suitable constrained addition formula for the exponential excitation of the exponential function @ xmath6—which is elliptic. However, all such addition formulae are generated only from a class of special functions, consisting of ... five parametrized subclasses, of which the prototypes are @ xmath21 (this is a rephrase of a classification of orthogonal polynomial systems in the work of meixner @ xcite . . .) obviously elliptic functions are not among those classes. The recurring fraction of the elliptic functions is a particular source of inspiration. The recurring fraction of the elliptic functions, as classically defined, is @ xmath214, with @ xmath214 implicit, and we have, for instance, @ xmath214 , see for instance @ xcite . . . . The interesting feature of the proposed expansions is that they can be tested systematically. In fact, we have discovered, in principle, that for about a dozen of the xmath235 series, the function xmath240 must be proportional to xmath240 of the addition formula, which starts with xmath241. In fact, in the form of xmath232, we will then seek the one-sided @ xmath240, where the ratio is a constant. It is necessary to check that Xmath230 (a unique) @ xmath232 corresponding to xmath233, with a reasonable precision, the xmath234 relations of , which will allow us to conjecture the only possible shape of the @ xmath244 and the @ xmath245 functions. In general, the function xmath240 must itself be a linear combination of @ xmath6 and @ xmath242 without a constant term, so that xmath243, finally, assuming the observed law of the coefficients in the continued fraction, is resigned, we can deduce the only possible shape of the @ xmath244 and the @ xmath245 functions. The calculations were carried out with the maple computer-assisted graphical engine (version 11), and our computer-aided graphical engine was an X11 based machine. The calculation was performed in the maple graphical engine (version 11). The calculation is performed by using the Maple computer-assisted graphical engine (version 11). It contains a set of calculable mathematical operations, namely, rational functions, normalizations, substitutions, and multivariate polynomial divisions. (a) The first function (def) is the basic differential equation, which serves as a definition of the property (xmath6) of the property; the second function (add) is the familiar 'add' theorem of elliptic function theory. We know that @ xmath145 . The other function (add) satisfies the following formula: Xmath213; add, (separation): both are known to maple, both can be regarded as deterministic rewrite rules, permitting one to enlarge and simplify expressions involving @ xmath8 . Let xmath254 be the fundamental constant (real period) of section - weier-separation . Let xmath254 be the fundamental constant (actual period) of section - weier-separation . One can then operate with the Rule (Def) as follows: the Ordinary Substitution , where the Ratio is a function of the Russian System, satisfies @ xmath270, where the Ratio is a function of the Jacobi Form, where the Ratio is a function of the Four Complexes, where @ xmath264, @ xmath264, where @ xmath264, @ xmath264, and similar for @ xmath267, with @ xmath183 replacing @ xmath43. When this is done, we see that @ xmath113 reduces to 0 and @ xmath269 reduces to a non-zero polynomial, which is of degree 1 in @ xmath269 and degree 8 in @ xmath266. The verification of the addition formula for @ xmath6 is thus completed. a rational function, with coefficients in @ xmath263, in the four quantities @ xmath264, where @ xmath264, - xmath264, - xmath264, - xmath264, and similarly to xmath267, by substituting a corresponding rule - def, and by the terms of [add - prop] - our main continued fraction. In the first place, they are formally orthogonal with respect to a (formal) measure whose moments coincide with pseudo-factorials, - in other words, they are orthogonal with respect to the bilinear form - - the convergents of are obtained by truncating the infinite fraction before a numerator - and this leads to the convergents of - that is, the convergents of - are obtained by truncating the infinite fraction before a numerator - and thus, the convergents of are obtained by truncating the infinite fraction before a numerator - and so on ... we omit to focus our attention to the - solution of the denominator, particularly to the - and reciprocals, which are formally - and that appears new - . we look at the - and in general - formally - formally - to a measure whose moments coincide with pseudo-factorials, - - xmath126 - in other words, formally - formally - to a bilinear form, - . if the two sides satisfy the same initial condition for the coefficients of @ xmath320, which is called the coefficients of @ xmath320, then the generating function of @ xmath320 satisfies the equations of Xmath320 (after all, we treat the quantity of @ xmath320 as a parameter.) for example, if the fundamental elliptic integral of Xmath320 is defined by the principle of elliptic integral . in this way, we feel we save the symbols, that is, the trees, that is. instead of offering a heavy proof of the defining recurrence, we have chosen to present a computer-assisted verification of the facts. This proof of the identity eventually boils down to a fourth-order differential operator in Xmath320, with coefficients in Xmath317, and that is satisfied by the difference between the two sides of . . . . We use the holonomic framework, pioneered by zeilberger, with supporting theorems found in stanley's works, such as xcite and (*? ] By the finite information of the underlying vector spaces the aforementioned method is perfectly valid, if it is performed by means of the powerful gfun library which salvy and zimmermann developed, in this case ... the ratio of the initial conditions to a single one (which may be a higher, but still quite reasonable, number) ... given two holonomic functions @ xmath330, it is possible to verify their apparent identity as follows. (c) compute a differential equation of order @ xmath331 which is satisfied by the difference between coefficients in @ xmath333. c) test the coincidence of the expansions of @ xmath113 and @ xmath269 up to the beginning of the order @ xmath333 . in the case of a non-singular operator of order @ xmath331, the number of required initial conditions equals @ xmath331. (c) in the case of a non-singular operator of order @ xmath331 the number of needed initial conditions equals @ xmath331 . In the case of a non-singular operator of order @ xmath331 (in the case of the singular' case, a higher, but still precisely agreeable number ))) in the case of a solution from @ xmath335 and from @ xmath336 ) does not root in @ xmath337. In the case of Xmath349 the fundamental recurrence is the vector Xmath350, xmath351 for Xmath352; hence, by means of substitution, the fact that the vector Xmath353 depends linearly on Xmath354 via a matrix whose coefficients are polynomial in Xmath13 (and the parameter Xmath321) . Then the 'subsequences' (sequences of the coherence) can be guessed (and guessed, by the indeterminate coefficients in maple's gfun) . The right-hand side is sent>. xmath363 and xmath360, as defined in the statement . . . the left-hand side is xmath364 . . . ) The equivalences relates xmath349 to xmath350 and xmath351 to xmath361; and so by substitution  xmath353 and xmath361 are explicit linear recurrences of order 2 with coefficients polynomial in xmath13. a equiv upsilon (z, t) , , :  pi _ 6  partial  2y +  pi _ 5  partial  y +  pi _ 4 y & = 0 ;  hbox  see  - . py ; Pi _ 6  partial  2y +  pi _ 6  partial  2y +  pi _ 4 y & = 0 ;  hbox  see  - see   -  . - '$in a 'Eqref  etadef , 'Eqref           [2mm]   ,     ,    ,  eqref      [2mm]  left   !  left      !  ,   ,  ,         !     eqref  etadef   [2mm] submit to me—send an example at this point to me. If a given quantity exists at xmath377 which depends on xmath321 we set @xmath378 and @xmath379, and define its   odd’ and   even’ parts (in xmath321), respectively. Therefore, if we take the value of math389 to be a holonomic function we have the capacity to produce an operator at xmath390 of the order 4 to be of order 4; and it has coefficients of degree at most 12 . . . Given an arbitrary polynomial, we have a function at xmath379, at xmath379 defining the ist and ist parts (of xmath388), and a combination of i4 and i4 parts, respectively, . . . . We can build differential equations starting from xmath369 . . . Let us begin with Xmath379 and proceed to define the corresponding annihilators, Xmath390 and xmath390. It turns out that if xmath385 is an arbitrary polynomial, then Xmath386, in the form of an invariant equation, this equation is invariant in xmath387, so that it is also satisfied when the exponential in is replaced by xmath388. – by the way, the difference between xmath402 and xmath402 is such that xmath402 = 0 – – by construction, the difference between xmath402 and xmath402 is such that xmath402 = 0 – – by means of the construction the difference between xmath402 and xmath402 is such that xmath402 = 0 – – – by consequence of the construction, the difference between xmath402 and xmath402 is such that xmath402 = – – – . The orthogonal polynomials associated with the continued fractional expansions of elliptic functions, as previously mentioned, have been first studied by carlitz and al- salam (see @xcite for some more recent developments) and, as already mentioned, they constitute the subject of the monograph “elliptic polynomials” by lomont and brillhart @xcite. This family, as well as the group of orthogonal polynomials outlined by theorem [qegf] is not captured by their classification and therefore seems to be new. Moreover, gilewicz et al. have recently discovered another family of orthogonal polynomials, related to the expansion of the dixonian function Sm at 0 (as in @xcite) rather than at the point 058, which is required here (cf. theorem] . The totality of the addition theorem is indicated in figure —the preliminaries—of a square of the gram matrix xmath410, corresponding to the size of a square of the xmath414 number, called xmath415. [89] The hankel-determinant of pseudo-factorials of xmath414 admits the closed form of xmath416, where the hankel-determinant of xmath417 is an explicit hankel-determinant of . . . the hankel-determinant of pseudo-factorials of xmath414 admits the closed form of xmath416, where the xmath417 are the continued fraction numerators of . . . . . the exact first one, a leading fraction, representing the general, pseudo-factorial function xmath250, has a factor of xmath429 at its numerator of rank xmath430. The remaining fraction, based on the normal regularity of the function xmath250, has a factor of xmath429 at its numerator of rank xmath430 . the contributions induced by the stages xmath430, xmath430, etc., of this continued fraction are zero modulo xmath429 . so, it is periodic modulo xmath418 . . . . This is an example of the general fact that the expansion of integer coefficients with integer coefficients imply congruence properties . . . the statement is an example of the general fact that expansions of integer coefficients with integer coefficients automatically imply congruence properties xcite. By expressing that xmath250 is the sum of the differences of its successive convergents, we obtain, for any @ xmath250, an orderly and periodic modulo The characteristic polynomial is exactly the denominator polynomial @ xmath440 (reduced mod @ xmath418). then let @ xmath444 denote an unspecified polynomial of degree @ xmath123. As the previous discussion suggested, the congruence properties of pseudo-factorials are tightly linked to the arithmetic properties of the xmath449 polynomials whose exponential generating function has been determined in the Theorem of the Qegf . as a result of the xmath414 augmented prime, there is a prime of the form @ xmath414:  mod  7  mod  13  mod  19  mod  31    equiv —“” —“” —“   hline —“end —array —” [2] the relationship between elliptic functions and continued fractions is an ancient subject, and particularly rich.
