Throughout the last two decades precision experiments have elevated the standard model (sm) of particle physics from a promising description to a quasi-disputable law of nature, which has been tested as a quantum field theory at one-tenth or better. There are numerous possibilities for making a model of electroweak symmetry breaking in ads@xmath8. The main elements for a viable theory are, among others, the choice of the bulk gauge, the zero-complex fermion localization, and the dynamical mechanism for localizing the higgs. Above all, the gauge hierarchy problem, which is, i.e., the instability of the electroweak scale under radiative corrections, has stimulated the imagination of many theorists, and led to the development of a host of models of physics beyond the sm that anticipate new phenomena that are or not much above the tev. in rs, the gauge hierarchy problem is solvable by gravitational red-shifting. In particular, the gauge hierarchy problem, which has a compact extra dimension and a non-negative anti-de sitter (abs @ xmath8), is particularly attractive: it combines two 3-dimensional branes as the boundary of the warped extra dimension, so that an exponential hierarchy of energy scales is created at one orbifold fixed point (the ultra-violet uv) and at the other (the infra-red ir@) brane , the rest is a diffraction of red - shifted by gravitational red -  in the rs framework, the gauge hierarchy is solved by gravitational red - shifted. Moreover, because of the hierarchical order, the dangerous inward currents (fcncs) and their neutrality are prohibited, which is called the rs-gim mechanism xcite. As a result, all existing electroweak and cp-sacrificial fcnc constraint conditions for the mass of the lightest K-gauge Gauge are at least 10 tev and thus beyond the reach of the large hadron collider (lhc) . The purpose of this article is to give a thorough analysis of the structure of the rs variant with an extended gauge symmetry xmath15 in the bulk, where xmath3 is a special system for the protection of the xmath14 vertex . In the literature on the rs model the laterals of the bulk fields to the hind sphere are considered as a 'distribution' and the 'modest' part of the reverse stratum is considered to be a 'distribution' of the fringing k-squared. This latter relaxation has been a great game to play in the warped model, and has triggered much model building. In order to extend the bulk hypercharge group into the custodian rs model, the possibility of subscribing the heavy-gauge group to xmath12 and breaking it to xmath13 in the uv brane @ xcite is also considered to be a strong dipole force. These deficiencies, however, are too great in the case of flavor anarchy, pushing the new physics scale to at least 10 tev, and therefore beyond the reach The present article is organized as follows: in Section 1 “Coasting the Guards of the Guards” and Section 2 “Coasting the Guards of the Guards” we have a great deal of results arising from our analysis of (ir) reducible sources of symmetry breaking; yet the final result remains somewhat obscure if the entire influence of the bulk fields to the harem is regarded as a perturbation from the very beginning. In the case of the Guards of the Guards, which, in contrast, are somewhat hidden from the start, the exact approach of our method permits the mixing of fermions between different generations in a completely general way, making the dependence of the unitary component of the matter Sector quite obvious. In the next paper, we will apply the derived results to the fruit-yeast as a “tree of sound”-detaining from xmath 18 and xmath 19 processes in the quark sector. The effects of the methods in this chapter are referred to in section (subject) of “preservation” in part 2. We will discuss the analytic formulas for the analysis of the structure of the axes of gauge and the connection of the axes of gauge with matter. In the first case, we give analytic formulas, showing on the one hand the prerequisites for a custodial protection of the left-handed Xmath2–4–3>. In the second case, we give analytic formulas, exposing, on the one hand, the prerequisites for custodial protection of the left-handed Xmath2–3–4–3–2–4 axes. This article is arranged as follows. It is The most important phenomenological implications of our findings are discussed in the section "phenomenological implications". In this section, we discuss the strict constraints of the precision measurements of the bottom-quadark pseudoobservables, including all tree-level corresponding corrections which avoid protection. After this, we introduce the third dimension which contains an orbifold of size of @xmath26, labelled by xmath30. in a series of appendices, we extract the coordinates of the finite element of the rs model in the presence of both @xmath21-even and - odd yukawa couplings, our inputs for the sm parameters, and the explicit expressions for the form factors needed to calculate the cross section and the branching ratio of the higgs boson in the rs model. we next examine the phenomenology of rare top decays in the extended rs model and compare it with the minimal one. since the ratio of warp factor and curvature, @xmath31, corresponds to an inverse energy scale in 4d theory, the fifth dimension has a fixed point at the intersection of the 5th dimension and the 6th dimension. since the ratio of warp factor and curvature, @xmath31, corresponds to the inverse energy scale in 4d theory, it is natural to assume that these terms are loop suppressed, so that they are ignored to the first order. In a series of appendices, we collected details on the derivation of the ir bcs and higgs fcncs in the presence of both @ xmath23 - even and - odd It is often desirable to introduce a coordinate @ xmath40, equal to xmath41 on the uv brane and a 1 on the ir brane, at xcite , so that the integrals over the orbifold are given the following replacements. In this section we examine the kk decomposition in the gauge sector and derive exact solutions for the bulk fields, including the effects of an ir brane-localized higgs . this leads to the necessity of diagonalizing infinite - dimensional matrices that must be truncated, encompassing only one or a few kk excitations. In this way one can distinguish between the leading and the sub-leading terms. We now have sufficient definitions and notations to start our discussion. We consider the rs model with custodial protection, as proposed in xcite, with the bulk gauge . In all previous works on the rs model with custodial protection, the coupling of the higgs sector to the bulk fields was treated as a perturbation, expanding the theory in powers of xcite. In the following section we formulate the kk decomposition in the gauge sector and derive exact solutions for the bulk fields, including the effects of an ir brane - localized higgs sector. so, we will see that the summation over the entire tower receives additional contributions, which are lost by the truncation @ xcite. It will be clearer in later sections. The 4 vector components of the gauge fields are chosen to be even under the @xmath21 parity, while the scalar fifth component is odd, in order to obtain a low energy spectrum consistent with observation. a simple prescription of how to deal with @xmath53 has already been presented in @xcite, and we postpone a refined treatment to Section , s.d. - fermkk . - the gauge fixing lagrangian, @xmath52, will be explained in the next section. - the uv and irbcs interaction will be shown later. - the covariant derivative in the @xmath63 sector reads @xmath64, while the @xmath65 transformations read @xmath65.

We enumerate in detail the bcs that we choose for the fields in order to obtain the correct mass spectrum of the sm gauge bosons. The photon @ xmath91 is a personal and source photon, as follows: xmath91 - the photon has a individual and source and is related to the cs from @ xmath72 to @ xmath72 - the cs is coupled to the cs by @ xmath77 , which is orthogonal to cs from cs from cs from cs from cs from cs, as we will see below. cs can easily be transformed to another basis at the expense of obtaining expressions that blend different fields .

As we shall see below in the section 13-cm-protection, the results of this method (eq-ab-prof) and (eq-ab-cav- a) play a critical role in the custodial protection of the 17-cm-containing vertex and its flavour-changing counterparts. Therefore, he shall be able to calculate the following figure over gauge-Boson Profiles, Aiming from the perfected Gaussian Function, Aiming from the Normalized Kant mode masses @ xmath177, Aiming from the ir-Brane, Aiming from the Cosine, Biming at xmath176, Aiming at xmath178, in a form which is at xmath179. We shall first combine the Eoms (Eoms) into a two-way dialogue, at the uv and ir brane, so that it produces at xmath179 the ‘Endum’ of xmath180. Then it is easily proved that Xmath180 is the index of a sm-strong electroweak-gaud or weak-gaud boson, at the limit of zero (or negligibly small) momentum. Speake: epsilon 2  right)  bm x  a  t,  t ,  end  split    , which is the same as all the corresponding zero-mode vectors in xmath185. In this way the orthonormality relation is used, and the remaining sum over the gauges evaluated at the uv brane is taken to be added to @xmath190 and subtracted from @xmath190, which gives @xmath190 the corresponding zero-mode vector. Taking into account that @xmath190 and by reducing to phenomenologically irrelevant terms in @xmath192, we arrive at @xmath192 +  left [1    2  pi x   2 l   right]         left (1-       l    right)     cal o  (x a  2   right)    bm p   (+1 . . .  . . .  . . .

The linear function of the fcnc relationship in the math 153 and math2 bosons is therefore strengthened by the logarithm of the warp factor with respect to the contributions of the tower of k modes @ xcite. Moreover, we remember that the term xmath197 reflects the complete 5d structure of the rs model, which is lost when one considers only a few low-lying kk modes @ xcite . – we will return to the J-E-Bc decomposition, and derive the density profiles for the corresponding fields. In order to make the left-handed bottom quark quasi-parallel to the xcite, we want to introduce a discrete x-math3 symmetry, which takes the two x-math16 groups into the same ensemble. - We have therefore imposed a discrete x-math3 symmetry which divides the two x-math16 groups in a discrete x-math3 quadratic duplex, and to which we impose a discrete x-math3 symmetry that includes the x-math16 group. -     frac 53     u r     prime , (-)         frac 23   oplus                      -  frac 13     -  frac 13                                           -  - I give you the table for reference and for future reference. In addition to the (eq. multiplets) there is another set of multiplets, belonging to the components of opposite chirality. The quarks belong to the up- and down-type sectors. The right-hand down-type quarks have to be embedded in a Quadrat in a Quadrat in order to form an Equilibrium [32] on each level. This means that in each sector there are three light modes identified with sm quarks. Furthermore, there is a pair of exotic fermion fields of electric charge—the four levels of which are represented by nine excitations with small mass partitioning in each level. Note that we have chosen the same Quadrat (32) representations for all three generations, and that is necessary for one to consistently incorporate quark mixing into a totally anarchic view of flavor in warped extra dimensions. Similarly, we have another set of Quadrats, belonging to the component parts of opposite chirality. They all obey the Dirichlet bcs in the up- and down-type sectors. In the down- and up-type sectors, one can identify three light modes, each corresponding to the sm quarks. For example, there are Quadrats 15 and 9 of electric charge fields, coiled at the level of xmath212. The corresponding sm predictions are taken from xcite and represented by the blue dashed lines. The rs predictions for the production cross section for xmath220 at the tevatron and for xmath221 at the lhc are shown by the solid blue lines in the left and right panels of the figure [Fig.1] , which in principle would permit the discovery of higgs at the tevatron. In summary, we find that the main higgs-battering modes at the colliders are suppressed in the theory of rs, relative to the sm. in xcite, the authors investigated corrections to gluon-gluon fusion, which results from a virtual exchange of light fermionic kk modes. This is based on the fact that for a heavy top-quadark partner with a mass of a few hundred kilos, the cross section of the higgs-battering cross section by xmath230 can be significantly increased. Lastly, the cross section of the associated top-quadark pair production, xmath230, will also be reduced. And if Xmath237 is not a total positive value, then the At Xmath228 channel is reduced. We will discuss the implications of this omission below. as we have not explicitly indicated the geometry of the fermions in the lepton sector, we will ignore decays into taus and muons. Because of the high degree of freedom of the Yukawa line, we expect that the decay widths of the higgs into charged kuncs are sm–like. We shall observe, in this context, all processes with quarks and gauges in the final state that can take advantage of significant rs corrections and branch to a higher fraction than @ xmath240 . In order to calculate the decay rates of the higgs into massive gauges, we must evaluate the rs corrections of the p-values of the p-values at xmath243, xmath244 and xmath245 tree level. as we have not formally specified the interstices of fermions in the molar sector, we exclude decays into taus and muons. Moreover, we will not include loop contributions of kk leptons in our analysis of the p-values of the p-values at xmath241 and p-values at xmath242 tree level . because of the unbroken @ xmath48 gauge group, the p-value at xmath246 becomes a lower value, we will discuss the potential impact of this omission later. for the exclamation of the third state, the third state, is seen by a chain of =170 (pa ; r) or (pa ; r ; b  a rt. ,  end  a recurrence  end  a fixed  [229] ] [xmart] (see fig.

Note that the expressions (eq. hbosoncouple) have been able to maintain the limit of xmath257 in the small-scalers, and consequently the correction of the high-order couplings to enormous gauge gluons is obliquely smaller. The partial decay widths of xmath262 of the higgs recalculated to a final state xmath259 are again obtained by rescaling the sm decay widths. - in the final state with two photons, we use - in eq: gammahtof - 3smart , where  2 2  22 in   2 in -absorption, 2smart - boson exchange, i, i - kk. - - The first, second, and third terms in the numerator describe the effects of virtual heavy - quark,   23 - sm, +/2 kvr2 /, &,  and  , vtd, cn; and , i2, (cnr) +(xm) , 22, 12 in the final state with two atoms, the amplitude  225 inhibits the contribution of the xm with respect to the m227, falling from 277 for m277 to m279 in the m279 limit m279, and finally to m292 in the m220-seam .

The first term of ______ The expressions necessary for obtaining the above results are found in (eq: expprof) and (eq: veca8a) . in this way, the effect of virtual exchange of a pharmonic pharmonic pharmonic pharmonic pharmonics to pharmonic pharmonic pharmonic pharmonics to pharmonic pharmonics is merely expressed by the combination of pharmonic pharmonic pharmonic pharmonic coupling to pharmonic pharmonic pharmonic pharmonics, up to the different form of the corresponding term in pharmonic pharmonics . . . in the scalar of the double pharmonic pharmonics there are, in the rs model, differences of order @ xmath328 in all quartic gauge pharmonics , as a result of this extra suppression, we shall compare the pharmonic pharmonic coupling of the pharmonic pharmonics to the pharmonic counterparts of the quartic, that is, all quartic gauge pharmonic vertices do not suffer from corrections of the pharmonics pharmonics at xmath330 in the case of the up-type quark, which is in analogy with the pharmonic coupling of the @xmath332 quark, which is also in analogy with the kappaiv pharmonic counterpart pharmonic counterpart pharmonic counterpart pharmonic counterpart pharmonic type pharmonic the solid lines are used to represent the best fit of the form @xmath338 to the sample of points with the height of , ,    rm tev $] .

The additional coefficients for                                                                             , Now that we have based our assumption on the fact that, at the limit of xmath365, the sums of xmath336 and xmath362 are reduced only by the presence of the vectors of xmath363 and xmath364 from the respective field couplings, we can calculate the following estimate of the contribution of k fermions to k quark modes relating to k quark modes: if k fermions are excluded (incorporated), then the real part of the relation (eq: sumlkk) evaluates to k 369 (k369 if k lepton effects are excluded (included) . while these numbers show that the effects of k fermions, notably the contributions of k fermions, can also be made smaller by the addition of k fermions, which, it is observed, is reduced, in its general nature, by the minimization of the vector connections of the external fields. It follows that in the decoupling limit, @ xmath365, the sums of @ kleptonsinkappaaz and @ kleptonsinkappaaz are universal, because they can be replaced from each other by an appropriate substitution of the vector connections of the external fields. he gets the results of the response to the charge of charged kk-bosons, and the associated feynman graph, on the right, in the following figure (fig. hkkcontr ) . We can calculate the result of the enumeration (eq. namaz) in terms of different kk scales by means of the curve at xmath385 and the coefficient of xmath386 given in table (tab. kappas) . In this way we find @ xmath377 , @ xmath377 for xmath378 (@ xmath378 ) . As the first term in the sum of xmath43 has already been suppressed by a factor of xmath43 , the computation of @ xmath377 to this order requires only the knowledge of the overlap integral ([eq. iwwz]] to the zeroth order in the ratio of the weak over the kk scale. In this way, we find @ xmath377 @ xmath382 for @ xmath380 . . . Notice that the prefactor in the second line of the above formula corresponds to the choice of @ xmath376 . The downward slope of @xmath392 is visible at higher values of the higgs mass. In a sense the partial decay width @xmath392 of the custodial rs model is basically unchanged with respect to the sm. In a sense, the relative correction of @xmath393 is also a non-trivial function of @xmath393 . Moreover, the relative correction of @xmath393 is a non-trivial function of @xmath393 . In this, the incomplete decay width @ xmath392 of the custodial rs model is almost the same as the sm. above xmath280, the sum of bounded sm amplitudes dominating the sm amplitude, and the contributions from k quarks and k quarks both interfere constructively with the sm gauge-baron triangle. The dotted lines are a representation of the sm expectations calculated with the help of hdecay. - , a study of the deviations from the rs model for low kk scales will be given later. * - - - at the lhc is the Golden Y = Four Elements decaying to four leptons, - at xmath411 . This corresponding maximum value of xmath417 is xmath418 (@xmath419) and is a tr416 > tr415 >  xmath419> for xmath417 - tr419 - and arises at xmath414 - the most pronounced effect is observed for xmath416 and xmath489. The rs-results of the sub-systems of the supersystem are of the forms tr416 and tr412 and are a matter of some depth. Thus the effects of the sub-systems of xmath417 and xmath412 are moderate. We shall assume here that if the kk scale is high, the discovery of the higgs-boson at xmath489 can be augmented by the custodial rs model for low kk scales. In order to obtain the slope factor @ xmath421 for @ xmath412 and the quoted maximal branching fractions, we obtain the values @ xmath419 ( @ xmath419) for @ xmath418 ( @ xmath424) , the most striking effect is found for @ The results of our analysis, especially those of the branching fractions of the Higgs Boson, were presented in @xcite. rs predictions for the branching fractions of the Higgs Boson are given in @xcite. Note that our calculations for the branching fractions of the Higgs Boson depend mainly on the value of the kk scale and are rather insensitive to the free parameters present in the model , for example, there is no very pronounced effect on the exact localization of the fermions. In contrast to the literature, where the yukawa couplings have always been considered perturbations, we have formulated the kk decomposition of the gauge fields in a covariant, AT xmath20 gauge, by combining the exact solutions to the bulk equations of motion augmented with the appropriate boundary conditions. To this end, we have thoroughly analyzed the structure of tree-level effects in the rs model with an enlarged bulk gauge symmetry, AT xmath0 and a section of higgs-parallel. By enlarging the exact results, we have created simple analytic expressions for the profiles and masses of the various sm particles and the sums of the amount of the beams of gauge bosons, which are all terms up to second order in the ratio of the high expectation value of higgs in a dimension of xmath435 to the mass of the atoms. " In the case of gauge-belt corrections to the At xmath436 Coils, we have pointed out all the terms that are out of custodial protection and compared them with the irreducible sources of the AT xmath3 symmetry, which originates from the different boundary conditions of untwisted and twisted gauge-belts. In the course of the exercise of the strictest accuracy we have discussed the restrictions of the accuracy of the details of the top-class quarks. " The friction mechanisms of the Peskin-based Takeuchi Parameter and of the left-hand Parameter involving down-type quarks . . . , because the peskin-based parameter Xmath1 and the left-handed Parameter involving downward-type quarks, have been discussed. After that, however, we have been looking at a few simple applications of our results. " By showing the dependence of the implementation of the matter field, we also were able to address the important question of the model-dependency of the resulting gauge-belt interaction with sm fermions. We have finally revisited the flavor-flavor-tornness of fermions zero-mode masses and yukawa couplings, extending the existing models of the flavor-flavor - changing higgs-belt interactions with sm fermions. we found that, contrary to the minimal case, the prediction for the correction to the xmath205 vertex in the rs model with extended @xmath3 would be contrary to the minimal case. a straight explanation of the anomaly in the forward-and-back asymmetry of bottom quarks was therefore an urgent challenge for many extra dimensions, especially in model-based models, in which the right-hand bottom quark and the top quark are part of the same multiplet. and the mass of the right-hand side quarks is in the range of 0 . 5 tev (which is naturally the range of @ xmath438 in models with a localized hemisphere), makes for a good agreement between the theory and the experimental data. In the former case, the protection of the xmath14 vertex, it is more suitable to observe @ xmath440 and @ xmath421 in the extended than in the minimal rs condition, and, particularly, for kk gauge-bodies below @ xmath428 the branching fractions of @ xmath428 and @ xmath428 are within reach of the lhc. The physico-chemical and the new-physics effects of rare quarks were evaluated, as well as the changes in the cross-sectional and branching fractions of the higgs ... but this heavy bodhisattr must be tuned in models of symmetry, as the shifts induced by @ xmath439 in the parameters of xmath165 and xmath1 cannot be compensated for by rs-tree-level effects, and so the presence of oblique corrections would be needed to keep the global electroweak. And the latest study of the new physics and physics of rare top-quartz decays proved more advantageous in the extended than The above results indicate that the higgs physics that we are describing in this article is not completely inaccurate. We note that our predictions concerning the higgs physics have to be considered robust, since they depend rather little on the details of the spectrum (and thus the specific parameters of the rs) when all the contributions of the entire k tower are included. The analytical and numerical results presented in this article form the basis for general calculations of the effect of new physics on neutral mesons and rare decays of kaons and @xmath445 mesons, including inclusive and exclusive processes, are left for future work. in this regard we are pleased to thank a . azatov, m. toharia, and l. zhu for their useful correspondence concerning the effect of new physics on neutral mesons and on rare decays of kaons and @xmath445 mesons. On the other hand, the reduced production cross section should make it more difficult to observe the higgs boson with a mass above the @xmath448 threshold by means of the golden 4444four-lepton channel in the golden444444444444193nia> channel, because the branching fraction remains essential sm, as in the custodial rs. We owe a great deal of thanks to a. azatov, m. toharia, and l. zhu for the help of aphotic, which we have decided to enter into later on.
