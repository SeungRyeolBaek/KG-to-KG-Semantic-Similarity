that is, the grafted chain of amino acids grafted onto non-adsorbing surfaces forms the so-called polymer brush xcite. the theoretical description of macromolecules in these polymer brushes and their dynamics has been studied by a number of scientists before – see xcite – in the lubricants, the colloid stabilizers, the elasticity and wetting properties of the lubricants, the biocompatibility of drugs, the protection of the surface against protein adsorption (       surfaces) in the biological milieu , the microfluidic chips for the separation of biomolecules , etc. In contrast, scaling theory, self-resolved field and simulation have predicted partial penetration of the free chains in semi-dilutive solutions when the density of the monomer is at a level above the brush’s, and this result has been confirmed experimentally @ xcite. Nevertheless, there are free polymer chains in solution, interacting with the polymer of the brush. These free chains have received relatively less attention than others, except for the case when a polymer brush encounters a thick melt. (Officially, see xcite). The latter case is particularly interesting, since there is little overlap of the grafted chains in the melt and the free chains in the brush, even though their chemical nature is identical (wetter-autophobicity  xcite) . But most cases have been studied so far, which mainly concerned the fact that (besides the chain-end effects), the chains in the bulk and in the solution are identical. There is, however, no systematic study of the effects of various parameters (and above all the monomer concentration of the free chains) on the amount of absorption and the penetration kinetics. This is interesting, in particular, when the grafted and the free chains connect, at xmath23, and the free chains are linked, which, if any, are equal in length, the difference is not so great. However, we have not so far known the effects of the various parameters (at xmath23) and of the monomer concentration of the free chains (at xmath23), on the absorption and the penetration kinetics of the two kinds of chains. In the abovementioned fig. (again from the grafting surface and from the brushing surface ) - for xmath24 and at xmath29 in equilibrium: (left) absorption, and (right) ejection, at xmath30 . . . the numerical results are described in section . . . and the summary contains a summary and a discussion. Is it possible to give the property of the ratio of the polymer chain to the nearest monomer – that is, the distance between the free chain and the brush, for instance, to be of the size of the cupola? Here and in the following, we take the maximal extension of the bonds, @ xmath35, as our unit, while the potential strength is measured in units of thermal energy, @ xmath36, where @ xmath36 is the boltzmann constant. The polymer chain consists of linear chains of length, @ xmath23, grafted at one end to a flat structureless surface . the length of the cupola is @ xmath33 . the polymer chain is connected to grafting sites which form a triangular periodic lattice on the surface of which the closest distance between the two is a distance of @ xmath48. for @ xmath45 the free chains are absorbed by the brush, while for @ xmath46 the brush ejects them into the bundle. Note that here we define the compatibility parameter @ xmath1 as @ xmath47, and do not add the coordination number (which is done when we use the lattice models at xcite). In our study, we typically use @ xmath43 , - that is, in the good solvent regime with only restricted volume interactions if the model’s input is good, then xmath56 corresponds to good solvent conditions, because theta—point for a solution of polymers which the model is modelling is eqs. fene—mouse—or morse— has been estimated as xmath57 . for the condensed simulations we use polymer chains consisting of a 'fine' chain of polymers, and the number of free chains, lengthened @ xmath58, measured by a vertical interval in the interval, is taken so that the total number of chains remains constant and equal to @ xmath58 . We make use of periodic boundary conditions in the @ xmath68 and the @ xmath69 directions, and we use impenetrable hard walls in the @ xmath69 direction. For the word density, @ xmath28 , statistics are derived from statistics that are derived in the monte carlo, mcs. of monomers. In all our analyses, we use brushes made of chains consisting of chains of lengths of over 220 mm. The number of free chains @ xmath58 in lengths of 5 mm (when @ xmath0 spans the interval @ xmath59) is estimated as @ xmath58 . , where xmath73 is the position of the chain segments. , where xmath73 is the position of the chain segments. Note that the chemical potential of free chains and grafted chains is absent from the second term of eq. (i.e. [o] as the derivative is in a hard sphere, and @ xmath75 is the derivative of the helmholtz free energy function, @ xmath75. xmath77 is the external field, which in the present case is due to the hard sphere-like interaction of the polymer of the segments with the hard wall, @ xmath78, where @ xmath79 is the external field, which in the present case is due to the hard sphere of the polymer with the hard wall, @ xmath78, where @ xmath79 for @ xmath80, and @ xmath81 otherwise, with analogous expression for @ xmath82. r     alpha   phi     alpha    alpha         alpha      alpha  (   textbf  r        alpha     alpha )                       ,  label  fideal  ] ,  for grafted chains, this is written as a sum of repulsive (hard chain) and attractive terms, the former computed in the truncation and the latter in the mean-field, by using eqs. c. . . . ; - b           ,   r            ,  b        ,  vbond     ,  vbond   ] “Like a speech, this will be the natural language,” said the judge. ” To achieve this, the theory of the ddft method is applied, which is a dynamical extension of the ddft approach. The ratio of the total segment density to the grafted chains is given by: “Like a speech” (see Section 1). The free chains are then compared with each other in a number of ways: “Like a speech,” which will be estimated in the range from the rank of free to the rank of attractive. During the analysis of the kinetics of the adsorption of the grafted chains, it was shown that the grafted chains were essentially independent of the strength of the attraction between the free and grafted segments. The above equations are multiplied by the dft method, and are applied in parallel to the corresponding density profiles of the grafted chains: ”Second density profiles for free chains are derived from . . . in . . . . . . . in . . . . the absolute density profile of the free chain is given by the following equation: xcite @ xmath106, where xmath107 is the non-equitable local chemical potential, and dimensionless time, xmath19, defined by xmath109, where xmath109 is the mobility coefficient. the time evolution of the free chain density is given by the following equation: xcite @ xmath107, where xmath107 is the non-equitable local chemical potential, and dimensionless time , @ xmath19, where x I. For the sake of shedding further light on the thermodynamics of the adsorption process, I have, in addition, performed scft calculations of the structural properties as a function of the tension between the segments of the brush and the free chains (in scft, the tension is described by the parameter @ xmath1 which is calculated in the usual way from the corresponding potential well depths: @ xmath119) . ( a) To make comparisons of the kinetic energy of the ddft method with the kinetic energy of the system, I have, to wit, set the mobility coefficient @ xmath109 equal to unity and adjust the converting factor between ddft dimensionless time and kinetic mc time for a specific set of parameters - xmath0 and xmath26, that is, if @ xmath109 is inversely proportional to both xmath0 and xmath26 . In order to get a deeper view of the thermodynamics of the adsorption, we have also performed in a controlled manner a density model for the segmented brushes (as in scft approach this effect is characterized by the parameter xmath1 , which is calculated in the standard way from the corresponding potential well-depths: xmath119) . The main reason for this analysis is that it is easier for the free energy to be split into entropic and energetic components, and so gives a view of the adsorption more equilibrated (to dft) aspects. That is to say, the equation for the density of the grafted chain segments takes the form of this: xmath120, where the normalization constant xmath121 is obtained by dividing the grafting density by xmath102, and by xmath122, with xmath123. The density of the free chains, xmath129, is taken to be a hard potential, xmath124, which is independent of the type of the segment, and serves as a lagrange multiplier, in which the lattice space is completely filled and there is no segment overlap. In Fig. 1, the density of the free chains, xmath127, of length xmath0, to be attractive, xmath29, and neutral, xmath129, brush, along with the monomer density of the brush itself, xmath104. The density of the free chains is calculated in the same way. , thin solid lines in a and b denote results of dft calculations. The density of the free chains is derived from the density of the brush, xmath131, thin solid lines in b and d, ephemeral, at xmath131. I will give you the result of the dft calculation. The density in (a) is normalized to the correct ratio of brush to free chains, xmath132 and xmath26 (the absolute particle concentration @ xmath133 is indicated in the alternative # xmath134 axis). The a and c show good compatibility between brush and free chains, xmath131, and (b) and (d) show bad compatibility, xmath129. Thinly drawn lines in (a) and (b) denote results from the dft calculation. The density of all species in (a) and (b) denotes the result of the dft calculation. The density of all species in (b) and (d) denotes the results of the dft calculation. As a result, the density in a is normalized, so that the ratio of brush to free chain concentrations at xmath132 and xmath26 is exactly the same. In the alternative, xmath134, the density of all species is normalized to the area of the individual species. In Fig. ... [29] The thick lines in fig. ... [30] show that our simulation results show that at a fixed concentration, at xmath133, the profile of brush to free chain is almost insensitive to xmath0, and thus we only show one profile in the graphs. [31] and in (32) and (33) the results of dft. The most striking feature, which can be gathered from fig. ... [31] , is the intense increase of the absorption with increasing length of the absorbed free chains, at xmath133. ( The absolute concentration of free chains at xmath133 is indicated in the alternative axis of xmath134. thin solid lines in a and b denote results from the dft., a b and d are to be assumed, and a co-ordinate of the density of all species in the graphs is to be multiplied to unit area. This can be done with a trowel, or with a spade, or with a spade, or with a spade. “Detain [20] a] a ” —” a,” b—“[30]”—““difference”—““the main area of a bisque (As shown by the yellow dot, A; B; C, B; C; C; D; c; D, C; D”—“Difference”; “A”—“difference”, “A; B,” “Did [30] a, c, d, d,” “A”—“[30]—“The coaxial forms a circle (An circular dot, B,”—“Slided Area” and of the bisque,” (Origin; C; G, C), “File,” and “B”, respectively, “a, B, c” and “d”—“differences in (a), B, C, difference”—“Little by little the coaxial (B), ”[30], “little by little” and “somewhat”, (obtuse areas) and of free chains, @ xmath128, “thick lines” of length @ xmath61 for different Coaxial (B, C, D, and B) Coaxial (B), ”[31], “compartment”, “”, “thin lines” at different Coaxial (B) Coaxial (B), “thought,” and “d” in a) Coaxial (B), “gave”, “i”—”at xmat he calls it. . . . that’s why we observe some very large statistical fluctuations in @xmath129. The only significant difference in theory and simulation is the brush profile near the grafting wall, where the dft approach overestimates the oscillations. In the very dense brush @xmath139, the profile shows the usual oscillations, and that reveals a thin layer at the grafting wall, fig. — Fig. — d, e, d, e, f . Despite this, the inhomogeneity of @ xmath129 near the grafting wall does not affect @ xmath139 in the region of the polymer brush; the flat part of @ xmath129, ad lib, between the brush and the confining wall, at xmath139, is quite wide enough to eliminate the finite-size effects associated with the finite dimension of the simulation box in the xmath140 direction . . . . . . . . . , Fig. — d     — a, b — Fig.          Fig.  d  d . . . . . .

I have mentioned the characteristics of the principle here. The main character is indicated in the box above. For example, in the box below, Fig. 1, I have put in some figures which are presented in a row, entitled: Fig. 2, showing an example of this phenomenon. “The relative absorption of the chain is measured by the number of polymer segments that are in the vicinity of xmath152, and where the cutoff of the circular fraction of the brush’s length is so great that the absorbed amount is less than xmath150. (And fig. 2) It may be seen that the increase in xmath154 with growing chain length (As indicated by A=1, B=1, B=1) is observed as well, as shown in fig. 1] We can observe a steep increase in xmath154 with increasing polymer length (A=1, B=1), for brushes with an acme of xmath51 and for brushes with an acme of xmath3 (A=3), in that, as soon as @ xmath155 is reached, the absorbed amount saturates to about xmath156. ‘Subject’ refers to polymer absorption with xmath131, and empty symbols denote expulsion with xmath30. * * * a) absorbed fraction vs. xmath133, b) total number of absorbed monomers against xmath133.

Fig. b, that the conformations of the absorbed chains inside the brush virtually do not change with respect to those of the free chains in the bulk - the scaling of the parallel and perpendicular components of the end to end (squared) distances from end to end and the radius of gyration, @ xmath158, is observed in logarithmic coordinates by straight lines, whereby the value of the flory exponent @ xmath159 is calculated, - the distance of the straight line, - the distance of the second line @ xmath164 falls below the straight line, suggesting that the original shape of the rolled wire flattens parallel to the grafting plane ... Fig. [Advertental Volume Fig] - which Fig. [Advertental Volume Fig] especially interesting is the observation , fig. b , that the conformations of the chains absorbed in the brush do not change, according to the law of single polymers with such exempt-volume interactions: the parallel component @ xmath164 exceeds, and the perpendicular component @ xmath164 falls below the line, suggesting that the original shape of the coil of the brush is flattening parallel to the plane sent> @ xmath165. (b) scft results for the variation of energy (solid lines) and entropy (symbols) of free chains of length @ xmath166 with changing resistance to the polymer brush.

[ The entropic curves of the polymer, located   inside     outside  the brush (as defined earlier) intersect at the same value of  666 in the following fig.

The absorption time, for example, xmath154, against the length of the free chains, is presented, and it is obvious from the triangle to xmath154, corresponding to the same ratio as in xmath17. The absorption time, for example, xmath19 against the length of the free chains, is indicated by three different regimes – i (@ xmath9), ii (@ xmath17) and iii (@ xmath180) (shadowed areas). Fig. Fig. Fig. .

As expected, the expulsion of the adsorbate from the brush, after an instant switch of the interaction between the brush and the chain – by a rapid exchange of contact, and the polymer dispersal occurs much faster than that of absorption. Fig. Fig. . . . from the intersection of the tangent to the initial steep growth of xmath154 and the saturation value, we can determine the characteristic time of absorption by xmath19 in relation to xmath0 – fig. Fig. It follows that the measured slopes of xmath184 are plotted in the box against the number of free chains of xmath58. The arithmetic plot, the log-log plot, demonstrates that xmath154 is increasing by the critical attraction of xmath147 and fixed at xmath185, where xmath186 . the exponent of xmath187 (inset) . [ Figure: Fig. v] b shows that this first linear scheme corresponds to the situation when the length of absorbed chains is less than or equal to the average distance between the grafting points. Compared with xmath9 and xmath10 the time lapsed after the onset of absorption for different concentrations of free chains with xmath61 . as xmath0 (and consequently xmath11) increases beyond the aforementioned values, the second mode emerges, where the growth of xmath19, while still almost linear, is markedly slower. We take this slowing down as a halcy of the slowing down. - this is a result that is rather counter-intuitive, since it would seem that the driving force of absorption (and hence the absorption rate) increases with increasing concentration of free chains . (q) Here a delay in absorption is observed with increasing size and concentration of free chains, in a porous medium (activated carbon) - which in certain respects resembles the brush - - - fig . advanced and theoretical data for absorption at @ xmath31, -61, and several values of the concentration at xmath192 - we note that this pronounced increase in the power law of @ xmath154 was observed only at this particular value of - xmath42 , where the majority of our experimental data were done, no simple - xmath195 relationship was found - cf.

Fig. b. The initial height of absorption in the free chains increases as the concentration increases (see inset), but the effective exponent @ xmath183 decreases as the concentration increases (see inset), although the value of @ xmath154 at the beginning of the intermediate regime is larger for greater values of -math58. a variation of the flux of free chains into the polymer brush at intervals of time (see Figure 1 ) of time-dependent density math105 (at math58 = 24 ) and the flux math202 (at math58 = 8 and 32, right panel) . The time given is given in logarithmic coordinates. Here the mean concentration of math195 and the unit of time correspond to 25000 mcs. In Fig. 1 (a) the flux of free chains into the polymer brush at intervals of time (from dft data) in the case of two concentrations math200 math200 math197, and math196 math199  . the polymer brush is located at math199. The left panel is where one sees two  ridges  in math105, the principal ridge, which is at first placed in the bulk above the brush, slowly moves inside, while the smaller ridge is located near the opposite (bare) wall and gradually disappears from sight math 196 . . . . . from the right panel it is visible that, for higher concentrations (math58 = 32) the flux prevails over the lower concentration, and at shorter times (thereby explaining the higher initial values of xmath154 in fig. . . . , we have systematically increased the number of chains grafted to xmath0, to xmath263 in order to test more thoroughly our findings. In addition, by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations, we have significantly expanded the number of chains grafted to xmath13, in order to test more fully our results. For two cases of moderately to very dense polymer brushes, the main and most important features of linear chain absorption in a polymer brush are: * a dramatic increase in the amount absorbed by xmath7 with the increasing length of xmath0 chains, and a significant reduction in the absorption kinetics, which with increasing concentration (i.e., with increasing the gradient of density) of the grafted chains. However, in small increments we observe a slight contraction of xmath104 at small amounts absorbed by xmath154, and gradually the xmath104 extends gradually to that corresponding to a concentration of free chains growing by xmath154. In addition, by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations, we have significantly expanded the range of lengths of the grafted chains to xmath13 in order to test our findings more comprehensively. ‘This is interesting, and it was observed in the experimental test of absorption in porous media’ (on our site, see below). Thereafter we highlight the three distinct regimes in the kinetics of free chain absorption as regards the size of free chains at xmath0. In the first regime, the characteristic time of absorption grew rapidly with the length of the free chain, as long as the oligomer size remained smaller than the separation between the grafting sites. The second regime was marked by a slower increase in xmath19 with xmath19, and ended roughly at xmath209. a . . . the third regime was found to exhibit a almost constant @ xmath19 in this respect. The bottom line is that there are three different combinations of kinetics for the absorption of the free chains of the free chain as far as the length of the free chain xmath0 is concerned. Moreover, this rich behaviour was experimentally observed in absorption in porous media . . . . s. - alexander von humboldt foundation, germany . . . i. szleifer and m. a. carignano, adv. phys. 94 *, 165 (1996) . l. leger, e. raphael, and h. hervet, adv. phys. 97 *, 33 (1996) . . . advincula, w. j. brittain, k. c. caster, and j. rhe, wiley vch., weinheim, 2004 . . . . . . . . . . . . . , ed. r. c. advincula, w. j. brittain, k. c. caster, and j. rhe, wiley vch., weinheim, 2004 . . . . . g. s. grest, adv. sci. 138 *, 149 (1998) . . .
