" One of the most interesting issues in quantum physics recently has been the study of universal properties of several body quantum systems in the unitary regime xcite. The basic principle of this system is simple universal laws . The universal properties of many-body quantum systems in the unitary regime are the same: although the efimov effect in the three-body (x0=3) system, where the attractive two-body interaction is too great, the scattering is very large, and the range of the interaction is too large. however, the efimov effect in the three-body system in this respect has a different character. The ultracold properties of fermi gases are well understood, but a study of bosonic systems with large scattering is very difficult. Moreover, the recent experiments of efimov phenomena in the ultracold atmosphere have led to the interest in the study of universality in several-body quantum systems - xcite. , whereas the recent experimental observations of efimov phenomena in ultracold gases have interest in the study of universality in small-body quantum systems - xcite, but the extension of efimov physics for large-body system - xcite is still not clear. - In the above work, we consider the several-body system - xcite atoms interacting with van der Waals. — the shape dependent two-body van der Waals potential — the results are given and show that there are universal cluster states, of efimov character. — we describe in detail the common approach of phlegmatic solutions of the many-body schrdinger equation, with the success of our earlier works on xcite. — the method has been described in detail in our earlier works on xcite — we take the hamiltonian for the relative motion of the atoms, for which the center of mass coordinate is xcite — and the relative motion of the atoms in the center of mass — the result is given by xmath9, in which xmath10 is the hamiltonian and xmath11 the position vector of the xmath12th particle. In our study, we shall examine the general behavior of three-dimensional bosonic clusters, near the unitary. We shall present in brief the method in a brief note. We will describe it briefly below. We will consider a system of atoms weighing @ xmath7, each of which is mass weighing, and interacting with each other via two-body potential. The hamiltonian of the system is given by Xmath9, where xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the two-body potential, and xmath11 is the position vector of the xmath12th particle . . . . for atomic clusters the center of mass behaves like a free particle in the laboratory and we set its energy to zero. The calculation of potential matrix elements for all pairwise potentials becomes an extremely difficult task, and the convergence rate of the hyperspherical harmonic expansion becomes extremely slow for xmath24, because the base degeneracy is rapidly increasing. The physical picture of a given component is that when two particles meet, the rest of the particles act as passive spectators. So we can decompose the whole function of xmath25 into two-body correlation, as xmath28; so that for xmath25 it is equal to the sum of two-body correlations and the global xmath30. Therefore, for every two-body interaction of an interacting pair of a xmath0 particle system, the active degrees of freedom are effectively reduced to four, viz., xmath28 and xmath30, and the rest of the irrelevant degrees are frozen. It is to be noted that xmath28 is symmetric under the exchange operator Xmath32 for atoms of the bosonic type, and satisfied the faddeev equation  phi  ij    phi   ij     phi  ij At xmath39 the subset of potential harmonics (ph) (a subset of spherical harmonics, which are necessary for the expansion of xmath37) is defined by xmath39 and xmath41 as the ph. The group of xmath18 non-interacting particles is reduced to xmath53, as for xmath54, xmath55, and xmath56. xmath53 is the subset of hyperangles in the Xmath36-dimensional space corresponding to the xmath26-interacting pair, and xmath41 is called the ph. *, the other non-interacting particles are added to xmath52 as xmath51, such that xmath51 . . . * ;  () _, —, _, ( ), , , , ,     , , , , , ,  , , , , , , , , , , ,  , ,    , , ,  () of the - at xmath and , a little less than the spatial scale, and, therefore, very large , the ; for the  xmath61 . ,    , the , , , , , . - for the  , (v) , , , , , ,   (v) - at xmath63, , , ,  - xmath72   -80 ,  = 0 ,   = a matrix element @ xmath67,  - the potential matrix element   (v) - and - xmath71 is a constant, represents the interatomic bonding, the inverse equation is very important, and the standard mean-field theory is a stalemate. However, in order to explore the generic behavior In fig. [fig. gndstate] we plot the negative energy shedding in the negative scattering in the positive to the unitary. At each discontinuity one extra node in the two-body wave function is created, which corresponds to an extra two-body bound state. in ah , we assume that the hyperradial motion is less pronounced than the hyperangular motion. In ah , we assume that the hyperradial motion is much slower than the hyperangular motion , therefore, the solution of the hyperradial motion is obtained by diagonalizing the potential matrix with the diagonal, hypercentrifugal repulsion, for a fixed value of xmath30 . the above equation is solved, obtaining the energy and the wave function with proper boundary conditions on xmath83. We have obtained the spectrum of bosonic clusters and in fig. [fig.] we find the radii of efimov states at xmath91 by the radii of xmath90. Suppose that there are infinitely many three body-bound states, which have smaller radii and larger radiuses, and these radii cease to be bound one by one. At xmath87, or at xmath88, = 0; then, infinitely many three body-bound states, of smaller binding and greater radiuses, appear. the relative distance of these states, @ xmath91, is shown in fig. . . . Excited, we observe that in each of the radii of efimov states, he is able to reproduce with the exponential coefficient, @ xmath98, @ xmath92, @ xmath99, where the coefficients are @ xmath100 = 0 and @ xmath100 = 0 and 0 for xmath102. After all, there are many measures in the theory of structural properties that are related to the interaction of atoms. When atoms form clusters, due to the attractiveness of the van der Waals interaction, the repulsion of the hard core occurs at a low radius, and therefore, xmath104, is zero for xmath105 smaller than the hard core radius, xmath72 . This is to be considered a more useful parameter in the study of structural properties, as interatomic interactions are necessary. . . . As we already said, the universal behaviour of the atom is very well understood, but little is known of the larger systems . . . we calculate the inverse correlation function for xmath104 in fig. tjon , which is the almost linear relation between the energies of three-nucleon and four-nucleon systems. . . . we compute xmath104 by xmath107, where xmath108 is the many-body wave function, and the integral over the whole of the supervolume excludes the integration over xmath105 . the position of the maximum is shifted to larger xmath105, with increase in xmath0 and the peak height reduces . . . . . . as a result of this, we have obtained an energy spectrum of xmath0, of xmath0, of xmath0, of xmath1 more than three particles, and this requires an infinitely large spatial range, that is, the energy spectrum of xmath0. Using the classic van der Waals potential, we prove the true characteristic of such delicate systems. The physics of weakly bound   , and of their universal behaviour near the unitary, is a very difficult problem of recent days. The experimental observation of efimov phenomena in ultracold bose gases has rekindled the interest in universal   physics.
