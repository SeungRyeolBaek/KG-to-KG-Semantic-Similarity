' ' An xmath-line spectra of the type 1 agn show a diversity of broad and narrow-lined emission lines that give direct insights into the structure and kinematics of gaseous and otherwise excited gas within the putative central massive object.     The spectra of the type 1 agn show a diversity of broad and narrow-lined emission lines that provide direct insights into the structure and kinematics of the gaseous and excited gas near the as-yet-identified central massive object.  The h @ xmath0 profiles are currently best described by a single lorentz function . a h @ xmath0 profile is as narrow as fwhm = 500 – 1500 and includes the narrow line of fwhm = 40000 – 1500. b is mainly radio-mistressed, while draughty is more present. a h @ xmath0 profile is often confused with the wide one – [5] 5007 – a wide profile is commonly called a broad-line profile. a feii and eii mixtures have been found in the type 1 quasars since the late 1960s. Since the world of photography, feii has been found in type 1 quasars in large, well-characterized beams (usually the most highly spread) - and a very wide beam (vbc, feii ; feii = 4000 5000), a feii , which is usually zero or small (red or blue) , and a very broad (vbc; 10000) and redshifted (at xmath51000) - but these two, a separate molecule (a whole molecule) and a sub-mice of the feii h xmath0 - a composite of the 469 brightest sdss - dr5 quasars suggests that these two components form the underlying stable structure of h xmath0 in a pop . feii is nearly ubiquitous in a sample of the brightest ( usually the highest s/n) sdss quasars (z10) - in the general vicinity a sample of the brightest ( often the most hyper-luminous sdss quasars z10 - is almost ubiquitous. Observe in 515 the shape (e.g., smoothness) of the blue '4450- 4700' mixture (and the 'fourteen-eighth' line at 5018) in 515 515 . “E” [E] (in a word, “Z.E.], “N. W. e. j., and so the X. j., which feii had in common with infall, but which were located at a greater radius than in the region which produced the majority of x. j. j. a quasars show a remarkably symmetrically symmetric unshifted Lorentz, similar to h. j. j. X. , as compared to h. j. j., it has been assumed that the magnitude of the shifts correlates inversely with the eddington ratio (l / l @ xmath7 @ xmath8 @ xmath9). h08 argues that the amplitude of the shifts isinversely proportional to the source-eddington ratio (l / l @ xmath7 @ xmath8 @ xmath9 @ xmath9). , we were amazed by this suggestion, and decided to test the hypothesis of a systematic feii redshift. Our sample of sdss was magnitude-limited, with a somewhat lower redshift limit (z = 0 . 7 instead of 0 . 7). There were, however, two possibilities for small, spurious h — xmath0 — or f—irs (or f—irs) shifts, in which there were (or could not be) high-frequency, oiii blue-outliers. This is a rare case, for the host galaxy is not likely to produce the amplitudes indicated by h08. In addition, h08 obtained four000 sources from dr5 based on their skewed stsy, where at xmath49494 % of sources show sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty isometric, and therefore does not prove to be the cause of the large and systematic sty of h08 . Hence, z10 had chosen 4000 sources from sdss dr5 to compute sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty sty at xmath15 . . . and also, according to sty. 5, there were 55% of sources that had a sty. No ordinary source spectra were extracted from the h08 sample and spectra were calculated. These spectra, with measured shifts, ranging from zero to the highest values quoted by h08, did not allow to distinguish between zero and e.g., 1000 redshifts in the majority of the sources. The sdss-based spectra of h08 were extracted from the h08 sample and spectra were generated. The results showed that the accuracy of feii spectra depends on the following: 1) the strength of feii, feii / h@ xmath0 profile, 2) the spectral s / n and (3) if estimates are based on the strong four430-4680 mixture, or the strength of heii 4686 emitted by heii 4686 ... the best course of action is to generate high s / n composites . . . h08 objects that it is impossible to prove or substantiate feii redshift by composites, because of the great dispersion of fwhm, the shifts and the flux of both feii and feii , this is also true for composites generated from random sources, but not for composites created from more limited ranges of parameter values . , the mxii maxima (intense point) of an a2 median composite involving n = 130 z10 sources (s / n 90) yields a best-fit consistent with zero feii redshift. As we do not find systematic feii redshifts in our z10 bright quasar composites, we have used the h08 sample to generate feii shift composites based on the h08 sample. In this way, h08 sources are reduced, the lines are larger and the feii is weaker. the result is that the median composite of a2 and b1 is composed of an a2 median composite, with n = 130 sources from z10; s/n 110 - in this case, there is less constraint, because the lines are wider and weaker. We use this to build feii shift composites for all h08 sources in 4de1 bins a2 and b1 (see figure 1 ). a2 median composite of a2 and b1 (see figure 1 ) yields a best-fit consistent with zero feii redshift. In addition, we do not find significant feii shifts if we use sources with l / l / l - xmath7 (h08 indicated that the shifts might be most significant for the l / l - l - l - xmath7). They made use of a number of composites, but the original forms of the diagram were given in figure 1: (a) feii is the only region that contains feii’s total flux, and the population of the average flux of feii is equal to the total flux of the scale, and this region is regarded as the safest area for normalization of feii ‘s,’ or xmath26 ‘s,’ i.e., for feii ‘s, - 8ms and ms’. , a uniform distribution of the parameters in which the best-fitted fits were fitted, and the corresponding spectra for feii ‘s , feii ‘s and feii’s. The s / n of the xmath26 values, shown in Figure 1, demonstrate that the best-fitted fits are statistically significant , for all four of these examples, we derived an interval of zero, and feii ‘better’ fits. —the principal ratio of xmath26 with xmath26 is xmath26, which is to say, the xmath26 to the minimum xmath26, compared with the average . The upper panel of figure 1 shows, on the right, that the best-fitted fits with xmath13 = - xmath32 (and still more) were statistically significant. Suffice it to say that heii4686 is not mentioned in the h08 study, so we conclude that it is not included in their fits. , it is also impossible to distinguish individual feii redshifts. The compounded spectra of five bins of redshift are shown in their figure 12 , the three bins containing the greatest redshifts show a prominent heii signature, which, if subtracted, will increase the apparent significance of the assumed redshift. In the light of the fact that the highest redshifts have been detected in the h08, the appearance of heii redshifts are to be taken as a signal of heii redshift. As the astronomical spectra of h08 are often confused with hei 4686, the latter was not mentioned in the h08 study, so we conclude that it was not included in the analyses. The bottom panels of our figure 1 depict specfit models superimposed on a median composite of all h08 sources with the quoted feii redshift greater than 1000. However, the facts are much more ambiguous than the a2 composite. It is hard to determine individual feii redshifts individually. The principle component analysis of the bqs survey @ xcite has found that the hei4686 equivalent width inversely correlates with sources luminosity (it is eigenvector 2 ) . Thus, hei will tend to play a larger role in the sources with the highest redshifts. . . . — As a rule, when a quasar is usually low-intensity, where heii is stronger than average, it is not unreasonable to conclude that heii was systematically redshifted. . . . we cannot confirm large feii redshifts relative to narrow lines. The a2 results show that heii can produce the whole systematic redshift claimed by h08 . . . it is unreliable to assert large feii redshifts relative to narrow lines. It is also impossible to prove large feii redshifts relative to narrow lines. . . . – We have recently reported an feii study of sdss quasars, and their feii redshifts (according to their figure 16) are much smaller than those estimated by h08 (the average feii redshifts relative to narrow lines is – 1,400 – and this is the smallest feii redshift in a blue blend. . . . Little systematic shifts of feii with respect to the rest frame might seem plausible, but a reliable analysis is possible only on spectra of high s/n ratio. lccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
