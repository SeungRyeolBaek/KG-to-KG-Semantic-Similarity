This work, however, has a different approach. In Xcite a database is presented containing a solution of the equations of the 3d incompressible navier-stokes (ns) equations. The calculations are done numerically in a quasi-spectral, quasi-spectral way, in a periodic domain, with the real space grid of Xmath0 points. Thus, a large body force drives a turbulent flow with a taylor microscale reynolds figure of Xmath1 . The solution, taken from this solution, is spread out evenly across a large eddy turnover time. In this work, we take a different approach. Firstly, we use the alternate quantity Xmath3, first introduced in xcite , then, we can utilize this function to examine the multi-scale character of the eddy. because the vorticity is dominated by the smallest available scales, we can depict vorticity at scale xmath4 by the curving of the velocity box, which is filtered at scale xmath4 . In this way, we can investigate the multi-scale character of the eddy. In this way, we follow a simple procedure: To focus on this more clearly, we use a special color for the xmath11 isosurface. For each point of the surface, we compute the cosine of the angle between the filtered vorticity and the filtered vorticity: for xmath13 the surface is green for xmath15, yellow for xmath16, and red for xmath17, following a continuous gradient between these three. In order to represent a further larger scale, we continue the previous operations. . In order to show this more clearly, the small vortices are transported by the large tubes that contain them. We see that most of the small vortices are aligned with the vortices of the large tubes that contain them. Next, we show the vortex structures at all three scales, one inside the other. Initially, we remove all the fine vortices from outside the large tubes. It is evident that most of the fine vortices are aligned with the vortices of the large tube that contains them. This, however, is not merely passive advection, for the small vortices are also distorted by the large scale motions. – - 2> - 2 - if x [0] – - if x [0] –      – - -  - - -   –   –  - - - , -  – - * , - - a full view of the turbulent cascade in progress. – -  - - [19] ,   ,  – * – jsp? jsp? - ...
