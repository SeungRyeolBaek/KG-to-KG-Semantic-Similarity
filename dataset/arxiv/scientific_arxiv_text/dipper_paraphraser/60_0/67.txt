In the past decades several exact solutions were studied in the form of galactic models. The stationary disk models with electric fields, magnetic fields, and both electric and magnetic fields were studied. The static disks were first studied by @xcite and @xcite, where they considered disks without radial pressure. The disks with radial pressure and radial tension had been studied by @xcite and @xcite. Solutions with superpositions of black holes with static disks were analyzed by @xcite and @xcite. Further, relativistic counter-rotating thin disks as sources of a variety of known vacuum spacetimes from the Chazy-curzon metric and the Zipoy-voorhees metric, were also obtained by @xcite. The relativistic counter-rotating thin disks as sources of the kerr-type metric had also been obtained by @xcite. In the last decade many exact solutions of stationary disks were obtained, as possible galactic models, from the cosmological sources kuzmin and toomre@xcite and mestel and kalnajs@xcite. For a survey of relativistic gravitating disks, see Xcite and xcite. in the last years, exact solutions were obtained for thin disks made of single and composite halos of matter, charged dust, and charged perfect fluid@xcite. For the study of the stability of disks in general relativity, this kind of study was made by @xcite, transforming the rayleigh criterion of stability to a general relativistic form. By this method the stability of orbits around black holes surrounded by disks, rings and multipolar fields were analyzed. Also, the stability of thin disks of single and composite halos was investigated by @xcite. also, the stability of thin disks, in particular, in the stationary axisymmetric space, was investigated by @xcite. More specifically, the stability of thin disks in general relativity was investigated by @xcite, transforming the rayleigh criterion of stability into a general relativistic understanding . this analysis was made by @xcite, transforming the rayleigh criterion of stability into a general relativistic criterion. For this reason, the stability of orbits around black holes, surrounded by disks, rings and multipolar fields, was analyzed by @xcite. In general, the stability of disks in general relativity is considered in two ways: one is to study the stability of orbits around black holes in geodesics. By this criterion, the stability of orbits around black holes, surrounded by disks, rings and multipolar fields was examined. Also, the stability of the circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes was studied by @xcite and @xcite. - [57] Hesitating thin disks, chazy curzon metric and zipoy voorhees metric, he studied with the general first order kappa stifling of the momentum tensor and the general first order conduction, they found that the thin disks without radial pressure were not stable. Moreover, he was able to study the stability of the static isotropic schwarzschild thick disk and the general stability equations of the thick disk, besides that, and stability, in the mathematical interpretation of the mathematical description of the thick disk, were derived from the previous work of xcite and xcite. in the newtonian gravity, many models of globular clusters and spherical galaxies have been developed by xcite and xcite. The purpose of this work is to numerically investigate the stability of the general relativistic niobius-i disk, under the general pressure of fluids. The miyamoto-nagai potential shares many of the important properties of galaxies, especially the contours of the mass distribution that are qualitatively similar to the light distribution of niobius galaxies. Miyamoto-nagai-i potential has recently been found in the literature and two different extensions of the miyamoto-i potential have been added: a triaxial generalization of axially symmetric models, and a relativistic version of the same original model . At the end of the article, in Sec. 229, we will present the general perturbed conservation equations for the thick disk. The energy momentum tensor of the fluid is considered to be diagonal with components (- @ xmath11) , where xmath11 is the total energy density, and - @ xmath12 are the radial, azimuthal and axial pressures and tensions. The corresponding metric - 5 is the distance, and - @ xmath11 is the radial, azimuthal, and axial pressures and tensions. In addition, we will describe the alterations in the following sections of this work. The thin disk case we study is the general stable and symmetric metric, - xmath0 (our conventions are: - xmath5 , metric signature - 2 and partial and covariant derivatives of the coordinate - xmath6 denoted by xmath7 and xmath8) , in the rest, the energy momentum tensor of the fluid - xmath9 is diagonal, with elements different from zero, and the shape of the tensor is considered as a diagonal with all elements different from zero. ‘ And moreover, the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor and the coefficients of the perturbed conservation equations are functions of the coordinates (@ xmath4). . . . let’s suppose that a quantity is perturbed at xmath20, of the form xmath21, where xmath23 is the unperturbed quantity, xmath24 is the perturbation. And if we replace xmath24 with  rmf f (t, z, p z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z  z) , we get @ xmath27     &       & In finding eqs. a, b, c, d, d, and f, we assumed that the perturbed energy momentum tensor does not modify the background metric. Besides the four equations contained in the energy momentum conservation equations, b, c, d, and f, b, c, d, and c, there is an important conservation equation, the equation of continuity, b, c, where b is the number density of particles, b, c, and b, where b is the radial density of the particles, b is the internal density of the whole. b, b, c, b, c, c, d, b, c, d, g, c, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z , z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z The thermodynamic properties of the system can be obtained from observations or theoretically, e.g. from the Fokker-Planck equation, where we find the density of the particles in the disk. if we are perturbing the velocity in a certain direction, we are perturbing the pressure in that direction. In this case the number of unknowns is greater than the number of equations. The four equations, (t)—t-z—have seven independent unknowns, and, as we have said, are of equal weight. Then, the perturbation is done with the additional condition of xmath-50. The four equations, (t-z)—t-z—have seven independent unknowns, and we have five, and will be taken into account in our thick disk model. The static general relativistic version of the Miyamoto-nagai disk is obtained by a correspondence of the general isotropic line element, in cylindrical planes, and the miyamoto-nagai model. So the total number of unknowns is increased by the number of unknowns. The thermodynamic properties of the system can be obtained from observation or theoretically, e.g. from the Fokker-Planck equation, in which we find the particle distribution function of the disk. Thus, in this example, we are interested in the perturbations in which the velocity in a certain direction leads to the pressure in the same direction. - right (a r  2 + a - xi) - right -   8  pi  xi - 3  pi  xi - 3   frac  1   2    chi - 5  frac  1   2    chi -        -        -   -  -      ,       -  - -         -  -   -   -        ,       ,      -  -        ,      ,             ,          ,             ,             , . . . We have, in this particular case, _______________________________________________________________________________________________________, and so on, which can be resolvable in terms of some x________ rx, or, if desired, an x#(29]-*32­­­­­cnad> to be based on a second-order equation (adjusté, =mna)—which is to say, @x______, a function of the coefficient (___) , as a pointer to appendix fmna, where – in the inner radius of the disk—are to be based upon @x__________________, because we want our perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk and, in that way, let the perturbation vanish when approaching the edge of the disk. Hence we assume that the thermodynamic parameters are, by their means, about 90 % of the infinite thick disk energy density. From the physical considerations given in sec. ____________________ are the same as those mentioned in sec. ____________ In the newtonian case, the less the ratio of xmath90, the flatter the mass distribution. At first sight, the perturbation of xmath73 seems to be stable for all xmath75, but in order to provide a complete analysis, we have to compare the values of the perturbations at each radius with the values of the radial pressure. At the same time, for the disturbance of xmath73 for different values of xmath92, it is always lower or, at least, of the same order of magnitude, compared with these 10 % values. As in the newtonian case, the less the ratio of xmath90, the flatter the mass distribution. In this graph we added in the same graph a profile of the 10 % value of @ xmath77. Note that our four velocity @ xmath14 ( [Tetrad]) has only components in the temporal part of the sphere, so we have no values of @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 to compare with the perturbed values of @ xmath102 and @ xmath99. And for this we also performed stability tests on the physical radial velocity @ xmath98 and the physical azimuth velocity @ xmath99. This disturbance of @ xmath73 is always lower or of the same magnitude when compared with these values. In the more flatter part (@ xmath93) the amplitude of the oscillations is somewhat higher. Moreover, we consider the possibility that the perturbation @ xmath73 is not dependent on the parameter @ xmath83, but on the disturbances @ xmath103 and xmath107. Remember that the perturbation @ xmath103 does not depend on the parameter @ xmath83, but on the perturbations @ xmath103 and xmath103. Thus, we can say that the general relativistic-military disk shows some not stable modes for very flat galaxies, e.g., @ xmath94. Moreover, if we set the frequency @ xmath113 to the perturbation @ xmath73, we obtain the same equation for the perturbation @ xmath73, like [edo2mna]. in this case, the real part of the general perturbation may diverge with time, and the perturbation is not stable. We do the same calculation for different values of the parameter @ xmath83, and we find that the perturbations are the same qualitatively. ‘Eight equations of the second order – the axial pressure perturbation of @xmath115 are reduced to a second ordinary differential equation for the perturbation of @xmath50 given by @xmath115, where @xmath79 is functions of @xmath80, as shown in Fig. Fig. Fig. , it is shown that the amplitude of the axial pressure perturbation is given by @xmath115, where @xmath79 is a function of (@xmath80) – see Appendix fmnb – see Fig. fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. For the vectors xmath124 and xmath103 we have examined them numerically and found that the qualitative behaviour is the same. The vectors xmath121 and xmath103 are not dependent on the vectors xmath83, but on the vectors xmath124 and xmath103 on the vectors xmath82. We have examined the vectors xmath75 and xmath126 for the different frequencies xmath83, and found that when we increase the number of xmath83, the vectors become more stable.

In this case, we are not considering azimuth perturbations and therefore the quantities involved are not dependent on the parameter at xmath92. In the present case, we are perturbing the radial component of the four velocity, the radial component of the pressure, and the density of the fluid. The function @ xmath79 is given in the appendix [fmnd] . Note that, like in sec. [14][15] the coordinate @ xmath75 is entered only as a parameter. Note that, like in sec. [16] the coordinate @ xmath75 is only entered as a parameter. In this case, we are not considering azimuth perturbations, and therefore the quantities involved do not depend on the parameter @ xmath92. if the two zeros are high, the two modes are more stable. if the two X Mathematical (K) is high, the two X Mathematical (K) numbers are stable. The two X Mathematical Operations , we call them, and as we say in SECTION 1.1 , they are both physical and qualitative. We measure, in this subsection, the radial component of the four velocity, the radial component of the four velocity, the radial pressure and the radial pressure. For the wavelength z Mathematical (K) numbers are variables of z Mathematical (K), see in SECTION 1.2. The partial differential equation (PDE2MNE) is solved numerically with four boundary conditions, at xmath133, at xmath134, at xmath84, and at xmath85 . The other boundary conditions are equal to zero, because we want the perturbation to disappear when it approaches the edge of the disk. This equation is then reduced to a second-order partial differential equation for the pressure at xmath129, say at xmath130, with a deformation of a term (@ xmath133) and a deformation of a term (@ xmath133) , namely at xmath130, the intensity of the flux and the pressure of the flow. This is a second level of approximation of the stability problem of gravitational radiation. In this paper, we have studied the stability of the recently proposed general relativistic miyamoto-nagai model [30] by applying a general first order perturbation. Notice that in the lower half of the disk (5  555) the axial perturbation is positive, in the middle half (555) the axial perturbation is negative. , so the disk collapses due to a radial perturbation, if we turn to the radial perturbation. This is a second degree of approximation of the stability problem, which is based on the emission of gravitational radiation. Note that in the lower half of the disk (550) the axial perturbation is positive, and in the middle half (55) the axial perturbation is negative. Hence, due to the linear perturbation, the disk retreats to the plane . , this is a second degree of approximation to the stability problem in which the emission of gravitational radiation is taken into account. So if we examine the axial perturbation graph of the disk, we note that the upper and lower parts diverge from the center of the disk by the positive radial perturbation. In this figure, we can say that the disk tends to form a circle around the center of the disk. p.s. l. e. g., the first term in ( t) has the coefficient @xmath149 multiplied by the factor @xmath150, the second term has the coefficient @xmath151 multiplied by the factor @xmath72, etc., the general form of the functions ( @xmath139) appearing in the second order ordinary differential equation ([edo2mnb]) is given by @ xmath145, where @ xmath141, @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 are @ xmath153, and the meaning of the coefficients (@ xmath154) is explained in the appendix [fmna] . . . the general form of the functions (@ xmath139) appearing in the second order ordinary differential equation ([edo2mnb]) is given by @ xmath146, where @ xmath141, @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 are @ xmath148 in eqs . . . .
