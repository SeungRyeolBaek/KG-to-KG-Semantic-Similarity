As has been already said, the most stringent terrestrial constraints on neutrino effective magnetic moments have been obtained in the anti-neutron scattering experiments, and the work is now on obtaining further improvements in the limits. The neutrino magnetic moment is no doubt one of the most well-understood, theoretically, and experimentally studied properties of the neutrino. for example, for the most minimally extended standard model, the dirac neutrino magnetic moment is given by @ xcite. , the magnetic moment of the hypothetical heavy neutrino (with a mass of @ xcite) is @ xcite2 , the magnetic moment of the hypothetical heavy neutrino (with a mass of @ xcite) is @ xcite2 , whereas the magnetic moment of the hypothetical heavy neutrino (with mass of @ xcite) is @ xcite2 , . As we mentioned earlier, the most stringent terrestrial constraints on the effectiveness of the neutrino magnetic moments have been obtained by anti-neutron scattering experiments, and the process of obtaining more excellent limits is ongoing. Here, in particular, it is expected that the new limit on the level of @ xcite9 can be reached by the gemma collaboration in a new series of measurements at the kalinin nuclear power plant, with much closer tilting of the detector to the reactor, a result which can enhance the effects of the new limit greatly. This most recent experiment, borexino (solar neutrino scattering) has obtained a fairly strong limit: @ xmath7 @ xcite . The best astrophysical constraint on the neutrino magnetic moment has been obtained from observation of the red giants cooling @ The neutrino excitation experiments, in regard to the measured neutrino magnetic moment, are not sensitive to the binding of electrons, and this approximation can be used for them. But, of course, the process of neutrino excitation in matter is a relatively old one and, despite the advances made, there are a great many interesting predictions. In fact, neutrino excitation in matter is a rather long-standing field of research, but it is still quite new and exciting, and offers several fascinating predictions. The useful and elegant method of description of neutrino interaction in matter has recently been presented in a series of papers @xcite . This method is based on the application of the modified dirac equation for neutrino in matter, the feynman-diagram, to feynman diagrams. This method was already used in a series of experiments with an electron trap and was called the method of precise solutions. The novel feature of the method is the presence of an electromagnetic field in the neutrino transition between two different helicity states in matter. This aspect is that of the electromagnetic field of neutrino propagating in the external magnetic field and dense matter. The importance of the plasma effect on the neutrino propagation in matter was first mentioned in xcite. The investigations already conducted in this area reaffirmed the existence of the plasmon emitted in the neutrino propagation in matter. The effect of the plasmon mass in the act of xmath10 is calculated to be quite large and would have a significant effect on the physics of the process. In this short paper, we would like to go a step towards the completeness of the physical picture and consider the incomprehensible at first It is here that the equation, which is formed by the modified dirac equation for the neutrino in matter, is in a state of motion, defined by the number of electrons in the matter. , wherein in the case of a single repulsion of the neutrino through non-moving and unpolarized matter, in which, in a word, the number of electrons is xmath12, and xmath13, the number of helicity is xmath14 and the sign of energy. In the exact solution, the reader will refer to the modified dirac equation for the neutrino in matter in order to give initial and final states, which would be entered into the process amplitude. In the x-module, the x-module, in the polarization of a particle, if it is not moving and is not polarized, a polarization of a particle is                    xcite, and here we refer only to the expression for the frequency spectrum: x-modules: Here it is to be noted that in order to obtain a consistent description of the particle, it is necessary to account for the effects of the particle mass in the dispersion relation and the functions of the neutrino. So let us start with the application of the mathematic representation of the particle, whereby we use the power of plasmon and the percentage of energy of the atoms. In the first place, we obtain the particle and its proportion, with the corresponding percentage of energy, and by the means of atom conservation, the mathematical equations for the equations corresponding to atoms in the plasma are obtained, and thus we find the average energy for the particle and its proportion of mass. This is an intricate calculation, and its final expression is too large to be given here. But, for simplicity, we take the most notable parameters in order to investigate some special characteristics of the particle behavior. for a complete account of the process, we will take the first atom of the object, atom of atoms, without plasma influence. In most cases, the atom of atoms appeared to be the smallest parameter in the concept, and it is several orders smaller than the other parameters of the system. for a comprehensive analysis of the whole process, we will consider the first atom of atoms as atoms without plasma. For this reason, we will take the limit of atoms at atoms atoms, and we will be able to estimate the rate and the total power of atoms at a particular rate. from atom conservation, we will conclude that it is kinematically possible only under the condition (according to the above-mentioned simplification): we shall take into account the dispersion relation and the neutrino wave If we take into account the influence of the plasma (which is, he says, ' xmath39') on the Xmath39 we can discuss two important points: one is the region of the parameters near the threshold, and the other is connected with the direct contribution of ' xmath39' to the radiation rate equation. . . . when the density is physically very high, the density is usually less than the mass of the plasmon, which in turn is less than the kinetic energy of the neutrino:  xmath40. . . . to the minimum (the threshold), the power has the same dependence on the advertising distance from the threshold to the threshold as on the rate of the process. As the conditions of the sky are similar to the conditions of the sky, it is natural to use high-energy neutrino. using the expanding-of-results expression, the expression (incremental extension) is correct only if the system meets the requirements @xmath48. Otherwise, one must use higher order of quantity @xmath49 in the expansion to obtain a correct value of intensity. So we can assume that the threshold (the threshold) must be satisfied. When we consider the numerical properties of the neutrino, we can imagine two important aspects, one being that it covers the region of parameters near the threshold, and the other, connected with the direct contribution of @xmath39 to the radiation rate expression. , we have borne in mind that the influence of plasmon mass increases (see (gammaslseries) and (extrusions) when the parameter xmath51 is close to xmath52. That corresponds to the system near the threshold. The procedure for exact solutions of the modified Dirac equation enables us to formulate all sorts of analytical expressions for probability and intensity for the whole range of possible parameters.
