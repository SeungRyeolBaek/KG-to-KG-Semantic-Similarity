- this is most often the case with the rail, sydney bus, and sydney ferry organization, which operates the public transport in the region around the city of sydney, Australia. The main object of the inquiry is to determine the number of passengers traveling, or the distance of freight smuggled from one region to another, but by the limited information of their source, that is, the number of passengers on each train at each station, it is difficult and expensive to obtain the estimation by direct measurements, interviews, and surveys. It is difficult and expensive to obtain the estimation by direct measurements or interviews, but by using incomplete traffic counts and other available information one may obtain a reasonable estimate. The results of the study of the od distribution are based on passengers observations, taking into account their knowledge of the locations where people pass and regress from the train. Most of the research on the od matrix is concerned with public transport. The most common approach is to utilize passengers observation, which means taking into account the location of where people get in and out of the train. The main informations (trains, drivers, stations) are known to cityrail and co, and they can not be accurately estimated from the data that are available from the passenger-transport operations. Thus, to determine the proper allocation of these resources, one should recursively take into account the availability of the trains, the drivers, the stations and the passengers. The common approach is to make a general model for the cyclic distribution of passengers, for example, a gravity-based model, which aims to introduce an earlier knowledge about the flows and assigning a price to each journey. , kostakos_417 proposes to make use of wireless detection of the users' journeys, and lundgren_peterson_163 is based on a target od matrix already defined. Despite its novelty, this article assumes that the behavior of car-users and public transporters is the same, at least in the matter of their respective od matrix. Besides, he does not employ survey data. In this paper we develop an estimation of the origin-destination matrix, based on the a priori estimation of the od matrix, and with partial observations of the network flows, they derive a generalized least square estimation of the od matrix. This estimation is based on the survey data that is collected by the public transport network and / or on previous surveys. unlike the article of bierliaire and toint, we take public transport users' surveys, and estimate the whole structure of the od matrix, by the estimation of its eigenvectors. Moreover, we propose a robust version of the estimation, so as to avoid the biases induced by the survey. Moreover, the information derived from the surveys is generally accurate. Besides, we only use the partial structure extracted from the surveys. In this paper we propose to develop an estimation procedure for the origin-destination matrix, by means of the ticket information for the transport network and on previous surveys. Despite its novelty, the authors assume that the behavior of the public transport network and the public transit network are the same, at least as regards their respective od matrix. Moreover, they only use the partial structure from surveys. a leisurely commuter is defined as a single or return journey, not regular (for example, daily), a journey to and fro for a short time. As a general rule, one who travels to a once-in-a-year event buys their ticket for that route, and returns on the same day. , we list in the section om-journ, om-return, and om-return, all the different kinds of observations. we provide, in the section om-journ, the summary of the observation in Section om-journ, all the observations about the passengers. The observations pertaining to the passengers are very different, and only those which they can address allow a direct estimate of om-journ. In the first case (called om-journ), every station in the network has these machines; in the second case (called om-journ) only the major stations have these machines. , from the entrance of the major station the passenger must verify the card he has bought, and then by the passage he must take the recommended route for that time. , we consider the results of this work and propose some future research opportunities. We then note the two scenarios, om-journs, om-departments, and om-regular. And this infringes on the main part of the paper. But that part remains quite unknown. The station of departure and arrival, in fact, will probably be known only for a few days, from the day of the arrival to the day of the departure. So, it is important to observe two factors in this model: a traveler is independent of the validity of his ticket, a regular traveler commits to a return journey on every working day. “ For this model, there are two main principles: a traveler is independent of the validity of his ticket; a traveler commits to returning on each working day he is in the country. For the analysis of the various elements, these two points are: analytic, the traveler is not dependent on the validity of his ticket; a traveler is committed to making the return journey each working day. If you recall that ‘xmath17’ is a matrix of count, then the main assumption is that the number of passengers is the sum of the casual travellers (xmath18) and the regular travellers (xmath15) plus a matrix containing the special events—e.g. major sporting events or large concerts (called xmath19), whereas the commuter journey is characterized by the poisson distribution of the traveller; i.e. if we consider the latter as being distributed over a poisson distribution, we will call @xmath21 the matrix of the passengers. To be sure, our estimator should have no permanent motion in the moment of realization. We will assume that the empirical distribution of xmath22 is negative binomial, with parameters @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 (we shall call this @ xmath25) . for the same reasons as for the casual distribution, we will use a negative binomial distribution to account for the uncertainty of the individual traveler’s information. For the same reason, unlike the casual traveler, we do not suppose a 'battering' but 'battering', so that, @ xmath28 and 'battering' are assumed to be independent random counts from a negative binomial or a poisson distribution. this means that the simple maximum likelihood estimation should work well, especially for large samples. This is why, according to the definition of the measurements, the following relationships are maintained: @ xmath28 where @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 are the vectors of the total number of departures and arrivals in each station during the time period of @ xmath . As we have said, if the estimation is well defined, the estimation procedure will be in a well-defined manner. Let xmath31 and xmath32 be the expectation of @ xmath31 and xmath34 . I have available the times for entry and departure of trains at major stations, but I have not yet acquired the details for the long-term tickets to and from small stations. Thus we have taken the assumption that only a small proportion of the people who have prepaid long-term tickets will be travelling on the day of xmath39, where xmath39 is the expectation of xmath39. , and in the following paragraph is an elegant solution to this problem. It is a symmetrical scheme, so we can diagonalize it so that, @xmath47, where xmath48 is a projection matrix of the eigenvectors of xmath32, and @xmath49 is a diagonal matrix with terms equal to the respective eigenvalues. This problem can be solved easily, since the matrix is to be estimated with the parameters @xmath44, and only with the equations @xmath44. However, we may provide the same estimate for the parameters @xmath43 as we did in the previous section, that is, @xmath42, where @xmath43 is the same likelihood function as above. In short, it is assumed that only a part of the xmath32 people will travel on day xmath1 (which is day xmath4), where xmath41 is the expectation of the person who has paid the ticket for the whole week. And, in accordance with eq.[33][34] [37], we get a probability equation (for instance, if we know @ xmath48), the maximum likelihood would be tractable, and the estimation of @ xmath32 was possible (@ xmath61 being the @ xmath3rd eigenvalue), and the ideal likelihood of @ xmath56, if we know what xmath48 means, the maximum likelihood would be tractable and could be estimated with an estimate of @ xmath32 (the @ xmath3rd eigenvalue) . . . The one that follows, at the bottom, is aligned     ] where ymath56 and ymath56. Moreover, the complex equation of this equation is simplified by the fact that observations are independent of each other, and that if the observation is independent of each other, then p . . . . the whole. When a solution of the equation eq mle is found, the simple likelihood shape, for example, ensures the existence of a solution, and it can be found by any ordinary optimization function. The solution of the equation eq mle is a classic optimization problem, for the simple likelihood insures the existence of a solution, and it can be found by any standard optimization function. The problem with this solution is that we cannot guarantee that it will fulfil the constraint of the density parameters. Consequently, the best solution, for the analysis of the diagonal, is the probability matrix . . . ” This solution is , let it be xmath72. Here, the absolute value of the equation - , , , , . The linear , , ,  ,  - - therefore, all the elements must be in the interval xmath72 , @ xmath78    - positioned     [ end  aligned  ] . Do you think that if we are to formulate a more realistic estimation of the number of passengers, it seems we have to take into account spatial, temporal, and multivariate influences on the number of passengers, and then determine the parameters of our estimation. So if we have a notion of a kind of exogenous feature and its corresponding (perhaps unknown) influence on the number of passengers, we can come up with the following estimation, the one shown by + (a) === –===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================== a n–==|4 &||| It is however difficult to design and implement a survey that yields accurate information. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose to use an ad hoc estimation of the o-d matrix. a survey has certain unknown biases, and this method is of little use. The quality of the estimator depends heavily on the sub-matrices of xmath32. Here, for example, we assume that the similarity of the matrix xmath32 and xmath32 is dependent on the projection matrix xmath48 and xmath100, and that this assumption is the key to the evaluation of the propositions xmath103. To overcome this, we propose to apply an ad-hoc estimation of the o-d matrix. With respect to the eigenvalues of xmath32, we will use the assumption xmath101 , and this assumption is the key to our equivalence. The model is shown in the figure Figure 10 – Sensing Signals – and the ad-hoc estimation is shown in the blue line, where the upper line signifies a bias based on eq. eq. noise, and the lower line signifies a bias based on eq. eq. noise. The difference between the two equations is due to the nature of the bias. The main conclusion we can draw from this is that the ad-hoc estimation performs better than the naive ml estimation when the survey scours in the direction of eq. eq. noise. That is the kind of error that we would expect to find in poorly designed surveys or in people who are randomly flooded with information. It is the sort of error we expect to find in poorly designed surveys or in people who are randomly flooded with information. The following plot shows the ml and ml estimations for the two categories of bias, with different numbers of observations and different strength of bias.

As we can see from the map, all the wharfs are connected to each other, except for darling point, watsons bay, and garden island. . Then we want to estimate the situation of the od matrix, which is almost like the od matrix of the ferry crossings, except that instead of logical values, it will be filled by counts of passengers. , whereas in the figure a position for the od matrix is determined, and the distance is calculated by dividing it by the longitude and latitude of the places. So the distance was calculated by dividing the distance by the farthest point and by the latitude of the points. So, then, we will calculate a new origin and destination matrix. As you can see from the graph, all the wharfs can be reached from any other wharf, except for darling point, watsons bay and garden island. We also keep only those who have said they took a ferry. So, to obtain a new origin-destination matrix, we shall use a different survey, which was carried out by the same institute, with the aim of understanding the preferred method of transport for workpeople. We are also going to apply the same methodology in section (iv. ), and thus give a new origin-destination matrix. - we proved its durability in section rob - we further demonstrated that the method was robust, and that it was well calibrated . . . in the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have used a multivariate approach to estimate the od matrix . - we also demonstrated that regression analysis could be performed on this kind of data, and showed that the estimation procedure was consistent. - this method can be used to estimate the passenger count (official). - the monitoring of the passengers count (official) is done without any additional information (if there is sufficient temporal information first), even if there is a great deal of extra information, it may well be that the more observation will be less variances, and this method may help to manage the train schedule (for example), but more studies have to be done to understand the influence of complex variables such as temperature and humidity. then a real-time estimation of the passenger count (official) is more difficult, but is theoretically possible. We have resold our method to the simulation and real-life examples of the sydney ferry carriages, using the data from the statistics department. We also proved its robustness in a simulation, as we found in section (details) rob .. To describe the estimation of the official count (official count) we can mention the following: (1) the orderly count (last week), (2) the time between the passengers being issued, (3) the time when they get on the train or (1) the regularity of their journeys if they are regular passengers . . . We also showed that our method could be used to estimate the official count (official count) by taking a second estimate of the passenger count (official count) (one week ahead of time for sent> of passengers at each station is independent, each station has a parameter xmath145, which can be written as follows: xmath146 where xmath148 are the eigenvalues and the xmath149 an element of the matrix p. if xmath150, then the transformed density can be calculated, xmath150. Then the log- likelihood is then expressed as follows: xmath150, the transformed density can be expressed in a new way, xmath150 where xmath150 is the element of the matrix p. if xmath154, xmath155, c2 * and c2 * are absent, then the calculated value corresponds to the classical one-dimensional poisson-unbiased mean estimator xmath156. if xmath154, xmath155 and c2 * are not left, then the estimate corresponds to the classical one-dimensional poisson-unbiased mean estimator xmath156. ‘Quickly-converged’ means ‘Knowing’; then ‘Knowing’ means ‘Tilting’. ‘Knowing’ means ‘Knowing’ and ‘Knowing’ means ‘Knowing’. ‘Knowing’ means ‘Knowing’ in a sense of the word.’ The first integral follows from the second and decreases towards ‘Knowing’ – for ‘Knowing’ means ‘Knowing’ the probability density function. ‘Knowing’ means ‘Knowing’ the probability density function of ‘Knowing’.’ To show the presence of convergence in probability, one must prove it, by @Knowing’s strong convergence in ‘Knowing’,’ (in other words, in ‘Knowing’), ‘Knowing’s robust convergence in ‘Knowing’, ‘Knowing’, ‘Knowing’, ‘Knowing’, ‘Knowing’, ‘Knowing’, ‘Knowing’, ‘‘,’ ‘Knowing’, ‘Knowing’, ‘‘ Consequently, if we impose an exogenous coefficient of three degrees, we shall obtain a result of the following equation, viz., viz., viz., the probability of one observation can then be computed, viz., viz., viz., the log-like likelihood. viz., viz., a given X-mass – the probability of each of the parameters – then viz., viz.
