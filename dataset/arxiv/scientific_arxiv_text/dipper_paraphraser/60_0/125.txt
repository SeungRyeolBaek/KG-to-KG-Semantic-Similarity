In our experiment we begin with an optical analysis of the qds and observe a markedly reduced spectral linewidth of the emission of a single qd (qd2) neutral qd compared with incoherent excitation methods, via above-band gap and p-shell excitation. Compared with incoherent excitation methods, which employ a resonantly driven single qd, a spectral linewidth of xmath53 is very short. Figure Xmath53 shows a series of spectra of a cw rf line. All the sources had a lower count of photons than the sides. Figures 7 and 8 show the complete histogram obtained on qd2 . the interval of  xmath0 (c-h) and  xmath0 (c-h) is a number of peaks that appear every minute, with intervals of  xmath1112 . 2 ns . The central cluster had an overall lower number of photons compared to the side clusters, because of the single-photon nature of the source. This model, with the exception of the residual two-photon flux, namely,  xmath54 , a sufficient opacity of our interferometric set (all of which is in the main text) we obtained a corrected degrees of indistinguishability to 0 . 956 (58) , 0 . 966 (59), 0 . 989 (41) xmath0 pulses, respectively .
