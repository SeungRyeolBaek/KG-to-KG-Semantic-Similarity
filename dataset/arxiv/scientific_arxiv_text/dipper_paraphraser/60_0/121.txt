I think it’s possible that some of the solar system’s slri may have been introduced into the solar system’s cloud (e.g., keiser & keiser 2012; keiser 2012), or the solar nebula (outletette et al. 2007-2010; dauphas & chaussidon 2011) by a supernova or an agb star shock. sent> the slri, the short-lived radioisotope (slri) had been alive during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, the ca–, al– rich inclusions (cais) found in primitive chondritic meteorites. In either case, the injection occurred as a single event, which could potentially reduce the usefulness of xmath4al as a spatially homogeneous chronometer ( dauphas & chaussidon 2011) for precise studies of the early phases of planet formation (macpherson et al. 2012; cf. krot et al.). previous studies (e.g., boss 2011; boss 2012) have shown how this spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be significantly reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (mu) disk, through the great-scale, inward and outward movement of gas and particles small enough to move with gas (e.g., boss et al. 2012) . in either case, injection was a single event that was spatially heterogeneous, which might have made the historical chronometer ( dauphas chaussidon 2011) thereby less useful for precise Mysterious fluctuations, at first, at first, at first and at first in a manner, at first a resemblance to a supernova and in a subsequent time, like a supernova. However, in the process of refractory evolution of comet 81p, if it has already been formed, is still quite firmly suspected to have occurred, and are expected to have happened during the time of the protosun. Moreover, the fact that the refractory particles in comet 81p / wild 2 (brownlee et al. 2006; simon et al. 2008; nakamura et al. 2008) are thought to be formed near the protosun, implies that these little particles have been transported from the inner solar nebula to the forming regions of the outer solar nebula. al. 2012) Moreover, the magnetic instability (MRi) is probably also to be involved in the fu orionis outbursts (zhu et al. 2010b; vorobyov et al. 2010b; vorobyov et al. 2012) . And the low-energy (GM) disks (GM) can lead to the high mass accretion rates (@ xmath7 yr @ xmath) needed for the fu orionis outburst. we present here several new models of mdu disks that investigate the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in the inner or outer solar nebula, by one shot or continuous injection, for a range of disk and central protostar masses, including protostars with mdu disks. The numerical models are based on the same three-dimensional, gravitational hydrodynamics system that was used by previous models of mdu disks (e.g., e.g., e.g., the work of the boss and myhill (1992) . the radial grid contains fifty grid points for the 10 au disk models and a hundred grid points for the 40 au disk models. The radial grid contains 50 grid points for the 10 au disk models and 100 grid points for the 40 au disk models. The radial grid contains fifty grid points for the 10 au disk models and 100 grid points for the 40 au disk models . The discs contain small mass exoplanets (bonfils et al. 2013; dressing & charbonneau 2013; kopparapu 2013), some of these could be habitable exoplanets, which raised the importance of the mixing and transport processes in m dwarf disks. The radial grid contains 256 latitude grid points, and an even 45 latitude grid, owing to the hemisphere of the grid. “The theoretical account of the initial density distributions is based on the approximation of the star that is a self-gravitational disk orbiting a star with mass of xmath16 , xmath17,  ” (Bost & Myhill 1992) where xmath19 is the gravity coefficient, xmath22 is the mid-plane density, xmath23 the surface density, xmath24 (cgs units) and xmath25 . The trigheria of color is conserved in the same way as the mass of the disk, as the hydrodynamic equations are solved in conservation law (e.g., boss & Myhill 1992). The initial density distributions of the different disks are shown in Figures 1 and 2 by the calculated temperature profiles of the boss (1996) for a self-gravitational disk orbiting a star with mass of xmath16, xmath17, xmath18,  [37] , where xmath17 is the gravitational constant, xmath22 the midplane density, xmath23 the surface density, xmath24 (cgs) and xmath25. math27 is the initial midplane density, while the initial surface density is xmath27. sent>, which is drawn at an angular offset, extending either 45 degrees (21 au outer radius disks) or 90 degrees (21 au outer radius disks) in a narrow ring of width 1 au, which was then centered on the points in the tables. The model will show one-time, single-shot injections of isotopic heterogeneity, such as supernova rayleigh rayleigh finger fingers that carry inert gases, dbf . (See, for example, Messrs. Boulikov & Kaiser, 2012). Note that in the single-shot and continuous injection models the total amount of color is undefined (e.g., the color field in the injection volume is just equal to 1 ) and is supposed to be scaled to whatever value is suitable for the isotope s under consideration. The single-shot and continuous injection models, as in the former case, add color to the same place in the disk during the evolution, crudely simulating the co-dissociation (e.g., lyons & young 2005) or even the formation of stable isotopes in the gas and solid phases. The model is intended to represent one-time, one-shot injections of isotopic heterogeneity, such as supernova-induced rayleigh-taylor fingers carrying live chemistry (e.g., boss & keiser 2012) . " In fact, miller et al. (2011) detecting a fu orionis explosion in the classical tauri star lkh@xmath35 - 188 - g4 , it has been estimated that the mass of lkh@xmath35 - 188 - g4 is regarded as 0 - 0 - xmath37, which is more than 0 - xmath37. this is all so, because the calculation of disk masses is usually not precise, except for the star-to-dark region, which is the least good. Aetiological models are usually called "devices" (e.g., -, androme, 2006) are usually assumed to be the same as the size of ml. such as the size of the Ear, or the bulk of the Son, and so on. , they can in most cases achieve the ml. mass, as assumed by a ratio between the mass of the dust grains and the total mass . the mass of the hydra sextant is estimated to be as high as 0 . 1 . (to bergin et al. 2013) . so far, the mass of the tw-hydra sextant has been raised by half a cm to 0 . . . In this section, the physical conditions of the disks are restricted, the outermost parts are cooled enough to be gravitationally unstable, but the models show that this is sufficient to render qualitatively similar physiognomy for all the models in the table 2 tables. Figure 1 shows the early stages of the disk temperatures. The measurements for these models are: the internal surface injection of the equilateral ball at the rate of nine o'clock, and the inwardly injection at a rate of two o'clock, for both the models, , that is, at a frequency of a certain time, 146 yrs. The ratio is given in the form of the xmath4al / xmath42al and xmath5o / xmath5o ratios, which the cosmochemists are measuring i.e., the abundance of an injected or photolysis product divided by the abundance of a species that was common in the pre-injected disk . . . Figure 3 shows that the initial injection of the surface at the phrnium was rapidly transported downwards to the phrnium and encloses the inner phrnium, and even later to the phrnium in a large scale. figure 5 shows the evolution of the dispersion of the ratio of color density and gas density for models 1 . . . All the gas and dust is absorbed by the protostar. There is, however, a marked decrease in the outer disks for both models by 777 yr to a value of xmath0 1 % to 2 %. - as shown in the figure, the dispersion in the outer disks converges to the same degree of elasticity (at xmath0 10 %) in all three models, 1 - 0 - 2 - 9 , 1 - 0 - 3 - 9 after 1370 yr. Here it is visible that in spite of the differing initial degree of elasticity, the dispersions in the inner disks allconverge to similar values of xmath0 10 %. as shown in the figure, the dispersions in the outer disks are significantly higher (at xmath0 10 %) than in the inner disks. As can be seen from the figure, the initial density of dispersions in the outer disks is very large (at xmath0 10 %), which shows that the introduction of the underlying microsphere does not really influence the overall distribution of the distribution: the underlying microsphere is the same for both models (i.e., the color fields are passive and have no influence on the evolution of the microsphere) . In general, it is evident that the first, largely heterogeneous disks become quickly homogeneous, in this case by about 5000 years . In the case of the dwarfs and the m dwarfs, and the possible presence of rocky planets (e.g., Raymond et al. 2007) around m dwarfs. Figure 2 shows the initial temperature of these models. In the case of the m dwarf, it can be seen that the initial dense disk enlarges at a much higher rate than the outer disk; while in these models (the initial AT=0) the inner disk enlarges by 5 % to 10 %, while in the outer disk it decreases by only 1 % to 2 %. Here, too, we now turn to the consequences of single-shot versus continuous injections at the surface of much larger disks (>40 m) than for the m dwarf. Figure 7 shows the same phenomena as for model 0 – 1 – 1 – 2 , which is different from the previous model shown in figure 7 only in that injection occurred at 9 m instead of 2 m. and the same for the model 0 – 1 – 1 – 2 – 8 – 9 , whereas the previous model, which is shown in figure 7, differs only in having the injection occur at 9 m instead of 2 m. As in all the models, it can be seen that the initial highly heterogeneous disks quickly become homogeneous, in this case by about 5000 yrs. but as it is now, the modulation of the coefficients is proportional to the square of the space, and there is no loss of linearity. In the case of the model 1 - 1 - 40 - 20c, it is observed that the process of modulation is as follows: a rapid decrease in the concentration and homogenization of the component parts, to the point where they are homogenized to xmath0 % to 2 % of the inner disk boundary . . . but, as we have seen, the constant injection model, which is shown in Figure 10, can be compared with the one used in the single injection model, in that the cell is injected at a constant rate, compared with a continuous injection, to simulate an inner disk undergoing continuous uv photolysis and fractionation. Here, we see a more intense enlargement of the disk, in order to follow the expansion of the surrounding disk mass, which is usually due to the pile-up of considerable mass at 40 au, which we can still disregard. Figures 9 and 10 depict the evolution of the surface of the disk, for example, for the model 1 ... 1 ... 1 ... 1 ... 1 ... 20c. The color amount added by the continuous injection models is very large, compared with the single shot: for example, the total amount of color injected by the continuous injection has increased by a factor of @ xmath0 90 compared with the single shot, and another factor of @ xmath0 2 %. These results are identical to those shown in Table 4 as well. But they show that the main factor in determining the relative dispersion is whether it occurs in one shot or continuously; in the latter case, the particles of the MNU disk strive to get rid of the color field, but the spatial heterogeneity of the MNU disk limits the degree to which this heterogeneity can be lowered. As dust in the interstellar medium is overwhelmingly amorphous, crystalline silicate grains have been discovered in a late MNU disk (SST-Lup-lup-lup-lup) at distances from inside 3 au to about 5 au in both the midplane and surface layers (mern et al. 2007) . These results are in accordance with the results of the present models, which demonstrate that MNU disks are equally capable of relatively rapid and rapid inward and outward transport, irrespective of the stellar or star mass or the exact value of the stability parameter. These results are also in agreement with the results of the present models, which show that the MNU disks in low mass m-dwarfs can be responsible for these observations. However, the analysis of the spheres and stars in the interstellar medium is overwhelmingly amorphous; crystalline silicate grains have been discovered in a late m-dwarf (sst-lup-lup-lup) disk at distances of up to 3 au to above 5 au (mern et al. 2009) . Just consider the shape of a little galaxy that a star might grow, from a g dwarf to a m dwarf. Similarly low-mass stars, from g dwarfs to m dwarfs, may experience a similar phase of mass-relaxation. The calculations were performed on the cor-dial cluster of the large-mass star cadence (see 211653) and the relative height of the cosmos, denoted by the grant from the National Astronomy Institute (22230) . i thank jeff cuzzi for his comments, the referee for many improvements, and to sandle keiser, michael acierno, and ben pandit for their support of the cluster computing environment at dtm. In this connection, we note that the protoplanetary disk, the prototype of the plight of the solar nebula, has only @ xmath5 (zhu et al. 2007; bonfils et al. 2013; dressing & charbonneau 2013; kopparapu 2013) . - 6 - 9 - 20 - 2 - 9 - 2 - 0 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1200 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20000 + 1 - 0 - 1 - 4 - 40 - 20 - 50 - 1 - 4 - 40 - 20 - 25000 + 1 - 0 - 1 - 4 - 40 - 30 - 50 - 1 - 4 - 20 - 20 - 25000 + 1 - 1 - 4 - 40 - 30 - 50 - 1 - 4 - 40 - 20 - 50 - 1 - 4 - 40 - 30 - 50 - 1 - 4 - 40 - 20 - 50 - 1 - 4 - 20 - 20 - 100 - 1 - 2 - 30 - 1 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 25 - 1 - 1 -
