, it is simply not obvious how csos are situated on the surface of the sky, and it is more likely to be that they are young, radio-dark galaxies with ages of between 100 and 10000 years. Normally they are elliptical galaxies, although they are known to have some notable exceptions like Sagittarius and Quasars. They are generally known to be basal galaxies, with ages of between 100 and 10000 years . Generally they are elliptical, but the hosts are generally elliptical galaxies (Readhead et al. 1996) although they do have some notable exceptions, such as the Seyferts and the quasars. This classification consists in csos, which are radio galaxies with a core of some kiloparsecs wide. They are mainly located between the core and the hot spots where they exit, and there are observations of superluminal and superluminal jets in a few sources (Taylor et al. 2000; Pfingerstrm et al. 2003). However, as the axis of the universe is not homogeneous, we have to contend with other theories of polarization. These theories may also affect the shape of the polarized beam (gugliucci et al. 2007) or the absorption of atomic gases associated with the hypothesized gas and dust torus that surrounds the central engine and is thought to be oriented perpendicular to the jet axis (peck et al. 2000, pihlstrm et al “Let us now consider the chronology of the cso 1946 + 708, spanning sixteen years. We assume the coordinates xm_1_ 73 7[2] , we assume the cosmological properties of 1[3]2] and the standard cosmology, so that xm_1=1 935 kpc and an angular velocity of 1 mas / y=5 . 98 c at the redshift (0 . a] of the radio galaxy 1946 + 708 [4] (peck & taylor, 2001] , the observations in 1995, 1998, and 2001 were made with all the ten elements of the vlba, which we have used in the analysis of the cso – in fact, with all the ten elements of the vlba, which we have followed over the ten years. The age of the csos of the 1946+ 708 cso is calculated by estimating the separation speed of the hot spots over time and comparing it with the overall spatial separation (owsianik & conway 1998; gugliucci et al. 2005) . at the moment, the csos ages appear to be proportionally younger compared to younger sources. The csos have been measured at xmath1= 71 km s @ xmath3 mpc vlbl , 1 = 1 - 835 kpc @ xmath3 and an angular velocity of 1 mas / y = 5 . . . . . the initial amplitude measurement and the final calibration were made in difmap. For the last three observations, we observed only in right circular polarization. . . . all the observations were grouped into quadratic lines . . . the coaxial connector produced 16 frequency channels in each quadratic line during each 2 s integration. and from the ANSA from schwab and cotton 1983. calibration of each antenna was performed with the amplitude measurements of the antenna gain and the temperature during each run. . . . the parallactic angle effects resulting from the antenna mountings were removed using the aips task clcor. phase corrections were carried out for each antenna, allowing the polarization of each antenna to vary in polarization. All of the stations had their clocks examined for the last three days in the same polar position. For our last three observations, the most recent observations were taken in the right circular direction. For our last three observations, the 5 ghz was measured only in the right circular direction. This procedure was repeated for each polarization, so that the component shapes of each frequency could be ascertained. The analysis of gaussian components was also performed in difmap. The dimensionality of the components was fixed on the 1995 epoch; in the other epochs, each component was allowed to move and to vary in flux density, to accommodate the independently-calibrated visibility data. We may therefore add that the 282 and 708 objects have not been seen at any time since July, 1995. The 942 (R-2) observations covered from March, 1995 to June, 2008 and have noise levels of 163 @ xmath6 / beam, and a maximum of 38 @ xmath6 / beam ( Table 1) . The source is remarkably symmetrically symmetric (see Figures 1 and 2); it arises from a compact, flat spectrum of air, bends slowly and attains a high-pressure zone. From the core, the jets depart from the core in good-defined, jet-shaped folds. This jet produces, in short, a strong and distinct jet component. This source is an excellent source of strong, distinct jet components . . . , small lobes of emission can be seen at 90 o'clock, and they are observed at 90 o'clock in our epoch. In addition to the known pairs of n2 and s2 and n5 , we report here on the discovery of a new group of components, a set of components called n6 and s6 (fig. 2) . like the previous set, these new components seem to have been launched simultaneously and seem to be moving from the core in opposite directions. It is not impossible to suppose that the tidal-core flux density and the flux density of the new components n6 and s6 have been growing in the past and have now lost their strength, and it seems that these tend to decline thereafter, as the new components move away from the core. Fig. 4 gives a graphic representation of the positions of the four most powerful jet components (n2 and n5; see the movie (fig. 5), and see the movie (fig. 6). Moreover, the speed of the less distant (n2 - s5) jet component is about half the speed of the inner (n2 - s5) - part of the distance. The more distant part of the jet component (n2 - s5) is moving at about half the speed of the inner component (n5 - s5), which is nearly the opposite direction. note that these are apparent speeds projected in the plane of the sky, as opposed to intrinsic, three-dimensional velocities. the shortest component (n2 - s5), n5 and s5, seem to move at a maximum of apparent velocity (table 2 and fig. 5; see also the movie (Marius, gbtaylor - s5), seems to be moving at roughly half the apparent velocity of the inner component (n5 - s5), and if the current velocity is unchanged, then the n5 - s5 pair will move slower, but this is not observed. ---- in the middle, so that the heat is directed toward the northern hot spot, so that a deceleration region should not be overlooked. ---- for the newest pair of components, n6 and s6 , their total apparent separation speed is a value of -72c, more like the n2 / s2 pair ( 0 . 63 c) than the n5 / s5 pair ( 1 . 4 c). This, of course, conforms to the rotational symmetry of 1946 + 708 and has been observed over many years of the galactic jet in ss433 (Roberts et al. 2008, hjellming & johnston 1981) . - As a helical model, the intrinsic velocity remains constant, but the orientation changes, so that the apparent velocity is altered. this, in the helical cosmology, the actual velocity is fixed and the observed, repeated movements, might be linked to a helical cosmology . in a helical cosmology, the intrinsic velocity can be constant, and the orientation changes time, so that the observed variations in the apparent velocities can be inferred. In the more distant north cosm (n2 ) there are kinks in the apparent motion near epochs 1994, 2001 and 2006 (epochs 2 , 7 and 9 in fig. 4), a minor-displaced correction of y2 shows that this cosm has a flatter spectrum on the eastern side of this component. By analogy with these core-jet sources we draw the same conclusion that the jets of 1946 + 708 are magnetically driven. Thus, taking into account the movement of the core-jet, which is traditionally in the range of xmath 10 to xmath 12 at an intrinsic velocity of xmath 12, we are able to determine that n5 and s5 are at the same time ejected, and n2 and s2 . very heedful observations at 8 - 4 MHz (see fig. 2 ) indicate that the jet is continually emitting from the source to both hot spots. Note that the velocities of the jet-jet components in the agns of 1946 + 708 are generally in the range of 1 . 3 , quite large than the one observed in cso 1946 + 708 of 1 . 3 ... 2 ... , see below. , we are fortunate to witness the ejection of n6 and s6 in cso 1947 + 708 , as outlined above. With the assumption that the components are ejected in pairs and that all the differences are due to doppler and light travel time differences, we can take the observed apparent velocity ratios and differences to the determination of the angle between them and the line of sight. This corresponds directly to the distances of apparent projected distances from the source ... ‘Taken together, the relation between the two equations is shown in Figure 6. Considering the usual cosmology and h  xmath4 = 71 km s xmath3 mpc  xmath3 , h  xmath4 = a distance of 0.5 km from the source, 0.5                                                                      ,    , ,  ,  and    ,  . , , ,   , . . . . the presence of  is inevitable, the phenomenon is absent. The nature of  is dependent on the distance, and  is independent on the amplitude of . Similarly, since h  xmath4 is a bit more than c, we see no reason why the latter is not more than c, and for the rest of this discussion we adopt h  xmath4 = 71 km s  xmath3 mpc  xmath3 . these solutions are based on the assumption that the components in a pair, as seen, are radially opposite and equal in speed. Therefore, in a combination, the distance and angle solutions are applied, implying that the younger, approaching component should be observed at a slightly younger age (25 - 75 %) than the approaching one, and at a smaller projected distance from the core. Hence the arm length ratios derived from the history of the components – the greater symmetry of the arms – implies that the components remained slower and / or moved more along the plane of the sky for a significant part of their lifetime, or rather moved more along the plane of the sky. But the observed arm length ratios are slightly lower than the apparent velocity ratios (1. 93 vs. 2 - 77 for n2 / s2; 1 - 80 vs. 3 – n5 - 5) – in conjunction with this we derive a line of sight depth of about 45 mm, which means that the axis of the viewer’s vision is an appreciable fraction of the total distance along the connecting line from the core, and roughly equal to the distance projected onto the plane of the sky. a new comparison between the ratios of n2 and n5 is presented in Fig. 2 (the standard equation of n2 and n5 is given below) and also a differentially increasing angle of about 15 degrees, and by about 50 % of that the difference in speed and angle (by at least 15 degrees) between n2 and n5 is very important for interpreting the changes in the component velocity that evidently occur along the jets. The discrepancy in the arm length ratios and the bending of the projection of the overall jets in the plane of the sky provide useful constraints. Thus, n2 and n5 have shown an increasing increase over the course of 13 years, while s5 has shown a slight decrease. Nevertheless, if we assume, however, that the light from s5 is delayed compared with that from n5 (by 27 years for the 2008 epoch, according to the geometry derived above), we must take into account the history of variability when interpreting the flux density ratios of the two components. In this case, it may not be possible to explain the very significant changes in the flux density, as shown in fig. 5. but the southern hemisphere is relatively faint and diffuse, and thus less able to be modelled than the smaller hemispheres. Even if there is no firm evidence for deviations from constant hemispheres, there do seem to be some kinks in the jets, especially in the earlier five ghz measurement c1 in Fig. 4 , this indicates a change of direction several degrees. In the alternative, the appearance of two images of the same era, well separated in time, has a gradient of the apparent motion of each. The observed motion is in accordance with Xmath70. - y-, as a result of which there is a systematic apparent velocity for all the elements. The observed motion is @xmath70. y - as a result of the fact that the result of the models is directed to the core, it also has to be understood that a proper motion of the core is caused by the ejection of the n6 / s6 pair . in this case the apparent motion is very clear. it is clear that the motion is much slower than the jet components. (Jonathan & Xuande, 1997), in order to achieve a constant expansion, the velocity of the northern hot spot is measured, and thus is the kinematic age for 1946 and 708 assuming an unchanged expansion rate. The velocity measurement obtained above yields a kinematic age of 4000, or 5000 a thousand years. The velocity measurement which is based on the expansion rate of the northern hot spot (based on model fitting) gives a numerical age of 4000 a thousand years. The density of the field between the two hot spots is at a near parity, 0 . . . The core is less than 0 . . 4 %, the jets are less than 0 . . 1 %, the southern hot spot is a little closer to the core. The greater flux density in the north side is the result of a stronger inner environment (e.g., peck & taylor 2001). The cold light occurs in the north as well, which is very low (cf. . . . ) . Further, the effect of selection is that the slow expansions take longer to measure. All the given epochs of the interferometric universe were thus covered. The total density of the electrical spectrum was mapped to a time of xmath04000 years, and a considerably shallower, lighter optical film was thus arranged. During a detailed, multi-frequency, multi-epoch analysis of the compact symmetrical object in question, we have concluded that the kinematic age of the imprinted signal is about xmath04000 years, which means the jets are highly constrained, and lie within the overall symmetrical universe, as we have seen. The flux histories of the jets can be more closely correlated, and one could ascertain the extent to which they have been connected with the environment. the jets, in general, seem well confined, and lie in the overall symmetrical shape of the jets - we suggest that they are not ballsistic, but helically confined. The information obtained from the statistical analysis of the 1939 and 2039 years, found the radio emission to be @ xmath04000 years. And, on timescales of 10-12 years, the symmetrical components emerge from the core, and move at intrinsic speeds between 0 . 6 and 0 . 9 c towards the hot spots.
