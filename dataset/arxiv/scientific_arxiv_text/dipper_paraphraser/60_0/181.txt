, water vapor is an important molecule for the chemistry of clouds in the spherical and circumstellar spheres. Other h           at 22  , which is derived from 700  has been measured in cheung et al. (1969) to trace in the vicinity of high excitation gas around forming stars and evolved stars. In this line, there is a 5     2         , 5           2   3      2   2    2             3                    2 That is, these are the emissions of several h-x-math3o lines in the orion irc2 and the other clouds. However, no maps have been obtained. a single enhancement in h-x-math3o's emission spectrum could be found by observing a transition of h-x-math3o with characteristics similar to those of the 183 h-x-math7 line. the na-bm-zoe1's 325 h-x-math3o lines of h-x-math3o from the north of the transverse channels of the sgrb2 and corresponding molecular clouds were obtained by Cernicharo et al. (1997). It has been established that water vapor is an ubiquitous element in molecular clouds with an abundance of a number of 10 @ x-math7. However, the iso observations of h-x-math3o are obstinate. Besides the lack of spectral resolution and high opacity of the thermal lines, h-x-math3o's far-infrared scope prevents the detailed study of the spatial organization and physical properties of the h-x-math3o . therefore, an important aid in the derivation of h-x-math3o's abundances could come from the observation of another transition of h-x-math3o similar to that of the 183 ghz line . however, no maps were obtained . The atmosphere was stable during the observations, with an atmospheric pressure of 620 mb and a temperature of one .4 @ xmath27c, and the relative humidity of 0.5 - 0.5 %. The instrument was a 1024 channel acousto-optical spectrometer, covering a bandwidth of 500 mhz (@ xmath25v = 1 . 1 kms . ) . the point was determined by looking at the same line at the o-rich X-ray structure, and it was found to be accurate to 5 . (fig. 1) Figure 1 shows the observed spectrum, which matches very well the previous observations by menten et al. ( 1990b) except for the intensity of the line . . . . the pointing was determined by pointing the same line towards the o-rich evolved star vy cma and it was found to be accurate to 5 . The temperature and the pressure were very stable during the observations, and the temperature was 620 mb and - 1 . 4 . xmath27c. , and the relative humidity was measured to be 7-8 % . The pointing was calculated by observing the same line in the a-rich developed star vy cma and found to be accurate to 5 . The geographical distribution of the 325 ghz h @ xmath3o line is shown in Figure 2 along with that of ch @ xmath3o (from the image side band) and that of cer94 . integrated intensity maps for selected intervals are shown in Figure 2 . the spatial distribution of the 325 ghz h @ xmath3o lines is shown in Figure 2 together with the c c c c c c c c c, together with the line profiles of ch @ xmath3o (from the image side band) and the 183 ghz emission from cer94 . rather than a change in the maser emission (the line profile in Figure 1 is identical to that of the menten et al. (1996)) , we think that this difference is caused by much better atmospheric transmission. Moreover, the weather was excellent, with a zenith opacity at the frequency of @ xmath4 . The spectra, together with those obtained in 1994, are shown in Figure 3 . As a result of the integration of the three-point c.vs, a spatial distribution of the 325 ghz h    3 2  12  0 1 ’s ’ t’s – ’ t ‘(183) – have a well-defined and quite valid definition of the term ‘Major, corresponding to the E’ (see Figure 2); in fact, the values of ‘Major, corresponding to ‘Major,’ – i.e., ‘Major,’ are found at other places in the cloud (see Figure 2), and represent a real difference in the brightness of the two lines . . ., there are also some narrow, small, narrow elements at 325 ghz, but with intensities of a few k, that is, much weaker than those described by cer94. the observations of this frequency in the month of July 1999 clearly indicate a certain variation in the intensity of certain of these narrow structures, the wavelengths of which are almost two arcseconds high (cer94, gonzlez-alfonso 1995) . . . . but Xmath30 changes extremely from feature to feature, revealing the higher mass of the emission. Only at position Xmath35 = - 12 , Xmath36 = To understand the behaviour of the two line, we have modeled the radiative transfer of the rotational levels of p-h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - , as described in gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo (1997), which is a dense, cold shell, a diameter of t - xmath 39 - 450 pc , at constant velocity of 25 km s - h - , thereby requiring very large column density to reproduce the observed brightness temperatures of the maser areas at 22 ghz - - , for example, to reproduce the 183 ghz and the 325 ghz intensity, thereby forming a thermal or a suprathermal 183 ghz line. Moreover, the vaporous and extended emission, noted by cer94, clearly shows the presence of water vapour coexisting with the molecular gas in the ridge of the orion. The ratio of helium and water vapour, calculated from green , maluendes & mclean (1997), assuming a value of a helium abundance 0, and adjusted to account for the collisions between h @ xmath3o and h@ xmath3o. All the numbers are drawn from the ion flux and the temperature are given by ion flux and digits, and the ion flux is given by ion flux, and as a result the ion flux is quite large, it is the radiance that is greater than the sum of the points, namely the figure – by a function of the intensity, i.e. the shape of the grain, the axe, and the utmost width – equals one, while at another, the ion flux is reduced by an exponential amplification of the 325 flux, resulting in an increase of i.e. xmath30, with the exception of the lines at 183 and 325, which are saturated at low irradiation (which are dependent on t – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – h – t – h – d – s the line at 183 – the one at 183 – and the one at 325 – that is the one where the line at 183 – and the maser at 183 – becomes saturated and the exponential amplification of the 325 line makes the line decrease at xmath30 and reduce by a factor of 1 for high n (p – h – h - In other words, the higher n (h @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath41, the lower n (p-h @ xmath3 ) which is needed to amplify the 325 ghz line. However, some of these models are not in keeping with the observed intensities. - In various panels for n (p-h @ xmath3), n (h @ xmath3) = @ xmath43 , t @ xmath43 , t @ xmath54 k - we find that r * @ xmath55 yields t @ xmath31 (355) in excess of t @ xmath54, t @ xmath54 150 k , we find that r * @ xmath55 yields t @ xmath31 (355) - 183 - @ xmath54 - 183 - @ xmath54 - 45  371 - 36 - a at least a small attenuation of the 183 ghz line - the physical reason is that for high values of n (h @ xmath3) and t @ xmath41 - we see that the density of the 183 ghz line becomes so efficient that the emission from this line reaches high intensities for column densities that give t @ xmath31 (183 ) @ xmath54 @ xmath55 - It is only for the higher temperature and density, as shown in Figure 4, that we obtain brightness temperatures above 10 @ xmath59 @ xmath545, and n (h @ xmath3 ) @ xmath53 @ xmath43 @ xmath45 . Thus, the density of x (h @ xmath3o) in the axes of the molecular cloud is below one. Therefore, in the ridge ring, the density of 325 ghz is very weak. We derived the column density of a coaxial wind of 10 @ xmath63 @ xmath47 .. therefore, x (h @ xmath3o) in the range @ xmath60 @ xmath61 @ xmath47 . . . the lower limit for n (h @ xmath3o) and t (h @ xmath3) is 0.75, the lower limit for n (h @ xmath3o) in the range @ xmath60 @ xmath51 @ xmath53 @ xmath45 and t (h @ xmath41) = 100150 k . . . . In the ridge molecular cloud the density of 325 ghz is very low. cernicharo and e . gonzlez-alfonso acknowledge the Spanish dges for this research under the Grants pb96 - 0883 and Pp 96 - 1351e. pardo thanks the financial support of the telegraphs of Paris-Mudon, cnes-de-france and mto-france . . .
