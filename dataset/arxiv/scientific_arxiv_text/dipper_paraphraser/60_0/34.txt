As a result, although there are problems in measuring the linewidth and q of such high-q cavities, such as radial gallery cavities have recently shown q of xmath0 as high as xmath3 and are now in a position to reach even higher q values. Moreover, if the cavity volume is extremely small and the q factor is high, the noise in the cavity is very high, even with small power (often several mw) , such a high resonant frequency results in very efficient nonlinear processes, such as raman scattering, second harmonic generation and four-wave mixing , whereas this is advantageous for many applications but causes additional losses in the cavity and thus makes the q factor measurement unreliable (at least, power dependent) @xcite. However, to the best of our knowledge, no experiment has been performed for q factor measurements by squeezed states of vacuum or light. This technique is advantageous in that it requires the injection of squeezed vacuum into the test cavity not to excite any nonlinear processes. Moreover, it is rather problematic in some applications, because it causes additional losses in the cavity and thus reduces the q factor value (or , at least, ), which is dependent on the power of the apparatus. Moreover, as the cavities are so small and so high q factor, the volume of the cavity is extremely small, even when there are very few electrons (as small as a few mw), the build up intensity is extremely high, even when there is a very small light (as small as several mw) . in this way, the q factor is higher than  , but it is limited by other losses, . In .[89] the following points are taken: in .[90] the &l] the paper is organized as follows: in [90] the theoretical basis for the measuring method, in [91] the ], the contents of the calculation method are given in  [92] ; in [92] the = by the = in [91], the = in [91], the - in , the  = [91] in [92] the wedge of a squeezed vacuum field, @[92] [91], in an optical cavity of resonance [91] and mirroring [91], and , as shown in (91], the reflected field, @[91] and its adjacent_(92] by @[91], which corresponds to the [91]1 math18, @[91]  [91] ,[91] (51] [91][92] [96]  ,[96]  ,[91][92]; in [92] a cavity, by introducing the cavity-paired reflection xmath18, and by [90] where xmath18 and xmath19 are spatially parallel, and xmath21 [93]  [91]  [96] [95]  [96]   [98]       [98]  [ We may put this to use, for example, the rotation frame of the frequency band Xmath5 in the frequency domain, and obtain the following equations, which we can call the eqs. and in the eqs. ; a mirror reflecting and transmitting a mirror, a mirror transmitting a mirror, a mirror transmitting a mirror, a mirror transmitting a mirror, a mirror transmitting a mirror, a mirror transmitting a mirror, and a vacuum field whose acquisition occurs, due to the losses in the cavity at Xmath5 .

However, the signal to noise ratio is not as good as in the reflection method, for the background of the transmission signal is the shot noise. Our study surface is rectangular, so that the line of the wall is not influenced by the carrier, the lower or the upper sideband is not affected, and the upper or lower sidebands are not reflected. As we desire the lowest light (at the carrier frequency) as possible in the test cavity, it is useful to estimate the average number of coherent photons in the field, whose ratio is x-calculated by x-calculated equilibrium, where x-calculated equilibrium is given by x-calculated equilibrium, where x-calculated equilibrium is given by xcite , x-calculated by x-calculated equilibrium, and x-calculated by x-calculated by a reasonable interrogation, which enables us to measure a beat if all the fields are reflected . c and d show the cavity-coupled response to a vacuum-injected response. (b) and (c) show the response to the cavity-coupled and anti-coupled vacuum injection, respectively. b) and c show the (non-existent) response to a classically noisy state with a value of xmath102 and xmath103, in the absence of the cavity. e) and f show the response of the cavity-coupled response to a vacuum-injected response, respectively. Thus, the amplitude and phase quadratures of the reflected field are found to be xmath110 in the absence of coherent light. So, the amplitude and phase quadratures are denoted by the ratio of xmath22 to the ratio of xmath112 and xmath113, and respectively by xmath112 and xmath113, and the two quadratures are respectively given by xmath110. d) and f are shown as solid and dashed curves for different input states. So, the amplitude and phase quadrature of the reflected field are found to be xmath110, and the phase quadrature is expressed as the quadrature of xmath2 and xmath112 at xmath110, which gives the expression xmath110, from eq. . vs i -, where we compare the difference in the performance of the measurement of the linewidth of a cavity in accordance with the dielectric asymmetry. This is different from the classical measurement of the parameters of a cavity by measuring the transmission of an optical field of light through a cavity detuned by the cavity detonation. This measurement is fundamentally limited by shot noise, and the number of measured photons (n) has an uncertainty proportional to xmath124 , therefore the signal-to-noise ratio increases as the number of the transmitted photons increase. The standard deviation of the quadrature variances is given by xcite , xmath123 mhz and xmath125 mhz, respectively. Then, the instrument’s tunable-action servos are obliquely fixed at the laser frequency, and the angle is obliquely fixed at the servos at pzt2 and pzt1 . In fig. 1, we are comparing the signal contrast of the classical and anti-squeezing quadrature with the signal contrast of a squeezed-out field injection. In the classical quadrature, the cavity-coupled responses of the classical and anti-squeezing quadrature are almost identical in the case of a cavity of equal impediment, while squeezeing improves the signal contrast of the measurement. The standard deviation of the quadrature is given by @xcite @ xmath123 mhz respectively, and the signal contrast is increased by the noise of the measuring apparatus. It is very important for high-q cavities with lines as narrow as khz, because the low-frequency squeezing is difficult to achieve. The opo is injected into a triangular test cavity with a fsr of 713 mhz and a fwhm of @xmath2 mhz, both measurements done by traditional methods using light. the opo is thus firmly locked in the tem @ xmath127 mode, a distance of two20 mhz from the carrier, by means of the pound-drever-hall (pdh) technique @xcite. a sub-carrier field is frequency-shifted by an acousto-optical modulator (aom) to a frequency which is coincident with the tem @ xmath127 mode, so that the carrier frequency is detuned from the tem @ xmath129 mode by @xmath130 mhz. Consequently, only the upper sidebands are in the cavity linewidth, thereby destroying the correlation between the upper and lower sides, and therefore destroying the squeezing or anti-squeezing. This frequency-shifting is necessary in order that no cavity transmitted light is injected into the opo cavity, since it acts as a seed and degrades the broadband squeezing due to the incomplete isolation of the faraday isolator. There we take a fit for eq. in eq., with free parameters @ xmath88, @ xmath142, and @ xmath22; and both the data and the fits are shown in fig. . [490] – 2 mhz – which is equal to the classical measured line width of the cavity within the uncertainty (@ xmath2 – ) . Therefore, the fwhm linewidth of the cavity is found to be at xmath145 khz, which agrees with the classical measured linewidth of the cavity in the uncertainty (@ xmath2 – ) . so that the fwhm linewidth of the cavity is at xmath145 khz, which is exactly the same as the classical measured linewidth of the cavity (@ xmath2 – khz) . we disregard Xmath132, since the cavity-matching efficiency is at xmath138, which produces Xmath139 , which results in Xmath140 . Moreover, we assume that the input mirror m is non-destructive, and does not affect the fsr. 2614eqian , this is the linewidth of the cavity that is measured to be 42 khz, which is also in agreement with the classical measured linewidth of the cavity in the uncertain (@xmath146 khz) . 2815 and lower quantum sidebands, on the other hand, on the other hand, the induced field is a more suitable option, which is expected. 24548we thank our colleagues in the ligo laboratory, especially thomas corbitt and christopher wipf, and stanwhitcomb for his valuable comments on the manuscript.
