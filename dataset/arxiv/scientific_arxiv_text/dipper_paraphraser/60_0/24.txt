During the first billion years after the big bang, the first stars and galaxies were born and they were transformed from opaque to transparent . . . but there is still much uncertainty as to the source of reionization . . . It is known now that reionization is completed by observations of the ly- x-ma forest , e. g. x-ma forest , e. g. x-ma forest, and that the universe was ionized nearly as soon as redshift a was less than 600 m, according to the electron scattering oblique depths measured by planck-x-ma. . . . agn - x-ma , e. g. , - x-ma forest, e. g. - x-ma. This study, which has a huge impact on the knowledge of the near-IR detection of galaxies in this time. Its progress was thus drastically extended. During this time, the wide-field camera (wfc3) was installed on the 'hubble space telescope' (hst), a continually growing, continually growing sample of the candidate galaxies. These ranged from small, ultra-deep observations, such as the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) to narrower, more extensive surveys, like the cosmic assembly near-IR survey ( Candels; @xcite); or, exploiting random points, such as in the cheapest of reionizing galaxies (borg) survey (Go : 0000 , 12572 Moreover, a slight departure from a schechter form might indicate a lower efficiency of feedback processes, and in turn imply an increase in the production of ionizing photons by galaxies. In addition to determining the shape of the lf, the brightest high-level candidates identified by _hst_ are also excellent targets for follow-up observations in order to infer the starry density, the ages and masses of the stars, ionization of the ionization state of the igm, and spectroscopic redshift . in addition to constraining the shape of the lf, the brightest high-level candidates identified by _hst_ are also ideal targets for follow-up observations to infer stellar population properties, such as ages and masses of stars, ionization state of the igm, and spectroscopic redshift . Moreover, at xmath24 the observed number density of bright galaxies is influenced by a double-power law, which can give the lf a double-power law . the spectroscopic observation of sources at xmath25 is extremely difficult, with no limits on the emission of lines. The brightest candidates show considerable promise in the latest observations. - the spectroscopic finding of xmath26 with xmath33 (@xcite - see also xcite - .) The results of xmath31 of the dataset (@ xmath32 arcmin @ xmath5) led to the identification of two candidates in xmath3 at xcite, which are similar in luminosity to the spectroscopically confirmed source of xmath26 at xcite, but substantially brighter than the six xmath34 - xmath35 dropouts identified in the goods / candels fields of the same area, @ xcite. This represents a catalog of galaxies without a wide-scale structure bias (or cosmic variance; see xcite), which is particularly severe for rare sources lying in huge dark matter halos (@ xmath29), as observed from clustering data at xmath18@ xcite. [236] . . . now a new campaign of observations is underway, with a modified filter set optimized for the new frontier of redshift detection at @ xmath23 (borg [Z9] - 10] - + . This is a catalog of galaxies not affected by large-scale structure bias (semic, cosmic variance; see @ xcite) , which is especially severe for rare sources seated in massive dark matter halos (@ xmath29) as has been derived from clustering measurements at @ xmath18 - We refer to the dr3 foreground as ‘the dr3 field’, ‘the dr3 field’, ‘the dr4 field’, ‘the dr4 field’ and ‘the dr4 field’ as ‘the dr4 field’, ‘the dr4 field’ and ‘the dr4 field’. All fields were imaged using the dr3 / ir filters f098 m, f125 w and f160 w, and the optical dr4 field of view was given by either the dr3 f606 f600 lp filter or the dr3 f600 lp filter. We refer to the dr3 f098 m, f125 lp, and dr4 f606 lp filter as the dr4 field of view @xmath45, @xmath38 and dr446, and to the dr3 f606 lp filter as dr4 and dr4 , respectively. and we note that the data comes from parallel observations that have been carried out by the primary instrument (cos or stis), and so that there is no direct correlation between the magnitudes. But because of the large amount of pigment in the XMorph*,  46ml1, and the the amount of red-tinted light on the surface of the space, the density of the light in the XMorph**** is insignificant, and, for that reason, 9 out of 71 fields are left in our study, and we include only those fields which have a total exposure time of xMorph* for the XMorph**, and in the XMorph* sound, and the weight of the light at xMe326 (see also xme326) , and following our scaling, by comparing the noise in the image at random positions that are not associated with the detected sources (i.e., the “shadowy sky” noise) and comparing the measurement with the value inferred from the XMe326 sound, which then can be multiplied by a multiplicative factor to the measurement. Moreover, photometric zero-points are corrected to account for the galactic reddening along the line of sight, according to xcite. The borg z8 public data release is composed of reduced and aligned science images produced with multidrizzle @ xcite, with a pixel scale of @xmath56, and associated weight maps (see @xcite) . According to Sextractor  @xcite in a dual-image mode, we create the catalogues of sources in each field and then we use the xmath46 image for detection . a - in the pass band, and the non- detection in the pass band, - in the passband, we need the passband sextector  star parameter - we do not include the passband sextector  class - star - (where 1 is the source, 0 is the diffuse light profile - - i) - we impose a sharper passband - to trade completeness for greater purity, and to require a color cut - - - by - xmath-67, which is more conservative than the standard  x-61 applied to other fields (e.g. @xcite) - since we do not have the opportunity to collect multiple-observer data - namely - a horizontal passband - x-math-66, where 0 is the light beam, - and - ftie - x-math-67, - a waveless passband, - d. - – he is – he is – he is – he is, he is – he is, he is – he is, the – and the – and – he – he is – he – 1 – he is – 1 – he is – he is – he is, he is, he is – he is – he is – 1 – he is – he is – he is, he is, at times a certain length of time, the time of his recitation – he is, he is, 1274 – 18 – he is, at once, the father of a ‘civil’ and ‘devament’ of the –analyst for the purpose of spherical decisions, and it is only with the use of a partial recollection that he concludes that he has not selected – to be the principal source – for a certain amount of time, of all those values, then the subsequent statistics and the same fractions and proportions of the quantities, have been found.

In this respect, we compute the mass of the candidates, starting from the observed half-light (effective) radius as determined by sextractor, which is translated into an intrinsic mass, a consequence of which is the effect of the spreading-spread function (psf) broadening and surface brightness limit of @xcite . The proportions of the photographic probability distributions are illustrated in Figure 1 and 2 below the images of the candidates. The empirical relation is obtained by scaling and recovering artificial sources with known dimensions and dimensions into borg images. we calculate the size of the candidates, starting from the observed half-light radius, as determined by the sextractor, which is translated into an intrinsic source size, taking into account the effects of the broadening function and the spherical brightness limits following @xcite . These two candidates, in particular, are particularly bright in xmath46; they are consistent with previously discovered candidates in xmath39 by xcite. These two candidates, however, are particularly bright in xmath46, and are consistent with previous discoveries in xmath39 by xcite. The estimation of Xmath46 sources by xcite is helpful in discriminating between high- and low-lying sources, since direct measurements of xcite on electrons galaxies show that xmath95 sources are less compact than xmath96 contaminants with similar colors. This proportion might be due to an approximate scaling of the sizes of the sources, as @ xcite has done on correloquins, and the S. W.

This source is not in the other bands (@math38 , @math45 , math44 math114 ), this object is more compact, it has a measured half-light radius @ xmath115 . it is the most extended source in the sample, math105 . this source is not detected in the other bands ( @ xmath38, @ xmath45 or @ x The horizontal radii of the foreground objects are drawn from the various isothermal spheres (e.g., @xcite), which depend on the velocity of the perpendicular space between the source and the lens, and between the lens and the source (of which we have the best photo-xmath24 values) . if the source is at xmath123 (which maximizes the magnification of the lens) we infer a magnification at xmath124. This object has a magnitude at xmath130 and has s/n at xmath131 . it is not detected in xmath46, xmath45, or xmath44. the Source is located relatively close (for example, @ xmath123) to a hot pixel, which appears in the xmath45 and xmath38 images. a velocity of xmath125 ( @ xmath126) and is detected only in xmath46, with a narrow but compact structure (effective radius @ xmath127). if the source is located at xmath123 (which maximizes the magnification of the lens) then we infer a magnification @ xmath124 . "Recently the field was revealed to contain a misconfigured pixel, well identified and concealed by the cut-off machine, at the edge of the segmentation map of the drop-out candidate in one of the two xmath46 frames. In order to verify the source is real, and that the light-curve is in good condition, we carried out a secondary analysis of xmath138. the sixth and last candidate was confidently detected at xmath138 in xmath120, and in xmath38 with s/n = 3 . . . the sixth and final candidate was confidently detected at s/n @ xmath138 in xmath46 ( @ xmath120), and also in xmath38 ( @ xmath140). the photometric redshift was sharply peaked at @ xmath138, with a secondary solution at @ xmath140. To translate the results obtained by searching for possible candidates at xmath 3 from the archived borg z8 data into the number density and luminosity of our sample, we must first assess the contamination in our sample, and the volume that is probed by the data. This candidate is also very compact, with a measured half-light radius @ xmath141 and the highest stellarity of the sample (class _ star = 0.91) . By reducing this sample to the depth of a black hole in the full glass chamber, we are not able to exclude all stars from our sample. The results we obtain show that the average density of extreme ultraviolet radiation which may enter the selection process is approximately 200 ppm per arcmin. @ xcite are able to differentiate outwardly the excess of the extreme ultraviolet radiation from a low-color contaminant, so that all the light emitted from an extreme ultraviolet radiation is due to a strong ultraviolet radiation. Moreover, this value is in keeping with the previous spectroscopic observations made by @ xcite with the mosfire spectrograph of the keck telescope and by @ xcite with the xshooter spectrograph of the very large telescope. These studies have shown no emitted line in the spectroscopic analysis of the extinguished borgs and are therefore able to distinguish between them emitted lines of a low-emission, to xmath152, assuming that the flux of a strong extinguisher is all the emitted by a strong extinguisher. , so we conclude that this source is most likely a stellar source with extraordinary colors. It was found that the actual size of the candidates in the @xcite sample was approximately @xmath72, but the low redshift and the irac-red interlopers were approximately @xmath158. This size was not a basis for rejecting extreme emission-line galaxies, which would have been extremely unlikely to be present at xmath164. The source examined in the @xcite experiment was much smaller than the candidate in our sample. The brighter galaxies in the @xcite experiment were somewhat 34 xmath164 , compared with the estimated size of @xmath165 (the brightest in our sample) , had an indistinct spectrum. Using the size-to-size relation in the @xcite experiment, we infer that the size of a galaxy at xmath164 (the brightest in our sample) would be @ xmath165, below our threshold of xmath164. @xcite will be a means of determining the size of the source , for, by using the size-to-lensity relation in the @xcite experiment, the amount of a dark source — an emission-line galaxies which, it is conceivable, may be due to the higher brightness of borg _ 0240 - 1857 - 369 — should be as much to do with the darker sources. In the present experiment we conclude that three of the six candidates, borg 1459 + 7146 + 785 , borg 0240- 1857 - 129 , and borg 0240- 1857 - 369, are probably contaminants. It is still possible that the contamination of the other three is a possibility, and therefore we are recommending a conservative assumption of xmath168 contamination (two out of three sources @ xmath169) based on the average probability @ xmath168 for the candidates in their sample. Further investigations are extremely interesting, as they can either identify an unexpectedly bright source at xmath11, or lighten the properties of intermediate redshifts. - The interpretation of this fact is compatible with the theoretical expectations, in which the presence of clustering can be used to verify the existence of bright sources at xcite, under the broad assumption that the uv luminosity is correlated with the density of dark matter (e.g., @ xcite) . However, one alternative, more in keeping with the relatively large extent of the two brightest dropouts, would be the presence of an intermediate redshift group. It’s the sum of the internal profiles of the sources which are then mapped to the wfc3 psf for each corresponding filter, and then inserted into the borg science images at random. The intrinsic profiles of the artificial sources are convolved with the psf of corresponding filters, and are then inserted in the borg science images at random. The spectra of the sources are modelled as a power law of xmath180, with a gaussian distribution, and with a sharp cut-off at the distance-frame @ xmath180 . . . the results are derived from simulations, if the sources are identified and the recoverable . . . . bottom-panel: an example of the selection function of xmath185 for field borg 0440 - 5244 . . . , size = . . . . the results are calculated from simulations and as a function of xmath46 . . . Similarly, as compared to the initial results from the ongoing borg[9] survey of xcite [10] , we do not find any evidence of ultra-bright sources (instead of more than twice the area covered by the samples). Also, our higher limits of the lf are similar to those of former studies and therefore, moreover, strengthen the proof that the abundance of galaxies can be suppressed at the bright end of the lf. , it is a fact that our estimates of the lf at xcite [9] are more than unconstrained fits and can be inferred from the former studies. Compared with the preliminary results of the ongoing survey of the borg_z9-1000 on @xcite, we do not find evidence of ultra-bright (@xcite) galaxies, although the data covered more than twice the area. In our estimation, our lf is higher, but still averring at xmath190 the theoretical model of xcite (shown in gray and gray in figure figlf). So the probability landscape is very flat in a wide area of the parameter space, and hence the landscape is quite flat. If our subsequent observations indicate that our sources are indeed at high redshift, we would find that the lf was higher at the bright end than the upper limit from xcite, and therefore compatible with the estimate from xcite at xmath190. A. If a. The result is a. The astrophysical interpretation of our search is based on the following observations, which, in view of the generality of the  () sources, and the magnification of the , can produce the effect that the  preferred the form of the power-law at the top of the , rather than on a schechter .

The proximate result is that there is a higher number of stray particles, as we already noted, at the end of the lf, than in the previous survey by Bouwens et al. (2015a, b) and by the theoretical model of mason et al. (2015c, d). Consequently, the team has now been awarded a spitzer time from our team to study the nature of the sources discussed here (pid 349). As a result, our measurements are consistent at the lf of xmath 13 with these studies. In our estimation of the lf, we find that there are already at the end of the lf much more particles, as the absence of a second band, and the absence of a coloration near uv nadir to clarify the color of the sources, who are still unknown. However, our measurements are still consistent at the lf of xmath13. However, we consider that this is quite remarkable, because the survey of borg z8 was not planned with xmath11 in mind, and there might have been a much larger number of contaminants than the observations of bouwens et al. (2015a, b), and the theoretical model of mason et al. (2015b).
