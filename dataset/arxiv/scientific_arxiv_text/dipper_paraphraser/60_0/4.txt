The results are inferred in refs., refs., refs., refs. , refs. , quot - quot , and refs. xcite - xcite. This dissatisfied effect prevents the ability of communication channels. This action is also to be mitigated by the use of partially (spatially) coherent beams. In this respect, one can consider the following conditions: (i) the ratio of the first transverse coherence length, Q0 to the beam radius Q1 is practically equal to unity; (iii) the characteristic time of the change of the particle, Q2, is much less than the integration time Q3 of the detector. However, the phenomena of non-compliance, and especially at the distance, can be illustrated by a phase diffuser disposed near the exit aperture. It is also known that the number of frequencies that arises from the radiation of the random phase determines the initial transverse coherence length of the beam. It is well known that the inequality of xmath6 can be easily satisfied by choosing a detector with very long integration time (see refs. xcite , xcite , and refs. xcite ) When you have seen the physical characteristics of the phased diffuser, you will be able to choose suitable diffusers and thus reduce the tendency to increase intensity. And thus a good choice of diffusers is possible, and if we know in detail the effect of the turbulence of the phase of the light, as a consequence of the finite time (or turbulence) on the photon statistics. The following is a simple and practical analysis of the condition of the index. The index of  xmath14 defines the mean square fluctuations of intensity. The index of Then it follows from eqs. two, three that if one knows the average of the average of the beam, the value of xmath26 can be obtained if one knows the average of the average of the four waves. This simplicity is very reasonable for the propagation of the beam over long distances. In the case of quasimonochromatic light, we can choose xmath20 in the form of xmath21, where xmath22 and xmath23 are the creation and annihilation operators of photons with momentum xmath24 , these are given in the heisenberg representation. In the case of a quasimonochromatic light, we can choose xmath20 in the form of xmath21, where xmath22 and xmath23 are the physics and creation of photons with momentum xmath24, - they are given in the heisenberg representation . . . the presence of the mentioned regions is due to two possibilities of correlating four different waves (referendum ref. xcite) which enter the right hand side of eq. . . . . In general, the equation for the quantity for the number xmath49 can be expressed as Xmath57, where Xmath58 is the tensile sum of Xmath40, but which is smaller than the characteristic transverse wave vector of the photons. Thus, the hamiltonian of the photons in a turbulent atmosphere can be regarded as independent of time , in this case the hamiltonian of the photons in a turbulent atmosphere can be considered independent of time . . . the two terms on the right hand correspond to the two axes of the four wave correlations. In the Refs. . . . . . “The Operator of Particle Mass in Phase Space” (the Distribution Function of Particle Mass in Phase Space) . . . in this respect the author used the Equation of xmath48 and he recited the Function of xmath48 in a similar way as [6], and so . . . and the corresponding equation, . . . [7], as follows: The General Solution of the Equation of xmath48 is : xmath57, where the Equation of xmath56 and xmath58 are expressed as: xmath56, where xmath55 is the Fault Index of the atmosphere. The expression for xmath68 can be obtained from eq. [12] by substituting the indexes at xmath73 and xmath74. . . . [14] with the initial conditions @ xmath63 and @ xmath75, respectively. [15] the operator on the right side of eq. [13] is related through matching the amplitudes of the laser radiation (see ref. xcite) by the relation @ xmath76, where @ xmath77 is the operator of the laser field, which is assumed to be a single-mode field, and the subscript ( @ xmath78) means the perpendicular component . [16] an integration is possible between variables @ xmath84 and @ xmath84. the integration over variables @ xmath84 can be readily seen that the factor @ xmath84 ,  ,  ] describing the effect of the phase-shielding on the beam is implicitly inserted into the integrand of eq. thirteen. “If you take the first two curves, the x, , , and  of the same period, you can be an effective junction.

For the second term at xmath98, we are able to define the difference at xmath99, and at xmath101 , we derive a simple expression for xmath102, and so in the limit case xmath106, we draw the second term at xmath103 in a form, @xmath103,     lambda c       lambda c                                             , Hence we consider the first of the two scenarios the simplest. . . . with a distinction between the spatial and temporal variables in 306 . . .

The value Xmath138 is, in fact, much less than unity, but can be a reasonable and even greater value than xmath139 . and henceforth the curves, with respect to the first coherence, are close to the curves without a diffuser , because the initial coherence is very short , even if the recording apparatus is short compared to the coherence time . . . the solid curve is calculated for Xmath118 (without a diffuser) . the other curves are for Xmath141 . . . if we know well that the diffuser reaches unity for any source distribution, provided the response time of the instrument is short compared with the coherence time . . . You will see that this physical quantity is of great importance to the performance of communication systems based on frequency-encoded information @ xcite.

This specific case is very convenient for theoremical analysis, for there are only two parameters needed to describe the effects of the diffuser. Our results show that the importance of both parameters, namely, xmath93 and xmath142, is very high for the diffuser's ability to suppress vibrations. Also, our method is applicable to the physical case, in which a spatially random phase distribution drifts across the beam. In fact, our formalism can be applied to the physical case, in which the spatially random phase distribution drifts across the beam.
