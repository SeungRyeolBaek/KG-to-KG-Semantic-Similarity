The local solar dynamo created by a global solar dynamo, by a local dynamo, or by the recycling of flux from decaying active regions? are these the results of local processes confined to the photosphere, or does the magnetic flux reach the higher layers of the atmosphere? In this study we analyze time series of polarimetric and imaging observations of the quiet sun region at the centre. Here we describe in detail the physical properties of small-scale magnetic loops in the quiet sun, estimating their magnetic fluxes, emergence rates, lifetimes, sizes, and velocities. these discrepancies are extremely important for our understanding of the magnetic and thermal structure of the solar atmosphere. According to xcite, the magnetic energy accumulated in the quiet sun is sufficient to balance the radiative losses of the chromosphere, but a mechanism for transferring it to the upper layers is still unknown. At xcite, for example, the magnetic energy accumulated in the quiet photosphere is sufficient to balance the radiative losses of the chromosphere. These calculations and their emergences are also numerical, providing estimates of the magnetic flux, the strength of the emergence, the lifetime, the size, and the velocities. These results are essential to the study of the magnetic and thermal structure of the solar atmosphere. We examine the polarimetric and imaging data of the quiet sun region from the centre. They were acquired in seven different days (September 26-29, September 1 and 6 october), and used in seven different days (October 25-28, 1 and 6 october 2007). , the stokes of the two lines at 630 nm, a narrow field of view (fov) of xmath8 , a fov of xmath14 , at an interval of about 28 s (Table 8.1)). the stokes of the pair of lines at 630 nm were measured in a narrow field of view (fov) of xmath14 , this region was scanned with a cadence of 28 s during two- and six hours per day (tabla obs.). with a pixel size of xmath11 along the slit and a pixel size of xmath12 perpendicular to it, the stokes of stokes had a spatial resolution of about xmath13. sent> record the full vector of the pair of lines at 630 nm in a narrow field of view (Fov) of xmath8 , it was transmitted with a resonant frequency of 28 s, in the cn band at 388 nm (filter width of 0 . 52 nm) and the chromosphere in the cn line at 396 nm (filter width of 0 . 22 nm) . the pixel size of the original filters was 0 . 0 , but we recombined them to the sp pixel size to reduce the noise further. The light sensors on the sp have been corrected for dark current, flat field, and instrumental cross talk using the sp prep . pro routine. The spectropolarimetric maps and the various filters have been aligned with pixel accuracy, using the bright point, g band, and the network elements as a reference.

The figure [Putinue] shows the first stages of the formation of a small magnetic loop as seen in the 630 nm line. At xmath25 s, a patch of linear polarization is visible at the center of the image. Red contours indicate enhanced linear polarization. Black and white contours mark the location of strong negative and positive circular signals. in general, linear polarization signals are very small in the quiet sun, so we ascribe these cases to loop-like structures only after confirming that linear polarization is produced by the symmetrical stokes xmath28 and xmath28 profiles. red contours indicate the enhancement of linear polarization. black and white contours mark the location of strong negative and positive circular signals. We use them to make longitudinal magnetometers (@xmath34) and dopplergrams (@xmath35), whose two digits r and b are digitized by means of xmath39, where the digits r and b are the measurements at the xmath36 time and xmath38; where the digits r and b are the measurements at xmath37 and xmath38 pm from the line center , respectively. this sequence is consistent with a loop which emerges and travels up in the atmosphere ; the distance between the footpoints keeps increasing until they reach the edge of the area surveyed by the sp. Note that our sign convention for the speed of the sp is different from that commonly used in astronomy. The stokes @ xmath33 and xmath24 obtained in the red and blue wings of the b line give information about the upper atmosphere / the temperature minimum zone, at xcite. These calculations have been obtained by calibration of the b line shape in the fourier transform spectrometer atlas of the quiet sun, and give only rough estimates of the magnetic flux density and velocity at the height of the b-measurement. These calculations are valid in the range @ xmath43 kms @ xmath3. Note that the sign of the velocity of these calculations differs from that of astrophysics. Let us assume, for example, that the magnetic flux density has been computed from the profiles of the 630 nm lines, using the weak field (e.g., *? *? *) [[31] where @ xmath44 is the longitudinal flux density, @ xmath46 the filling factor, @ xmath46 the field strength, @ xmath48 the angle of the field to the vertical, @ xmath49 a proportional constant that depends on the central wavelength, @ xmath49 the effective land factor of the transition, and @ xmath33 represents the intensity profile. For the solution of the vertical flux density, the units of               left (v =  i +  phi c            left (v = v)              left (v = v i +  phi c       left (  v  v               left (             left ( v You will note that the time steps are not uniformly spaced, but we have adjusted them to give a better account of the various phases of the process. In this section we describe the most obvious cases of the process, defining in detail the different phases of the emergence process, distinguishing between loops which rise to the chromosphere and loops which remain low-lying. During 28 hours of observation we have detected 69 loops which are like structures in the area of xmath57. From left to right we show cn filters, photosphere los velocities derived from the stokes of xmath370, crossing the horizon of 630 nm, and a red contour shows the regions of large linear polarization signals in 630 nm. The red contours show the regions of large linear polarization signals in 630 nm. when the foot points of the loop are visible in the photosphere, we plot red contours of 630 nm circular polarization signals in black and white. this strongly supports the hypothesis that the fields are weak. Note that the time steps are not randomly distributed, but we have adjusted them to better describe the various phases of the process. a slightly higher diameter has now sprung up above the surface of the sun, so that the curve is getting higher. The upward granularity gives rise to the lines as the sun's gravity raises them from beneath the sun's surface. The downward granularity makes the lines rise from the earth below . . . , the lower temporal scale has no parallel on the b-grid, and the b-grid shows photospheric upward tangents, confirming the circle is rising. in the photosphere for the time being, however, the magnetic field remains in the lower stratum: there are no polarization signals in the b-grid, nor in the faintness of cai-h that could be associated with the loop. there are still upward tangents in the p-grid. , the downward slope of the magnetic field appears to be sufficient to confirm that the loop is rising. This strongly illustrates the usefulness of our observations: magnetic structures that are visible in the polarization maps, but not in b-grid or in h-grid, are intrinsically lower in the solar atmosphere. At xmath59 s, the linear polarization signal disappears below the noise. The positive angular point has passed over an intergranular lane and is concentrated, while the negative angular point remains rooted in the granular layer and is more diffuse. However, no traces of the loop are detected in b-grid or h-grid. At xmath61 s, a weak circular polarization signal, cospatial with the photospheric foot-points, are first observed in the b-grid for After the first 500 s of the loop evolution, the distance between the footpoints increases linearly, at a rate of 5 . 9 km s xmath3, and this increases the mean velocity of the footpoints by about 4000 m. so that the whole structure is rising, because the footpoints remain apart . . . the distance is computed only when the two footpoints are visible, both in the maps (squares) and in the b magnetograms (triangles). Therefore, the mean velocity of the footpoints is about 2 . . . , and when the b magnetograms are visible, the whole structure is rising, because the footpoints remain separated . . . - t--t--t--t--t, and he drew at x--t, a j--t--diamond is visible, - the color of the b magnetogram is clear, and the b- magnetogram is seen, as it is quite indistinct, and the difference is quite indistinct. at x--t--h--t--t--in the first 500 s, the distance between the footpoints increases linearly at a rate of 5 - 9 km s at x--t--, so that the mean velocity of the footpoints is 2 - 95 km s @ x--t, which corresponds with the motion of the granular plasma. The whole structure is growing because the footpoints are moving apart . We mention briefly that a new loop appears in the fov at this time, very close to the ____ crom2 ] shows the beginning of the decay of the loop. The positive footpoint is very weak, though it shows a little less than a little bit of flow at the beginning of the measurement; it will disappear below the noise level, together with the eddying, at the end of the stanza. a quarter of a lane of a beam (see the white arrow) is visible. This is the beginning of the decay of the loop. In this section we present a typical example of a loop that does not show chromospheric signatures and therefore remains low-level. The loop can already be distinguished in the intergranular passage, but they are very weak. at @xmath66 s, the loop reaches its greatest extent (530 km) while the upflows begin to weaken. In the first frame a band of linear polarization appears at the border of a granule (see the white arrow) at which it is quite obvious that the lineal polarization and the upward plasma movement are almost forgotten. By @xmath67 s, the loop is no longer visible. In general, loops continue to evolve rapidly, disappearing almost at the same place. interestingly enough, the footpoints never meet. This fact does not eliminate submergence below the surface of the sun as the cause of their disappearance. in this section we present a typical example of a loop which does not have chromospheric signatures and remains low-hanging. The loop we have been looking at simultaneously with the hinode and the dot (ml20) appeared on the 26th of September, 2007 at the hour of 09:06 ut. in fig. [Ej2 crom] todos, we have shown the evolution of the loop in the atmosphere and the polarization zone, using the 630 nm circular polarization map and the b magnetograms (first and second columns) ; we have also shown the h @ xmath18 core filtergrams, and the h @ xmath18 dopplergrams at xmath20 and xmath19 from the centre of the figure , the entire structure shows upflows in the stokes v zero map, indicating its ascent. Unfortunately, the loop observed by _hinode_ and the dot (ml20) did not appear on september 26, 2007 at 09:06 ut. in fig. ej2 crom crom todos, we show its evolution in the photosphere and in the temperature range. Unfortunately, the loop, which was followed by the dot, did not overlap at all, because of poor viewing conditions. so we use the h . . . line core, h . . . . and h . . . line . . . h@xmath73-id3 Figure d.l.l. - this is how the core images and d.l. d. - the dots are not of any special type which could be attributed to the appearance of an arch of filaments in the chromosphere. note that the maximum separation between the feet of this loop was only 760 km ; there was an abrupt fading at Xmath72 s, and the loop disappeared simultaneously from the lower and lower layers of the chromosphere. Figure d.l.b., in a new section, we have studied the physical properties of small-scale loops, especially those appearing near strong network elements, or that appear close to weak elements, in order to preserve the quality of the results. The lifetime is the time in which the polarization signals appear and disappear. The duration is the time in which the polarization signals appear and disappear. This period is a term of life. The average life of a loop is the time in which it has disappeared and faded. When two numbers are given, the first is the time in which the footpoints of the loop meet. The second is the time in which the footpoints converge with a magnetic element. The time between the appearance and the disappearance of the polarization signals. In this section we describe the physical properties of the small-scale magnetic loops observed with only weak examples, loops appearing near strong network elements or in crowded areas are excluded from the analysis to preserve the quality of the results. . . . . ; the two numbers in each column correspond to the positive footpoint (left) and the negative footpoint (right) . . . . . . mx . . . . . mx . . . . . , p . . . . mx . . . . p . . . . . . mx . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the longest intervals of time, in this circle, the occurrence of a loop, a metal ring, a mirror, a circle, a sphere, a sphere, a magnetogram, a dopplergram, a h ray core, a cn filtergram, cn ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc 90  490  4  4  3  xmath9510  xmath10310  xmath101 “xmath9510 @ xmath9610 @ xmath97 & xmath120 & Xmath121 & Xmath121 & 0 . . . 3 . . . 6 . . 0 . . . txtr — — — — — — — — — - 0 — — ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— Xmath9510 @ Xmath9610 @ Xmath97 & Xmath138 & & & & & & & & ml27 & 27 & 12 : 20 : 30 & 420 & 960 & 0 . 5 . . 8 . 0 . 0 . . . 0 . . . . –  – 0 . . . . –  -   - 0 . . . The upper edge is oriented toward the lower edge, so the center of the lip is in the upper part, so the inner wall is not as strong as the outer wall. The middle foot is about 40 meters long. There are also many loops that reach vertical dimensions as big as the granules. Therefore, the loops have smaller fluxes than the ephemeral regions, and must be placed at the lower end of the flux distribution observed in the active regions. . As we can see in the table, tabla, there is a great deal of information about loop parameters. The lateral magnetic flux measured in the foot is from xmath143 to xmath144 mx at the level of the 630 nm lines, mx, far larger than the rest of the measurements. The tidal forces in the foot are usually 2040 mx cm . In order to infer the magnetic field strength from these tidal forces, we need to know the filling factor of the fields that construct the loop structure and their inclination . . . . In addition, 15 % of the loops are recognizable as bright spots in the h line - core filters (in this order) . The loops are found in the magnetograms, the b magnetograms, the b magnetograms, the b dopplergrams, the h line - core images, and the cn filters (in this order) . this means that a considerable fraction of the magnetic flux that comes out of the photosphere is absorbed into the chromosphere. Furthermore, the relationship between these structures and the transient horizontal fields described by xcite should be studied, since their lifespan and magnetic topologies are similar. Therefore, it is necessary to describe why a large fraction of the loops remain low. Moreover, 15 % of the loops are brightly highlighted in h line-core filters. In most cases the linear polarization appears first or at the same time as the stokes of xmath24, as one would expect from the loops of xmath0 formed by loops rising from the atmosphere. The images taken from the b magnetograms are b-amperograms, b-ampergrams, b-ampergrams, h-ampergrams, cn filters (in this order) . . . and for a large fraction of the loops, only 77 % of them reach the chromosphere. What’s more, the emergence centers may have important implications for the origin of loops. These regions act as reservoirs of magnetic flux which is temporarily shifted to the photosphere by an as yet unknown mechanism. Figure (traysectorias) shows the two polarities of the loops observed on the 25th of september, 2007 (all loops ml09 to ml17 in the table 2), which were taken on the 25th of september, 2007. Among the loops, the footpoints are quite rectilinear, as well as the active regions and the ephemeral regions. Often the footpoints do not describe rectilinear trajectories. as they emerge, the footpoints separate and the linear polarization disappears. for some of the loops even appear at the same position . the footpoints do not represent rectilinear trajectories . the most important thing is that the magnetic field is sufficiently weak that it is pushed and pushed by the granular flow, but ... without being destroyed in the process ... so that the loops remain coherent throughout their lifetime, as if they were still intact. However, the majority of loops show more complicated trajectories . No, the maximum distance between the equator and the line which connects the positive footpoint with the negative, measured from the west, is about 90 degrees, so we assume that there is no regular order of footpoints at the moment of their emergence. The activity of the magnetic fields in the solar photosphere is on the horizontal scale, and there are small-scale magnetic fields on the horizon ( -lm = 6 m) in the region of the large disk, at the middle of the sun. So the behavior of the tiny loops of the disk itself is just like a branching in the air. In the northern hemisphere all the loops that are considered here appear during the solar cycle 23 in the north. In this cycle the leader polarities were positive in the north, and in the south - as a result of this cycle - the leader polarities were positive. We studied this in detail using the free observations of the hinode, in 28 hours of hinode observation, we have gathered 69 small loops of the disk in the region of quiet sun. In this region the power of the magnetic field is small and isotropically distributed . if a loop of smaller size could travel up to the quiet sphere it could carry a strong magnetic load. To the effect that these loops could move up to the chromosphere, they could carry the magnetic load. The rate of magnetic flux to the quiet sphere from the loops would be around a thousand mx s @ xmath1 arcsecs@ xmath1 mx per day per day. This is about half the rate of flux emergence estimated by lites et al. (1996) for horizontal inter-webs, but it is still enormous (see xcite) in comparison with fluxes in active and ephemeral regions). As one observes in a b-line core, the top linear polarization disappears quickly, and the circular traces tracing the arcs at the foot of the beam break down, which is consistent with the lines moving upward through the atmosphere. A related question is whether the small-scale loops reach the transition region or even the corona. a certain fraction of the loops reach the low chromosphere, carrying magnetic energy with them. also, the upward motion of the stokes, in the m-line, confirms the descent of the loops. The rest is more than a doubt, but one must not doubt that this is the case. We cannot understand the completeness of the tangled sun fields, as derived from the hanle measurements. We found three dimensional simulations of the formation of a small-scale magnetic loop at the bottom of the convection zone, beneath the photosphere. Thus, the small-scale loops we have detected may be the result of weak flux tubes distorted by the granulation, coming from the convection zone to the photosphere, and their breakage was accompanied by the contact between the materials and the fractures. In this case, the fraction of the tubes might have been a good enabling factor in the development of the loops, which was shown by the instability of the filaments. This is a difficult fact to make up for, since we can't deduce the origin of the loops from the solar dynamo. The mhd simulations of abbett, @ xcite, and @ xcite also show the phenomenon, because they are all composed of the same. Here, in some sense, the abbett, @ xcite, and @ xcite simulations are based on the same process, for they all have the same properties. one possibility is that the tiny loops are formed by weak flux tubes distorted by granular convection as they emerge from the convection zone into the photosphere. and we thank andrs asensio ramos, pascal dmoulin, and Rafael Manso sainz for his very helpful discussions, and vronique bommier for carefully reading the manuscript. further, the phenomena of the magnetic loops observed in the internet network are important to the determination of the magnetic nature of the quiet sun and its role in the heating of the solar atmosphere. Moreover, there are polarization measurements in the chromosphere, so that they may be used to track the growth of the loops with height. These observations are now collected by two-dimensional spectrometers, such as the ibis, the crisp or the imax. With regards to the electromagnetic theory, we have not enough observational constraints to distinguish between a surface dynamo or a magnetic flux tube that is burst from the solar interior. So, as we have seen, we have not enough observations to distinguish between a surface dynamo and a magnetic flux tube bursting from the solar interior. In addition to high-resolution photographs, polarization of the chromosphere is necessary to measure the polarization of the horizontal loops of spheres . the polarization of these spheres can now be obtained by two-dimensional observations like ibis, crisp, or imax. for further information, thank you to suguru kamio (naoj) for supporting the campaign and to peter stterlin (utrecht university) for taking measurements at the dutch open telescope and reducing them. “Second Author, y., nagata y., shimizu y., tarbell y. d., and title: “Apr. 69,” “Apr. 69.”
