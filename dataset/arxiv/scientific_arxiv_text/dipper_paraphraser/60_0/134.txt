the interesting solution to the hierarchy problem is the randall-sundrum (rs) model. in this model there is a single extra dimension constrained on xmath1 with the non-factorizable metric of xmath2 in xmath3; here xmath4 is the extra-dimensional coordinate, and xmath5 is the inverse of the inverse of xmath6 curvature, xmath7. to the inner branes, one is called the uv, or planck, brane; the other is called the ir, or tev, brane. We now ask what drives this break on each brane. This break of this extended electroweak symmetry proceeds in two stages: in the uv brane, xmath13; in the ir brane, xmath14, where xmath15 is the diagonal of the diagonal of the xmath16 groups. It has since been realized that both gauge and fermion fields can live in the bulk in a realistic model xcite. We can solve this problem by adding a gauge group to xmath12, which significantly improves the electroweak fit of xcite. This is achieved by calculating the effective 4d theory. We’ll divide the 5d field into kaluza klein (kk) field, and at xmath27 we can obtain the gauge boson wavefunctions by solving the equation of motion subject to boundary conditions (eq: gaugebcr ) and (eq: gaugebcrp) . this gives us the surging limit of @xmath25. The ground is the boundary of the lower masses in each charged and neutral sector. The lower masses in the charged and neutral sector correspond to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 bosons . The neutral sector also contains a zero-mode corresponding to the photon. This resulted in a spectrum of eigenvalues corresponding to the excitations of the gauge fields. This structure is interesting in that the @xmath28 and @xmath29 waves are suppressed near the ir brane, as can be seen from the boundary conditions. the main effect of this phrase is to shift the location of the fermion zero in the bulk. by changing this parameter, we can make the zero localized either near the uv or in the ir brane, and we can also modify the degree of this localization by mixing with new fermions localized to the plank brane, where the @ xmath32 is broken. Here the hierarchy of fermion masses can be formed by changing the order of the 5d masses. note that the excitations of the gauge fermions have been studied in the calculations. However, the magnitude of the excitations is very sensitive to the configuration of the fermion sector , for the particular configuration of the fermions studied in @ xcite, there is a constraint @ xmath33. Note also that the small 4d yukawa couplings have small squared overlaps with the same wave function, and the 5d yukawa couplings have a small squared overlap, and the eddy states have no wave function. the coupling of the yukawa to the eddy states has no whirlpools. This second complication is caused by the symmetry of the @ xmath31, which says that the @ xmath32 is always unbroken, and this mass relation can be changed by mixing new fermions localized to the plank brane, where the @ xmath32 is broken. Note that there are tree-level corrections to the precise observables, mostly due to the kk excitations of the gauge bosons. Unfortunately, the magnitude of these corrections is very sensitive to the configuration of the fermion sphere. In fig. 1, we see the behavior of the principle of the branching ratios. We can see that in fig. 1 and 2 we can see that the index of the branches is reduced by xmath34, and the dominant at xmath34 is the delayed at xmath35. This is because of the symmetry of xmath33, which gives a large increase in the strength of yukawa-yukawa, and the suppression of the gauge boson couplings. It is due to the suppression of the coupling to gauge boson that the production of the intercalations will be reduced, which makes the discovery of the intercalation very difficult.  83, 3370 (99) [arxiv: hep-ph / 9905221] . j . l . randall and r . sundrum, phys.
