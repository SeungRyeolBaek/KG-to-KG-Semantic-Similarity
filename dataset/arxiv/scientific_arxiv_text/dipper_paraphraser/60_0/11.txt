And so our main motivation is the previous study of the swarming desert locust schistocerca gregaria. This swarm has characteristic characteristics, for example, of fish schools, bird flocks, bacterial colonies, and insect swarms. biological aggregations, such as fish schools, bird flocks, bacterial colonies, and insect swarms, have characteristic features, influenced by the interplay between the group members. They are often met by a socially attractive and repellent force, as in the interaction between the particles, and by a sensory stimulus, either directly by sound, sight, smell, touch, or indirectly by chemical, vibrations, or other signals. In some parameters of our model (such as the one presented briefly) locusts self-organize into swarms with a peculiar shape, namely, a bubble-like shape, containing a dense group of locusts on the ground and a flying group of locusts overhead; see figure bc. locusts on the ground, when surrounded by the flying swarm, take off and rejoin the flying group; see figure bc. locusts on the ground, being overtaken by the flying swarm, take off and rejoin the flying group; see figure bc., the two are separated by an empty space. He uses the transverse to slant the base, so that the model is two-dimensional, where the @xmath5 coordinate is aligned with the main current of the wind and the @xmath6 coordinate is a vertical coordinate. In the first term on the right hand side of (* = locusts) the second term describes a force which is exerted by the locust on the locust. as locusts rest and feed when they are in this state, their motion in that state is negligible compared with that of their motion in the air. Then we add to (* = locusts) the stipulation that locusts whose vertical velocity is negative under (* = locusts) remain stationary. As the velocity of the insect is merely a function of position, the model neglects the inertial forces. This so-called kinematic assumption is common in swarming models, and we shall discuss it in the following section : discrete model . . . in the previous sections we mentioned that (* = locusts) . . . in time and space we divide the inertial forces by one and the same number. the first term on the right-hand side of '[*] locusts" (*) defines the force exerted by the locust on the locust . . . a certain advantage of this method is that it is simple to assemble the simplest differential equations. Furthermore, for high-dimensional systems, computation, though simple, can become a stumbling-block. For example, in a swarm, the population density in a single dimension is defined by a conservation equation; a higher density, a density that is incompatible with a definite plane, is determined by convolution with the antisymmetric force of the force in [7][8][9] [9], the one-dimensional equivalent of a social force, like the force in [9][10][10][10]. There are many studies on conditions in which the population concentrates to a particular mass, a concentration that is stable, a finite steady state, or spread. These conditions have created a Phase-Gap, which divides the dimensional space into regions corresponding to the nature of the behavior. These Phase-Gaps are more apt to be used for analysing large systems. And the spatial matrix (* eq[11]] gives three possible and well-known solutions. Its general formula (*] ,Q(16) includes at least three possible solutions, as identified by eq[11]. The general model, eq[11], indicates at least three solution types, as shown by eq[12], the continuum (d. exponents) a “then-trigram” encloses the step. Its efficacy is greatly increased, for a social force (eq[12]) displays more complicated phenomena, which include, for example, swarms. In a one-dimensional domain, collapse occurs when the force if [x  eq ] itself in an arbitrary dimension, then there is a theory beyond the time of concentration. There is an energy function in x math (19) called “fifteen” [xx] (for a most basic attractive point is that all classical steady points are constant in space, as proved by a variational formulation of the steady point problem. Nevertheless, there may be classical pointers. Some of the pointers we have described above are equilibrium points. However, the pointers are not biological, as they contain infinite mass. Many of the results we have described are obtained by exploiting the gradient flow of (eq: i i ). The sharp edges of the support are located in x , y  int  mathbb  r  f (x)  rho (x)  dx , dx , ] which is minimized under the dynamics. In a simplest case, the only classical stable states are fixed in space, as is demonstrated by a variational formulation of the steady state problem. Many of the results described above were obtained by exploiting the underlying gradient flow of (eq: introeq2) . This energy can be interpreted as the continuum analog of the summed pairwise energy of the corresponding discrete particle . There are several forms of induced energy in it; in general they involve @xmath0-function concentrations of mass in the domain boundary. For some particular induced energy there is a method for calculating exact solutions; in particular they can be connected with At xmath0-function concentrations of mass in the domain boundary. in the second section, or the third section, we consider the ionic domain, in which there is no induced energy, a half-line subject to gravitational forces, and an unconditioned domain subject to a quadratic potential, predicting the attraction of a light, chemical, or nutrient source. in the third place, the equilibrium is compacted, with the density dropping gradually to zero at the edge of the support. for all three examples, we compare analytical solutions from the continuum to those obtained by numerical simulation of the underlying system, and the two agree closely even with small numbers of discrete swarms. In section “mistak” (the first one is similar to the second one), but we now consider the more complicated case of the endogenous interactions, which are repellent on short scales, and are attractive on longer ones. This process involves solving a fredholm integral equation for the density. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section “mistak” (the second one is reactive) we investigate purely repellent interactions. The first one is dynamic, the second one is elastic, the second one is elastic, the third one is the transition from the frontier to the surface, and the third one is very elastic, the density drops discontinuously to zero at the edge of the support. for all three examples we compare analytical solutions from the continuum framework to those obtained from numerical simulation of the We consider that motion is governed by newton’s law, so that acceleration is proportional to the sum of the drag and motive forces. In the literature, this is known as kinematical models, and the resulting models, which are first order in time, are known as kinematical models. Here we assume that motion is governed by the law of newton’s law, so that the acceleration is proportional to the sum of the drag and motive forces. For the moment, we will concentrate on the case where the acceleration is negligible and the drag force is proportional to the velocity. Here, we will assume that the forces are symmetrical, that is, the force that is induced by a particle on a particle on a particle is the opposite of that induced by a particle on a particle on a particle . . . exogenous forces might include gravity, wind and swishes towards light or nutrients . . . in the literature, kinematic models have been used in numerous studies of swarming and communal behavior, including . . . . As we have already said, many of the general models of mutual interaction are satisfied by this assumption, and the flows which we have described in the literature are even to this extent. But if the flow is limited to a particular domain, it is difficult to quantify it. so, we will assume the geometrical type eq (dimension) in which we have taken into account (and this dimension is called the eq definable) and the path eq definable is a complex system. The bifurcation of this system is a correspondingly symmetrical one. Here we will treat the case as follows: The eq definable is a strong function and is located at the positions of the particles: eq definable, eq definable. At this point, the system is analyzed in a continuum, and we will deduce equilibrium solutions and subsequently determine their stability through the calculus of variations and the integral equation method. It will be a simple matter to describe our solution to this question, namely, the modulus of the energy, eq definable. The analogy for this is similar to @ xcite. (For the sake of simplicity, we suppress the dependence of x definableness in the following discussion.)

This phrase is exact because, in the case of the swarm, the equation of xmath61 is quadratic (see eq. “Half-Strength-Liquidity”), namely, that xmath63 is a fraction of the domain of xmath35. so, in order to arrive at xmath61, inspired by the biological observations of swarms, we have focused on the finite number of equilibria, and we take the support of xmath63 to be a fraction of the domain of xmath35, we refer to the support of xmath63 as xmath62.

Figure [fig: repulsion ] shows solutions for xmath99 for three situations: a domain without an exogenous potential, a gravitational potential on a semi-infinite domain, and a quadratic potential well on an infinite domain . we will try to solve the problem classically; when the solution has a compact support contained within the domain, we find solutions that are continuous within the support and may have jump discontinuities at the boundary of the support. However, when the boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the domain, the classical solution may break down and there is a necessity for a distribution. . . . then we apply these results to the three examples mentioned earlier . . . first of all, we will explain the minimization problem for the laplace potential. We will attempt to solve the problem classically, when the solution has a compact support contained in the domain, we find solutions that are continuous in the support and can have jump discontinuities at the boundary of the support. But when the boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the domain, the classical solution may break down and it is necessary to include a distributional component in the solution. And in this case, as a matter of fact, we will confine our attention to the cases where the support of the solution at xmath62 is a single interval in xmath39; that is, the minimizing solution has a bonded support. Thus, let us suppose that there is a swarm minimization at the laplace potential if the exogenous potential is convex, that is, at xmath104 on xmath39 . for the remainder of this section, we will confine our attention to those cases where the support of the solution at xmath62 is a single interval in xmath39; that is, a connected support. Since swarm minimization is the necessary condition for global minimization, we are now limiting our attention to single-component solutions. To see this, let us assume that we have a swarm minimization with two disjoint components. We add @xmath82 to @xmath106 and add @xmath111 to @xmath103 at the ends of the gap. As we have seen, we can prove that there are no multi-component minimizations for the laplace potential as long as the exogenous potential is convex, that is, @xmath106 on the xmath39. - Eq: fie - sol -  –  –  –   –  –  –  –  –  –   –  –  –   –   –  –  –   –  –  –  –    –  –  –  –  –  – –     –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  – – –  – –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  – –  –  –  –  –  – –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  – – – –  –  –  – – –  –  –  – – The difficulty with this calculation is that we expect physically, for every mass in the xmath26 interval and in the xmath128 interval, there must be a minimization. Besides, we have limited ourselves (as we have seen) to the laplace potential ([eq]. [eq.] ), that is, for the general case. It is possible that, if @ xmath32 and @ xmath32 are bounded from below, the energy @ xmath48 is bounded from below too. let @ xmath129 be directly from ([eq] continuum energy]: since xmath48 is bounded from below, solutions to the minimization problem exist in the space of measure valued functions @ xcite.

Again, applying @ xmath159 to (Eq: fie) simplifyes the equation; we can check that the integral term and the contribution from the @xmath0 function are annihilated by this operator, and we deduce that @ xmath166 = 0  qquad  rightarrow  qquad f (x) So if the xmath126 and xmath127 are both strictly inside xmath39, then ([2 ] mincon] constitutes sufficient conditions for the extremal solution of xmath59 to be a global minimizer (recalling that Xmath68) . . . a similar calculation for xmath165 yields xmath173    rm for   quad x leq  alpha . . . in the case of xmath173 it follows that the difference is obtained by a formula of the inverse, which is equivalent to the inverse, if xmath165  rm for   quad x leq  alpha . . . as we have already said, if xmath164 and xmath126 are both strictly inside xmath39, then (the eq. - mincon) is necessary for the extremal solution @ xmath59 to be a global minimizer (as is observed for xmath68) . . . for xmath174, so either @ xmath176 or @ xmath127 coincides with the left end of xmath39 . then either @ xmath177 or @ xmath127 coincides with the right edge of xmath39. The equation is the result of the continuous potentials, which are described by the laplace potential. We begin by starting with the simplest possible case, namely, no exogenous potential, @ xmath178, and a finite domain, which we take to be the symmetric interval @ xmath178. ; as @ xmath180 we know from ([eq] fie-sil ] that the non-classical solution is @ xmath184. We know, by ([eq] mform ] that the minimizing solution has a fixed support, that is, a unified support, i.e. a single component. We see that the minimizing solution has an interposed mass between @ xmath0 - functions at the boundaries of the domain and a constant solution in the interior, as shown in Figure [Fig] repulsion - diagram (a) . - a solution is a global minimizer. The solution @ xmath101 is shown in Figure - repulsion - diagram (a) - . —>. - Function of mass in the analytical solution, and simultaneously a superposition of swarms of swarms in the numerical simulation. (v) - At xmath192 we know from eq. - of single component - that the minimizing solution has a central support - i.e., it is a single component - so, the support of the solution must be at xmath197, presumably at xmath198 . - We now consider repellent social relations and an exogenous gravitational potential. We now examine the corresponding solution, math199, which is given in figure math199 of the infinite. Thus, at xmath199, the whole area is covered by a repulsion and an infinite spacing. we get a solution for xmath199, as follows: from  Math199 we know that the minimizing solution has a united support, i.e., a single component. And if we equilibrate this component downwards, the source energy decreases while the endogenous energy is preserved. So, the support of the solution must be at xmath199, and possibly at xmath198. , we know that there is a r0  1  217 . . . that is, it is clear that 170 046 - s and r= *  / + g / s - [#]. ; e, s and r = 521  (for ) is a r0  220 ,  [219] [217] . , if the function 170 is concave, then the slope of the chord will be increasing as  219 increases from 220 to 220, and the inequality will hold. Then, from 226, from -291, 525, 1, 5, 5 - 219, 220, which is positive, so the solution is universally stable. - The second factor (1: minconb) is . As a result of lhpital's rule, equality is obtained as 2223, and 'for 223,' as a result of 'for 223,' let's see that the inequality is @ xmath208 , let's see that @ xmath212 and @ xmath213 (so @ xmath214 ) , the inequality becomes 223, ... the numerical (dots) and analytical (line) at xmath232 agree, as does the non-classical part of the solution, represented by the  lollipop (the second point of a superposition of the swarm members in the numerical simulation, total mass of xmath233, and simultaneously a - function of mass of xmath235 in the analytical solution. . . . the calculation proceeds as follows: -    a = a  a  a - function at the origin . . . the  a = a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t is a t and a t in a t and a t is a t and a t and a t is a square, a rectangle, a round (fifty-six) swarm and a quadratic exogenous potential well , we see in te m - t (fifteen) - te m is a quadratic well, it is shown in te m - te m: in the tem “Next, in defining xmath59, we define xmath224. However, in the second half of (eq: abquad) we know that Xmath224, if you combine these two expressions for xmath224, then the solution xmath224 is equal to xmath245 . . . Note, too, that Xmath248 increases monotonically from xmath249 with a greater xmath26. Thus, the solution xmath244 is symmetric around the centre of the potential. The solution xmath248 is shown schematically in Figure 9a. [fig. 2] of repulsion , which follows directly from algebra. Thus, the solution is symmetric around the centre of the potential. (Eq. mform) gives Xmath73 as xmath26 in terms of mass, whereas Xmath247 from the second half of (eq. Abquad) we know that @ xmath246 equating these two expressions for Xmath247 results in xmath248. This is the most common and widely studied potential. The potential is given in the h-stable and in the h-stable regime. A particular feature of the potential (Eq: h-stable) is: whether the parameters @ xmath257 are chosen in the h-stable or the h-stable regime; see xcite for a review. The energy per particle is unbounded as @ xmath260 and the particles pack together more and more closely as the distance between them increases. In this case, the energy per particle is unbounded as @ xmath260, and the particles pack together more and more tightly as the distance between them increases. Consider (Eq: discrete system) with Xmath178. Consider, however, that if the parameters of @ xmath257 are chosen in the h-stable regime, which is [eq] the h-stable regime, then the density of the particles is fixed, as does the energy per particle. in the catastrophic case, @xmath264 intuitively, a catastrophic state is unstable to long-wave perturbations, whereas in the stable state the initial density profiles spread out equilaterally, to the point of flattening. In this case, @xmath78 for all @xmath264 is sufficient, and from section [Section] (zh-maximum), that is sufficient for @xmath68, or equivalently, linear stability of constant density states. We will now study minimizations for the case of continuous-wave interactions, and we shall see qualitatively different solutions for the catastrophic and h-maximum interactions. For convenience, we shall define the differential operators @ xmath266 and @ xmath268, and apply @ xmath268 to (zh-maximum) @ xmath269,  xmath269,  quad x  in       in    in   omega        rho      end   aligned  ] A similar calculation, averaging math277 h (x-y)  dy and     mbox     [14] – where math277 h (x-y) – dy and         –    mathcal  q   –          mathcal  q      –      –     –    mathcal  q   –      lambda – f (x –        – a       – a        –                non-umber  end   aligned   ] – taking the limit – – – which we have taken the factor – – – h (x-y-y) – Xmath88 is contained in Xmath39 , then xmath287.

It is, therefore, with a settlement of a settlement of a settlement of a settlement of a settlement of a settlement of a settlement of a settlement of a settlement of a region of xmath62. The domain of xmath62 is determined by the relations ([eq] morse and [eq] mass ], and [eq] bcs , [eq] bcs , ,[5] by a settlement of a settlement, the solution of which, on the contrary, is a swarm minimizer, that is, stable in the presence of infinitesimal concentrations of mass. Therefore, on xmath302.16 to xmath502.24 in the following subsections we will consider the solution of the continuum system (eq fie) and [eq mass1] with no external potential, @ xmath 305 . As a result of this, we will take the solution of the continuum system (eq fie) and the [eq mass1] with no external potential, @ xmath 305. In that case, @ xmath99 in _eq_ fie_, and @ xmath306 in _eq_ morse_, so that @ xmath302 for @ xmath5 in the neighbourhood outside of _xmath_6 . . . the same situation will hold at the boundary @ xmath164.

For example, as a case of a swarm minimizer, see figure (Fig. 1–3: Morse – Numerics) (a) compares the analytical results of a discrete system (eq. 1–3) with the interaction parameters @ xmath319 and @ xmath324 – the solid line is the numerical solution of the discrete system (eq. 1–3) with a swarm of members. As we have just seen, the asymptotic behavior of the solution (eq. 1–5–pde) for the h–stabile case is a sprinkling self-similar solution which approaches the well-known barenblatt solution of the porous medium equation. Therefore, there is no solution for the h–stabile case in an unbounded domain (as we have already proved by considering the analogous problem to the one in the previous section and showing that there is no solution) . The solution is [eq: hstablesoln] in Xmath330.

The figure - fig. morse-numericals” [B] is a comparison of analytical and numerical results for a case with a rather small value of xmath334 in it. For the case of the locust, we have observed that the locusts are observed to have a concentration of individuals on the ground, a gap or a bubble where the density of the individuals is near zero, and a sharply delineated swarm of flying individuals. We also note that in the model (eq. locusts) the column of individuals is anchored to the swarm at xmath190, while at the same time there is the matrix of particles at xmath192 which is located between two dots. Thus the column of dots corresponds to the numerical equilibrium of the discrete system (eq. locusts) with @xmath190 swarm members . Figure - morsel-numerics (b) compares analytical and numerical results for an example case, with a relatively small value of xmath334. This behavior is replicated in the model (eq. locusts): see figure - morsel-numerics (b) . We will note that the bubble is present even when the wind is omitted in the model, and only endogenous interactions and gravity are present. We will examine this in detail in the repulsion-only case, in order to find the minimal mechanism responsible for the appearance of the gap. the repulsion-only case, in order to find the minimum mechanism for the appearance of the gap. We have chosen a swarm in two dimensions, with spatial coordinates @xmath338 . We will gradually confine the vertical coordinate @xmath339 to nonnegative, for it describes the height above the ground at @xmath340 . We assume the swarm to be uniform in the horizontal direction @xmath341, so that @xmath342 . we consider a quasi-two-dimensional interaction potential, @xmath339 letting @xmath344 and @xmath447 , that yields @xmath447 , it is easy to show that the two-dimensional energy per unit length is given by @xmath447 . we will show that the quasi-two-dimensional energy per unit length is given by @xmath447 . . . . Irresistible, dynamical equations are simply (eq. cont. velocity) and (eq. pde) but with an adverbial force of xmath350. For the laplace potential (eq. laplace) , the quasi-two-dimensional potential is @ xmath351 where (eq. q2db) comes from symmetry, (eq. q2dc) comes from letting @ xmath353 , (eq. q2dd) comes from letting @ xmath354 , and (eq. q2de) comes from the trigonometric substitution @ xmath355 . . . , this integral can be asymptotically enlarged with (eq. q2dd): , for small @ xmath356 @ xmath356 , for large @ xmath356 , and for intermediate values @ xmath356 we interpolate from a lookup table pre-calculated with (eq. q2d) . The spatial coordinate at xmath197 shows the distance of a swarm. Consequently, xmath197 is the semi-infinite interval at xmath197. And so, if @xmath39 is computed, then @xmath194 is the semi-infinite interval at xmath198. From Section 1.1 Gravity , we recollect that for the one-dimensional model, @xmath367 is a minimizer for some @xmath26, which consists of all swarm members pinned by gravity to the ground. In this respect, if @xmath39 is the global minimizer, then it is not necessary. Note that although @xmath375 is sufficient for @xmath193 to be a global minimizer, it is not necessary. Moreover, since @ xmath194 as well as that , @xmath194 is a global minimizer. therefore, we believe that this solution is the global attractor (though we have not proved it) . note that the condition of @xmath375 is not strictly increasing, only that @ xmath193 is strictly increasing, as he is attained by @ xmath194. “Together, the same is true for Xmath381: the first swarm members are high above the ground, and the simulation is a circular system. At Xmath381 the local minimum of Xmath82 at Xmath382 is satisfied, as at Xmath383 and Xmath384 . we have performed a number of experiments to assess Xmath391 and have measured two basic properties of the solutions. First, we have taken the equation and given it a unified, polynomial method. The horizontal blue line pictured below indicates (chartainwise) that for xmath390 the equilibrium consists of all the mass concentrated at the origin, as we have explained above, the global minimizer and (we think) the global attractor. As Xmath391 increases, the equilibrium is a swarm minimizer consisting of a classical swarm in the air separated from its origin, and some mass concentrated on the ground. As Xmath391 increases, the proportion of mass concentrated on the ground increases monotonically. We set @ xmath388 and use @ xmath389 in all simulations of the discrete system. We have shown that for @xmath401 one can construct a continuum of swarm minimizers, with a difference between the grounded and the airborne component, and that for @xmath402 such solutions have a lower energy than those solutions which are concentrated solely on the ground. We recall that for a swarm minimizer, each connected component, @xmath73, is constant, and we define @xmath394 for the grounded component, and @xmath394 for the airborne component. Note that we believe that by continuity, we believe that there is a state of @xmath400, which corresponds to a global minimizer. But, this state is clearly not a global one and therefore cannot be simulated in simulation. we conclude that dimensionality is the decisive element in the formation of a bubble-like structure, like a real locus. - figure [fig]: lambda2 [cd] , the mass is contained in the grounded component. , in this case, the energy is contained in the grounded component . in this case, the energy is contained in the grounded component . By means of this we mean that, under the modeled assumptions, swarms are denser with increasing mass. Besides, when a support is not drawn to the boundary of the support, a minimization may contain a concentration of @xmath0 at the boundary. we note that for the locust model of @xcite (see figure 4.2) a concentration of locusts occurs on the ground, with a seemingly classical component above, divided by a gap. Moreover, when the boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the domain, a minimization may contain a concentration of @xmath0 at the boundary of the domain. in the case of a h-statistical social force, there is no equilibrium solution on an infinite domain. in the case of an h-statistical social force, there is no equilibrium solution on an infinite domain. Besides, if a boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the domain, a minimization contains a concentration of @xmath0 at the boundary of the domain. The analysis of the results above, with the morse potential, was a general solution that was independent of the total population mass. We also found analytical solutions for h-statistical social forces modeled with the morse potential. On a finite domain, the mass is divided between the classical solution in the interior and @xmath0 concentrations on the boundary.
