a unit cell containing a single sic pillar attached to the sic substrate was constructed, surrounded by a floquet layer along the xmath30 and periodic layers along the xmath31 layer, with a nonlinear polarization of the p polarization, at a velocity of 25 xmath32 , and then a scattered electric field whose source was referred to as the electric field whose source was referred to as the electric field whose source was to be found in the pillar and substrate. We note that in these calculations the input power density was kept constant, and the output power was normalized to the surface of the xmath36 plane. based on the results of the simulations described above, we have obtained spectra of the shg response. . . . here, the spectra of the shg response were obtained by means of a comsol multiphysics system — www.comsol. com — was used to simulate the linear optical response described in ref. xcite ; a sic pillar anchored to a substrate was constructed, with a floquet boundary in the xmath30 axis, and periodic boundary in the xmath31 axis, perpendicular to the plane of incidence . . .

If you read them, you’ll find out that the effect of crystal anisotropy on the infrared reflectivity of 6h sic is strong. If you read them, you’ll see that they are up to a third harmonic-comparison of the last harmonic. (Birds.) fuchs, j., floess, d., hentschel, m. , giessen, h.
