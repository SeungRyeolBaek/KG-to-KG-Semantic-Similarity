One can see, however, that in the vicinity of a universe, there is a whole complex network of filaments and gaps, which is called the 'coldness of the cosmic web.' . Thus, a greater number of observations have been made, as a result of the decreasing physical condition, the distribution and the metal enrichment of gaseous gases in the low redshift cosmic web. At the present time, in addition to dark matter and galaxies, the filaments consist of a mixture of cool, photoionized gas (of the low # xmath0 portion of the forest), a shock-warming, low-density gaseous phase at temperatures between xmath19k and xmath21k, which constitutes most of the baryonic mass, the 'warm-to-hot' intergalactic medium (whim, cen and ostriker 1999; dav et al. 1999). Thus, the observational efforts of cosmological studies are being more and more invested in the experimental development of the 'dark' cfw. and as a result the spatial and numerical aspects of the system have been presented in detail. The numerical study of the density of the galaxies in the nearby universe has been revealed in detail by several large-scale sacrocosmological surveys, such as 2dfgrs ( colless et al. 2001, Baugh et al. 2004) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss, stoughton et al. 2002, doroshkevich et al. 2004) and the 2mass of the whole sky survey ( 2mass Now in order to study gas distributed in large-scale filaments, bregman et al. (2004a) sought out absorption lines in large-scale filaments. While absorption lines are sensitive and powerful probes of the whim, the pencil-face nature of the measurement from a distance gives no clue as to the context of the absorption, e.g., whether the absorption is from an individual galaxy disk or halo, or in smaller clusters or voids. Several groups are investigating the nature of whim gas in the spectra of high-redshift agns (trams et al. 2000, 2001, savage et al. 2002, 2005, nicastro et al. 2002, 2005, nicastro et al. 2002, kaiser et al. 2002, richter et al. 2004; prochaska et al. 2004; danforth et al. 2005). Thus, to understand the nature of highly ionized agns at low redshifts, several groups are conducting deep redshift surveys and observations of qsos behind well-defined clusters or clusters. ” - 2490 – the foreground abell clusters [468]) on the e140 m echelle mode of the space telescope spectrograph (stis) on board the hrb Space Telescope. we have also obtained multiband images and redshifts of galaxies in the 0624 field. This paper is organized as follows. The observing and data reduction procedures are described in detail, and they include hst / stis and a 'stratified ultraviolet spectroscope' () observations, as well as ground-based imaging and galaxy redshifts. In section 6 we present the properties of the full spectrum of ly xmath16 lines derived from the stis spectrum, and focus on broad ly xmath16 lines. Instead of a low-magnetic whim, we find predominantly cool, photoionised, and high-metallic gases in these large-scale structures. (We will also examine in detail the galaxy redshifts of the abell clusters in the 0624 field. While the absorbing gas is intergalactic, and, it is probable, we are probing gas in cosmic filaments, the properties of these absorbers are unknown. instead of low-magnitude whims, we generally find cool, photoionized and high-magnified gases in these large-scale structures.) a total of 61 . 95 ksec. To this effect the effect of the wings of the line spread function was re-examined by the team of pi. In 1999 and 2001 the pi team was observed by the team of pi on several occasions between 1999 and 2002. The pi team was given the code P1071001 and P1071002 respectively, and the code P1071002 was adopted in a modified version of calstis (see moos et al. 2000, 2002) . This information msws ds 0624 + 6907 the combined intensity of which was 118 ks. total time was required for the whole measurement. The data had been extracted from the archive and reduced as described in tripp et al. (2005) using the calstis team version of calstis. for lif12 and lif13 we reduced the spectral spectra to the minimum level (score of a one-in-one system) using the calstis algorithm of calstis, which we call ‘SiC/SiC/SiC’. Because the spectra in the individual channels had a modest s/n ratio, we aligned and combined all the available lif channels to form the final spectra that we used for hs0624 + 6907 . An introductory purpose of our low absorption line for the study of 0624 is to study the connection between galaxies and their absorption systems. Our primary goal in this study is to investigate the connections between galaxies and their absorption systems, and we require good imaging (for target selection and information about individual galaxies) and optical spectroscopy for accurate redshift measurements. We selected images for the first spectroscopic study, but afterwards we used only the better mosa images. As summarized in the table , we recorded images in Xmath36 and Xmath35 with a simple Dithering technique for filling the gaps between the ccds and preventing cosmic rays. The spicam images were used to select targets for the first spectroscopic survey, but thereafter we used only the better mosa images. On the 4m observation site on February 29, 2003, with mosa, one could see a r-band mosa image of 0624. [3] The final r-band mosa image of -678 was observed on February 29, 2003. The spectra were taken in the conventional way, and were matched by using helium - neon - argon arc-lamp exposures. Small slight offsets in wavelength were made as needed, after comparing the observed skyline to the rest values. 0547 - 5 - 1 - 0 - 0 - 20 - 2 - 0 - 20 - 0 - 21 - 0 - 0 - 21 - 0 - 27 - 0 - 0 - 27 - 0 - 26 - 0 - 27 - 07 - 0327 - 7 - 0 - 21 - 6 - 0 - 20 - 5 - 0 - 27 - 07 - 07 - 07 - 06 - 30 - 42 - 64 - 69 - 58 - 32 - 69 - 02 - 40 - 70 - 68 - 58 - 40 - 32 - 59 - 72 - 0 . - 79 - 0 - 0 - 27 - If it’s then it’s then it’s then it’s then it’s then a new place to live in!

The clusters of the galaxy are often clustered and often reveal a broader cosmic structure, i.e., superclusters (see einasto et al., 2001, and references therein) . . . in cosmological simulations, clusters are often clustered and often reveal even larger cosmic structures, i.e. superclusters (see einasto et al. 2001, and references therein) . . . the density of the abells in this region is relatively high compared with the density of the other clusters in the abell catalog: the number of abells within two  xmath583mimimimimimimimimiminymimi in a557 (the cluster closest to the math58miminymimimimimiminy3miminypi a558 mst mstmist msty5 i2n2325 an3 13mi22> on the 3mina_ group , the mstrmi2strmi At the redshift of 10 , the clusters at 559 and 559 are separated by 4 . 7 from each other, and by 565 565 546  562  556 are separated by 3 . 9 and 8 . . . according to the theory of colberg et al. (2003), the superposition of the galaxy groups at several redshifts is evident. According to colberg et al. (2004) the filaments of galaxies connect in the abell clusters. However, it is not sufficient to say that the visually recognized a557 is a false cluster, owing to the superposition of several different redshifts. We will later describe in a few paragraphs the detection of absorption lines of the spectroscopic spectrum of 254 and of galaxies close to the speck, which means that gaseous filaments connect in the clusters. It is possible, however, that the filament of galaxies connecting a559 to a549 must extend 15° west from a549, and that the structure connecting a549 and a549 must extend 20° west to cross the qsoya speck. The figure identifies three galaxies: two galaxies appear to be present at redshifts similar to those of the abell clusters, i.e., at 1665 and 1664 , it seems that the filament of the galaxies connecting a559 to a564 must extend more than 3 degrees ( 15) west from a5 To answer this question, we have searched the spectrum of h to detect any counterparts of absorption in the redshifts of galaxies and galaxies close to the qso axes. The redshifts of the h systems that we have identified and measured (see table 6414a) in the spectrum of h to 663roman systems are plotted at the top; the length of the line is proportional to the width of the line 65. However, the abell clusters we see visually do not require the aid of spectroscopy, and it can be seen from the figures [fig: field] and the color of the stratum, that a few discrete groups can be found at the position of a557. it is probable that a557 is not a true cluster, but is simply the superposition of several groups in projection. We have surveyed the spectrum of 0624 for any equivalent counterparts at the redshift of galaxies and star structures near the qso line. First, when a galaxy is located at an impact point (p. xmath66) the absorption is almost always found within a few hundred of the redshift of the galaxy (compare table [tab: spec] red to table [tab: lyalist]), in keeping with the observations of the lanzetta et al. 1995; tripp et al. 1998; impey et al. 1999; chen et al. 2001; bowen et al. 2002; Penton et al. 2002) The strongest lines are found in the hottest regions of the galaxy, and these results are in keeping with the conclusions of bowen et al. (2002) and c-ot et al. (2005) . such kinematics are unprecedented in a single galaxy halo. In the case of this strong h @ xmath4roman1 system, the nearest observed galaxy to the sight line is at xmath69 (ne3 in the table – spec: red) . Moreover, it is difficult to detect a clear pattern that shows the connection between the individual lines and the individual galaxies in this complex. As we will see in the next section, the strong h @ xmath4roman1 system is composed of a great number of components, spread over a large number of dimensions. In addition, it is impossible to see the connection between individual lines and individual galaxies in this complex. Using photometric redshifts (as described in Chen et al. 2003) to classify the distant background galaxies with photometric redshifts at xmath70, we find that there are only four galaxies that are closer to the sight line than ne3 . These four objects are only possible because photometric redshifts have considerable uncertainty. In the case of a redshift of xmath71, the nearest galaxy to 0624 has still a high impact parameter of xmath72 kpc . I took a computer-visioned decomposition of galaxies and ly ly ly ly xmath16 lines from the same place, and measured the column densities and doppler parameters of the ly ly xmath16 lines in the spectrum of Xmath488 (see webb 1987, p. 7): table [Tab.

The syst0063 relates to the six lines of the line at xmath90 , and the line y= xmath90 is in good agreement with the c xmath90 , the = xmath90 and the = xmath90 lines . . . but the metal lines at this redshift have a distinctive two-component profile (see figure 0063) and the profile of the c xmath90 is in good agreement with the profile of the c xmath90 and the 309 lines. Hence, the 309 is not closely correlated with the 309 . . . . 233o2, the resulting joint fits the 306o2 ma3n. as shown in figure upholsterion, by a single-component curve of growth and the observed equivalent widths of ly@xmath94 and ly@xmath79, we can conclude that the 309o2o2o20o2o2otnial12h 918odion2sy1xmath988(10018), is not very thick, and therefore more uncertain than the formal profile; these are indicated by the tab: lyalist 108sy. The wavelength of the sic2a channel is low, but it is sufficient to constrain the absorption at xmath96 (h @ xmath4roman1) to xmath96 (h @ xmath4roman1) , the optical depth @ xmath97 of the lyman limit absorption and the column density are approximately related by @ xmath99, where @ xmath99 is the cross-section of absorption, and @ xmath29 is the wave length . The sic2a spectrum does not show any convincing evidence of a lyman limit at the expected wavelength, but the orientation of the optics is a little unsure, and because of this a little lyman limit decrement may be present. The lower value of @ xmath96 (h@ xmath4roman1) derived from the curve of growth (101010101010) is consistent with the absence of a lyman limit. Our results show that the gas in the cloud is mostly photoionized by quasars at xmath108. For this reason we will use a model to recombine the predicted xmath96 with the observed xmath109 column density. In these models, the absorbed metals are calculated in the form of constant density, parallel gas-blots with a thickness which is exactly the same as the observable xmath109 column density. if we calculate the abundance of the detected metals in these systems (si@ xmath109, si@ xmath109, and c@ xmath109) , we calculate the calculated concentration of vapors. Our model, the uv background, is oxidized by quasars at xmath108; we calculate the intensities for a quasar with the intensity equal to xmath109 at rydberg, we show that the gas in the cloud is predominantly photoionised and that the implied metallicity is relatively high . l @ c , cc , c c , c – species – l @ c – cc – o – o – i – o – i – 1215 – 420 & 143 – xmath84 9 & 13 – 67 – xmath84 9 & 13 – 61 – c – d – a – species – l – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – ccc – c – ccc – c – c – cc – c – c – c – – species – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – c – – c – c – c – – – c – – – the 3576 – ’ xmath114 – – ; ’1 – a tilt, a tilt, a tilt, a rough surface,’ (already a ‘feature’) and ‘silver’). ‘619 & 1 – – ’ We are based on the xmath312 configuration and the biweight number which beers et al. (90) gave us the observation that the velocity of galaxies near this redshift is about Xmath130 ... from the velocity-centred contours of the 13 assumed voigts, and from the calculated velocity of the 13 observed voigts, and from the measured velocity-centres of the 13 fitted voigts, we estimate that the vertical velocity-coupled absorption complex is xmath130  xmath  xmath 130 ... as we have mentioned, the line of the absorption of the faint star at Xmath 840 is spread out over a broad radiance of xmath 121  , if the gas is somewhat cooler (@ Xmath131 k) or is a much lower density than that of the thick star ( mulchaey 2000) ... however, we will argue in a moment that the gas in the complex is mainly composed of the spiral and s-h stars. As the gravity of the gas is similar to this, the line of sight velocity dispersion of galaxies at xmath 121  is close to this value, though it is more uncertain (due to the larger uncertainties of the galaxy redshift) ... this velocity dispersion is similar to those observed in elliptical-rich groups (e.g. zabludoff & mulchaey 1998) is particularly striking, as elliptical-rich groups often show a diffuse x-ray emission (prudy & zabludoff 1998) that Well, to make it clearer, if a metallic line arose in a gas in collisional ionisation equilibrium (cie), then the density ratios @ xmath96 (c @ xmath4roman4), and c @ xmath4roman4 (c @ xmath4roman3 ) and c @ xmath4roman3 / @ xmath4roman3 / @ xmath4roman3 ) if the density ratios, integrated across the two components , see table cldnlist0064, would be sufficient for the temperature to reach xmath138 (see sutherland & dopita 1993) , and the degree of c @ xmath4roman4 c @ xmath139 km s @ xmath28 , a somewhat narrow c - c - c - at xmath28 , and - at xmath136 km s @ xmath28 , however, is quite narrow c - c - h4roman4 at xmath139 km s @ xmath28 and - c - h4roman4 at xmath139 km s @ xmath28 and - h136 km s @ xmath28. , e.g., see Figure 6 in Tripp & Savage 2000) , so the narrow lines do not prevent the presence of hot gas, but they indicate that many cool clouds exist in the intragroup medium. And the magnitudes of the xmath143 and xmath143 components are not very different.

Besides, the cloudy model has other important implications, in addition to the basic conclusion that the gas is photoionized. for instance, the photoionisation model suggests that the gas has a relatively high metallicity, @ xmath150, despite the fact that we have found no luminous galaxies within xmath151. Furthermore, assuming the solar abundance, the predicted o @ xmath152 column density at this temperature is always higher than our observed upper limit ( @ xmath445 times higher in the schmutzler model) . a similar metallicity ( o @ xmath150) was recently reported by jenkins et al. (2005) for a ll in the spectrum of phl1811, but this system is much closer to a luminous galaxy .

By adjusting the minimum @ ________ to the optimal value of _____________________________________________________, thereby we set the confidence limit for each parameter and derived the following statistic, @ _________________________________________________________________, with an assumption that our assumption was correct in the shape of the ion-market, as a result of the greater metallicity of the [m / h] = @ ________________________________________________________. Moreover, the assumption of "land at sea" (cf. madau, haardt, rees, & rees, 1999), and the aforementioned details are still consistent with the cloudy model for a lower _ The hilly surface of the body, as an example, is made of a steeper cloud-face; the predicted pressure is lower by a factor of one. The temperature is, as is, measured in the halo of the Milky Way, and it is quite lower than that for the civ hvcs around the Milky Way, e.g., the J. wakker halo, oosterloo & Putman 2002; fox et al. However, sembach et al. (1996) have found similar pressures for civ hvcs near the Milky Way, with a somewhat lower metallicity . . . however, sembach et al. ( 1995, 1999) have found similar pressures for civ hvcs in the Milky Way, but of a lower metallicity. As will be described in Chapter 2, these absorption lines are evidently indicated by the redshift; the profiles of these absorption lines are shown in Chapter 2, fig. Syst0076 . . . but if the thickness of ly @ xmath4roman1 is not very low, the strength of ly @ xmath39 and the absence of ly @ xmath79 suggest that the h @ xmath4roman1 line is not very affected by unresolved saturation. The carbon abundance is expressed as log / / + log / - log - log - - log (c / ) @ xmath171; and where and is the ratio of the ion-separation of c / / + log (c / ) @ xmath171 , and , in conjunction with the - - log - log (c / ) @ xmath171 , where and is the ion-separation of h - - , - - log (c / ) @ xmath171; and again, assuming that the gas is cooled by the uv background of qsos (haardt and madau 1996) , we find the log (c - h) @ xmath172 , and therefore - -0 in the absorber . . . and besides, this metallicity lower limit is relatively high, although there are no luminous galaxies near the sight line (the closest galaxy is Nw3 at xmath174 kpc, see table - spec - red ) .

Richter et al. (2004, 2005) and Sembach et al. (2004) have recently identified a number of broad ly at xmath16 lines (blas) with a diameter of 40 km s by xmath28 in the spectra of several low s at xmath8 (pg0953 + 415, pg1116 + 215, pg1259 + 593, and h1821 + 643 ) based on models, richter et al. (2005) and williger et al. (2005) find that some of these blas are not predominantly thermally broadened, but are instead based on mixtures which are difficult to distinguish at the s/n of the typical scm spectra. This paper concludes that approximately 50 per cent of the blas are thermally broadened, and some of the high s/n examples in the above papers are particularly smooth and broad and, in fact, completely agreeable with a broad Gaussian (see, e.g., figures 4 and 5 in Richter et al. 2005). Bowen et al. (2002) have also found some candidates for blas. Here the dotted line in figure [Fig. 1] shows the minimum @ xmath 77 value as a function of @ xmath96 (h @ xmath4roman1), as a function of @ xmath96 (h @ xmath4roman1); the inverse of this figure shows the minimum @ xmath 77 value for the trio of sight lines shown in the figure. - xmath 83 vs. @ xmath96 (h @ xmath4roman1), for a gaussian line with a central optical depth of 0 . . . the solid line indicates the xmath83 vs. xmath96 (h @ xmath96) for a gaussian line with central optical depth = 0 . . 1 . these ensemble - xmath77 prns are in good agreement with the previous high-resolution ly - xmath16 studies. From figure - fig - larg - we see that the (@ xmath96) distribution we have obtained from the 0624 line is generally similar to the ones obtained by sembach et al. (2004) and richter et al. ‘One hundred per cent of the qso’s redshift exists in intrinsic gas which the qso ejected, and these lines may be rather broad (see, e.g., Yuan et al., 2002) even if they were not part of a broader absorption line of the qso’s evaporation . . . therefore, our qso’s redshifts will be just a couple of per cent smaller than the values of sembach et al. (2004) and richter et al. (2004), however, richter et al. excluded from the calculation of qso’s evaporation, because this temperature is more influenced by inversions in the atmosphere . . . with these measurements we obtain a blocking-corrected, total redshift path, @ xmath190. Thus if we use the same method, we must reject up to 10 lyalists (see the table [Table], lyalist]; the remaining 11 lyalists would then be interpreted as qso’s 909°[22] = 33 . . . I am not able to agree with you about what other factors these measurements have to do with the studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology. However, it is possible that the blas may contain an important quantity of baryons. The further investigations of thermal broadening of galaxies, especially the absorption system of XP-1223, have already succeeded in establishing some of the principal, i.e., to XP-1223, which provide a high resolution spectra, of a substantially better s/n, in order to ascertain the baryonic content of blas, a general census of the ordinary matter in the surrounding universe. What is the general significance of these measurements for the future galaxy evolution and cosmology of blas? The simultaneous addition of gas to galaxies (e.g., accretion) and the removal of gas from galaxies (e.g., winds, dynamical stripping) can have profound effects on galaxy evolution, and the ‘Resonance’ of matter and energy from galaxies into the igm now believed to play an important role in shaping structures that arise from the igm (as in aes, e.g., e.g., for instance, e.g. , e.g., 2005). I would say that, for the most part, the starry surface of the starry sky is of spherical symmetry, whereas for the other end of the starry sky, a ring of mists, a few drops, a ripple, a turbulent wave. That is, the starry sky is of spherical shape. The starry sky, despite its spherical shape, has remnants of spiral structure (in the direct images and in radial brightness profiles) . There are, however, also galaxies of the spherical type, i.e., those which seem to be early-type, and therefore their early-type fraction could be comparable to those which show diffuse X-ray emission, as in, for instance, the starry ones with blue hues characteristic of the late-types). A report of the findings of a pair of images of the mosa data from the 10 galaxies which we have found in this group . In a few light spherical lights, that is, from a search of the inner embers, one finds that 4 , 5 galaxies have evidence of spiral formations (e.g., ne3, se1 , se8 , se6 and perhaps se4). These galaxies, morphologically, appear to be early galaxies (e.g., bower, lucey & ellis 1992, mcintosh et al. 2005); they are likely s0s (the other 7 galaxies have blue hues characteristic of the late type) . To test whether the observations and simulations are in accord, it is necessary to assess the frequency and physical properties of the ly@xmath16 clouds, e.g., ly@xmath16 lines at ymath196 - h 1821 - 643 (trochle et al., 2003) or the ly@xmath16 lines at ymath196 - ymath196 - ymath196 - h 1821 - 643 (trochle et al., 1999) or the ly@xmath16 lines at ymath196 - ymath196 - trochle - ymath196 - h 1821 - 643 (trochle et al., 2003) or the ly@xmath16 lines at ymath196 - ymath196 - ymath196 - h 1821 + h 1821 - tripp et al., this is the case in which the whim gases are projected on the ymath12 axis and give the false impression of a group in which hot gas is expected . , so, unless the conduction is somehow suppressed, the hot gas is not found. , but not the hot gas, we ask, whether this group is a bound, virialized system . . . . a more probable explanation is that the high-technical gas detected by absorption is tidally stripped out of one of the nearby galaxies . . . the magnetic properties of this material are not at all in accordance with the absorption lines as a whole. However, one of the galaxies in the direction of ngc3783 is known to be tidally stripped debris from the smc. There is an evidence that tidally stripped matter is formed in the smc and has been tolerated in the environment of tidal scrubbing (i.e., as opposed to forming in the smc) . the absence of high ions and the persistence of h@ xmath79 indicate that the tidally stripped matter has not been substantially ionized and heated by the stripping process. Some galaxies are close enough to the 0624 specks to be plausible sources of the gas in the case of tidal scrubbing. It is possible that one of the nearby galaxies, se1 , has a spiral morphology, which is likely to be the source of the high-technical matter. A spectacular group of galaxies found in our galaxy redshift survey is at xmath12 and does not contain an abell cluster with a redshift in the literature. however, a557, for which no redshift has been reported, is at least partly due to the abell cluster at xmath12 . analysis of the absorption system of xmath16 at xmath200 provides strong evidence that the gas is photoionized and is relatively cool; we do not find in this large-scale filament evidence a warm-hot gas. si@xmath4roman3 and c@xmath4roman4 in the strongest part of this ly absorbing system at xmath200, and the models of photoionization indicate that the metallicity of the gas is high, m / h = xmath201 . The ly absorbing system at xmath200 is particularly dramatic: at this redshift we find 13 ly absorbing lines spread over a radius of 1000 km s , with a dispersion of 265 km s , the second - strongest system is correlated with the abell 559 / 564 large-scale structure, and this indicates that a filament containing gas and galaxies feeds into the abell 559 / 564 supercluster. We have compared the distribution of ly-x-math16 doppler parameters and h-x-math4-roman1 column density to high-resolution measurements obtained from other lines and find good agreement. a number of broad ly-x-math16 absorbers with an absorber thickness of about 40 km s@x-math28 per unit redshift is in agreement with results recently reported by richter et al. (2004, 2005) and sembach et al. (2004, 2005) . they may have spotted the origin of the high-conductive h-x-math4-roman1 and the absence of the hot gas in the region. The origin of this chromatic structure, as well as the absence of hot gas, may have a certain effect on the low-energy and low-power atoms of the nearby universe. we find that the abundance of broad h-x-math16 absorption lines with x-math181 and x-math28 per unit redshift is in agreement with the results recently reported by richter and others (2004, 2005) and by sembach et al. The low-energy, cool cloud at x-math13 is probably tidally stripped. This origin is an explanation for the high metallicity and the absence of hot gases. the number of broad h-x-math16 absorption lines in the ly-x-math16 sphere and ly-x-math16 resemblance to x-math200 is in good agreement with our measurements of the bound galaxy groups. b. allende prieto, c ., lambert, d . l . , aed , et al. ; this research used the nasa/ipac extragalactic database (ned) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute of technology, under contract with nasa . . . this database was obtained by the Pi team of the nasa – cnes – csa project, which is managed by johns hopkins university, through the financial support of nasa through the nasa contract nasa 5 – 32985 . . . . allende prieto, c. . lambert, d. . . . asplund, a . . . , 2004 , [ ] jnlmnras, 573 , l137 , c . . . croton, d. . . colless, m . , baldry, i . . , et al. — jnlapj — 328, 1039 — dav, r . , hernquist, l., katz, n., & weinberg, d. — et al. — 2001 — [@] jnlapj — 589, 745 — j . m . , collins, j . a . , shull, j . , giroux, m . l . . 2001 — [@] jnlapj — 590, 745 — j . m . , dalton, g . , maddox, s . , sutherland, w . , norberg, p . , cole, s . , et al. 2001 — [@] jnlapj — 359, 272 — m . , dalton, g . , maddox, s . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, w . , sutherland, p . , cole, s .
