There is a vast amount of information on gl 229b , as it is not only the first brown dwarf recognized as genuine gl 229b , it is also the brightest and best-studied t dwarf known , it has an effective temperature of xmath5k, it lies squarely between the latest l dwarfs (xmath6k, xcite) and the giant planets of the solar system (xmath7k). In fact, its spectra of spectral measurements from xmath11 to xmath12 and an accurate parallax@ xcite allow for a precise measurement of the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b. The spectroscopic observations at xcite covering the range from 0 to 5 - xmath13m have revealed a very rapidly declining flux, beginning at 1 - xmath13m, with the unmistakable presence of cs, s, cs, and cs, and the vanishing cs, indicating the absence of the cr, feh, vo, and tio features characteristic of late m and early l dwarfs . a wealth of data on gl 229b has been accumulated since its discovery five years ago. Finally, noll, geballe & marley (1997) and Xcite (1997), have figured in the spectra of gl 229b , it is quite remarkable, and suggests the spectral appearance of the giant planets of the solar system, which have temperatures of up to 200, 1600, xmath10k , xcite Fig. 2.2 Our results are expressed in terms of gravity, but not necessarily from the data we have. In this paper we present new high-resolution spectra in the Xmath0, Xmath1 and Xmath2 bands. The addition of the   red spectrum of xcite in a measure of the h xmath3 abundance of gl 229b, broadly defined as the metal spectrum, to obtain for the first time the presence of nh xmath3 in the spectrum, and to estimate its abundance at two different depths in the atmosphere. The synthetic spectrum and our method of analysis are described in Part 2. Our results, relating to several molecules which can be at least detectable, are referred to in Part 2. Section 3 illustrates how a precise parallax, a well-selected spectral distribution and evolutionary models of a broader scope of xmath14 and gravity are greatly reduced without resort to spectrum fitting. The results are expressed in terms of surface gravity, which can not be determined from the data presented here. We present new high-resolution spectra of gl 229b in narrow intervals in the Xmath0, Xmath1 and Xmath2 windows. In general, these are among the most sensitive spectra obtained. a two-line rota was derived from the interpolation of the rota. This is most often comparable or somewhat smaller than the signal from gl 229b. The wavelength calibration was achieved by observation with arc lamps and is in all cases more than one-fourth part of xmath17 (xmath17). The wavelength calibration was achieved by observation with arc lamps, and in all cases is better than one-part of xmath17 (xmath17) . In all cases the match of the airmasses was better than five percent, and consequently the residual telluric features were very small in the ratioed spectrums. the error bars are judged by point-to-point variations in featureless parts of the spectrum, the signal-to-noise ratios at the continuum peaks are approximately 40 in the xmath2 band, about 25 in the xmath1 band, and about 30 in the xmath0 band . , there are almost all features caused by h . . . in the xmath9 band the red side of a ch . . . . . , which is responsible for the features short in xmath20 m . two lines of neutral potassium can be detected near xmath21 m . And while the opacities of nh@xmath3 and h@xmath9 are not negligible in this part of the spectrum, neither molecule is capable of forming spectral features. , they cannot be directly determined from these data, mainly because their opacity is weaker than that of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9, and because of their considerable pressure stretching (see 5, 3). At the xmath2 band the flux of the nh@xmath2 band emerged from a window between a strong h@xmath8o band and a strong ch@xmath9 band (fig. ). This window is a slit between the strong h@xmath2 band and the strong ch@xmath9 band (see fig. ). , the spectral properties are formed by the h@xmath2 band at shorter wavelengths (at xmath24) and by the ch@xmath8 band at longer wavelengths (at xmath25) . but these data are not at all accurate. Moreover, the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b is now very precise. “With a high degree of conservativeness and in the upper limit of the present age, gl 229b appears to be much cooler than the lower limit of gl 229b. Using the lowest limit for the age of gl 229b at 0 . 209 0 .0 . 0 . 0 @ xmath36k, we find the mean of @ xmath34k. The determination of the gravity by xmath35k is very important. On the other hand, the gravity has not been particularly rigorously defined with xmath35, which corresponds to a mass range of 0 . 0 . . . 0 . . . 0 . . .0 @ xmath39k, in other words, they are all quite firm. In the remainder of this paper the discussion of three atmosphere models which extend the range of allowed solutions (table 2, fig. 4, fig. 4, ): xmath38 (870, 4 . . ), , 940, 5 . . . , 1030, 5 . . . . we find that xmath39 and xmath39 are co-solvents, but at a certain amount of metallicity, ranging from [m / h] @ xmath39 to xmath40 . . . We are using the halosphere, a continuum of opacity, represented by rayleigh scattering, ion mixing, zmath8 , ch, nh, h, zmath9 , ph, ph, ph, ph, zmath, & co, a continuum of opacity whose intensity varies in proportion to the pressure, and the continuum opacity of h , h , k, h , h , h , h , ph , ph, ph, ph, ph , ph, ph, ph , ph , ph , ph , and co , the strong continuum of opacity, causing the rapid decrease in the flux of gl 229b shortening h , d xmath13 m, follows the haze model of xcite, which is a bit deeper than xmath13 m. text> the chemical equilibrium is formulated as in xcite. a section of the chemical equilibrium is shown in fig. , the inflexion point at xmath44 indicates the peak of the convection zone . , in the xmath51, xmath1 and xmath1 bands, and to a lesser extent in the xmath2 and xmath52 bands, the atmosphere is very transparent and is thus probed to the depths of six. This provides an exceptional opportunity to study the physics of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf over an extended vertical distance. Figure 6 reveals that spectroscopy of the xmath53 and xmath54 bands can probe the atmosphere from xmath54k to a depth of xmath55k, corresponding to six pressure scales! The precision of our results is influenced by the validity of the models, the noise in the data, and most importantly by the limitation of the line lists used for their opacity. The opacity of ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 is computed by combining the Hitran @ xcite and the Geisa @ xcite databases, combining with the recent laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations. Besides, the opacity of ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 is nearly complete for @ xmath57k. The opacity of ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 is calculated from the opacity of ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 , and they are fitted to the opacity of both molecules, which 'only' a very short time ago It is to be noted that, as can be seen in Figure 6, the temperature in the atmosphere of gl 229b is exceeding 300 math10k. For gl 229b, we calculate the absorption coefficient of ch@xmath9 from the spectral observations of the giant planets at 1 2400  60  m intervals, and then we calculate temperature dependent opacity (it is incomplete above 300 math10k) from the population of excited levels determined by the boltzmann formula for gl 229b, and use temperature independent opacity at shorter wavelengths. ch@xmath9, we compute temperature dependent opacity (which is incomplete above 300  10k) from the population of excited levels determined by the boltzmann formula for gl 229b, and calculate temperature independent opacity at shorter wavelengths. unfortunately, this prevents us from making use of the regions in our spectrum where ch@xmath9 is prominent. h @ xmath9 is a very prominent molecule in the spectrum of gl 229b, but the current knowledge of its opacity is not sufficient for a quantitative analysis of its spectral signature. Unfortunately, this prevents us from making use of the spectra which contain ch@xmath9 prominent. For example, in figure 6 the temperature in the atmosphere of gl 229b is nearly 300 ° 10k , and as a result the h @ xmath9 is too low for a quantitative analysis of ch@xmath9 . There are a lot of 'opacity' noises in gl 229b, only the opacity is understood, in the gl 229b, whose opacity is a relatively well-known phenomenon. To test the equality of this database, we find that the h - opacity features computed with this list correspond extremely well in frequency with those of gl 229b (figs. 7 to 9), but we notice a noticeable discrepancy in the relative strength of h - opacity features which we attribute to the calculated oscillator strength of the transitions (f. 5). These spectra, as a demonstration of the equality of this database, we find that the h - opacity features computed with this list are extremely well matched with those of gl 229b (see Figs. 7 and 9) , however, there is a marked difference in the relative strength of h - opacity features, which we attribute to the calculated oscillator strength of the transitions (5. 1). Hence we have made a grid of synthetic spectra for the three models shown in Fig. 4 with the metallicity of @ xmath69   le 0 . ] [[2]] in steps of 0 . The best fits obtained with the model of intermediate gravity (Model B) are almost identical to those obtained with Model B. The spectra of xcite and xcite, xpress, reveal two lines of cs i (at 0 . 852 and 0 . 894 @ xmath13m), and a strong h . xmath9 band, but _not_ the bands of tio and vo common to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs (fig. 7). The spectra of xcite and xcite reveal two lines of cs i (at 0 . 852 and 0 . 894 @ xmath13m) and a strong h . xmath9 band, but _not_ the bands of tio and vo, common to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs (fig. 7). The flux from gl 229b also increases very rapidly toward shorter wavelengths @ xcite, which, according to xcite and xcite, can be no longer represented by a figure of c-sec. In the atmosphere of GL 229b, a condensate derived from the hyaline medium of spherical particles, we expect to have a thick cloud of condensate, which, according to the moxydynamic theory of condensate, may be of adequate thickness. As a rule, tsuji, ohnaka, and aoki (1998) consider this rapid decease to be due to the broadening of the red wing of the 0 – .249b line, the first optical spectrum of a dwarf (sdss 1624 + 0029) shows that this description is correct ... In the cloud-cloud-cloud model, the domain of condensates is described by the following: a vertical density of the condensate, a vertical density of the condensate, a vertical density of the particles, a vertical density of the grain size, and a complex index of refraction of the condensate. The dust opacity is computed with the mie theory of scattering by spherical particles, and is derived from the vertical distribution of the particles, the grain-size distribution and the complex index of refraction of the condensate. The particles' opacity is calculated with the mie theory of scattering by spherical particles, and is calculated by the vertical distribution of the particles, the grain-size distribution, and the complex index of refraction of the condensate. In the lower panel of Fig. 7, the upper panel of Fig. 7 clearly shows the differences in the relative strength of the absorption features of the h @ xmath8o band from the synthetic to the observed spectra. The larger the metallicity, the larger the amplitude of the features in the h @ xmath8o band. This value is the same, or 3f° (equiv) with respect to the density of the features in the h @ xmath8o band, and 3f° in the h at xmath8o band. The metallicity of the atmosphere, 4f°, is not bound by the atmosphere, but only by the density of the features in the h @ xmath8o band, which we have incorporated between 0 . . . 0 . . . ,   m. The results are the same, the difference being manifested in all three atmospheric profiles and indicating inaccuracies in the ab initio line list of h @ xmath8o@ xcite. . . . for solar metallicity, condensation of silicates in the atmosphere of gl 229b in gl 229b will reduce the oxygen content of h @ xmath8o by @ xmath9   . . . . Since the infrared spectrum is based on the halogen of the atmosphere, there is an error in the halogen of a halogen, or there is a little dust opacity in the infrared spectrum of gl 229b (not modeled) . . . In the figure, there is a remarkable correspondence of spectral features between the observed and modeled spectra, although the model spectrum is less successful in reproducing the relative strength of the halogen of a halogen. In the figure, there are two prominent k lines (see Fig. 5) . . . as the ratio of z - xmath0 is, in the first, three, - - we ignore z - - y, we just adjust the logarithm of the flux rather than the flux, as shown in Fig. . Figure 8 shows the effect of sand in the halogen spectrum and the best fit (bottom of fig. ). The halogen spectrum falls between the red side of a strong z - xmath9 band (for 22 m) and the blue side of a prominent z - y, nh - y3 and h - y8s have no negligible opacity in this wavelength. , which, if we look at the total flux in the atmosphere, is not more than 1 . . . a light spectra corresponds to the xmath3 band. Thus, by reducing the xmath3 band’s abundance to a given metal, nh @ xmath3 is uniformly distributed throughout the atmosphere, by constant factor. ... In the case of nh @ xmath3, we find that the best metallicity is at least m/h. for a given metal, and there are still some technical problems with the h @ xmath8o. The results of varying the metal’s abundance are shown in fig. 10 for model b. in the case of model b, the effect of changing the metallicity is strong. In this region the spectrum is formed deep in the atmosphere, where 210k and 220b bars (fig. 6), and there are 155 106 106 bars (fig. 9). There is no distinct feature at this wavelength (at xmath103) that can give a clear characterization of the molecule. In this region, we determine the abundance of nh @ xmath3 as a function of the metallicity, but can not connect the two. , and, as it were, in accordance with the systematic and precise testing of our fit, we have verified that the fit fits are indeed in accordance with the data and models, with the corresponding slope of the spectrum. This we call two-level fit, of metallicity and nh @ xmath3 abundance, and it is only this fitting which we are able to do, which is to say to measure the slope of the spectrum. The maximum value of nh @ xmath3 abundance in the @ xmath1 band is in the opacity of about half the value of the nh @ xmath3 abundance. As the nh @ xmath8 features are fairly uniform in strength and wavelength, a comparison of the spectrum with the chemical abundance of h @ xmath8s or the absence of h @ xmath8s only has a small to negligible effect on the determination of the nh @ xmath3 abundance for a given metal. Figure 11 shows two spectra computed with and without h @ xmath8s opacity. The opacity of this opacity is less than that of nh @ xmath8s, and there are no distinctive features which would allow the positive identification. Since the h @ xmath8s features are fairly uniformly distributed in strength and wavelength, matching the spectrum with either the chemical equilibrium abundance of h @ xmath8s or with no h @ xmath8s has only a small- to-nothing effect on the determination of the nh @ xmath3 for a given metal (see figure 11). I can’t constrain the co abundance by my data. This is where the above-mentioned spectrum, where we probe the atmosphere at 2/3 bar, is most likely to be useful. The second band of co is located in the xmath11 band and, in principle, could give us a determination of xmath108 at a more deeply subsurface level, where xmath109 bar and xmath110b (fig. 6). This is the same level at which we probe the atom at 4/3 bar. the second band of co is located in the xmath11 band, and would allow us to calculate the xmath108 at the lowest possible level. Using the data of the first two spectra, which were computed for the chemical equilibrium abundance of co (@xmath111 at 14 xmath10bar) and for the free mass (@xmath113) , there is no distinctive spectral signature of co at this level (@xmath103) . A third spectrum is computed in the unnatural limit where all the carbon in the atmosphere is in the form of co (@xmath113), and represents the maximum possible enhancement of co. As the third spectra of co (@xmath110 at xmath110) are almost identical, the second spectra are very nearly identical. . . . (fig. 3). The structure of the scheming band is very similar to that of the observed spectrum. Figure 13 compares the scheming band with [m / h] @ xmath104 with the whole scheming spectrum. It is in this scheming band that we find the predominant feature nh - xmath3, which is a subject of discussion in this section. Hence the much better agreement of the scheming band with respect to the scheming band than in the scheming band of @ xmath1 is due to two conditions. First, in this band the transparency is calculated from a linelist, and therefore can be computed as a function of temperature, rather than as a fixed value of 300 - xmath10k. The second, the lower temperature in which the scheming band is formed (fig. 6), is the effect of the incompleteness of the scheming line list above 300 - xmath10k. The scheming of ch . . . is shown in fig. 14 for model b, where m . . . – a few nh @ xmath3 features on a background of h@ xmath8 absorption . . . the properties of the trio at 2 . . . 033 , 2 . . 0 and 2 . 0 – xmath13 – , three are clearly present, 2 . . 0 and 2 . 0 – xmath13 m, but one is absent (2 . 0 – xmath13 m) and three are missing ( 2 . . . , 2 . . 0 – xmath13 m) . Hence we consider the depletion of nh @ xmath3 in gl 229b at the level of the xmath1 s spectra. Using the method of fitting the xmath1 spectra, we express this depletion in fractions of the chemical equilibrium abundance of nh @ xmath3. The result is that for gl 229b the abundance of nh @ xmath3 is too high. The effect of the former can be seen in the trio of features at 2 . . . 2 . . . 2 . . the bottom panel of figure 15 shows the model b fit obtained by reducing the nh @ xmath3 abundance throughout the atmosphere to xmath127 % of the chemical equilibrium value of the applied metal . . . the results are presented in Table 2. for the estimation of nh @ xmath3 features in the xmath2 band, the opacity which we compute is strictly lower than the actual opacity of nh @ xmath3 at any wavelength . . . it seems extremely unlikely that the errors in the oscillator strength of the h @ xmath8 transitions will conspire to mimic the depletion of nh @ xmath3 in the xmath2 band . . . for example, if we imagine that there is no nh @ xmath3 depletion (dot in the dotted line in the top panel of fig. 14) , then the residuals between the data and the fitted spectrum for xmath120 m would be much greater than the typical mismatch that we see in h @ xmath8o features in all four spectra presented here . it seems extremely unlikely that the errors in the oscillator strength of the h @ xmath8o transitions will be able to mimic the depletion of nh @ xmath3 which we find. p. m. 1 - m is a blend of three strong lines from three different bands of h. xmath8 m , our synthetic spectra show that this feature is strong enough to become visible in the background of the h. xmath8 m and h. xmath9 oh - s.414 - m is a mixture of three strong lines from three different bands of h. xmath8 , which has not been compared with the experimental data in this part of the spectrum , this range is remarkably similar. - . the strength of the predicted feature is far above the noise level of the data, and taken at face value, this figure 17 represents a probable depletion of h @ xmath8 - by more than a factor of 2. But, of course, it is desirable to seek this feature at a higher resolution and a higher ratio, because an absence of sulfur in gl 229b would be a most interesting result. - our synthetic spectra show that the feature is strong enough to be visible in the background of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 features. we have computed our h @ xmath8 line as a derived result (r wattson, priv. ) which has not been compared with the laboratory spectra in this section of the spectrum. “The uncertainties of the co abundance are obtained by generating synthetic data, by adding a Gaussian distribution of the observed noise to the best-fitting spectrum. The results of this analysis are also in keeping with @xcite’s finding that a co-cluster of 300 ppm (thus “m/h” = “m/h” = “xmath130”). These results are quite in keeping with our results for model A, which has a co-cluster of 300 ppm ( namely “m/h” = “xmath130”), which is very in keeping with our result for model A which has a co-cluster of 300 ppm (analogous to “m/h” = “xmath129”), which is more than one-fifth the fitted values of the co-cluster. Supposed that a co-cluster has a total abundance of 300 ppm (that is to say, [m/h” = “xmath129”), which corresponds very well to the result of our analysis for the model a, which has a “m/h” = “xmath135” and a “0” = “0”, which is more than the expected value. It is very important to equilibrate the gravity of gl 229b to an astrophysically useful range . The big uncertainty of gl 229b with respect to xmath27 is to reduce the radius, the mass and the age of gl 229b (fig. 4), as well as the metallicity and the abundance of important molecules, such as co and nh ,@ xmath . Sadly, it is not possible to equilibrate the gravity better than xmath136 with the data and models we have now. . The gravity sensitivity of the spectra of gl 229b spectroscopic models reported by xcite and xcite is, as they say, fairly sensitive to gravity. The high resolution spectroscopic method does not allow us to choose between models a, b and c (see table 2), for an increase in gravity is equivalent to an increase in metallicity, and this is only true for a fixed metallicity. For the three models indicated in fig. 4, and using the metallicity we have calculated for each of them (see table 2), the gravity dependence of the ultraviolet colors is - 137 and - 138 and - 139 - this dependence is very weak in the light of the uncertainty in the photometric of gl 229b. The spectrum of gl 229b is formed of a forest of livid molecular lines, principally due to h                                                                            , s the  red spectrum of           the spectrum of the primary star gl 229a, schiavon, barbuy, and singh (1997) found the  -11% between  (-) and  ( ) -cv. Our interpretation of the - metal of gl 229b, with an uncertainty of 70, is given in table 2. We find excellent agreement between our three independent calculations of  m / h for each gravity and conclude that gl 229b is likely to be depleted in heavy elements, e.g.  oxygen. metal depletion in gl 229b is consistent with the observation of the 427 red spectrum We also analysed the metallicity and abundance of several molecules in the atmosphere of GL 229b, corresponding to the same model as in Figure 2 and showing the abundances of the most important molecules as a function of depth in the atmosphere, based on chemical equilibrium calculations, and on condensation cloud formation. The low mass of the primary (@ xmath144), the large semi-major axis and the eccentricity (@ xmath145au and --) and the small angle (@ xmath146au and --) shows that the binary formation, and therefore equal metallicity, are more probable. Similar to ch @ xmath9, all elements are found in ch @ xmath9, but co begins to form at higher temperatures and becomes the most abundant molecule of carbon. The chemistry of these abundant molecules is quite simple. The abundance of h @ xmath8o is uniformly reduced by silicate condensation. c-J -latyn-en - xmath3 dominates the surface, and rapidly forms na - xmath8 at higher temperatures. At deeper temperatures the recombination of nh @ xmath3 occurs, and the ratio of nh @ xmath8 to n - xmath8 decreases slowly with depth. The stochiometric constraints imply that this also leads to a significant reduction in ch @ xmath9 at the level of 870 950 zmath10k. The nh @ xmath3 abundance at 900 zmath10k is nh @ xmath150, which corresponds to the abundance of elemental carbon . In a stable model, the nh @ xmath3 abundance is nh @ xmath3 in gl 229b, and the average 12 % of the nh @ xmath3 of the equilibrium, at 900 zmath10k, is nh @ xmath3; in the yang, the nh @ xmath3 is almost indefinable to the equilibrium, and at 900 zmath10k, the co abundance, which is not proportional to the level of a whole, is, of course, at xmath151, which is of an enormous error; a careful analysis of the spectral spectrum requires careful examination of the balance of ch @ xmath3 in the yang, the non-equal ch @ xmath3 is equal to the balance of a whole and a half zmath3 in the xmath3 band, while the yang 3 is in perfect agreement with the equilibrium value, there is clearly no depletion of nh @ xmath3 in the yang 3 band. As a matter of fact, the vertical circulation of the co—rich gas is most obvious in the stellar atmosphere, but in GL 229b the convection zone remains more than three pressure scale heights below the level where co is observable (indicated by a sphere in the figure.) convection is the most obvious mode of vertical transport in a stellar atmosphere, but in GL 229b the convection zone remains more than three pressure scale heights below the level where co is observed (see fig.) . in this case the influx would be much slower than the influx at the 900@ xmath158k level. At xcite, we infer that h15 years are not longer than 10 years and may be much smaller. In the parallel, to the co/ch/xmath3 equilibrium, the low nh3 abundance could be explained by vertical transport, which reduced the nh3 / n3 ratio at a level found deep within the atmosphere , n3 is displaced by n3 and thus the ratio of n3 is reduced to n3 , and this may explain the very high abundances observed at the 900 @xmath10k level. This eddy diffusion or mixing, timescale, is constrained by the rather unprovable co abundance and by the rather uncertain chemical pathway between co and ch5 . . . as it is carried upward, n3 is converted into n3 . nhiac is given by @ xmath162 where xmath155 is in year, xmath163 is the temperature in k, and xmath27 is the surface gravity in cm / s . Xmath162 assumes that the n xmath8 conversion takes place in the gas phase, though it might be reduced by catalysis on the surface of grains. The time scale increases very sharply with decreasing temperature. For example, if the n xmath8 / n xmath8 ratio is deformed by the reaction at the level of xmath169 (which corresponds to the bottom of the convection zone) the time at xmath169 is a minute longer than the age of gl 229b. At xmath171 the n xmath3 / n xmath8 ratio is analyzed. In view of the relatively short mixing time inferred from the co abundance, the n xmath3 abundance in the xmath1 and xmath2 bands is _most_ determined by non-linear processes, and not by reaction (4). Moreover, at depths where @ xmath169 (which corresponds to the top of the convection zone) @ xmath170yr, the reaction proceeds rapidly enough to establish chemical equilibrium between n xmath3 and n xmath3 . " Xmath1 and Xmath4 are constant concentrations that have been uniformly applied to the chemical equilibrium abundance profile of nh xmath3 (with a large vertical gradient). The equations of xmath1 and xmath173 are now calculated by means of model b, the former is in good agreement with our simple calculation, and the xmath1 band value is now very high. For the determination of nh xmath3 we consider that this vertical gradient in abundance may have been caused by another non-equilibrium process, such as the oxidation of nh xmath3 by the flux of the primary star . . . ammonia is a relatively fragile molecule, easily dissociated by uv rays: xmath175 with a cross section of xmath176cm @ xmath164 , and this is equivalent to the nm / h spectra of nh xmath1 in a few millibars in gl 229b. As the nm / h spectra are constant across the atmosphere, we have calculated xmath173 and xmath174 from the xmath2 and xmath1 band, respectively (model b) . The former is in good agreement with our simple prediction, while the xmath1 band value is high. “As for nh@ xmath3 we have nh@ xmath183 and nh@ xmath184 (mites, priv. comm.) the binary separation is nh@ xmath184. The binary is nh@ xmath3 by removing the xmath189b_ym___2 and by removing the xmath184b__1_ and _1__172b__. This effect is of much less consequence at lower temperatures, so that the abundance calculated by fitting the spectrum is overestimated. because the incident flux of uv photons is relatively low, it is satisfied only at pressures of a few microbars, which are very high in the atmosphere . in the region of interest, the photodissociation destroys only a small fraction of nh @ xmath3 during one mixing period, and therefore does not have a very large effect on the abundance of nh @ xmath3. we believe that the difference between the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 abundances arises from the limitations of the nh @ xmath3 opacity data, which are used to calculate the spectra of synthetic spectra. At 10 . 35, ch@xmath9 was discovered, and a new spectral class, the t dwarfs, was created. Using extensive spectral and astrometric data, the atmosphere of gl 229b gradually became more exotic and complex. with the increasing of the resources of measurements, astrometry, and spectroscopy, our picture of the atmosphere of gl 229b has gradually become more and more complicated. Fig. 9 . The first discovery of ch@xmath9 in its spectrum was a very early discovery and was prompted by the creation of a new spectral class, the td-divisions. Among these features there was good evidence that the rapid decrease in flux was caused by the remarkable broadness of the atom-alkaline metals @xcite. Clearly, the quick decrease in flux is due to the high density of atomic alkali metals at xcite . the presence of condensates is also said to have played a role in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b. We have not been able to further restrict the range of our new nh@xmath0, nh@xmath1 and nh@xmath2 spectroscopy. —and in a sphere, in which there are entanglement, nh — at xmath3 there are three distinct bands, corresponding to three distinct depths in the atmosphere, for an accurate determination of the abundance in each band provides information on the time scale of mixing by the varying thickness of the air. As a result of the limited convection area, we find the intensity of the convection insufficient to give the full extent of the abundance, and the mixing may be due to overshooting or eddy diffusion. This is an unusual and powerful diagnostic tool which can be used to discover the level of the concentration of possible condensates in the visible part of the atmosphere. While cesium and potassium have been detected in the spectrum of gl 229b, it is possible that resonances of k I and na II are a structural feature of the visible spectrum. According to our calculations, nh @ xmath3 is observed in three different bands, representing three different depths in the atmosphere, and an accurate determination of the abundance in each band provides information about the time-scale of mixing by degrees in each band. therefore, no absorber with a large abundance of nh @ xmath3 could be used to infer the details of the mixing process. Further progress in understanding the atmosphere of gl 229b requires more opacity of ch @ xmath3 and nh @ xmath3—and, to a lesser extent, h @ xmath8o, and h@ xmath3o. We thank t. guillot for sharing the programs which proved most useful to us, j. moses for his invaluable insight into the photolysis of nh-xmath3 in giant planets, and k. noll and b. oppenheimer for their data. This new level of complexity adds to the exoticism and the difficulties in the study of t-dwarfs. gl 229b is currently the only t-dwarf known in a binary system. There is no evidence that the illumination of the primary star has any effect on the state of its atmosphere, and gl 229b is most likely typical of isolated t-dwarfs. This study was supported in part by the NSF grants ast-9318970 and ast-962487, and by the nasa grants nag-5-4988 and nag-5-4988. The existing work on gl 229b points to the most rewarding experiments to be performed on t-dwarfs. The astrophysics of gl 229b is far richer than was originally thought. It remains the brightest and most studied of the seven t-dwarfs known to us so far, but its number will be enlarged to several hundred in two or three years. This new scalability and the new challenges of t-dwarfs are a fascinating prospect. we thank t. guillot for sharing programs which were of great help to us, j. moses for incredibly valuable information regarding the photolysis of nh-xmath3 in giant planets, and k. noll and b-oppenheimer It was quite the same in Analytical Physics. . . .
