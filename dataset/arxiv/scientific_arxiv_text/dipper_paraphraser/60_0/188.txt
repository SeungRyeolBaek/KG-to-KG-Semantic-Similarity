As we have already noted, synchronization in chaotic systems is a surprising phenomenon, which recently received a great deal of attention. The heuristic theory and the classification of synchronization are already very well understood and are reasonably well understood, but the mathematical theory is not sufficiently rigorous. Moreover, the synchronization of chaotic systems is not always a uniform phenomenon, and in general the whole is made up of sub-systems, and in the long run its behavior depends on the sign of the central lyapunov exponents, that is, those exponents that are zero in the event of a zero coupling and become non- trivial in the presence of interactions between sub-systems. While this model has a very simple property, it has a non- trivial property: it locks, and in @xcite we have derived the interesting invariant manifold from a convergent expansion. However, in spite of its simplicity, the lyapunov spectrum in @xcite was very simple: the longitudinal associates exponents (i.e., the motion on the invariant manifold) are very simple. However, in the presence of the invariant, the lyapunov spectrum in @xcite is very simple: the longitudinal associates (i.e., the motion on the invariant manifold) are invariant. We can define the suspension flow of Arnold's cat as xmath7, and xmath8 if xmath9 if xmath10 . . . therefore, all the results and statements of xcite are correct, in spite of the re-interpreting of the flow equation (*? ? ? * (2 . 1). We will apply to xmath17 the solution to the following differential equation, but we will refer to the fact that at all times xmath12 the variable xmath13 leaps abruptly from xmath14 to xmath15 and in addition to these discontinuities the flow was smooth . . . so, all the results and statements of xcite are correct, since . . . and . . . , Let the flow on @xmath36 be the dynamics, and @xmath36 and @xmath40 are analytic in their arguments. in this paper we apply the analysis of @xcite to @xmath34. We first write about the construction of the attractive invariant manifold for @xmath34. In this paper we study the effect of @xcite on xmath34. We create the invariant manifold in the proper domain of the complex plane, the boundary of which contains the origin. For @xcite, we express the attraction in terms of a convergence-intensity expansion in @xmath32, for xmath33 and a special class of dissipative functions . . . In the first result, we describe the attractiveness of the invariant manifold for xmath34. The proof of this theorem is constructive: it presents an explicit algorithm for the computation of the generic term of the perturbation series of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath32, it shows how to estimate it and prove convergence of the series. [Put: ] Let xmath35 be the flow of xmath36 in the dynamics, with xmath26 and xmath27 analytic in their arguments. The construction also implies that @xmath54 is an attractor. ‘Put out’ xmath56, i.e., denoting by xmath61 the characteristic function of xmath56, xmath62, for all measurable xmath63. Here, however, is our second result, which is: ‘[3]’. Xmath64 is analytic, and Xmath76 is analytic in Xmath32, for xmath77. Our second result is: ‘A natural and invariant measure of the attracting-response, @xmath64, is defined by @xmath65 for all continuous functions @xmath66 and @xmath60. @xmath68 is supported on @xmath54 and that @xmath69 . the limiting measure @ xmath64 is supported on @xmath64, and that @xmath68 . the limiting measure @ xmath64 is supported on @xmath54 and that @ xmath69 . . . After an exponent is formed, it is bound by an exponent (omitting nodes) and the number of branches in the tree, so that if you have a normal expansion for xmath85, you can produce an exponent of xmath88 by a standard convex enlargement (see, p. 30) , the dimension of the tree is represented by a reference, a tree with xmath83 nodes, whose value is proportional to xmath83 times a value of xmath83, which is also a function of xmath32. Theorem , p. 219 theorem (proposal 2, p. 3) is proved in a few sections of the paper. in this paper we are shown some numerical evidences for the transition from a fractal to a non-fractal transition of the invariant manifold, and we propose some predictions. In this section we will describe the equations for the invariant manifold and formulate some conclusions. The positive local lyapunov exponent xmath89 acts as the gibbs potential of the invariant measure xmath90. In this section we define the equations for the invariant manifold, and we draw a figure representing the relation xmath72 to the invariant extent. , by drawing the fields of the equation at first order in xmath101 and at zero-second order in xmath102, the relaxation of the dynamics in xmath101 is, according to the second condition, "expanding" the equilibrium at the first order. In a word, this relaxation of the equilibrium at first order in xmath101 and at zero-second order in xmath102 is . . .  . if we expand the equilibrium at first order in xmath101 and at xmath102 , in fact, the result would be qualitatively the same. , in principle we can increase the equilibrium at first order both in xmath101 and in xmath106, but the result would be qualitatively the same. . . . . - g . . , g . g . the rewriting follows from the fact that the (indirect) approximate dynamics obtained by neglecting xmath105 is dissipative, with a contraction rate proportional to xmath32, thanks to the second condition: this will allow us to constrain the whole dynamics as a perturbation of the approximate one. - give him the answer of - and look for a solution of xmath121 with [eq: 2] [eq: 2] [xmath122] and - xmath123, with xmath11 and - xmath124 as in ; - xmath105 must be ultimately set equal to xmath32. We shall conclude by defining - in xmath121 - a power series expansion (and to xmath124) - and we shall do so in a form of a power series expansion in xmath117 (at fixed xmath60, as explained later) ; henceforth we shall denote by xmath138 and xmath139 the standard scalar product in xmath138 . . . and also by xmath137, where xmath138 and xmath139 are defined. . . . . the solution of - will be found in the form of a power series expansion in xmath117 (at fixed xmath60, as explained above) . , we denote by xmath174 a node such that @ xmath174 for any node @ xmath174 : @ xmath174 . . .

The 'inner node' is defined as 'a single node' for xmath200, where xmath202 is equal to 'a', and 'a' node integral' is 'a'.

When xmath337 and xmath340 are the two nodes immediately preceding xmath181 let xmath344 be the nodes immediately preceding xmath184. Xmath348, with no loss of generality we assume that xmath340 is of type xmath346 (so that xmath347 is of type xmath315); when xmath348 is of type xmath318 (so that xmath347 is of type xmath315) , in both cases we impose the constraints of xmath349, xmath350, xmath351 . - It is easy to prove by induction that where @xmath360 is given, let @xmath217 be the family of labelled trees different from @xmath218 just by the choice of the labels. - it is a measure of the size of the average of the quantities of @xmath361 , the radius of convergence in the series of @xmath255 and @xmath364 is proportional to @xmath365, which enables us to fix @xmath366 at any moment. Therefore, the radius of convergence in the series of @xmath32 of the series for @xmath255 and @xmath364 is proportional to @xmath365, which means that it is possible to fix @xmath366 at any moment. Moreover, there is a unique srb measure @xmath374, such that the measure @xmath374 can be computed by reason as in (? ? ? ? ? ? ? - Chapter 10 - , which we describe in more detail in our main thesis, and formulate a conjecture about the transition from fractal to smooth (er) behavior, as indicated by our result. Here we have a numerical example of the consequences of our main thesis and propose a conjecture about the transition from fractal to smooth (er) behaviour, as shown in the following figure. In fact, by constructing @ xmath338, @ xmath338, @ xmath328, a positive constant exists at xmath32, such that @ xmath338, @ xmath390 is analytical, and the expectation value @ xmath390 is analytic for @ xmath334, for example, if @ xmath66 is analytic, then a positive constant @ xmath388, according to @ xmath66, such that @ xmath390 is analytical for @ xmath77. The following, from the main theorem, we know that the surface @ xmath54 of the attractor is h * h * * continuous, but we have no control over its possible differentiability. “Take a guess at xmath397 as a calculation of the fractal dimension of the attractor, without any concern for the validity of the hypothesis (which has been rigorously proved only in some special cases, see e.g. ) , it is now tempting to extrapolate to larger values of xmath32 (in the range of validity of theorem [paragraph 2]) where xmath397 is the taylor remainder of the order 2 in xmath32, which is clearly visible in the convergent expansion derived in the previous sections. In the simple case that @xmath33 (which is the case of @xcite) the lyapunov exponents of @xmath407 are independent of @xmath32: @xmath408 . thus, adding to the kalpan-yore conjecture (eq: fract) makes it a fractal force for @xmath32 small, and the fractal force increases (as expected) by increasing the strength of the dissipative interaction. Thus, combined with the kalpan-yore conjecture, (eq: fract) suggests that the attractor is fractal for @xmath32 small, and that its fractal force decreases (as expected) by increasing the strength of the dissipative interaction. The angle of a fractal in a sharp manifold, if Xmath418, was given, could not seem to be a fractal if Xmath418, which could be interpreted as Xmath414; however, we do expect the angle of Xmath418, which could be called Xmath418, to be called again Xmath409. a) Xmath418, b) Xmath418, title = “fig“, width = 264] (50, 0) Xmath418, a) Xmath417, b) Xmath418, title = “fig”, width = 264] (50, 0) xmath418, a) xmath418, b) xmath418, b) xmath419, title = “fig”, width = 264] (50, 0) xmath418, a) xmath418, b) xmath418, b) , title = “fig: “, width = 264] (50, 0) xmath418, xmath418, xmath418, if xmath418, then it seems to be a transition from a fractal, to a smooth manifold, and a) . . . if @ xmath355 is a node of type 1 then @ xmath434, so that the bound for @ xmath435 follows.
