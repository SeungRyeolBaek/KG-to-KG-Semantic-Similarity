– this is a basic many-body problem, which consists of interacting fermions ranging from the ultracold atoms near a feshbach resonance, to dilute neutrons. In our case the density itself is the order parameter, which vanishes for xmath10 and assumes a finite value for xmath11 . – The critical structure of the qcp is also a universal function, which was measured experimentally – Fig. – Phase. We focus our research on the critical structure of a qcp at zero temperature, above the qcp at xmath12, -math13 and -math18, where xmath19 is a universal constant . - the thermal length of xmath20 is equivalent to the mean particle spacing at xmath21 , which is also important. In a qcp the properties of the sphere are independent of the microscopic details of the interplay potential, and are shared with a common universal phase diagram. . . . when a strong interaction is involved, the frictional force is almost perfect for a real fluid, and in graphene the frictional force decreases logarithmically with temperature in the quantum critical region . . . strongly interacting quantum fluids that fill this sphere are called perfect fluids . . . strongly interacting fluids which fill this sphere are called perfect fluids. The advantage of the rigidity theory is that it is controlled even at a strong interaction, while in contrast to the quantum monte carlo it works directly at the thermodynamic limit and needs no scaling . This approach is like the expansion of space in a dimension. Moreover, we compare our large – xmath5 results at xmath23 with other theoretical approaches, including the self-consistent luttinger ward at xcite, and bold diagrammatic monte carlo (bdmc) – @xcite calculations. We find that the entropy density at xmath23 is exactly proportional to the pressure, and the viscosity to entropy ratio (at xmath23) is a universal number, independent of temperature. The experimental measurements of the pressure @ xcite yield an entropy density of @ xmath41 for the gas trapped at xmath18 (@ xmath42) which agrees well with trap averaged calculations @ xcite. However, knowledge of the trap averaged chemistry does not permit us to determine the homogeneous solution for the homogeneous system, so we refrain from making direct comparisons. from the bdmc equation of state simulations of @ xcite, one can extract, by means of the pair propagator, a preliminary value for the contact density of xcite. Our large - @ xmath5 value is only at xmath39 below the bdmc value, which is remarkable in its simplicity, while the luttinger - ward value is about @ xmath40 above the bdmc value, just above the error bars. However, since the values of the trap-averaged, the viscosity of the system, however, cannot be determined from the constants of the homogeneous system, we shall not have direct comparisons. In this study, we have measured the viscosity of a trapped gas and the averaged value of xcite agrees with the averaged value of xcite, but differs from the normal value of the homogeneous system. i.e. tan, that is, we find out the adiabatic and energy relations of the tan adiabatic and energy relations, and we show that they are satisfied, perfectly, in independent luttinger ward approximations. In this respect the appendix [Appendix 2] contains technical details of the quantum kinetic equation. @ xmath43—For the action of a two-component fermi gas, the action is: the action of xmath43; the grassmann variables are the quantities of fermion species of equal mass, the imaginary time is extended to the inverse temperature @ xmath47 (we use units where @ xmath49)—for the rest of the length of the relative momenta can be written in the form of xcite; where the experimental scattering length of xmath56 is experimentally varied by an applied magnetic field, and the effective range of xmath57 depends on the details of the interatomic potential. Similarly, by adjusting to a broad feshbach resonance, if xmath57 is much shorter than the mean particle spacing at xmath61, the detuning at xmath57 is incompatible with the detuning at xmath61. By a fine tuning to a feshbach resonance, the two-particle eddy eddy eddy eddy is very strong at xmath59 and reaches the unitarity limit @ xmath59, independent of xmath57. xmath70 has an unstable fixed point at xmath71, corresponding to the feshbach resonance . . . small fermions will form a bec of fermions; larger fermions will move toward the attractive fixed point @ xmath74 of the free fermi gas (bcs limit). in this work we concentrate on the spin balanced gas @ xmath12 at unitarity, xmath13: the phase diagram for finite @ xmath12 and @ xcite is illustrated in Fig. [Fig.], phase . . . the phase transition line @ xmath78 @ xcite is universal and strictly linear, in contrast to the corresponding phase diagram for a dilute gas at xcite . the transition line @ xmath1 , - 11 is zero density (air) . The left side - the fermi liquid - crosses over to a classical gas. The lower right - the superfluid phase of fermion pairs, the left part is a normal liquid phase at finite density . the low point is a superfluid phase of fermion pairs, and the left - the normal liquid phase at finite density . There is no small parameter to stop these higher-level loops, and they are equally important in the ir ( ). A rotational charge (and thus a non-consumptuous) may also take place in the function of three particles (Efimov effect) in the function of three particles (Eq. ), which is in turn precise. However, at xmath90 the velocity of the particle at xmath91 is decoupled from the velocity of the particle at xmath91, which is exact. This action has a rotational charge with an even number of fields, whose number is given by a bare fermion loop, with -Xmath87 insertions. In contrast to the repulsive fermi gas, where these vertices are irrelevant in the rg sense, for the unitary fermion all these vertices have a marginal rg sense. Finally, integrating the fermions, we can obtain a more effective rotational action for the pairing field xmath83 . Moreover, all the higher rotational vertices xmath89 are singular for small external frequencies and moments and scale marginally in the rg sense. I have found a great number of fermion flavours at xmath5 in xcite. But I have not had time to do it, and I have found it extremely gratifying to see what results I have come up with. As a consequence of this, I have devised a small-scale extension of xmath5 to produce a flavor or flavor of xmath94 and xmath95, denoted by xmath96, by xmath96, and by xmath98 the flavor index. . . . the gaussian integral on the fermion field yields the effective action of xmath100 the effective action of xmath100. . . .   frac  1   g – 0 (ii) xmath112   frac  1   n   int -   frac   d  frac  d  frac  d omega    pi  , b       b    d d  frac   inft                         inft                    end    arranged     end  a convergent and easily computed . at xmath134 the fermions are free: once the shear flow is excited in the infinite system it will go on forever, and the dynamic shear viscosity is a drude weight, proportional to the pressure, according to the sloping sum rule - xcite . Note that the tan adiabatic theorem @ xcite @ xmath131 is fulfilled exactly in the Xmath12 expansion: the change in pressure with the detuning is @ xmath132 because the change of the phase shift with the detuning is @ xmath133, and we derive a sloping factor for @ xcite by a factor of two . note that the high-frequency tail @ xcite @ xcite is a shear field. It is free; once a shear flow is excited in the infinite system, it will continue, and the dynamic viscosity is @ xmath138; the viscosity sum is @ xcite, and eq. . it produces @ xcite . note that the high-frequency tail @ xcite is, in kinetic theory, also at xmath138: the xmath138 function is widened to a peak of width @ xmath22 and height @ xmath5 . Note that the tan adiabatic theorem @ xcite @ xcite is satisfied in the expansion @ xmath22: the change of the pressure by detuning is @ xmath132, and by eq. . cnsm > , it is said that a certain degree of tidal impingement is possible on higher orders; and (iii) the effect of dispersion is the same, and it is possible that the principle term math145 is overruled by the actual term math144 , but it is only a sub-leading correction of the leading real term math144, as follows: cnsm  cnsm  cnsm1; for the shear thickness we assume a vector math148 with a small shear gradient, math149, and the local equilibrium distribution math150 math150 .

Xmath0 - matrix is a modified expression of xmath94 but with full green s functions, xmath201 and analogously for xmath203.

We also observe that in this self-consistent calculation the minimum of @ xmath219 is lower than the large @ xmath219 in eq. . . and, consequently, our results are far superior to those obtained by experimental and theoretical calculations in eq. . . . the unitary fermi gas in the high-temperature critical region is a difficult many-body problem . . . it is strongly interacting, its density is almost twice that of non-interacting sources @ xmath18 @ xcite, and it has no small expansion parameter. a possible reason for this good agreement is that the largest + + - + - approximations of the tan adiabatic and energy relationships, as we show in Appendix - tan . . . this result is slightly lower than the large + + - xcite value in eq. . . a promising step in this direction is to selectively probe the atoms near the center of the trap in order to extract the contact density from the tail of the momentum distribution @ xcite. . . . . we note that the minimum of @ xmath219 is found at a rather lower temperature at xmath220 , which is slightly lower than the maximum of @ xmath219 in eq. . . . .

But to derive the energy formula from mass, the mass usually has only one kinetic energy (cf.
