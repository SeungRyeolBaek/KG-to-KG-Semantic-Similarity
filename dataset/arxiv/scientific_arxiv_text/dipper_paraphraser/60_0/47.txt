" . . " in @xcite the problem of how to give an explicit combinatorial definition of weakly higher categories was solved, and a conceptual framework for their further study was developed. . . . the main idea of @xcite is that, in the description of any system, no matter how grained, can begin by starting with the underlying "grained" globular set, that is, the sets and functions of @xmath . . .   t    ar @  - 1ex > l   t   ar @  - 1ex > l   t   ar @  - 1ex > l   t          - x      . . . . . . . . At xcite, the theory of the present paper is used to show that the funny tensor product of categories which one can get from the gray tensor product is the most severe, which, in the right sense, would be the most severe. The algebras of this xcite - operad are only the algebras of xcite . . . This experience naturally led us to try to define what the higher dimensions of the gray tensor product are, so as to formulate a similar inductive definition as for the strict xmath11 categories, but to take into account a more complete, semi-strict xmath11 category, which in the right sense would form the strictest structure, for example, to replace an arbitrary weak xmath13 category with and without a loss of vital information, is a gray category, which is enriched in xmath14 by the gray tensor product of 2 categories instead of the cartesian product of xcite. Xcite, the theory of the present paper consists in showing that the funny tensor product of categories, which you obtain by considering the gray tensor product, is a valid tensor product. This experience naturally leads us to want to understand what the higher dimensions of the gray tensor product are, so as to have a similar inductive definition as the strict xmath0 categories, but to select the appropriate semi-strict xmath0 categories, which would form the most strict xmath0 category, without losing vital information. He described the relationship between tensor products and the category of graphs enriched in xmath8. This relationship, and the algebras of the category enriched in xmath8 correspond in structure with the algebras of the associated tensor product. This correspondence, the algebras of the category enriched in xmath8 coincide in the category enriched in the associated tensor product. In the present paper, we continue this development by studying for a given category of xmath16 the passage for a given category xmath17, where xmath17 is the category of graphs rich in xmath16, in a systematic way. in the section ' mon monad-disptlaw' (and in the section ' mon monad-dispute') we give a short and explicit explicit construction of the monads Xmath9 for strict xmath0 categories, from which all their main properties can be clearly observed. In section ' ssec : general - op - mult ' ) we give shorter and more general proofs of some of the main results of Xcite . In the present paper we consider the general problem of transferring a lax tensor to a tensor product on the category of algebras of that tensor product. . . . this result, theorem (theorem) is the main result of the paper and provides also the sense in which these tensor products are unique. Any lax tensor product on a category of grey categories has a 'unary' tensor product, which, rather than being trivial as is the case with non-unary tensor products, is actually a monad on xmath16. The lax tensor product created by xmath16 is a monad for two categories. This result, theorem (thm: lift - mult) is the main result of the paper, and indicates also the sense in which these tensor products are unique. Moreover, applying this lifting to the lax tensor products on xmath8 associated with general xmath11 operads (over xmath24) , one sees the structures definable by xmath11 operads as rich categories whose homs are some xmath0 dimensional structure . — The joint computation of happy and bohemian categories is an algebra of a 'contractible' (Melancholy) category. Moreover, in order to interpret the connection between lax categories and lax tensor products, their arithmetics, and their lifting theorem, as well as the very definition of weak @ xmath0 category, it is sufficient to take the property of weak @ xmath0 category as defined by section 'Pan-approach'. In this connection we also show that the main results and notions of higher category theory in the globular style can be obtained in this setting. In this paper we work more abstractly than in much of the earlier work. Specifically, instead of studying monads on the category of @ xmath0 globular sets, or even on presheaf categories, we work with monads defined on some category of enriched graphs . It is possible to see the identification by joyal and street of braided monoidal categories as monoidal categories with a multiplication as an instance of theorem ( thm: a - infinity app) . in the section (sec: contractibility) we recall this notion, give an analogous notion of the contractible lax monoidal structure, and explain the canonical relationship between them. Then the theory of weak @ xmath0 is then obtained. In this form, it is possible to start from the very beginning not from xmath24 as the category of xmath26 categories, but with a nice enough @ xmath16 . “Our assumption is that we have a stacked topological space called xmath32, with points located at xmath29 and at xmath30, we shall be able to define the topological space called xmath32 of the paths of xmath32 from xmath29 to xmath30. In general, if we recall the details, let us denote by xmath32 the reduced strength of xmath2, which we can define by a push-out – i.e. the local connection of a space, or, more generally, the local connection of grothendieck topos, (four) the algebras of any – operad; or, five – the category of multicategories (symmetric or not) . . . . . in recollecting the details, let us denote by xmath32 the category of spaces ’ which are complete, co-complete and a cartesian category . . . given a topological space ’ of spaces ’, which is complete, co-complete and cartesian, let us write by xmath32 a category of spaces ’ which are complete, co-complete and a cartesian category . . . If we do, we will find the inclusion of the sphere into the sphere of Xmath0, and our right adjoint is a functor which moves the bipointed space of Xmath2 from Xmath29 to Xmath30. . . . the collection of spaces @ xmath31 is our first example of an enriched graph in the sense of [cv, enriched], let xmath16 be a category. . . . We take xmath31 to be a collection, and to xmath32 it is our first example of a graph that is (cv: enriched), which is (cv, enriched) in xmath16. This is well proved with the above elementary definition of @ xmath44, which is, push-out, and the pull-back square @ xmath45 . . . . . . - r -  1ex > r -  1ex > m - r -  x - n -   1     - 1   -        - 1     -  1   -  1   r -   -                ,       -       -  -      -        -   -  1    r               -     -   -      -   -  -  -   -  -  -  -           -      -  -  -  -  -  -   - ‘237 a category is given by Xmath64, a category of bipointed enhanced graphs in Xmath64. The series of objects is a type of object of Xmath66, and Xmath66 is an orderly pair of object of Xmath66. The unit Xmath72 sends xmath72 to the enriched graph whose objects are elements of Xmath67, and the hom @ xmath74 is given by the object of Xmath66. As for any group of xmath82, Xmath83 is defined as the following category. Let us take a look at the unit and counit of this 2 - the equal. Let us assume that the graph enriched in Xmath64 gives rise to a functor at Xmath81, where xmath6 is the set of objects of xmath82. Moreover, when xmath64 is the initial object, xmath71 has a left adjoint given by xmath71 . ... ” (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 ) –  “ –  ” –  “ –  –  –   –   –  –     –    –   –  “  –     –  –   –  “ –  “ – where the source and target maps are the product projections, as the presheaf on the category of xmath86 – ‘ – xmath85 – –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –   –  –  –  –   –  –  –  –   –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –   –  –  –  –  –   –  –   –  –  –  –  –  –  –    –  –  –  –    –  – (d)      ar                                    (d) sent> the notions of grothendieck fibration, which can be made internal to a finitely complete 2 - category , which, besides, are right-ass. The more important thing for us is the '' (a lem: g-em object),' '" - , and moreover the obstruction-maps for commas are right-ass adjoints.  This is why, for example, a monad xmath101 on a category xmath16, we shall write 'xmath102' for the category of 'xmath101 - algebras and morphisms, and 'xmath103 for the forgetful functor - . and ' xmath103 for the forgetful functor . . . the direct proof that for any monad xmath101 on a category xmath16 the obstruction map xmath108 is an isomorphism comes from the obvious fact that for any xmath16 - graph - xmath108 the morphism is the same as a morphism on the homs of xmath109, and similarly for morphisms. a_ lax monoidal category _ is a lax algebra for the two-monad_ of xmath114. . . . . there is an underlying category _ math16, a functor _ math116, and maps _ math116 for all _ xmath82, _ xmath118 from _ xmath114 which are natural in their arguments, and such that _  _  _ ope _ limits _ i    pos _ [1] ... ... ? ...                  ope _ i c= 1em   ope  limits  ie You can say 'abuse', and then 'abuse' is a misnomer, which is true even if 'abuse' and 'abuse' are not in the same way. ' The match is very good, when 'abuse' and 'abuse' are not in the same place, 'abuse' and 'abuse' are not at all synonymous with 'abuse'. ' Abuse' - 'abuse', 'abuse' - 'v'    i'  ' : 'c'  ope  x' (x'  i ' x' 'in' 'c') is taken as an indication that the categories of 'xmath122' are enriched with 'analogs' and with 'analogs' and 'abuses' in 'c', and so on, and that when 'xmath123' and 'c' are not both of 'c', it's fairly clear that 'c' is 'c' in this place.' 'c' '  'c' ' In the present paper we shall explain why any @ xmath0 multitensor has a canonical lift. Then, for the present purpose, we shall discuss the interplay between the theory of monads on categories of rich graphs and the theory of multitensors. Xmath121, for instance, was the normalized monad and the multitensors on the category of xmath12, which is multitensors on the category of xmath12 globular sets. At the abstract level, much of this paper is about the interplay between the theory of monads on categories of rich graphs and the theory of multitensors. In Xcite we explained how to associate normalised xmath145 operads with multitensors on the category of xmath12 globular sets. In xmath12 a monad that crosses the category of xmath12 is called a monad that crosses the category of xmath12 – and is the normalized xmath12 – multitensor. That is, a monad that crosses over xmath12 on xmath12 is the monad that crosses over xmath12 when the functor at xmath101 does not affect the object set, in other words xmath148 for all xmath12 and similarly for maps. And the combinations of xmath14 and xmath12 are the same identity. This will result in the following designation: the object set is @ xmath154, and @ xmath155 for @ xmath156, and the other homs are equal to @ xmath151. Xmath160 is now given, where @ xmath164 and @ xmath132, and a map, @ xmath165, given on the object by @ xmath166, and @ xmath167 for @ xmath164, and the hom map between @ xmath168 and @ xmath46 is @ xmath169.    t tilde   tau      0 , k   t  t (z  11   kn  kn  kn  kn  kn    )        tbar   ij       ij     . , they see that the functor @ xmath174 becomes represented in a enriched graph and can be used in the organization of objects in its class. In the simplest case, we assume a little more of xmath16: that it has finite coproducts in order to develop a more conceptual approach. We will see that, in the end, we need only the initial object. So in (ssec: laxalg - const1] and (ssec: laxalg - const2 ) we describe these general constructions, and finally in (ssec: tbar) we finish the proof of theorem (tbar - tbar) . for most of the time we will assume a little more of xmath16: that it has finite coproducts, so that our more conceptual approach will be possible . . . So in (ssec: path - like) we present a condition on xmath101, which assures that xmath101 has algebras and xmath173 categories. , in this situation the wretchedness of the functor functor (I will explain that xmath174) enables an adequate reformulation of the category xmath171 as the category of endocospans of xmath26 as described in section 517 of graphs. The homs of xmath171 are inherited from xmath2 and xmath181 in almost the same way as for coproducts. Xmath176 has an object set given as the disjoint union of the object sets of xmath177, a hom set of xmath178 when xmath107 and xmath179 are objects of xmath177, and all the other homs are xmath171. Xmath171 has a group of coproducts which can be computed under xmath18. This group of coproducts can be formed with finite coproducts under xmath18, that is, push-outs in xmath18, that is, push-outs in xmath18 - -  x - y -  ar [l] - x - y - y - x - y - ar [l] - -  x - y - (c) - f - d -  - a - 0  ar l -  b -   - a -  & 0  ar l -  b -   -  a -  & 0  ar l -  -   -  -  -  - n - -1  - ar r  - a - 2  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -  -  - - -  - - - - - -  - -  - - - - - - -  - -  -  -  -  -  - -  - -  -  -  -  - -  - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - -  -  -  - - -  -  - - -  -  -  -  - -  - - -  -  - -  -  - -  -  - " "Supposing by xmath207 the 2 category whose objects are categories with initial objects, a 1 - cell in xmath207 is a functor in xmath194 in xmath194 , a 2 - cell in between these is also a natural tranformation also in xmath194 , in fact, a 2 - functor in xmath207 has a monad in xmath207, and a 2 - cell in between those two is a natural tranformation also in xmath194 , we have a 2 - functor in xmath210 with homs @ xmath216 , a pair in the middle is @ xmath216, as a homs, @ xmath216 , if xmath214 has finite coproducts and xmath147 is a monad in xmath24 on xmath18, then xmath172 is a monad on xmath171 in a pushout composition of cospans. . . .

[poem: pl, b- adjoint-char] lets xmath16 and xmath196 have coproducts. then we have an adjunction on xmath424   ndist (v, w)              [poem: d-                     b-            perp                                                                          perp We are making an elegant inductive description of the monads of xmath436 for strict categories, giving an explanation of some of their important properties, and a short account of the central result of xcite on the equivalence between xmath0 – multitensors and xmath145 – operads. an object in a category xmath16 is _connected_, if the present-day functor of xmath436 is the one @ xmath436, then it preserves coproducts . let @ xmath22 be a regular cardinal . . . a direct proof is also quite straightforward, and is left as an exercise. Let @ xmath22 be a pseudo-functor of xmath435, that is, we take for granted the inclusion of xmath297 in xmath58. The functor for all families @ xmath438 of objects of @ xmath439 is an equivalence of categories. A more elementary characterisation is that @ xmath439 is expansive if it has coproducts, coproducts, a finite initial object, and given a family of commutative squares @ xmath439  - c i   ar [ d  f     f   f   -     - - d  - d -    - d -   - d - d -  -  -     -  - y  - ] , which the coproducts are disjoint, and the first object of xmath4 is strict. a category is (in this case) inextricable when it is extensive and limited. grothendieck toposes, the category of algebras of a higher operad, the category of topological spaces and continuous maps are all examples of such categories. Nose, xmath32, is the same as to say that xmath32 is an indexed decomposition of xmath32. The terms are analogous, since a topological space xmath32 is locally connected, if its associated topos of skews are locally connected. . . . a local category xmath16 is a local category - presentable - when it is complete and contains a strong generator consisting of small objects . . . a functor - accessible - when it preserves a protected dimension of some ordinary cardinal xmath32. a local category xmath16 is _locally presentable _ when it is cocomplete and contains a strong generator consisting of small objects . finally remark that a functor is _available_ when it preserves _Calibraries' filtering colimits for some regular cardinal xmath32. a set xmath450 of objects of xmath16 is a 'stining generator' when for all maps xmath48 if xmath451 is bijective for all maps xmath48 , then xmath76 is an isomorphism . ‘Dismissive X-MATHS – The next section is called ‘Student of a limits-sketch’; this is the Models of a Limit-Sketch’s Models, of which one readily draws them from any site which presents it ... – the same as the Classification of Small Connected Categories in the Classification of Small Connected Categories, which is a sound Classification of Small Connected Categories – (see Classification of Small Connected Categories) – – and proposition ‘ The – lext-decompose–charn’ (incl. ‘ ‘ ) for a Locally Connected Classification of Small Connected Categories in the classification of Small Connected Categories – the following one, ‘A Locally Connected Classification of Small Connected Categories’, (Supplementary Note: The sub-category of a Small Connected Classified Categories’) ‘Supplementary Note’, ‘A Locally Connected Classification of Small Connected Categories’, ‘Lockable Classification’, ‘Stretchable Classification’, ‘Departable Classification’, ‘Openable’, ‘Closed Classification’, ‘Closed Classification’, ‘Closed Classification’, ‘Dirable Classification’, ‘Commandable Classification’, ‘Departments of Small Connected Classes’. ‘Lockable Classification’ means a Classification whose Connected Classification is Wide-Fielding,’ ‘Dishonourable’, ‘The Classification of Destructive Classes’. - ,  (Lc6) - (the -  ) (she says - lc6), and immediately sees that the slices of a locally c-presentable category are locally c-presentable from the result of the locally c-presentable categories. - first of all, we must remember that colimits in xmath102 can be constructed explicitly by using colimits in xmath16 and the accessibility of xmath101 (see for example @ xcite for a discussion of this) - defining a regular cardinal @ xmath392 such that @ xmath101 preserves filtered colimits and @ xmath101 is locally c-presentable .   v  t  t  ar d   res j   save pos? c -  restore  v  ar r  r  u     res j    save pos? . . . another example of this principle is the following result. a se-a-d-h-o-o-d-h-a-d-m-b-c – se-a-d-h-a-d-b-c-d-e-f -i – o-n-d-o-d-a-d -—a-a-d-e-a-d-d-e-a-d (c-d-e-a-d-d-e-e-ad-se-a-d-d-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-a-e-e-d-e-e-e-e-v-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-n-e-e-f-o-a-o-a-o-a-o-o-o-so-one- and-and-such-and-such, and the co-equalization of any of the co-em-e-e-e-e-em-e-o-o-em-e-o-o-e-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-se-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-so-o-o-o-a-m-o-o- em-worth, if there is any category of the algebras , you will add the objects: “matches,” which is obtained by referring to “xmath46 ” , to xmath479.

In the following we shall make a separate category for xmath487. We shall make a separate category for each xmath488, and the same for every xmath488 for all xmath488.

[14] . [15] . [17] . . . we will see the conditions under which math22 preserves local right adjoints. Let math568 be a functor, math16 be a commixture, math220 be a small, dense, full subcategory of math196, and math569 be a partial left adjoint to math318 , that is, there are natural isomorphisms in math576 and math577.

Let’s say we have given an ordinal @ xmath392 and a @ xmath392 chain in @ xmath604 in @ xmath24 . that will have colimit @ xmath6 because @ xmath422 and products are in transit in @ xmath24, and @ xmath46 is cocontinuous . There, by using @xmath122, one obtains an @xmath142 - ary version of (@xmath142) - that is to say, a version involving @xmath142 - fold instead of binary cartesian products in @xmath24. These, of course, commute with @xmath142 - filtered colimits. Then, for all the links in @xmath164, starting at @xmath29, and ending at @xmath164, we will get an @xmath72 - filtered colimits of @xmath164. - @xmath164 - filtered colimits of @xmath166, which is, of course, parsed by the @xmath143 - filtered colimits.   f   f  f    -  f -  f -  f -   -  v -  -  - e -   -  - v -  -  -  e -  e - n  v   e -  e -  -  -  - w -    - As products, one has a multitensor in xmath619 defined by xmath620, and unit and substitution can be induced by the obvious way from xmath149 and xmath150. Suppose, for example, that xmath16 is lextensive, Xmath101 is a local right nexus, and Xmath149 and Xmath150 are cartesian, it follows that Xmath619 is a local right nexus of its unit and multiplication. This monad is coproduct preserving, finitary, and local right nexus. If Xmath101 preserves coproducts and the cartesian product for xmath16 is distributive, then Xmath619 is a distributive multitensor. Moreover, by the proposition (xmath 6), in “conversation” of @xcite, one can think of the following inductively defined sequence of monads: given a monad at xmath9 on xmath624, define a monad at xmath625. remembering that the category of xmath40 is the category of xmath0 globular sets . . . – Multitensors. – Adjectives ( gv–topos) – Adjectives ( gv–topos) – Adjectives ( gv–topos – approachable – Adjectives ( gv–topos – lattice – plus – with – presheaf) – Adjectives ( gv–topos – accessible) – Adjectives ( gv–topos – lattice – and – tc–eq–nt-g–eq–nt–eq–f–tx-v) – Adjectives of – Xmath–630, and many of the non-inclusive subjects of – xmath–24 are described by algebras of – xmath–– operads over – xmath–24.

The object @xmath652 is an object @xmath16 which is equipped with a functor into @xmath24, and a monad @xmath101 on @xmath16 which is  a fiber-wise' functor with respect to this functor. We shall now exhibit the 2 - functor, which is given by @xmath19, by @xmath652 . It is not the xmath101 s object that affects the underlying object set, but the arrow map of @xmath101 , and the components of @xmath101 s unit and multiplication are identity on objects in the obvious sense. A arrow @xmath646 of @xmath652 is a pair at xmath652 as in the case of @xmath654 , with the added condition that the components of @xmath653 are identity on objects, and similarly the two cells of @xmath652 come with an additional identity on the object. This way of thinking is easy to follow. In fact, once we have established the facts that @ xmath659 as defined here is in compliance with the axioms of a monad functor . . . moreover, any such activity is automatically preserved by @ xmath664. . . . In addition, given a monoidal natural transformation, @ xmath660, it is also quite easy to prove that @ xmath661 is a monad transformation. Let us derive the distributive multitensor of @ xmath122 such that @ xmath663 is equivalent to @ xmath665. a monad functor of the form @ xmath665 is in the image of @ xmath665. . . . [5] Then let @ xmath634 and @ xmath665 be distributive lax monoidal categories . . . a monad functor of the form @ xmath665 is in the image of @ xmath665 if @ xmath101 is distributive and constrained. . . . a monad functor of the form @ xmath665 is in the image of @ xmath6 . The Xmath-flat is given, such that the components of Xmath-flat are identities on the object, and, for Xmath- Flat, one recovers from Xmath-flat the corresponding lax-monoidal functors as the homing map from Xmath-26 to Xmath0 of the corresponding element of Xmath-flat. So the following 2 categories are given, which are given by Xmath-flat, i.e., from Xmath-flat, the corresponding homological functors as the hom map from Xmath-flat to xmath-flat of the component xmath-flat. Hence, from the proof of proposition (xmath-flat - 1 - 2 - cells), we have the following 2 categories, the 2 categories of a lax category, and _op_ lax categories between them, and the 'monoidal natural transformations' between them. These arrows are arrows @ xmath-flat of @ xmath-flat, and the 2 cells are 2 - flats @ xmath-flat of @ xmath-flat. so in particular you have the 2 categories of a lax category, with _op_ lax categories between them and _Monoidal natural transformations between these - that is to say, we use @ xmath-flat to the corresponding functors, and we do the same with the corresponding morphemes to obtain a 2 - equivalence@ xmath-flat . and has been discussed in the sections ([ssec: gamma]] and [ssec: gamma] (see section 1). We have now presented the dual version of the 2 functoriality of xmath22, described in section ([ssec: gamma]] and in the section ([ssec: gamma] (see section 2). as before, xmath684 differs from xmath652 in that all the categories associated with it are loaded with a functor, and all the functors and natural transformations of the same sort are compatible with these forgetful functors. a arrow @ xmath642 consists of a functor @ xmath636 and a natural transformation @ xmath683 satisfying the two evident axioms. as before, xmath684 differs from xmath652 in that all the categories of interest come with a functor, and all the functors and natural transformations are compatible with the forgetful functors.  eft> the 2 category # xmath659 is defined as the locally full sub- 2 category of @ xmath679 consisting of lax monoidal categories, and the oplax monoidal functors @ xmath648 which keep coproducts. ‘ . . .’ equivalences in xmath2 and xmath405 are, as we have just seen, 2eq – mult – mon – dual. The proof of the following result is obtained by the same modification of the proof of corollary ( ‘cor: 2eq – mult – mon – dual): – @ xmath2 and – @ xmath405 provide 2equivalences in xmath689, as explained in – – – – the assignment of – – – – – – ‘equivalences in – – –’. The meaning of this result is understood by understanding the object of the two categories involved, that is to say, the monads in each of the two categories – xmath20, xmath686, xmath674 and xmath687.

In short, we will speak of this clearly with the Corollaries (SEC: Monmon - Distlaw) below. As a result, the Penetrating Law of Xmath701 is a manifestation of monoidal and opmonoidal monads which, upon the distribution of lax monoidal categories, are equally well known, and are therefore usually called “monoidal monads” . The monoidal monads in Xmath701 are monoidal monads defined on the distribution of lax monoidal categories, while the monoidal monads in Xmath702 are the product of opmonoidal monads defined on the distribution of lax monoidal categories. As a matter of fact, an opmonoidal monad on a monoidal category in Xmath16, that is, a monad on xmath16 in Xmath679, comes with extra data of coherence maps in Xmath699 compatible with the monad structure. Therefore, the meaning of theorem (Thm : monmon - distlaw) is that it exhibits these monoidal and opmonoidal monads as being equivalent to certain kinds of distributive laws. 0 . . 0 . . 0 . . 0 . . .  t  tau  e  : t  1 . . .   t  tau  e if you're making maps at xmath716 to make xmath101 into an opmonoidal monad on xmath714 , then it's the same as giving a monad distributive law at xmath719 whose components are the identities on objects. Similarly, you can unpack what theorem (thm: monmon-distribution) (mdl2) says at the object level , test @ xmath715 and use corollary ( cor: gamma-a-a-ecat) to come to [ cor: gamma-a-distribution] in conclusion [ cor: opmon-distribution] , because it is the same as giving a monad distributive law at xmath-distribution whose components are the identities on objects . . . . ex: cheng . . . , after all, in the case of corollary (cf. cf. cf. ) (cf. mdl2) and corollary (cf. ) in order to conclude (cf. op. gtgamma , gtgamma ) These examples of a non-symmetric operad in the usual sense are known as multitensors. Hence, if @xmath700 is a cartesian product, then the projections @xmath723 are the components of a cartesian multitensor map @xmath724 . . . on the contrary, this cartesian multitensor map displays @xmath726 as an operad in all @xmath40.                     - Iiddeqruiqruiqs idrtin      n  prodre i tx i ii   i (no-symmetric) operads in the usual sense can be considered as multitensors. , and that is the reason for the , , , , ,   (symboli i), and  (i)  , , ,  (i)  i. . . .

[m] To say that there is a distributive law of the numbers of the xmaths, to say that there are a distributive law of the xmaths, and isomorphisms of the categories of the xmaths over the xmaths , it has the canonical structure of an operad. This result has an operadic counterpart. Let xmath16 be a distributive category, let xmath101 be a coproduct preserving monad on xmath16, and xmath726 a non-symmetric operad on xmaths 102. the monad @ xmath735, whose algebras by proposition (property: operad- trimble) are xmaths-categories, has a canonical structure of a 'Operator' in xmaths 736. . . . . The cartesian multitensor map, Xmath739, depicts the multitensor @ xmath726 as a non-symmetric operad, and since Xmaths16 is lextensive, Xmath22 sends that to a cartesian monad morphism .

Using the precept _proper_ monad_ trimble_ (application of the precept _proper_ monad_ trimble_) to this case produces the monad of xmath13 - globular sets whose category of algebras is xmath760 and which is decomposed into an iterative series of monads as observed in the section _xcite_ (n. ). According to the main result of this section theorem _proper_ (thm : lift - mult) the lift of every - @ xmath0 - multitensor is unique in the sense that in the example we do not have to unpack an explicit description of the lift of multitensors provided by the theorem, we just give a lift of @ xmath122. If, as the expression 'to lift' is said, the lift is the tensor product of @ xmath123 whose enriched categories are gray categories, that is, the abstracted gray tensor product. On the normalised version of 'Operation' for gray categories, 'Operation' is produced on the category of 'Operation' for gray categories,' and 'Operation' is applied to this situation, to a laxity-monoidal structure of @ xmath122 on the category of 'Operation' for gray categories, 'Operation'. The axiom that ails xmath763 is that it is built by a transfinite process, which consists of only _connected_ colimits in xmath16. Let xmath16 be a category with an initial object, Xmath196 be a complete category, Xmath210 be a small connected category, and xmath765 . [cpl1] if xmath768 is a path, like for all @ xmath557, then xmath767 is also a path, like . . . , if xmath768 is distributive for all @ xmath557, then xmath767 is also distributive. The importance of this is emphasized by [cl2] concol-pathlike . [clp3] if xmath768 is a path-like for all @ xmath557, then xmath767 is also a path-like . speak - which implies homs, as does the construction of xmath767, ; ; 2 - ad (ad) immediately follows, since colimits are concurrent with colimits in general. ; Lem: lift - mult ; we give, with these preliminaries, the monad version of the implied, lifting theorem. Let xmath16 be a locally presentable category, let xmath318 be a coproduct preserving monad on xmath16, let xmath225 be an accessible and normalized monad on xmath18, and xmath774 be a monad morphism whose components are identities on objects. if xmath75 is normalised if xmath779 is normalized, then xmath778 is normalized , but if xmath778 is normalized if xmath779 is normalized , then xmath774 is normalized . for the inductive step, the argument is the same: at each step one takes connectable colimits of normalised functors and componentally connected identity on objects natural transformations, and so by lemma ([ lem: concol] one remains within the subcategory of 986 [0] consisting of such functors and natural transformations. 790 writing   phi  u  m  &  u     ca g  rho  ar d                  ca g (u  r)  -  u    ca g (u  r)  -          ca g (u  r) - retrace of it, - xmath793 is the identity of objects by definition, - xmath794 is by construction, - so the result is as follows: - remember from definition (the lift) that a lift of xmath124 is a normal multitensor, - xmath142 on - xmath141, together with an isomorphism - xmath143, which merges with the forgetful functors into - xmath144. Moreover, - xmath305 is distributive, we say that it is a distributive lift of xmath122. writing xmath796 the distributive multitensor on xmath16 whose unary part is @ xmath123 and whose non-unary part is constant @ xmath151 , then - xmath796 has a distributive lift on xmath305, which is unique up to isomorphism , math123 has a distributive lift on xmath305, which is unique to isomorphism , math 108 has a distributive lift on xmath108, which is unique to isomorphism . That is, @ xmath142 is a distributive lift of @ xmath122. Thereupon we see (cf. gamma-alg-ecat) that @ xmath152 is a distributive lift of @ xmath122. Assuming that @ xmath152 is a distributive lift of @ xmath122 , then by corollary (cf. gamma-alg-ecat) and proposition (cf. pl-neart-char) , @ xmath150 is a distributive lift of @ xmath122. Then by corollary (cf. gamma-alg-ecat) and proposition (cf. pl-neart-char) , @ xmath850 is a distributive monad of @ xmath164, and it is now that @ xmath850 can be reverted to the forgetful functors in the connector of @ xmath168 . in cases where we already know what our tensor product ought to be, the uniqueness of the equation (cf. lift-muti). There is a general case for the tensor product Xmath700 of an xmath0 - operad xmath109, and a normalized xmath145 - operad xmath1 whose algebras are the categories enriched in Xmath109 - algebras. Thus, the tensor product Xmath700 (theory : lift-multi) is just a lax tensor product of gray categories enriched in teisi. the multitensor Xmath122 relating to this 4 - operad has xmath123 equal to the 3 - operad for gray categories. Theorem Xmath700 (theory : lift-multi) is an infinite lax tensor product of gray categories whose enriched categories are teisi. It is possible to illustrate the tensor product of crans as an example of our general theory by rewriting its explicit constructions as the construction of the 4 - operad whose algebras are teisi in his sense. However, such details are not important in the end, for a tensor product (or, more correctly, a bi-closed version thereof) is only really useful once it has been given a conceptual definition. In the end, however, such details will be of no importance, for a tensor product (or, more accurately, a bi-closed version thereof) will only be useful in the first place, if only a conceptual definition is given to it. . . . but we shall be speaking of . . . the category of . . . .

In our case, the colimits being formed in xmath18 at each stage of the construction are connected, morphing in the colimits, and in which they are of the form @ xmath154 for xmath40 . . . and this theorem ([6] a - infinity - app) is an - generalization of the above corollaries. So the multitensor @ xmath346, as given in the above formula, is really slow, and shows laxity as a way to avoid the negative result . . . and this theorem ([7] a - infinity - app) should be considered an - generalization of the above corollaries . as we explained in the introduction, the negative result of @ xcite, indicates that there is no hope of getting an honest tensor from such algebras. Therefore, this theorem ([7] - generalisation of the above corollaries - will be considered as an - generalization of the above corollaries . . . We define by @ xmath829 the ordinary sequence obtained from the set of @ xmath244, the tuply nested sequence @ xmath830, and , that is, a quadratic sum, and is given an important role. The transfinite induction produces for each ordinal of @ xmath227 and for each sequence of @ xmath123 the algebras of length @ xmath0, morphism, morphism, morphism, morphism, etc., etc., etc., etc. Note the notational abuse that we take with write @ xmath123 for the multitensor on @ xmath16 obtained from @ xmath122 by disregarding (ie, setting to constant at @ xmath151) the non-unary parts, but also as monad on @ xmath16 and so on xmath838 as monads . “Let us start with the equation at xmath225. It’s a combinatorial process of homology and geometrical solutions. Let us assume that xmath850, xmath851 and xmath855 have the same object and are termed morphisms in xmath853 and xmath855. So let us say that the morphisms in xmath847 are morphisms in xmath849 in xmath849.

If xmath290 is a functor which preserves connections of a certain type, then it also preserves these connections in each variable separately, because for a connected connection a cocone with only arrows is a universal cocone. This is particularly noted by this corollary (= 3 by 3), if a multitensor @ xmath122 preserves (some class of) reflexive coequalisers if it preserves them in its own right. Let Xmath16 be a local category, Xmath392 a regular cardinal, Xmath122 a distributive math432 - accessible multitensor on xmath16, and Xmath432 a sequence of Xmath123 algebras ... Note in particular that when the sequence of Xmath123 algebras is of length Xmath332 or Xmath273 , the basic coequaliser is absolute ... in the case Xmath332 the basic coequaliser is constant, and in the case Xmath 273 the basic coequaliser is taken to be the canonical presentation of the given xmath123 algebra ... so in these cases it follows from corollary (Ce :Ce :Ce :Ce :Ce : Xmath – simple) that Xmath9 and Xmath 915 are the same.

So, by taking xmath934 and examining the homs, means that by corollaries ( cd: induced-monad very-discretionary) and by (cd: vexp-simple) one has cd: induced-monad-subsequential, which is very-discretionary.

By induction, we can easily establish that the codomains of the maps in any of the classes – xmath988 , xmath998 , xmath996 – are connected, so that proposition ‘property’ (‘property’) can be applied. Continuing the discussion from section (‘Section C: Tci’) we now explain why operads which describe only trimble ‘math’ categories are contractible. ‘ Thus math1018 is contractible. math951 is contractible. It is an essential feature of the doctrinal definition, to include the point in which the indivisible space is contained. We have noted in section (www.ssec.org) that a basic feature of the trimble definition is the little interval operad which is adapted to act upon the paths of any space. a significant feature of this operad is that it is contractible, a topological operad @ xmath0 being contractible when the unique map of xmath1024 is in xmath1024. if @ xmath48 is a trivial xmath1024 fibration then so is @ xmath50 for all xmath1027. I will write @ xmath1030 for the forgetful functor for each @ xmath0. xmath1036 inductively derived from section (SEC: Tci) we assume that @ xmath1036 sends trivial xmath1022-frictions to trivial xmath998-frications, and suppose that @ xmath76 is trivial xmath1022-friction. Thus the result of lemma (Lema: ind tf - path - spaces) follows. The relationship between trivial tatters of spaces and globular sets is expressed in [Prophet: pres - tf]; if @ xmath48 is a trivial tatters of tatters of tatters, then @ xmath1031 is a trivial tatters of tatters of tatters. Thus is the result of lemma () (tind-tind-tatters). In this section ([p. 332] [438] we exhibited in a straight-forward way the algebras of an xmath0-operad with a straight-forward application of two abstract results ([5]): the first one, ([6] [7] [8] [9], which is an algebra of an xmath0- operad by a recursive application of two abstract results propositions ([8]] ([9]] A class of maps of #xmath16 is given, and the non-symmetric operad @ xmath1039 and the non-symmetric operad @ xmath653 are trivial Fibonacci.

For the algebra of xmath1182 of xmath114, one has the reflexive coequaliser @ xmath114  (sx,  mu  s x) :   s  eta  m Xmath1195   colim  m     n  sq m   = – Xmath114 and Xmath225 are monads in Xmath16, Xmath1180 is amorphism of monads, and Xmath104 is an xmath114-analytic . . . if, furthermore, xmath114 is * obtainable for some regular cardinal Xmath1132 , then for any ordinal Xmath0 such as xmath1163, one can take xmath1207 as an explicit definition of xmath1205 and the associated coequalising map in xmath734 . . . . (Certificate ) which (Certificate ) and which (Certificate) are . . . and that (Certificate ) exists, which is a degeneracy of this isomorphism. (Et cetera) for a regular cardinal, whereas for any ordinal @ xmath0 such as xmath1163, one may take @ xmath1207 as an explicit definition of @ xmath1205 and the associated coequalizing map of @ xmath734 taken from the dubuc triangle theorem.

But to describe xmath777 and xmath778 , we must, in the first place, set the first stage, xmath1225, xmath1223, for each stage, xmath1227, as a simple step, define xmath1232 and xmath1233, as the maps induced by xmath1234 and xmath1235, and the universal property of xmath1194 as the colimit of the sequence of xmath1237, respectively. . . .

The data of xmath101 is still not quite explicit enough for our purposes.
