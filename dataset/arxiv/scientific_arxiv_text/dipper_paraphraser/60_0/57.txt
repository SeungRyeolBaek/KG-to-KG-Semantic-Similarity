Now in the study of spin glasses much research has been directed either theoretically or theoretically at the properties of the atomic-structures in the magnetic field. However, the development of the true thermodynamic sg transition in the magnetic field has remained largely unsatisfactory to date. In the case of the atomic-structures in the electromagnetic field, moreover, much work has been done, either in theory or in physics, on the properties of spin glass. On the theoretical side most of the mathematical studies have been devoted to the properties of the atom-structures of the simple ising model, especially the three-dimensional, three-dimensional, edwards-anderson model. While the existence of a true thermodynamic transition in the magnetic field is known, the question of its existence or absence in magnetic fields remains occupied. If one considers real experimental atom-structures, one must keep in mind that many of the materials that are atom-structures are more or less heisenberg, in the sense that the random magnetic anisotropy is significantly weaker than the isotropic interaction. This observation is closely related to the heated controversy: is the orderly state of the atom-structure in the zero-field actually symmetric? (This is further discussed in relation to the hotly debated question of whether the ordered state of the atom-structure in the zero-structure exhibits a real rsb, or not.) Although the experimentally observed a rather sharp transition, it is experimentally observed to be rather asymmetrical. a relation of such temporal changes is apex of the equations of the relative temperature of the sg transition temperature in magnetic fields, in which the temperature of the sg transition is much less dependent upon the field-dependency of the sg transition temperature. This connection, however, of the mean-field sherrington-kirkpatrick model (Fig. 4) is such that its dependence on the subordinate field is very similar to that of the experimental sg transition temperature at xcite. This quasi-field-of-being of the sherrington-kirkpatrick model, which assumes an infinite-range heisenberg exchange interaction with the weakest and most random magnetic anisotropy, exhibits a transition line of the same kind as the experimental transition, i.e., that is, the so-called de almeida-thouless line at xcite in the weak-field regime where the anisotropy is important, and that of the gabay-toulouse line at xcite in the strong-field regime where the anisotropy is not important. Hence, the question of the true nature of the observed sg transition in the magnetic field remains unsolved. One of the authors, after having recently suggested a scenario, a ‘cartooning-chirality’ model, aimed at explaining some of the puzzles that have been posed by the experimentally observed sg transition at xcite. It is based on the fact that the chirality, which is a multispin variable that can represent the sense or the handedness of local non-coplanar spin structures induced by the frustration of spin, plays an essential role. the chirality term, eq. (eq.) (i.e. chidef) (as in a pseudoscalar way) in which it is invariant under the global rotations of the chirality but changes its sign under the reflections of the chirality (or inversions), which are a combination of reflections and rotations. Note that the chirality defined by eq. (i.e., chidef) is a pseudoscalar in the sense that it is invariant under global rotations of the chirality, but it has changed its sign under global reflections or inversions, which can be regarded as a combination of reflections and rotations . The chiral - glass transition of a fully isotropic heisenberg sg is defined by ref. Xcite. Note that in the chiral - glass transition of a fully isotropic heisenberg sg there is a novel chiral - glass ordered state, in which only the chiral - glass transitions exhibit a glassy long-range order (lro) while the chiral - glass transition remains paramagnetic. (Patentally) it is noted that the equilibrium in the firmament is of the same chiral – glass transition as in the zero – field. There is some argument that the equilibrium in the firmament is of the same chiral – glass transition as in the zero – field. This is an interesting observation: the equilibrium in the firmament is a form similar to the equilibrium in the mean field model. Interestingly, in this case the equilibrium in the firmament is of the form gt as in the mean field model, where gt – line is constant. We emphasize, however, that their physical origin is quite different. In the present paper, we describe the results of our large-scale monte-carlo numerical simulations of the firmament 3d heisenberg sg @ xcite. The chiral-glass transition in the firmament was assumed to be of the same nature as the zero-field transition. This hypothesis was taken to mean that the firmament would behave in the firmament in the system as a chiral-glass transition, rather than as a chiral transition in the firmament. various physical quantities were calculated in our firmament by means of our mc simulations. The firmament was discussed, in particular, in ref. xcite. - jie - v is the total square of all jie's, the max square of which is the sum of the square of the square of the square of the rectangular of the hamiltonian; xmath 15 - which is a three-dimensional vector, - xmath17 - the intensity of the magnetic field applied in the xmath17 direction. critical properties of the chiral glass transition are analyzed in [selective part] of the model. Our numerical results are described in terms of the recent experimental result of canonical sg. - In this section we introduce our model and discuss some of the details of our numerical method. we perform equilibrium simulations on this model - the model is the isotropic classical heisenberg, with a simple cubic lattice in hamiltonian geometry, @xmath25, where xmath15 is a three-component vector, and - xmath17 is the intensity of the magnetic field corresponding to the xmath17 directions. The lattices studied are simple cubic lattices with xmath25 sites, xmath26 , 8 , 10 , 12 and 16 with periodic boundary conditions. The theoretical average is taken over the xmath24 layer, whereas the real average is taken over the xmath24 layer . We also compute the residuals of physical quantities and add them to the table - condition. It is in this section that we describe the various physical quantities that we have calculated in our simulations. For the first of these, we certify that the temperature exchange process is considerably faster at the highest temperature, whose relaxation time is in the order of @xmath31 montecarlo steps per spin. The second is that we test the stability of the results against three times longer runs of the temperature exchange process. The limits of the local chirality are estimated by defining a local amplitude at the location @xmath31 and in the direction @xmath32, the scalar @xmath33, where @xmath33 is the average thermal average, and [____________ the average over the bond disorder. This quantity disappears in the coplanarities of the local chirality, and its magnitude tells us the extent of the noncoplanarity of the local chirality. let us begin with the definition of the chirality. by the same hamiltonian [hamil], we can easily create two independent systems («replicas », «replicas », both based on the same hamiltonian[8][9][9], and hence have the sum of the chirality in the two independent systems. ‘see  cxt                                                                         ,      , ,      ,                 , I will explain this later. In the case of the chirality, it is necessary to define an overlap variable for the heisenberg spin. Hence, in the case of the tensor overlap, the   longitudinal ' ' (pivot of the applied field) and   transverse ' ' (pivot of the applied field) . . . in contrast, the   longitudinal ' ' (vertical to the applied field) , it is possible to use it as an indicator of the transition ' . . . but as the temperature goes up to the thermodynamic limit and the 'z' is nonzero in the ordered state, a determination of the phase transition is possible . . . in the case of the chirality, one can take advantage of the heisenberg spin . . . , it is easy to define a tensor . . . between the   longitudinal ' ' (in parallel with the applied field) and the   transverse '' (in parallel with the applied field) . When we speak of the transverse (and here we define the integral) that a Finite Phase is the ordered Form, we will argue that in the High Phase there is an Inverse Phase, or an Inverse Phase that is intangible in the Nondegenerate Phase . . . because an Inverse Phase such as Indo, might not disappear in applied Geometry, we may further be able to define the Function of Binder-Obtuseness [13], which is an S-Liquidity, a Conjugal, a tensor, a Kinetic (k) Ratio,” or a Transverse Shift (K) ratio [14] . . . in the High Temperature Phase each ‘X-math’ (as if a bit of gaussian “K”), is expected to be distributed around ‘K” , the Ky-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke-Wolf-R-Wolf- If the transverse sg ordered state accompanies rsb, then the associated non-non-zero contribution would be added to the one given by eq. (Ptform) . if the transverse sg ordered state includes rsb, the non-non-zero contribution would be added to the one given by eq. (ptform) . . . and here, we will start with the chirality-related quantities . . . , in fig. - locx, we show the temperature and the area dependence of the mean local amplitude of the chirality for various fields . . . it can be seen clearly from Fig. - locx (a) that extrapolation of xmath92 to xmath93 gives non-zero values if the applied field intensity is not too large, i. e., 0 . - 313 , 0 . 260 and 0 . . . meanwhile a direct observation of the spin pattern shows that such non-zero spin configurations realized at low temperature in zero and weak fields are rather close to the non-zero chirality . . . They give rise to the three-dimensional structures of "local spins" of @xmath36. (b) in fig. (b) , we show the size dependence of @xmath99 for the field of @xmath24 . as can be seen from the figures, @xmath103 has a negative angle, with increasing @xmath27, it tends to deepen and shift toward lower temperatures . . . as Fig. (b) , we show the size dependence of @ xmath99 for the field of @xmath24 . (b) . . . for @xmath95, 0 . 1 , 0 .5 for other values, and is   xmath26 for other values . . . . in Fig. (b) . . . . . , we can plot the negative-dip temperature @ xmath109 versus @ xmath110 for the fields @ xmath24 and @ xmath101. In Fig. [Fig. 11] [Fig. 11] [Liquid coefficients] we get our first estimates of the average chiral-glass transition temperature, @ xmath110 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath113 for @ xmath101. We can furthermore claim that our @ xmath110 is already greater than the z1 as shown below. For the lower portion of the graph, we get an xmath110 /*0.0 and the less of xmath100. To the aforementioned extreme cases, as will be explained below, we attributed a few peculiarities of @ xmath105, that is, the decreasing negative dip and the crossing at @ xmath106 to the possible z2 step, like a peculiar rsb in the chiral ordered state. - for the lowest part, as you see in fig. [xmath 11][2], a negative dip and a crossing on the equal. - as shown below, the recalculation of @ xmath112 yields @ xmath118 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath112 for @ xmath101. On a log-log plot we obtain: a) @ xmath121, b) @ xmath28. Moreover, our data of @ xmath121, as shown in fig. - auto (a) and b (b) are almost exactly the same estimates of @ xmath121 and @ xmath125, although the @ xmath121 and @ xmath125 data do not completely overlap, especially below xmath121 . from the slope of the data at xmath124 the exponent @ xmath125, which characterizes the power-law decay of @ xmath126, is estimated at xmath127 . Moreover, we notice that the below xmath120 curvature subtracted from xmath119, tending to a non-zero value corresponding to the static chiral parameter @ xmath129, indicates that the chiral ordered state is a 'strict' state, with a non-sensical long-range order. Moreover, our observation that below xmath120 an upward curvature under xmath119, corresponding to a nonzero value of the static chiral ea parameter @ xmath129, shows that the chiral ordered state is 'stiff' with a non-sensical long-range order. xcite in a zero-field is the same as the one we derived from ref. xcite. But it is very different from that of the models which the i.e. are to use, such as the 3D ea model @ xcite, or the mean-field sk model @ xcite. although the errors in the data are rather large, the crossings occur even at temperatures higher than xmath11 . - We note that the data of xmath141 is compatible with the fact that a continuous plateau is present between [ xmath142 in addition to the delta function peak ] at a temperature of xmath115, well below the chiral-glass transition temperature, xmath143 . - fig - gax , we show the temperature and size dependence of the xmath144 and xmath145 parameters for the field - xmath101 . - besides the standard peaks corresponding to the ea order parameter @ xmath137, which grow and sharpen with increasing xmath27 , a central peak is corresponding to the ea order parameter @ xmath138, which also grows and sharpens with increasing xmath27 . In the second section, we show our results on the spin-related quantities. Fig. fig. gsl and fig. gst, we show the ratios of the longitudinal and transverse spins for the fields (a) @xmath24 and (b) @xmath101. [It is very clear from the data of @xmath26 and @xmath146 for @xmath24 that the ratios of @xmath146 and @xmath146 are monotonous and positive at all temperatures. Thus the ratios of the transverse spin remain at xmath119 even below xmath119. For the field xmath101 the magnified figure is shown in the centre . . . for the field xmath101, the magnified figure is shown in the inset . . . in fig . . . . in fig . . . . in fig . . . . in fig . . . . - gs2 , the fundamental ratio of the longitudinal spin for the field a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a ... - sn- a-r-c-cc-cc-cc - gst - . the analysis is done with the two special field values, @xmath24 and @xmath101, where the most extensive simulations have been performed. For the field @xmath24, we have also observed the same suppression of the shoulder, up to about @xmath150, well below the temperature @xmath120 . However, we note that such suppression of the shoulder does not imply the critical-glass ordered state, at least as far as @xmath120 . therefore, we conclude that the critical-glass ordered state does not imply the standard transverse-glass order, at least just below the chiral-glass transition temperature. In this section, we estimate the chiral-glass transfer coefficient @xmath156 from the asymptotic slope of the log-log plot of the chiral-glass transition, as we have already shown. for the field at xmath24 at a temperature of xmath150, well below the chiral-glass transition temperature @xmath118. This result is illustrated in Fig. (b) as a rule, versus Xmath155, a log-log plot of Xmath160 versus Xmath27, where, if xmath164 is estimated, the exponent Xmath159 is estimated to be xmath164, and the rest of the static exponents, Xmath165, Xmath166, and xmath167, can be estimated by the proportions xmath168, xmath169, and the proportions xmath169, as for the graph xmath174 and xmath172 , we can measure xmath178 from the proportions xmath179, and by the relation xmath180. As can be seen from the figure, the data lie in a straight line . . . from the slope xmath173 the proportion of the chiral-glass negative coefficient xmath177. Then we calculate xmath181 , xmath177 , xmath183 , xmath180. The next calculation is to get xmath178, xmath177, xmath177. if we include the fundamental properties of the chiral-glass transition with the ones in the 3d ising ea model, we also show the sg exponents of the 3d ising ea model, we show the sg exponents of the sg magnet agmn @ xcite. in table [Table 1 ] : we also show the sg exponents of the 3d ising ea model, as well as typical experimental values (in the zero field) of real heisenberg heisenberg, like sg magnet agmn @ xcite. As mentioned, such a calculator will yield the bulk chiral glass transition temperature, @ xmath105, @ xmath109, and @ xmath187 – see the dashed lines of fig – dip. in fig – scalingc , we show the standard Finite-Scale Scale for the chiral glass order parameter @ xmath48, which we have computed from the chiral autocorrelation, and which we employ in our scaling analysis. as a method of ensuring the consistency of our estimations and @ xmath119, we have also computed the following: we take the @ xmath185 value that was calculated above, i.e. @ xmath186, and extrapolate the temperature of the chiral glass transition from @ xmath105 to @ xmath187 (see the dashed lines of fig - Dip) as well. These estimates of @ xmath119 agree with those calculated by the chiral autocorrelation, , and (b) @ xmath191 and b. *. Moreover, the existence of such substantial entropy-sizing effects is also confirmed by the behavior of the double-finger ratio and the diagonally parallel, transverse spin order. ( b) , and (b) @ xmath1991. however, in the range of sizes studied here, at xmath1991, we cannot observe such a complete scaling of xmath1994. The lack of a complete scaling of xmath1994 is also observed in the behavior of xmath102, which shows not a unique crossing of xmath1984 within the range of sizes studied: instead, as shown in fig. gx. , the crossing occurs on the negative side of xmath105 somewhat above xmath124, while the points tend to decrease to xmath119 as xmath27 increases. In a truly asymptotic critical situation, Xmath199 itself should scale at xmath124 with a one-hundred-eightth exponent of xmath159. The existence of such significant finite-size effects has also been suggested by the behavior of the binding ratio and the diagonal transverse-spin truncation function. We will give you the traditional finite-size scaling of the transverse sg order parameter @ xmath196 for @ xmath24; one assumes @ xmath197, and the other assumes @ xmath199. Similar plots are given in Fig. Fig. - q2log , if a sg order parameter is assuming @ xmath197 and b if a sg order parameter is assuming @ xmath198. first, as we have just shown, this transverse sg order contradicts the binder ratio @ xmath73 and the diagonal sg order from xmath79 . . . first, as we have just shown, such simultaneous chirality and transverse spin order contradicts the result of the binder ratio @ xmath73 and the diagonal chirality @ xmath79. . . . but we do not believe this is so because of the following reasons. . . . for the field of xmath101, suppose (a) @ xmath197, and (b) @ xmath199 . . . at a glance, they seem to be equally good-looking, without a significant difference, if you adjust your exponents appropriately . . . * Therefore, in the observation of @xmath86, we observe a slight drop in the graph by @xmath124, and then gradually moves to a near linear behaviour. In general, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities from the data of Xmath204, fig. xmath204. Firstly, we note that this critical sg-ordered transition is not supported by the data of Fig. - gst. Secondly, we consider the linear sg-ordered correlations calculated in figs. [Standardsph01] (b) and (Standardsph05) assuming the simultaneous sc-ordered and chiral transition, fig. xmath205, which is much lower than the lower critical sg-ordered value (lcd) that is generalized for such transitions. Here we can only exclude the possibility that the sc-ordered sc-ordered transition occurs simultaneously with the chiral transition, @ xmath204, and the critical sc-ordered transition. We second, we estimate the transverse sc-ordered sc-ordered sc-ordered sc-ordered sc-ordered value of xmath204 [Fig - sc-sc-gst]. It should be noted here that the spin-chirality distinction is a long-scale phenomenon: at short-scale the chirality is never independent of the spin by its definition, but squared, as expected from the naive power-calculation. in this case, one should take note that the bipolar   spin-glass exponents expected would be @xmath211 and @xmath212, as a result of the short-scale relation, @xmath213; and if so, then the frequency of these two   measurement-scales is closely related to the length and time scales. Note that these are not very far from the values that we find from the finite-size scaling analysis of figs. Note also that these values are not very far from the ones we get from the finite-size scaling of figs . . . [210] The chiral-glass-reversal temperature is at the chiral-glass transition temperature of the field. The case of the chiral-glass-reversal -g is as follows: at short scale, the chiral-glass-reversal is never indifferent to the spin by its definition, since it is, according to the naive power calculation, a squared (@xmath210) relation, as well as in the long-scale relation, @xmath21. In this case, the apparent (not true) transverse -g spin-glass exponents were expected to be @xmath211 and @xmath212, which were calculated from the short-scale relation, @xmath213 . Note that these values are not very far from those that are obtained It’s clear in fig. [b] where we draw the same phase diagram on a model that has both temperature and magnetic field energies shared. The equation eqn: phaseline is slightly negative, so that at first, @xmath216 begins to increase somewhat with @xmath17, though it’s difficult to make a precise conclusion since the scattering of our estimates of @xmath216 is quite a problem. * In fig. [b] we draw the same phase diagram on a spectra where the temperature and the magnetic field energies are common. — see, for instance, Fig. [7] where we draw the same phase diagram on a spectra, where both temperature and magnetic field energies are common. It is most evident in Fig. [8] where we draw the same phase diagram on a plot where the temperature and the magnetic field energies have the same energy scales. [9] our data are even not contradictory with the coefficient of xmath14 in eq. ([9]) being slightly negative so that @xmath216 increases in the first phase with @xmath17, although it is difficult to draw a conclusion due to the scattering of our estimate of @xmath216. [10] If we look at the chiral – glass transition line in the – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – we see it is almost vertically converging to the temperature axis, at a certain degree of order – – – that is, quite inflexible to the – – glass-ordered state – and thus it seems that the – glass ordered state is very strong against magnetic – fields – this is mainly due to the random magnetic anisotropy that inevitably occurs in real – – magnets, which we have not introduced. Further, in a real – magnet system, the spins do not necessarily lie on a simple cubic lattice and do not interact with one another by the closest neighbouring – neighboring – etc. etc. in spite of these apparent limitations, it might be interesting to compare our present phase diagram with the experimental phase diagram of heisenberg-like – sg magnets. In contrast, we have also constructed a phase diagram of the 3d – sg magnets, which is similar to the chiral–glass phase diagram, but of a different geometry – namely, the chiral–glass transition line, in the direction of –[14]—spread, almost vertical to the temperature axis, this, it is found, corresponds almost vertically to the temperature axis, and therefore the Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. fig. phase of sg. , in the same figure, we show our current result of the glass transition line, scaled in the following way . first of all, we calculate the zero-field transition temperature of the hypothetical isotropic system of xmath21k, by extrapolating the high-field transition of sg. - to xmath218 , we know that the relevant value of xcite is roughly 50k. Secondly, we calculate the intensity of the field in the standard unit xmath223 by the relation xmath224, which is the effective bohr number: in the case of sg., @xmath225 was experimentally estimated to be @xmath225, where @xmath227 is the magneton magneton @xcite - oh! for the case of sg. and sg., it is necessary to compare the experimental phase diagram in the low-field field.
