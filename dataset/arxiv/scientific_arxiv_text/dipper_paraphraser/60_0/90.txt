The increasing speed with which the direct direct Xmath0 body method is able to obtain reliable models of the dynamical evolution of star clusters has closely correlated with the increase in computing power (heggie 2011). In the sphere of technology, the most robust Xmath0 body model has been adopted (e.g. von hoerner 1963; mcmillan, hut, and makino 1990; giersz & heggie 1997) and has been applied to the models of ancient open clusters and into the Xmath9 domain (baumgardt & makino 2003); in the special purpose hardware of grapes (maki 2002) . In consequence, Xmath0 body models have been employed in a number of ways to understand the evolution of globular clusters (gcs: vesperini & heggie 1997; baumgardt & makino 2003; zonoozi et al. 2011) . in fact, the two methods are in good agreement, mc instructing a more laborious xmath0 body approach. In contrast, Monte Carlo (mc) models have proved successful in generating dynamical models of xmath10particles (giersz et al. 2008). These models have shown that former observable non-core clusters may actually be in an irregular phase, post-core (heggie et al. 2010). In order to further improve our theoretical understanding of star cluster evolution, we should consider the way in which inferences made by smaller, smaller, models of xmath0 are carried out to larger values. Consequently, the subject of this paper is the study of star cluster evolution in the light of the present study of giersz and heggie (1997), which analyzed the structure of a star cluster, stellar evolution and the tidal field of a star-mass galaxy, though starting with the size of stars rather than xmath11, we had decided to look at the structure of a binary made up of two black holes of the same size (bhs) that caused the collapse of the core. Moreover, we were compelled to create a model of the collapse of the core, without melting by that time, but at the same time without tearing . . . we used the nbody4 software (aarseth 1999) and a grape-based board (makino 2002) which we located at the American Museum of Natural History. This programme, using the 4th order Hermite integration, in the following time step , it follows the orbits of the cluster members and the internal evolution of the small-scale subsystems (see the nbody4 documentation ). In this section, the results are discussed and compared with the previous studies. In this section, in particular, we consider how the new model compares with the past results. In the case of the nbody4 code, aarseth 1999, we were using the nbody 4 in grape-tree, which is located at the American Museum of Natural History , it has the 4th order integration scheme and an individual time This is the result of the experiment of hurley, aarseth & shara (2007) and is compared with hurley et al. (2008) in nbody4 we assume that all stars are in the current main sequence, and that any residual gas from the star formation process has been removed. The masses for the single stars were drawn from the first mass function (imf) of Kroupa, tout & Gilmore (93) between the limits of 0 . 1 and xmath14. The masses for the single stars were taken from the imf of kroupa, tout & Gilmore (93) between the limits of 0 . 1 and xmath14. and thus we adopted this value for our simulation. In the model of the parent galaxy we have used the method of the point-mass method, where the model cluster is placed on a circular orbit of xmath18kpc with an orbital velocity of xmath19. Previously we had found that xmath22kpc was the minimum and the minimum. In setting xmath20 we have been driven by a desire to have the cluster have its moment of core-sputtering between xmath22kpc and xmath21kpc. The gravitational angle of the primordial binaries is taken from the log-normal distribution suggested by eggleton, fitchett et tout (1989) with a peak at xmath16au and a maximum of xmath17au. The orbital eccentricities of the primordial binaries are assumed to follow a thermal distribution (heggie 1975). - with these choices, the initial parameters of the k200 model were xmath29, xmath30pc, xmath31pc. - this corresponds to the expansion of the gas produced by the formation of a star (which we do not model), so that the radially extended model should be more radially extended than a compact protocluster. we opted for the xmath25 scale of our model, so that the outermost star of the model is xmath28. This is to avoid the rare cases of great distances in the initial distribution. This model will be compared to that described by hurley et al. (2008) for a model which began with xmath33 stars and xmath3 binaries. In the first model, the star boundary is set at xmath25, where xmath25 is the gravitational constant and xmath27 is the cluster mass (see giersz et al. 1997). The first model was resolving at xmath28 the outermost star of the first model was positioned at xmath28. The parameter of the stars and binaries were set in the same way as the first model. For example, for the k100, the k100 is centered at xmath33 (solid line) and the k100 is placed at xmath33 (diamond line) and a k100 is placed at xmath33 (diamond line) and a k100 is placed at xmath33 (declining line) and a k100 is placed at xmath33 (D - We show in figure - fig2 the behaviour of the core radius, the half-mass radius and the tidal radius as the K200 model evolves. In the figure - fig2 the slope of the mass-age plane is similar to that of the k200 model, but differs from that of the k100 model. We also compare the evolution of the model hurley et al. (2008) with the K200 model - we have at xmath4 gyr the same amount of mass left (after starting with a factor of two) . the slope of the tidal radius is similar to that of the k200 model and distinguishes from the k100 model with @xmath34 . the core radius is deep and deep at @xmath5gyr, which we regard as the moment when the core-brim phase ends . . . a study of the dissolved, mass-death, and dissolution times of star clusters in the galaxy will be the subject of another paper ( madrid et al. 2012). . . . the mass-loss and dissolution times of the clusters will be investigated in another paper (Madrid et al. 2012) . we are also compared to the K100 model of hurley et al. (2008) and see that at xmath4gyr the two model clusters have the same amount of mass (after a factor of two difference) . . . the half-mass radius reaches its minimum at xmath5gyr, which is identified as the moment when the initial core-col — The range of radii is three-dimensional. — The body core radius (– symbols) and the mass-weighted central velocity (and its inverse) —the density-weighted average of the distance of each star from the density center (aarseth 2003) . In the following figure [f][f], a vertical dotted line indicates the time when the initial core-splitting phase has come to an end. — The radius in figure [f][f] is the radii of the body body formed by Monte Carlo, calculated as @ xmath45, where @ xmath46 is the central velocity of a given star and , @ xmath47 is the central density, both calculated from the smallest 20 stars. In this regard, it is well known that the core produces irregular fluctuations in the development of the core and also at the moment of its collapse. In our case, the core is continuously fluctuating around the moment of its collapse. Besides, following heggie & giersz ( 2009) we have also examined the dynamical radius of the core in their monte-carlo models, calculated as @ xmath45, where @ xmath46 is the mass-weighted central velocity and @ xmath47 the central density, both calculated from the innermost 20 stars. We have also studied the dynamics of the core radius, which is calculated as @ xmath45, where xmath46 is the mass-weighted central velocity, and xmath47 is the central density, calculated from the deepest 20 stars. It is interesting to examine the result of previous @xmath0-body results for smaller @xmath0-body models. In this instance, the absorption coefficient of the k100 model was at least as high as that of the k200 model, but it was also older than our absorption coefficient of the k200 model, and thus had a longer half-mass relaxation time of xmath56 m . in the midpoint of the core-collapse, as well as a greater fraction of the absorption coefficient of the k200 model. giersz & heggie (1997) computed the fraction of a certain number of math60 by a simple mathematical calculation, and indicated that they did not use math48 at all, but at the sixth of the eighth, math55 m . The ratio begins at math61 and gradually decreases to an average of math62 at the end of the absorption. This comparison seems to indicate that the absorption of a certain fractional of math0 increases in proportion to the distribution of the total mass. giersz et al. (2008) reached the same result of absorption near the absorption of a core-collapse, as did our k200 model (@ xmath57pc) but at a later time (at xmath58 compared to xmath5 ) (it is interesting to examine how the previous absorption of math0 by smaller, smaller absorptions are judged, and how they compare to our new absorption. the ratio starts at @xmath61 and gradually decreases to an average value of @xmat This speculative table is suitable for clusters in the middle of the core-thrust (though see the next section for some unusual cases) . The remarkable feature of Figure [f] is the sudden change in the behaviour of the core at @xmath65gyr, the last deep minimum, when the size of the core suddenly increases and grows steadily from this point. In this change, the bh-binary forms a group, at @xmath65gyr, in a four-body interaction, initially very high eccentricity and a long orbital period of @xmath70d. This group has lived in the core for the majority of its life and had a series of perturbations and interactions that have seen the eccentricity vary from 0 to 0 and the orbital period reduced to 0 - 91 at xmath70d. at that time the bh-binary forms a group in a strong interaction with a binary composed of two main-series stars (mass of @xmath73 and @xmath74), which ejects quickly from the cluster (@xmath77 at xmath77) . . . milky way gcs exhibit a range of values for @xmath79 (harris 1996) with the most obvious examples having @xmath80 but with @xmath81 generally considered as a high- density cluster or perhaps even a core-stricken cluster (the mateos 1988) . . . the bh-bh binary in our k200 model has not produced the same increase in the ratio. Therefore, it would not be expected that the cluster should appear at this point as a core-stricken cluster. it is our intention in the near future to examine a broad range of k=_0 body models and document in detail the statistics and results of bh-bh binaries in the cores of model clusters. According to king (1964) models, the concentration parameter is @ xmath78 (king 1966) . The king (1962) models are fitted to the density profiles of the clusters in order to properly calculate the concentration parameter, rather than using the @ xmath0 body values as we have done here in our preliminary investigation. Hurley (2007) showed that a long-lived bh-bh binary, with both bhs being stellar, could substantially increase the density of a model with a mass of xmath8 stars . The bh-bh binary in our @ xmath1 model has not shown a similar increase in the ratio. — Fable   432   - see fig. 82 , v. - -xmath85. The average stellar mass across the whole cluster is xmath85 at the start of the simulation there is no primordial mass separation and falls in all regions from stellar evolution mass-loss of large stars for the first xmath85  - we see that the decrease in the average stellar mass in the inner region is gradually stopped by the effect of the external tide, which preferentially takes out the lower-mass stars that have been pushed out to the outer region . . . , which in the central region increases until the end of the core-sunk and then flattens again after the collapse (the ejection of the bh-bh binary) . . . . . . . . Note that the binaries are added, and are assumed to be unresolved. After the period of the half-mass downfall has passed (# f: fig#), there is a clear distinction between the average masses in each region. At the start of the simulation there is no primordial mass degeneration and the mass drops in all regions as a result of the stellar evolution mass-loss of massive stars in the first (# f: fig#) We see that the average mass in the central region has increased to the end of core-fall, and then flattens after core-fall (catch the relation with f: f – f – f). The decreasing average mass in the outer region is gradually arrested by the external tide, which preferentially removes the lower-mas In general, the "xmath59" model of baumgardt & makino (2003) agrees with our k200 model, and the general process, including the flattening of the average mass in the central regions post-crack. However, the @xmath59 model of baumgardt & makino (2003) agrees with our k200 model, and agrees with the general behavior, especially the flattening of the average mass in the central regions after the collapse. ; in addition, we have a spline parameter , f : fig.1 Note that the behaviour of two-dimensional velocity is the same, but usually 20 % less. The main features of our new model resemble those of the smaller, xmath59 models of giersz & heggie (1997), in that respect they find that the timescale for the initial phase of mass separation is about the same as the timescale for the core-crack, whereas we see that mass separation is already complete before core-crack. All the regions show a rapid decrease in the initial phase, due to the general increase of the cluster, and then gradually decrease in the process, and almost in the same direction. The ratio of the velocity to the 1 percent and the 10 percent regions is of the same size, and the numbers in the 50 percent region are much closer to those of the inner regions than to the outer regions. , in a third place, the exotropy parameter @xmath91 (Baker & tremaine 1987, baumgardt & makino 2003, wilkinson et al. 2003), where @xmath92 is anisotropic, @ xmath93 is tangentially anisotropic, and @ xmath94 is radially anisotropic . a second way, the inner region remains somewhat anisotropic all the time, while the outer region develops an increasing tangential anisotropy over the first @xmath95gyr, and then flattens out to a constant value for the rest of the evolutionary period. This overall effect is similar to that of baumgardt & makino (2003) . This inseparable radial axis is contrary to previous observations of radial axis axis axis (Giersz & Heggie 1997; wilkinson et al. 2002). The latter observation was confirmed by baumgardt & makino (2003) . This tangential axis was in opposition to the previous observations of radial axis axis for small-scale axis (e.g., giersz & heggie 1997; wilkinson et al. . . but the average isotropy . . . . this overall observation was reminiscent of that observed by baumgardt & makino (2003) . . . . In the more central region (in the 0.8 % lagrangian radius —(f) —fig3 [6] hurley, aarseth & shara (2007) observed the evolution of binary fraction with time for a variety of @xmath0 body models, from  96 to  82, and primordial fractions from  81 to 5. They all found that the binary fraction within the core and the 10 % lagrangian radius increased as the cluster grew larger, especially towards the core - collapse, while the total binary fraction remained near the primordial value (though, perhaps, the incorporation of a large number of in the beginning wide binaries would lead to a sharper decrease) . Davis et al. (2008) measured the binary fraction in the prime sequence in the vicinity of the half-mass radius of ngc, and found it to be a few per cent. This was taken to be representative of the primordial binary fraction of ngc, at the half-mass radius of ngc, and found it to be some ten per cent. The results were also confirmed by the results of hurley et al. (2008) showing that the binary fraction of the prime sequence of ngc was good to identify the primordial binary fraction. This was reinforced in the figure [f] of our k200 model, where we show that the binary fraction of the prime sequence of ngc, at the half-mass radius of ngc, is much greater than the primordial fraction. As expected, the average energy per binary increases as one moves towards the center of the cluster, although the values in the 1 - 10 % and the 1 - 50 % regions converge towards the end of the simulation. The energy per binary in the inner 1 % region by mass begins to increase as one moves toward the center of the cluster, though the values in the 1 - 10 % and the 1 - 50 % regions begin to converge in the end. Note that the binding energy is calculated in arbitrary, physical units of @ xmath98, which make it possible to compare the internal energies of the two binary populations. . . . but the influence of the bh-binary in the k200 simulation from -xmath100gyr on up to this point is obvious, as if it increased the average energy by almost two orders of magnitude, then it fell off again when it was taken out of the core. In this case the maximum energy per binary in the inner 11% region is increased, as if the concentration of stars at the center is getting tighter. For example, the increase in the 50 - 100 % lagrangian region in xmath101-myr in figure - fig. 7 is the result of a primordial binary in which common-envelope evolution is induced. for example, the increases in the 70 - 100 % lagrangian region at xmath101-myr in figure - fig-f is not particularly evident. In xmath99, the proportion of energy per binary increases from one to two orders of magnitude, but there is a sharp decrease in the value of the 70 - 99 regions, since these decreases are less It is worth asking if the signatures of these short-lived energetic matrices can be seen. The other matrices discussed above produced a primary star which was tidally disrupted and swallowed up by a black hole of xmath104. The resulting star would be relatively large, hot and _young_. This resulting star would remain one of the brightest stars in the cluster for several hundred gyrs, and would be readily observed. The corresponding core collapse time is calculated to Xmath105 for the k200 and k100 simulations, respectively. The comparison of the core-compression time, Xmath-106, and the relaxation time, Xmath-106, for the k200 and k100 simulations. [31] Table 1 , the time when the cluster is melted and the top of the galaxy is swallowed by the black hole, (2011: if for a supermassive black hole) , it can be expected to be very massive, hot and young . It could be expected to remain one of the brightest stars in the cluster for a few gyrs and be easily seen. . . . baumgardt (2001) analyzed the scaling of the body models to xmath112 star clusters, and found that xmath110 was the appropriate scale for a cluster, a normal k200 model and the k100 model of hurley et al. (2008) start by filling the tidal radius and then xmath110 which is in good agreement with kpper et al. (2008) . a good comparison would be to use the average half-mass relaxation time across the life of a cluster, @ xmath110, which is not known for an observed cluster . . . , if we use xmath110, then we find that the @ xmath110 scales very well with @ xmath118. However, as we see from Table (t: Table 1), the half-mass relaxation time varies considerably over the lifetime of a cluster, and it is not immediately clear which value to use when determining the timescale . . . if we substitute @ xmath110 for the k200 and the k100 models, we find that the @ xmath117 is the same for both simulations, so the agreement for this key time-scale is excellent. For example, the k200 and the k100 models of hurley et al. (2008) begin by filling the tidal radius and have the  xmath111 scale, which is in good agreement with kpper et al. (2008). But since the density of stars is equal to that of stars, it will be only about a thousand years before the average stars will have been formed through the collapse of the core. In this regard, we have examined the results of previous work against a larger model of xmath0 and found good agreement with that, provided that the time of core collapse and dissolution are adjusted to the values described in the literature, but this is the result of the difference of the half-mass-reduction timescale. , in general, the behaviour of scalar quantities such as the average stellar mass and the velocity of the decomposition of the body was observed. In particular, the scaling of the dissolution time by xmath105, reported by baumgardt & makino (2003), could be compared with that for the average core radius and the aggregate density of xmath105. In other words, the scaling of the dissolution time by xmath105 reported by baumgardt (2001) is also consistent with the other scales that were studied in the literature, although this depends on the value of the half-mass relaxation time. This remains the gradual increase of xmath0 of realistic xmath0 models, starting from the xmath59 model of giersz & heggie (1997) to the xmath89 model of baumgardt & makino (2003) . in the raw values some differences exist, for example, the sphere radius at - bh-coil reaches a deeper depth of mass distribution in the mass distribution for larger xmath0 . You can find these from the authors. They can be obtained by contacting the authors. Despite the great support of the cordelia Corporation and of Edward Norton, which has enabled amnh to acquire grape-tree boards and other components, the increased reliance on a large-body-dosing model - owing to the deep-seated effect of the monte carlo technique - it is also possible to develop a multi-body model of the stars with a single-body dosing (hurley & mackey 2010; zonoozi et al. 2011) and this, along with the introduction of multiple-body Dosing (Swarzem 1999), will probably make such a model commonplace in the near future . we thank harvey richer for being the motivation for this model, and ivan king for his many useful suggestions . aarseth s . j., 1999, pasp , 111, 1333, aarseth s . j., 2003, Gravitational Dosing: tools and algorithms (cambridge monographs on mathematics) , cambridge university press, cambridge aarseth s . j., 1999, pasp, 111, 1333 aarseth s . j., 1999, pasp , 111, 1333 aarseth s . j., 2003, julian gravitational n-body simulations: tools and algorithms (cambridge university press), cambridge aarseth s . j., 1999, pasp, 111, 1333 aar Davis d. s., richer h. b., anderson j., brewer j., hurley j., kalirai j., rich r. m., stetson p. b., 2008 aj, 135 , 2155 hurley j., hypki a., 2012 aj , 135 , 2155 mnras 410 , 2698 giersz m. , heggie d. c., 1975 mnras , 173 , 729 heggie d. c., 2011 mnras , 410 , 2698 giersz m. , heggie d. c., giersz m. , heggie d. c., 1975 mnras, 173 , 729 heggie d. c., 2011 mnras (arxiv: 1112 . 6246) gnedin o . . the British Institute, 135-216, 1603-142, jordn a., et al., 1967, apj, 71, 64 kroupa p . tout c . a . , gilmore g . , 1992, mnras, 250, 514 kroupa p . , tout c . a . , gilmore g . f . , 2007 mnras, 379, l40 madrid j . p . . , kpper a . h . w . kroupa p . , tout c . a . , gilmore g . f . , c . . . . , 2009 mnras , 634, 0002 king i . , ed., asp san francisco, p. 389 mateo m . ed., ed., p. 2631512 p. 463 p. 463 p . . . mnras , b . . , kroupa p . , baumgardt h . . , gilmore g . f., tout c . a., 2003 mnras, 343 , 1025 zonoozi a . . , kpper a . h . w . , baumgardt h . . , haghi a . . , kroupa p . , hilker, m . . , 2011 mnras, 411 , 1989
