, then it is reasonable to assume that pulsars existed in the formation of pop-ii nss, though there is no direct evidence, because no pop-ii nss is observed. Similarly, repetto et al. - xcite hypothesize that bhs also have a kick velocity equal to that of pulsars, because their galactic distribution is as small as that of pulsars in our galaxy. As a consequence, we consider the natal kick of pop-ii nss, but not for pop-ii nss. The following results show that pop-ii nss is better than pulsars in the formation process. The physical mechanism of such a kick speed may be due to the Harrison-Tademaru mechanism, anisotropic emission of neutrinos, anisotropic explosion, and so on (review of the lorimer @ xcite for a detailed account of this) . (And it is also possible to assume that pop-ii nss has a proper kick velocity, whereas there is no direct evidence of it because there is no pop-ii star or pulsar.) . In this paper we use Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the kick of pop-ii nss and pop-ii nss. the kick of pop-ii nss and pop-ii ns-bhs. In this paper we calculate the kick of pop-iii ns-bhs and pop-ii ns-bhs for comparison. Now the population synthesis method, which is monte-calro simulation of binary evolution, is taken to be adopted by the monte-calro method. The binary initial conditions are chosen by the monte-calro method and the initial distributions, such as the initial mass function (imf), the initial mass ratio (imf), the initial separation function (ief) and the initial eccentricity function (ief) , which we call the table of pop iii stars and the pop ii stars of pop ii and ii. These initial initial conditions are chosen by the monte-calro method, and then we assign the first distribution functions, the first mass function (imf) , the first mass ratio (imf), the first separation function (ief) and the first eccentricity function (ief) , the first density function (odd) and the first distribution function (odd) , we consider these distributions for pop ii and pop ii stars as table [idf] [45] [50] [55] a . . . lyne and d . . lorimer, nature, *369* , 127* , 127* — _R _M______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________ ;——______________, et.__________________________________________________, et.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ . . . s . ioka, astron . . . 7408 , 1217 ( 2010) [arxiv: 0904] . . . . r . . vink, n . yoshida, and k . ioka, astron . . . t . hartwig, m . volonteri, v . bromm, r . . klessen, e . barausse, m . magg and a . . . , mon . . a . . . 05659 [ ph . . co ] . e . visbal, z . . haiman, mon . not .  461 , 2722 (2016 ) ]   ph . . . - , - -  astro ph . ph . ph .  ph . s ] . . . ,  r s . yoshida, n . yoshida, and k ioka, astron . - t . , m . volonteri, v . . v . . k . - m, v . m, z . h . bryan, mon . taniguchi, phys. d * 92 *, 024014 (2015) [arxiv: 1506 . 05470 [astro-ph-he]] . . . s. a. hughes and b. jain, phys. d * 74 *, 063006 (2006) [astro-ph-he] . . . j. aasi et al . . . . . . . . . . . . , t. nakamura et al . . . . .
