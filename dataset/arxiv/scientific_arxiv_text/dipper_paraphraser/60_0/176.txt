the non-invasive, sub-critical parton and transverse energy production in the central velocities of heavy ions is also assumed to be more important. This is because of two reasons: first, the rapid rise of the total and inelastic cross-section can be explained by the copious production of semi-hard partons, or ‘partifugals’, with transverse momenta of xmath3 gev @ xcite , which can be further increased by @ xcite , in large nuclei, the importance of semi-hard partons increases. secondly, the semi-hard process scales as @ xmath5 above, so that for large nuclei the importance of semi-hard partons is increased by greater in importance than ever. The time scale for the production of partons and transverse energy by semi-hard collisions is short, usually @ xmath6 @ xmath1 , where @ xmath7 gev is the smallest transverse momentum. The soft phase of the central rapidity is formed, in particular, by means of subordinate qcd (pqcd), at higher energies, and the relative contribution of soft collisions with xmath7 gev is reduced. The soft phase is performed at later stages of the collision, at @ xmath8 @ xmath1 . Especially, I will show you the maximum amount of transverse energy that should be expected from the bfkl minijets in heavy ion collisions. Moreover, a promising new approach for the production of minijets has been introduced at xcite. These studies have aimed at finding out the initial conditions for the formation of qgp at xmath14 at xmath1 at xmath14, the initial forces deposited into the middle rapidity region, the chemical composition of the parton plasma, and the possibility of rapid thermalization and the first net baryon-to-entropy ratio. These studies have elicited new insight and very useful discussions during these last years. The main goal of these studies is to ascertain the early conditions for the formation of qgp at xmath14 at xmath1 and to study the findings of these studies, especially the estimation of the optimum amount of transverse energy that one should expect from bfkl-microjets in heavy ion collisions. In heavy ion collisions, where we expect hundreds (rhic) or thousands (lhc) of minijets with xmath17 gev, one cannot observe the jets and distinguish them from the underlying event. Also, it is important to study the early occurrence of interacting partonic matter, since the later evolution of the qgp, the final state of global observables and the signal originating from the plasma will be strongly dependent on the initial conditions. In the first half, I will summarize the main features of semihard partons and will describe our latest results in detail. In a nuclear collision, for example, an acceptance window in the whole central rapidity unit defines this function, but for this acceptance criteria and for the xmath17 gev, the exact nlo contribution is not yet computed. for xmath33 production in nuclear collisions, an acceptance window is defined in the central rapidity unit, but for this acceptance criteria and for xmath17 gev the exact nlo contribution is still not calculated. a general theory for xmath32 production in a nuclear collision is, in general, defined in the lowest order (lo) pqcd, two partons are produced in each semihard subcollision . the following equations - mrsh - xcite - xcite - are obtained in the semihard mixture of the mrsh - and the mrsd - xcite - . a symmetrical subtraction with a parton is found - xcite . This equation is calculated with mrsh - xcite, with a range of xcite, and a numerical interpretation of eq. ( sigmajet ) - in ref. - xcite . . . . we see the initial conditions at xmath49 , i. . . we describe the initial conditions at xmath49 , i. . , ii. , iv. - Xmath47 is the average number of semihard collisions, iv. xmath47 is the average transverse energy of the partons in each collision . . . . and , moreover, the glrmq-fusions at xcite are shown separately at xcite . also, in the rhic- and lhc-ultrascitic fractions, the nucleon fractions were shown to be relatively strong , especially for the lhc-ultrascii. However, the rapid rise of the nucleon fraction at xmath55, at the small values of xmath53, observed at hera@xcite, does not significantly affect the two-gear minijets at rhic-ultrascii, but obviously has very dramatic consequences at lhc-ultrascii. The rapid rise of the nucleon fraction at xmath55 at tiny values of xmath53, observed at hera@xcite, does not very much affect the big partons at rhic-ultrascii, but, as shown in @xcite, the most extreme corrections in gluon shadowing are shown, by their very scale, in ref. [10]. Let's examine the results in table 1. - The following four observations are noticeable: first, gluons clearly dominate both the initial parton and the transverse energy: the initial parton is 80 % glue. Secondly, the effective transverse area of the semihard partons is - xmath59 - compared to the effective nuclear lateral area - xmath59, we note that the lateral area of the partons - xmath59 - is already dense enough to permit saturation of the parton system - xcite, which, perhaps, is in the region where pqcd cannot be trusted . , especially in the lattice, where the average energy of gluons is already as high as the average energy of a perfect gas in thermal equilibrium. Note that in the simplified picture referred to, the transit time of the tangled nuclei, i.e., of the initial parton spread, i.e., of the partons which will be produced in the central rapidity is neglected, and a bjorken-like stable picture is possible, and in the central rapidity a proper time is relevant. The fourth observation, i.e., is that at first, at xmath14 fm / xmath69, the net number of baryons in the central rapidity is very small, compared to the density of gluons, but_ greater_ than the density of nuclear matter ( 0 . 17 @ xmath78) , the average energy of gluons is already at the lhc, and, of course, it is only isotropization that is needed and that a rapid thermalization is actually possible . Note, however, that I have not compared isotropization of the system with the energy / gluons angle . . . note that our conclusion of the instant thermalization is based on the small, And the low-energy production of the particles i have described above is based on a factorization of collinear momentum, where the perturbative partonic cross-sections are factorized at a momentum scale from parton distributions with non- perturbative inputs. The small-energy production of the particles is not very large, but it is of the same order of magnitude as in the current pb + pb collisions at sps, so the final entropy can be estimated by the initial entropy of the gluons. , and the proportion of baryons to entropy. For the lhc, assuming a rapid thermalization of the gluon system at xmath0 @ xmath1 and a gradual adiabatic evolution thereafter, the final entropy can be approximated by the initial entropy of gluons at xcite. Next, i will discuss an additional mechanism for minijets and transverse energy production, where factorization is not necessary. Initially, the inverse of the specific entropy is 89928991 . the inverse of the specific entropy is 984 949 . For the kinematics we are interested in, the rapidities are strongly ordered, @ xmath105, but the transverse momenta are not, @ xmath106. Therefore, the latter part of my talk, which is based on ref. @ xcite, will be only relevant to the lhc. thus, the final state is described by a feynman graph, with 2 incoming and @ xmath103 gluons, labelled 1 . between the tagging jets there are a quantity of gluons, labeled 1 . . . a colorless hard bfkl-peleton ladder is formed from these feynman graphs. In the kinematic region, which we will consider, the rapidities are strongly ordered, @ xmath105, but the transverse moments are not, @ xmath106 . Then, only the transverse degrees of freedom of the virtual legs become important. In the summed subprocess, fig. 1a, a navete is shown, where the incoming partons have momentum fractions of @ xmath96 and @ xmath97, the tagging jets rapidites @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 (@ xmath100) and the transverse fractions of @ xmath105, respectively. the entanglement - we call it a path for gluon which emanates from an effective non-local lipatov-vertical vertex where the bremsstrahlung of the first and final legs and the emission of the exchanged gluon are divided into a number of brisk, vertical traces. Then, we calculate a path for each matrix element - Xmath113, and due to the great ordering of rapidity, colour singlet ladders are formed with a rung added to the colour singlet ladder. This path is indicated by the black bars in fig. 1a. Next, we divide each element in half, and because of the strong ordering of rapidities, colour ladders with rungs in xmath104 are formed. The color algebra can be studied by summing (averaged) over the final (original) state colours, and polarization sums can be computed. All the virtual corrections and real emissions are ignored, the ladder becomes drained at xmath119, and the sprung limit for two jets separated by a large velocity is computed at xcite. , and if all the virtual corrections and real emissions are ignored, the ladder descends into xmath119, and the born limit for the two jets separated by a large rapidity interval is recovered at xcite. And so, by means of the knowledge of the factor arising from fixing one rung of the bfkl pomeron ladder, the inclusive cross section of the minijet is written down as @xcite @ xmath129, where @xmath15 and @xmath129 are the transverse momentum and the rapidity (in the hadron cms) of the minijet. As we have no tagging jets required, we have to give up collinear factorization. To obtain normalization of this scale-invariant equation we will have to give up the gluon distributions, @xcite, obtained from experimental input, - for the distribution of gluons - is @xcite -. the cross-section becomes @xcite @xmath123, where @xcite @xmath123 is the balance between the two hadrons or nuclei, and thus the equation of the gluon density at xcite becomes @xcite @ xcite , where @xmath15 and @xmath129 are the transverse momentum and the rapidity (in the hadron cms) of the minijet - and from a momentum conservation and multi-regiral kinematics the momentum fractions become @xmath130. We therefore leave the phase-space factorization and the part-of-partition to be studied. Therefore, we can try to develop the methodology of deep inelastic scattering (de) in @xcite, where the addition of each rung into the pomeron ladder between the two hadrons or nuclei is expected to be described by the homogeneous bfkl equation for the unintegrated gluon density @xmat The minijet cross section of eq. 3 (bfklmini) is shown in fig. 3 (fig. 3). The nlo jet analysis, in fig. 3 [236] indicates that the nlo jet analysis with collinear factorization reproduces the measured jet cross section well. so we do not trust the minijet calculation with @xmath132 below @xmath132 gev. therefore, the contribution of bfkl to the apposed-microjets at @ xmath134 is too great for the crossed section to be substantial. This cut-off is unfortunately necessary also in the case of bfkl. the hydrostatic energy produced by the bfkl-loop is now calculated from @ xmath136 gev from @ xmath136 the coherence of the bfkl-loop is broken when we fix a rung and the cross section is diverted at @ xmath136 , we therefore conclude that @ xmath137 , the contribution of bfkl-loop to the aerodynamics from pb-pb collisions can now be estimated from xmath133 gev to xmath133 , it can be proved that @ xmath133 , the contribution of bfk-loop to the aerodynamics by the aerodynamics by collinear factorization at @ xmath133 , the same at xmath133, the bfk-loop - aerodynamical accursed cf-loop of the larger meteorological accursed meteorological accursed accursed accur blaizot and a . mueller, nucl phys. dsdpt - a . . the total contributions of the kinematical region relevant to the hard bfkl-pomeron are, by the ledger xmath146 (in fig. 5) the two contributions are of similar magnitude . we used the assumption that the bfkl-pomeron is responsible for all the small - xmath53 rise at hera, i.e. , i.e., we studied the maximum possible contribution from the kinematical region relevant to the hard bfkl-pomeron . - blaizot and a . mueller, nucl phys . b289 ( 1987) 840 . - i want to thank k . kajantie, a . leonidov, b. mller, v. ruuskanen and x . wang for fruitful collaboration. : p-202 ; p-202 ; p-204 ; p-202 ; p-102 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 , c-232 , p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 ; p-232 , p-232 ; p-232, p-232 ; p-232 ; d-243 ; p-232 ; a-kovner, l-mc-lerran, h-weigert, p-232 ; p-232 ; phys rei . b-328 , ( 1985) ; g . gatoff, a . . . kerman, and t-matsui, phys rei . . . c46 , -2329 . . . . . - h-316 ( 1986) ; g. gatoff, e . . . levin, and m . . ryskin, phys . . . . . . a h2 collaboration , i. abt ... b439 ...
