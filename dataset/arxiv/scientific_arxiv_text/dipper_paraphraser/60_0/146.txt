snia was detected to be fainter than expected, and a description of the molecular structure of the universe was made, as follows: - the first observations that the universe had entered into an expansion was made, when supernovae (snia) were found to be fainter than expected, - snia was observed to be fainter than expected - and the observations of the observations confirmed this hypothesis with many independent observations: - the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) - inhomogeneities in the distribution of the matter, - the integrated sachs wolfe (isw) effect, - the integrated sachs wolfe's effect - the bounded baryon effect - the weak lensing wl - xcite, - the gamma-ray bursts - xcite - the dm is assumed to have negligible pressure and temperature and is called cold . this new cosmological model is not satisfactory from the theoretical point of view: the value of the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than what is estimated by particle physics - xcite. The cosmological model is also complicated by a severe fine- tune problem known as the 'knot problem' which can be expressed in the following words: if the time variations of matter and de are very different, then why is their current value very different? Is it possible to estimate the effect of an interaction between the components of the dark sector? Let us examine the influence of the interaction on the background dynamics. The presence of the de and the de interacts with the growth, density, and baryon density perturbations; the pattern of temperature anisotropies of the cmb and the evolution of the gravitational potential during late times. [2] In this article we introduce the concordance model and discuss some of the shortcomings which made us consider interactions in the dark sector. As the nature of de and dm is not known, we introduce two possible and different ways of describing de and dm: fluids and scalar fields. In the phenomenological fluid interaction models the perturbations of the matter and baryon are described. We find that a dm/de interaction can solve the coincidence problem and satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. in the , the main observables that we refer to in the dm are used, that is, the main observables which we use in the dm and dm6. Finally, in the dm, dm, we will discuss the available observations and the prospects of measuring or limiting the interaction. In the dm , dm, dm, we shall discuss the influence of the interaction on the background dynamics. But we will introduce the speed of light in case we need it. wolfe + cmb & cosmic microwave background & lss & large scale structure + detf & dark energy task force & rhs & right hand side of an equation – dm – dark matter – rsd – redshift space distortions – eos – equation of state – sl – strong lensing – eisw – early integrated sachs – wolfe – snia – supernova type ia + friedman – robertson – walker – tsz – thermal sunyaev – zeldovich – friedman – robertson – walker – tsz – thermal sunyaev – zeldovich – friedman – robertson – tsz – thermal sunyaev – zeldovich – friedman – robertson – walker – tsz – thermal sunyaev – zeldovich – sz – thermal sunyaev – zeldovich – friedman – robertson – tsz – thermal sunyaev – zeldovich – isw – early integrated sachs – wolfe – snia – supernova type I – friedman – walker – tsz – thermal sunyaev – A hubble constant is usually referred to in this way: @xmath20kms @xmath21mpc @xmath21, so the parameter @xmath22 fills in the observational uncertainty about the value of the hubble constant. For the sake of simplicity in our subsequent discussion, we will focus on models with a de eos parameter. the results of the correlation study can be found in Fig. . . - figure 2 - sec8 . the results of the mcmc analysis in different data sets are shown in Fig. . . . the results of the interaction study in Fig. . . . . . The results of the interaction study with different data sets are shown in Fig. . . . . The phenomenological description of the interaction between the dark sectors was introduced in Fig. . . . . [sep. 3] , and the linear perturbation theory of the model was explained in sec. . . . . . . for the sake of simplicity, in our subsequent discussion, we shall examine only the models with the eos parameter at xmath23. the result of the experiment is shown in Fig. . . . in xcite, evidence of the existence of a bilinear relationship was found, but with a low cl. [[3]] At lower redshifts, the deviations of xmath31 (from planck _planck_ + wmap) were not very prominent, and it was easy to prove the existence of a dynamical de component, or even an interacting one, with high redshift observations. We can compare the function of dm and de in the friedmann equation and compare it with the value of the Hubble parameter obtained from the friedmann equation for different values of the cosmological parameters. A numerical element of dm, de, and baryons can be used to test the relationship between dm and de. We can draw the conclusions of this article from the numbers in table 3.1.3 : if de and de combine, which emits energy to the former (as is necessary to abolish the coincidence problem) , and indicated by the data in xmath33, it is possible to find the value of the hubble parameter, xmath34, obtained by the team in collaboration, and which is smaller than the expectation for xmath34, @xmath36. At the lowest redshifts the deviations of xmath31 are not very great, and one can easily establish the existence of a dynamical de, or even a combination of the two, with the help of high redshift observations. Let us, as a brief example, give the result of the network of bosses. Let us consider a universe filled only with dm, de and baryons. Let us take the Hubble parameter obtained from the Friedmann equation and compare it with the value of the hubble parameter obtained by the collaboration from the different sets of adjusted cosmological parameters. We can compare the constraints for @ xmath35 and feq   xmath42  xmath42   al    xmath43  xmath45  xmath45  xmath46  xmath47  xmath48  xmath49  xmath50  xmath51  xmath52  xmath53     end    de   de    de   label     end  -    de  end  aligned     label  int de   end        the baryonic density is given by the usual expression @ xmath38 . For the ccc parameter and the bestfit, we take two sets of values for the cosmological parameters, namely, the values of the de, calculated from the planck- and bao-, snia and @ xmath55, respectively. For the samurai model, the evolution is that @ xmath39, if energy is transferred from the de to the dm, the density of the dm is always smaller than what is in the standard samurai model, so it is the hubble parameter, as indicated by the boss data. The tests are all about analyzing interacting dm/de models. One reason for studying interacting dm/de models is to overcome the coincidence problem. The results are shown in fig. [336](p. 8] where the positive coupling is compatible with the data, and the positive values help to solve the cosmological coincidence problem,[372] and the same conclusions have been reached with the field description of dm/de. . . . for example, in the case of the cosmological model (dbl. xmath59) and in the case of the integral ratios, (a) the integral has two attractor solutions @ xmath59; the past and future values are given in eq. [473]. at xmath56 . . . the integral solution is no longer dependent on the initial conditions of the universe; the solid circles represent the differential difference at xmath56. . . . , width = 480 , height = 432 , . . . , the solution has two arrows  = xmath58 in :0; , the ratio has two arrows  in :0 - r + - , width = 480 , height = 432 ] . . . The diffusion coefficient @ xmath56 is different for different initial conditions, but all curves are bounded by the two attractors solutions @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . in this particular case we fixed @ xmath67 and @ xmath68. Observations of supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, redshift space distortions and the growth of cosmic structure probe the evolution of the universe to @ xmath70. As the interaction between the dark regions of the universe changes the expansion history of the universe and the evolution of matter and radiation density, peculiar velocities and gravitational fields, these new facilities not only test the current accelerated expansion, but also explain the nature of the interaction between the dark areas. Thus, current and future observations will be used to establish constraints on the interaction between the dark areas and to clarify the nature of dm/d interactions. Besides, the physics of dm/d interactions at recombination can be probed by the cmb radiation power spectrum, while the isw effect and lensing pattern of the cmb sky are sensitive to the growth of matter at lower redshifts. The de task force (detf) was established to advise the different funding agencies on future de research. The report contained several experimental approaches and a numerical -the-number of merit', which was adapted to the properties of de, and its evolution with respect to low redshifts. I will refer to the projects under construction in this section, which are in the works or are being planned in advance, for a brief overview of these experiments. They have all the common feature of surveying a large area, collecting large samples of galaxies, clusters, and supernovae, and they will also help clarify the nature of the interaction between dark sectors. In the past, the cfht. legacy survey, conducted in the late 1990s, with observations of snia and weak lensing, and that ended in 2009, and the sds. ii Supernovae and Bao measurements from the sds. Then, the chi-chi, and the sds. The sds. (at xcite) and yu-ni, qiao and yu-ni, supernovae and supernovae, and in xcite, supernovae are found, the distance and redshift relationship is determined. " The 6 diffraction galaxy survey (instead of the last one, established in the late 1990s), has mapped the nearby universe over xmath71 deg@ xmath72 of the southern sky, with galactic latitude xmath73, whose median redshift is Xmath74 . The fourth survey of sdss-iii is an astronomical survey of the Universe. It is set up in five years to measure the distance and volume of galaxies and make the radii less intense and more small. The goal is to calculate the radius and volume of galaxies in the redshift range, and in a circumpolar system with 54 narrow bands and 2 broad bands. The filters are optimized to measure the redshifts at a redshift of xmath84. The project is called the javalambre physics of the accelerated Universe, which was founded in 2009 and has been running for five years. Its objective is to measure the total diameter of the radii and the redshift in a single line, i.e., if the radii are high redshifts, it has developed a technique for calculating the boulevard, which is very accurate at xmath78. The p. 9 data published by the pas, are shown as estimations of the Boulevard at xmath79 and at xmath78. The researchers are a combination of abbreviations and curves. At the Anglo-Australian observatory, a survey has been carried out. It is complete. It has taken measurements of the galaxies of 1000° deg, 40>, 40> and 100110247; this survey combines a measurements of cosmic distances by combining measurements of the structure by the redshift. As the system is based on the interpretation of the measurement in Sec. 7, it is also based on the reconstruction of the equation of state of @xcite. the observatories of the atacama (act) operates at 148, 218 and 277 ghz, the full width at half the maximum resolution of @xmath91|xcite. the observatories will have four telescopes in collaboration to measure the sky, with a view to the cosmological survey. This survey will cover the whole sky above, at dec. + @xcite, which is a factor of two orders of magnitude in the xcite band, with photometric redshifts, in order to estimate the development of the galaxy cluster. The collaboration has released two observed areas of @xmath93|xcite, a slit-shaped observation area. The wigglez de survey is a large-scale redshift survey carried out at the Anglo-Australian telescope, and it is now complete. Its aim is to take a wide survey of the sky, above the standard, up to the level of the sdss. And, in addition to the wide survey, an ultra-deep field of xmath87deg@xmath72 will be observed down to the dimension of 27, xmath88 xmath87, xmath72, No noise level is noticed, a region of xmath98deg@xmath72, a signal area of xmath98deg@xmath72 . The data in the three frequencies was used to produce the radiation power spectrum, which was representative of the predictions of the gravitational lensing of xmath103. de survey (de) is a wide-field imaging and supernova spectrometer on the blanco4 m telescope in cerro tololo (chile) using the de camera. The spectroscopic instrument, des, is a wide-field spectrometer, which is to be launched in 2018 and that for five years in the nearly twin-mayall telescope at Kitt Peak (AZ) . It is intended to study the effects of de on the expansion and the height of a Universe. Its goal is to study the expansion and the gravitational evolution of a Universe, and to study the gravity of a Universe through the lensing of a Dark Matter. The institute is a non-profit astronomy association dedicated to estimating the universe in 56 colors, in a large-scale sample of galaxies and quasars in the relatively unexplored redshift range that straddles the giant galaxy sample and the giant ly-@ xmath30 sample. In five years, jpas will cover a span of xmath82deg, xmath72. This collection will have in it a large sample of galaxies and quasars in the relatively unexplored redshift range that lies between the giant galaxy sample and the giant ly-@ xmath30 sample. In this way it will obtain a 50% accuracy in detecting distances between xmath81deg and xmath72. The principal instruments of this survey are a 2 .5 m telescope located in el pico del buitre (teruel, spain) and a 1 . 2 gigapixel camera. The main objective of this survey is to obtain the angular and radial components of the bao from the galaxy clustering. The main instrument is a 2 . 5 m telescope located at the Pico del Buitre (teruel, spain) and a 1 . 2 gigapixel camera. You may know about the first radio telescope in the world. The telescope is located on the telescope site of Cerro Pachn (Chile), and will operate for a decade. In six optical bands, from 320 nm to 1050 nm, it will analyze galaxies, for a period of a decade. Its goal is to determine the density and density of galaxy clusters, according to redshift. The telescope will be placed on cerro pachn, chile, and it will work for a decade, allowing it to identify galaxies to redshifts exceeding unity. The skew barometer (SK) is a radio telescope that will begin construction in 2018 . The skew barometer is a compact telescope, devoted to cosmological studies. The skew barometer is a multi-object spectrometer specially designed for the observation of stars. Its science goal is to detect, in a high-precision way, bao, and snia, and to determine the spatial density, distribution and masses of galaxy clusters by adjusting the redshifts of the galaxy. The Wiksonson microwave-antisotropy probe (wmap) was a satellite mission to measure the polarization of the cmb and its galaxy and globular sources. The plans were to characterize the polarization of the cmb and the source of sycbols and gallops, and the large object of these experiments was to characterize the polarization of the cmb and the cosmological sources, in addition to the polarization of the globe and of the universe. The ground experiments are generally expensive, and as a result the experimental data is often quite inaccurate. The final nine years of this operation were followed by the planck collaboration's measurements of polarization and temperature. The planck satellite had observable the microwave and sub-millimeter sky from August 12, 2009 to October 23, 2013 in a band between 3 and 5 ghz with a radiance of 83 5 5 m. the calculated temperature and polarization, the catalog of the sunyaev-zeldovich effect, a catalog of sunyaev-zeldovich and tsz clusters. The wilkinson microwave-polarization probe (wmap) was a relic of the Wilkinson Observatory (june 30) and was operated for nine years, from a distance of 22 ghz, until its end in september 2010. The main results and data of the nine-year-old probe are described in xcite. The planck collaboration has received data on the thermal and temperature changes of the cmb and submillimeter from August 12th, 2009 to October 23rd, 2013. The resolution of the measured temperature and polarization, a catalogue of cluster – The goal of erosita is to detect and survey redshifts at redshifts – in order to study the large structure of the universe, and test and characterize the cosmological models including de . The Uclid is a European space agency satellite project, scheduled for launch in 2020 – in the optical and near-infrared (OLIR) spectrum, with a full range of optical and near-infrared (OLIR) and nir spectrums. In the soft x-ray (ac) band, ac 2 – 2 – 5 – 2 – 5 – 2 – 2 – it is about 20 times more sensitive than a rosat all-sky survey, and in the hard band, ac 2 – 10 – it will provide the first full-scale imaging survey of the sky at these temperatures. The euclid mission is the result of the Hubble space telescope, with optical and nir infrared imaging and nir spectroscopy. It will allow many different cosmological models to be assessed, when the growth factor is parametrized as a ‘1’, the value – – –1 corresponds to the – ‘1 –’ model and euclid will measure this parameter with a precision of – x-math117 – . In addition, 50 million spectroscopic redshifts will be obtained . Many synergies will be derived from cross-correlations between observations of different wavelengths, for example, euclid, wfirst, and ska have similar scientific goals, but they will have observations at different wavelengths . euclid, wfirst, and ska have similar science goals, but will be given observations at different wavelengths. euclid, wfirst and ska have the same scientific goal, but they will be taken at different wavelengths . euclid and wfirst probe the low redshift universe, through the acoustic oscillations of the acoustic waves and the constant redshift evolution , whereas ska, in contrast, has the potential to probe a higher redshift regime and a different range in the dimensions of matter power, which are linear rather than quasi-non-linear, as euclid and wfirst are able to discern . Besides, due to their different observing strategy, it is possible to cross-check the different parameters and obtain a systematic diagnosis. Moreover, because of their different observing strategy, it is possible to carry out cross-checks that can detect and eliminate systematics. The ska, wfirst, and euclid are similar scientific objects, but have different wavelengths, and the ska has the potential to penetrate a higher redshift regime and a different range of scales in the matter power spectrum, which is linear rather than the quasi-non-linear scales to which euclid and wfirst are sensitive.
