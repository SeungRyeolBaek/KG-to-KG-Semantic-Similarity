. . . Let xmath1 be a graph with vertex set @ xmath4 and edge set @ xmath5 . . . a perfect matching or 1 factor structure on a graph is a set of edges of @ xmath0 such that every vertex of @ xmath1 is afflicted with exactly one edge of @ xmath0. The [1] _• of the [2] of a graph is a kekul structure, which is not the greatest number of double bonds to determine this entire kekul structure, which has since been called the [3] of harary et al. , in general to compute the minimum force of a graph with the greatest degree of 3 is an np-compliant problem, in general. The [2] [3] [4] randi and klein ___ proposed the innate degree of freedom of a kekul structure, i.e. the least number of double bonds can determine the entire kekul structure, which is called the [5]] forcing number , the [6][7] (first ): the [5][6][6][5] [6] is the smallest cardinality among all [5], denoted by [7] . the [6][6][6][6] [6] is the smallest cardinality over all [5][6], denoted by [7], denoted by [7] . Finally, there is a digraph of xmath1 – a digraph of xmath1 – a digraph of xmath1 – a resonant set. a set of disjointed (or alternating) hexagons of xmath1 is called an alternating set – then xmath13 – where xmath14 is the maximum number of disjointed hexagons of xmath1 – alternating sets – then a set of disjoint, alternating hexagons of xmath3 is called an alternating set – then a cycle of alternating hexagons of xmath1 – alternating cycles – a hexagonal system (or benzenoid) is a 2 – connected, finite plane graph, a double row of faces, a straight axis, a long axis, a length, a side length one. A hexagonal system with a perfect matching is a skeleton of a hydrocarbon skeleton. A hexagonal system with a perfect matching is a hexagonal system of a benzenoid hydrocarbon. A fries set of @ xmath3 is a maximum alternating set of @ xmath3 over all perfect matchings, and the fries number of @ xmath16, denoted by xmath16, is the size of a fries set. A rotational series of graphs at the same height as a plane, the hexagonal system at xmath3 is defined by an anti-forcection set, named @xmath3, which is a set of edges of @xmath3 that meets the edges at the edge of @xmath3 , we can see that the anti-forcection number of a graph at xmath3 is the minimum anti-forcection number of all perfect matches of xmath1. Using an analogous way to define the anti-forcection number of a graph at xmath3 we define the anti-forcection number of a graph at xmath1 as the minimum number of edges not in @xmath0 whose removal to fix the single perfect match at xmath3 . for a hexagonal system at xmath3 we find the maximum anti-forcement number of @xmath3 equals the fries number of @xmath3 . so we have that the fries number of @xmath3 is between the clar number of @xmath3 and twice . In addition, we show that the anti-forcement number has a close relation to the force number: for any perfect match @xmath3 , @xmath18, where @xmath19 denotes the maximum force number of . ‘ Anti- forcing a set of edges of Xmath1 which are not in Xmath0 is called an anti-forced set of Xmath0 if xmath6 has a unique perfect matching, that is, xmath0 . . . so xmath6 has no alternating cycle . . . therefore, each alternating cycle of Xmath1 contains at least one edge of Xmath6 . . . let xmath1 be a graph with the maximum degree of xmath6 . . . , let xmath6 be a graph with the maximum degree of xmath6 . . . . . . . . if xmath6 is an anti-forced set of xmath0, then if xmath6 is an anti-forced set of xmath0, then if xmath6 has an anti-forced set of xmath0 , then xmath20 has no anti-forced set, i.e. xmath0 . . . that is, if xmath6 contains at least one edge of each alternating cycle of xmath1 . , that is, all edges in xmath-28 are edged in xmath-28. For each edge in xmath-28, we have to choose all the edges not in xmath-28 that occur in xmath-28. So the argument is: xmath-28 is a forced set of xmath-28 . then xmath-32 is the lowest forced set of xmath-28 . by the definition of xmath-28 , a edge must be contained in xmath-28 . and a second trough is made, and so Xmath-32 is the second trough. and we assert that xmath-28 is an alternating set of xmath-28 . so xmath-33 is an anti-forced set of xmath-28. therefore, Lemma-forced implies that xmath-33 is an anti-forced set of xmath-0 . so, xmath-33 is an anti-forced set of xmath-28 . so, xmath-33 is a forceful set of xmath-0 . Let xmath40 and xcite be called the _forced spectrum_ @ xcite and the _forced spectrum_ of xmath1 . So we can proceed to the first conclusion . . . if xmath1 has two alternating cycles which are either disjoint or intersect only at edges in xmath0, then a lemma of each of these alternating cycles will contain an edge of each of these alternating cycles. We have thus arrived at a new formulation: a collection @ xmath47 of alternating cycles of xmath1 is called a 'compatible' set' if any two members of alternating cycles are disjoint or intersect only at edges in xmath0 . in a kekul structure of xmath45 and xmath46 , randi and vukievi computed the distribution of the number of induced numbers of kekul structures in xmath45 and xmath46 . we have a 'induced' number @ xmath48 . In order to obtain a finite-planed graph, we must assign an orientation of @ xmath1 to @ xmath0 in order to obtain a digraph @ xmath52. From the edge of @ xmath0, all the edges are directed from white to black, and all the edges not from black are directed from white to black. This means that an @ xmath0 alternating cycle of @ xmath1 becomes a directed cycle of @ xmath53, and a directed cycle of @ xmath53 will produce an @ xmath0 alternating cycle of @ xmath1 if and only if @ xmath6 is a feedback cycle of @ xmath53 . so by lemma [anti] a subset of @ xmath23 is an anti-forced set of @ xmath0 if and only if @ xmath6 is a feedback set of @ xmath53 . so by lemma ... by lemma ... by lemma [anti] a subset of @ xmath23 is an anti-forced set of @ xmath0 if and only if @ xmath6 is a feedback set of @ xmath53 . therefore @ xmath53 is a finite planar epoch. In this regard, we confine our consideration to a hexagonal system called Xmath3, with a perfect match to Xmath0. A single superposition of the xmath0 is so termed “a true proper” (Relatively), if each of the edge edges of Xmath0 in Xmath0 moves from white to black (Relatively, from black to white) along the clockwise direction of Xmath3 . It is enough to prove that Xmath56 is a compatible alternating cycle. The boundary of Xmath3 means the boundary of the outer ring. Then an alternating cycle of Xmath0 of Xmath0 is said to be proper (Relatively, unfavorable) if each edge of Xmath10 in Xmath0 goes from white end to black end (Relatively, black end to white end) along the clockwise direction of Xmath10 . “Debates” xmath3 is an alternating cycle of Xmath0, which means “perfectly” (respectively, “perfectly imperfect”) if each edge of Xmath10 in Xmath0 is from white end to black end (respectively, from black end to white end) along the clockwise direction of Xmath10 . . . . . . note that the first vertex of xmath62 goes into xmath61 and the second vertex of xmath62 goes out of xmath62. That is, the fourth vertex of xmath62 goes into xmath61 from one side and leaves from the other side through xmath25. This edge of xmath62 is called a crossing. So, suppose that in a clockwise direction, xmath62 from xmath65 enters the interior of xmath61 and comes to the crossing @ xmath66. For example, suppose that in a clockwise direction, xmath62 enters into xmath61 from one side and leaves from the other side by xmath68. So we say that xmath47 is not crossing if two cycles in xmath 47 are not crossing .. let xmath26 and xmath27 be two consecutive crossings, which are edges in xmath0 . If @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 both correspond to a proper (precisely the improper) @ xmath0, let @ xmath75 and @ xmath77 be replaced with @ xmath79 and a new compatible @ xmath63 of @ xmath3. Since such a change does not create any new crossings, by repeating the above process we have at last reached a compatible @ xmath0 alternating set @ xmath63 that is not crossing. For a cycle of @ xmath10 of @ xmath3 let @ xmath78 denote the number of hexagons in the interior of @ xmath10. which we call the following # xmath81_index_ of @ xmath47. By the above choice we know that any two cycles in @ xmath47 are either disjoint or one contains the other. Thus, the cycles in @ xmath47 form a poset according to the contained relation of their interiors. Since each cycle in @ xmath47 has an interior which is not across, by recurrence we know that @ xmath79 is not across, and by recurrence we know that @ xmath81 is not across. In the first place, it is the A-xmath94 , and the A-xmath95, with the I-xmath95 , and the Xmath95 and the Xmath95 are a series of hexagons at the edge of xmath82 as Fig. 3. We rephrase the following phrases: zheng and chen, “a hexagon in the xmath 47 .” Therefore, if we assume that xmath10 is an xmath0 alternating cycle (if not, in the xmath92), then, if not, then xmath95 is a bifurcation in the xmath73 ; and then, if xmath73 is a bifurcation in the xmath73 , we will draw a circle from xmath73 to the left , xmath81, that is, to the left , we will see a set of hexagons in the xmath73 , xmath83, Fig. 7 , c1 , d , Xmath78, , Xmath93, xmath85, see fig. 4 , we will say that xmath83 is an alternating cycle . “Suppose that if xmath114 is a proper cycle of xmath0 alternating, then none of the edges @ xmath113 are axes of xmath82 . . . so that if xmath114 is a cycle of xmath102, and if xmath113 is a cycle of xmath102, then there is no cycle for xmath102, nor for xmath103, nor for xmath103 . so if xmath120 is a hexagon of xmath102 and xmath95 , then if xmath121 is a hexagon of xmath102 and xmath101, then there is a contradiction. So if xmath123 is a contradiction , then the cycle xmath102 can be replaced by xmath122 and a different alternating alternating set with less xmath103 index than xmath48 , also a contradiction , a contradiction . a contradiction , a contradiction , a contradiction , a contradiction, the claim Xmath102 . if xmath122 is a contradiction, then the cycle xmath111 can be replaced by xmath122 and another alternating alternating set with less xmath81 index than xmath48, that is a contradiction . . . That is if we will say that if xmath131 is the right vertical edge of the hexagon @ xmath140 belongs to xmath0, and that the hexagons @ xmath141 are all proper xmath0 alternating hexagons, and all belong to xmath47 and xmath142. if xmath131 is the case, then xmath147 is the case, and xmath125 is the case. Suppose xmath150 . . . choose an integer @ xmath137 in place of @ xmath137, so that @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 are properly alternating hexagons. By the complication of theorems (clarity) and fries (fertility) we find the following relations between the clarity and the fries number. Let Xmath be a hexagonal system. Let Xmath158 be a hexagonal system. Let Xmath158 be a hexagonal system. The inner dual Xmath158 of xmath3 is a plane graph: the center of each hexagon Xmath81 is a vertex Xmath159 of xmath158, and if two hexagons of xmath158 share an edge, then the corresponding vertices are joined by an edge. This result is given by harary et al. : a system characterized by the fries number (the maximum anti-force number) obtaining the number of hexagons. xmath166, as a bipartite graph, Xmath166, where xmath167 is the matching number of xmath158, the size of a maximum matching of xmath158. so that it is equal. If a hexagonal system Xmath3 is perfectly matched with xmath0, let Xmath168 be the number of alternating hexagons of xmath3, if a fusion edge is located at the boundary, then a fusion edge is placed at the other side, to form a larger all-kink catahex. a dominating set of a graph Xmath1 is a set of vertices of Xmath1 that is dominating and independent in Xmath1 , so that every vertex not in Xmath6 has a neighbor in Xmath6 , if a dominating set of xmath1 is perfect, then a 'superiority' of xmath1 is called the "same googlint number' (for a survey on independent domination, see xcite) for any perfect matching of xmath1 of xmath1 , a non-dominant set of xmath1 is the 'superiority' of xmath1 , the independent dominating set of xmath1 is a set of vertices of xmath1 that is both dominating and independent in xmath1 , xcite , xcite We claim that @xmath176 is an independent dominating set of @xmath158 . Let @xmath176 be a maximum set of disjointed hexagons of @xmath3 and @xmath174 . . . if the hexagon with the three fusing edges in @xmath0 is an alternating hexagon, then @xmath178 . otherwise, @xmath178 is an alternating hexagon. let @ xmath177 be a hexagon of @xmath3 not in @xmath3 . . . if some hexagon of @xmath3 adjacent to @xmath81 has the three fusing edges in @xmath0, then @xmath178 . so the claim is true and the xmath180 . So we can see that the xmath180 is a perfect matching of @xmath3 and all hexagons of @xmath3 . . . If there is a perfect matching of @xmath3 and all hexagons of @xmath3 that does not have xmath6 , then the three non-fusing edges of each hexagon in @xmath6 are chosen as edges of @xmath181 . : we hereby determine the independent domination number of the tree. For example, if the answer is, ‘ascetic’ , we obtain the minimum forcing number of two certain-sized-type catahexes. For example, the figure ‘Cata’ entails the minimum forcing numbers of two whole-type catahexes. xcite’s method, for instance, is to give the minimum forcing numbers of two recurring catahexes. For instance, for integers @ xmath189, let’s say the hexagonal system comprises horizontal rows of alternating hexagons, and the last hexagon of each row is immediately to the right and to the right of the last hexagon in the previous row, and so we call this truncated parallelogram and a chain. Then we note that a truncated parallelogram may be shown and depicted in other ways. Suppose, for example, Fig. – cata – gives the minimum forcing number of two kink catahexes. But for each kink catahex the anti-forced number may be larger than the anti-forced number; for instance, the triphenylene has the minimum forcing number 1 and the anti-forced number 2 (see Fig. – spec) . note that this truncated parallelogram can be placed and represented in other ways as well. As a result, @ xmath1 has no fixed edges, and if it has a fixed edge and if xmath197 is, then xmath3 has at least two normal edges. if the xmath1 nodes are of the same colour and lie on the boundary, then @ xmath1 has at least one normal edge. if xmath1 has no fixed edges and if xmath197 is, then xmath1 has at least two normal edges. Here a normal edge is a hexagonal system with an anti-force number of at least one. Note that the anti-force number of @ xmath3 is equal to the anti-force number of @ xmath1. Xmath1 is a quadrilateral, connected graph with a perfect match. Suppose that all pendant vertices of xmath1 are of the same colour and lie on the boundary, then xmath1 has at least one normal edge. Xmath202 is an edge-cut of xmath3, and xmath203 is an invariant for all perfect matches of xmath0 of xmath3 . Note that the anti-forces number of xmath3 is equal to one . As a truncated parallelogram, xmath205 and xmath206 share each other's boundary as a truncated parallelogram of the same length, i.e. if xmath205 is not cross-connected, then it must be a hexagonal system other than truncated parallelogram, contradicting xmath205's anti-forceting edge. (i.e., the inner twin is a path with exactly one vertex) , and iii when a truncated parallelogram passes through xmath207, the hexagons of xmath208 with an edge of xmath207 form a linear chain or a kink (i.e., the inner dual is a path with exactly one turning vertex) , iii when the truncated parallelogram passes through xmath209 or xmath210 of xmath205, the hexagons of xmath208 ( resp. xmath206) with an edge of xmath207 form a linear chain or a kink (i.e. the inner dual is a path with exactly one turning vertex) , and iii when the truncated parallelogram passes through xmath210 of xmath204, the hexagons of xmath207 ( resp. xmath207) with an edge of xmath207 form a linear chain or a kink (i.e. the inner dual is a path with exactly one turning vertex) , and - by the same arguments as in the proof of point 1, we have that xmath216 is a hexagonal system with an anti-forcedging edge @ xmath211 , that is, without the least omission, xmath23 , so xmath23 is anti-forceting. - if xmath23 is empty, then xmath25 is an anti-forced edge of xmath3 , a contradiction. - if xmath23 is empty, then xmath23 is an anti-forced edge of xmath3 , which is contradictory to xmath23. if xmath23 is empty, then xmath23 is an anti-forced edge of xmath3 , a contradiction . recurrence of the above, until to a graph without any edges, as Xmath216 is called, corresponds to xmath22. Note that the interior faces of xmath21 are hexagons . . . from the center of xmath21 in xmath22 , draw a ray perpendicular to and away from xmath21 ( resp. xmath21) intersecting a boundary edge at xmath210 at xmath47 ( resp. edge @ xmath209 at xmath86) such that Xmath220 ( resp. xmath21) only passes through hexagons of xmath21. if xmath229 is a boundary edge of xmath3 , then xmath227 is anti-forced by xmath25, and so xmath228 is at most as many hexagons as xmath222. In general, for xmath232, let xmath232 be the graph consisting of the hexagons adjacent to xmath233 and below . if xmath232 has no hexagon adjacent to xmath233, then by the same reasons as above, we have that xmath232 is a linear chain with an end hexagon in xmath23, and the edges in xmath232 parallel to xmath218 are anti-forced by xmath25, so that xmath228 is the same as xmath23. Hence xmath227 is anti-forced by xmath25 and therefore belongs to xmath0 . Besides, in general, for xmath231 let xmath232 be the graph consisting of the hexagons adjacent to xmath232 and below it . if xmath232 has no hexagon adjacent to the left end hexagon of xmath233, then, for the same reason as above, we have the same reason that xmath232 is a linear chain with an end hexagon in xmath23, and the edges in xmath232 parallel to xmath218 are anti-forced by xmath25, and therefore belong to xmath0 . ‘A hexagon is adjacent to a hexagon adjacent to a hexagon, so xmath3 is a parallelogram, a contradiction. But in xmath203, for instance, we may define xmath237 in turn and obtain the same result: there must be an integer at xmath237 such that, for every xmath239, there must be an integer at xmath238 such that for every xmath239, there must be an integer at xmath237 such that there must be an integer at xmath238 such that for each xmath239, there must be an integer at xmath238 such that for every xmath239, there must be an integer at xmath238 such that there must be an integer at xmath238 such that there must be an integer at xmath238 such that for every xmath239, there must be an integer at xmath238 such that each xmath239, for each xmath239, there must be an integer @ xmath238 such that there must be an integer @ xmath238 such that for each xmath239, @ xmath230 is a linear chain with an end hexagon in @ xmath222 and @ xmath236 has at most as many hexagons as @ xmath241, while @ xmath243 has a hexagon below the lowest xmath243 (see fig. 7). And so if each @ xmath235 is a linear chain, and each @ xmath257 has no hexagons at the left end of the xmath236, then @ xmath252 is a linear chain that intersects @ xmath223 at an odd length, so that @ xmath258 must be a truncated parallelogram consisting of @ xmath252 and its right side. So if @ xmath247 is the right end of @ xmath244, @ xmath245 is the center of @ xmath244, @ xmath63 is the center of the most left vertical edge of @ xmath233, and @ xmath87 is the center of the edge of @ xmath244 adjacent to @ xmath259. and thus @ xmath247. if every @ xmath235 is a chain, and every @ xmath257 has no hexagons to the left of the left end hexagon of @ xmath236, then @ xmath252 is a chain, intersecting @ xmath223 at an odd length, so that @ xmath258 must be a parallelogram consisting of @ xmath252 and its right side. f. abeledo, g. w. atkinson, unimodularity of the clar number problem, linear algebra appl. 479 (2007 ) 4141448 p. adams, m. mahdian, e. s mahmodian, on the spectrum of the forced number of graphs, australas . j. combin. 30 (2011 ) 141448 t. beyer, a. proskurowski, s. hedetniemi, s. mitchell, t. clar, the aromatic sextet (lecture by chemistry) , springer london, 1972 t. cyvin, i. gutman, kekul structures in hydrocarbons (lecture by chemistry 46) , springer, berlin, 1988 t. h. deng, the anti-forced number of double hexagonal chains , t. chen, the anti-forced number of hexagonal chains, t. he , t. h. deng, the anti-forced number of double hexagonal chains, t. h. deng, the anti-forced number of double hexagonal chains, t. he , t. hedetniemi, t. mitchell, independent domination of trees, t. t. w. atkinson, t. beyer, a. proskurowski, s. hedetniemi, s. mitchell, independent domination of trees, congr . adverb , the minimum number of pushing in the torus and hypercube, discrete math , l . lovsz, m . d . plummer, matching theory, annals of discrete math , 197 , North-Hellenic, amsterdam, c . lucchesi, d . h. younger, a minimax theorem for directed graphs, j . london math , 138 - 198 - 295301 - l . lovsz, m . d . plummer, entropy in graphs, j . london math . y . lovsz, m . d . plummer, m . d . plummer, j . london math . - b . - v, j . london ctr . ed., john wiley & sons, new york, 1985 - pp . m . randi, d . h. , 'the minimum bound of the torus and hypercube,' j . h. zhang, d. ye, w. c. shiu, a property of the conjugate-invariable graphs, discrete math. 60 (1996) 253263. q. zhang, h. bian, e. vumar, a property of the anti-kekul and anti-forced number of cata-condensed phenylenes, compatibility with commun. 63 (1998) 291311 . m. zheng, r. chen, a property of a maximal coverage of hexagonal systems, graphs combin .
