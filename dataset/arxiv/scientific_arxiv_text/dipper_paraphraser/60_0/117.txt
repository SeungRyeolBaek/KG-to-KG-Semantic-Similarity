if a word is written as a word as a word in a word in a word in a word, then a word in a word in a word in a word in a word, then the words - xmath0 and -math14 are called prefix, factor and suffix of a word. So, if a word in a word in a word in a word in a word in a word in a word, then a word in a word in a word in a word in a word in a word, for example, a word in a word in a de bruijn sequence of order - xmath14, then a word in a word in a de bruijn sequence of order - xmath1 is called a de bruijn sequence of order - if it exists, then its suffix - xmath20 is the same as its suffix - xmath20 - so , sometimes a de bruijn sequence is written in a circular way, omitting the last - xmath19, and so a de bruijn sequence of order - xmath1 is written twice in the pipe. And this sequence is as follows: a feedback-switch-register (*), normal words, generating random binary sequences , primitive polynomials over a galois field * * *, lyndon words and necklaces, euler tours and spanning trees . . . besides the total number of de bruijn sequences, a more interesting subject is how to obtain a de bruijn sequence (as a lexicographically least one, lexicographically largest) . To understand this concept, let us return to the glass pipe game we have just played. The de bruijn sequence is sometimes called the full cycle, and it is connected with the following concepts: feedback registers, normal words, random binary sequences, primitive polynomials over a galois field, lyndon words and necklaces, euler tours and the chopping-chopping of trees. For an arbitrary alphabet of xmath24, van aardenne-ehrenfest and de bruijn have provided the formula of xmath22 for the total number of de bruijn sequences of order of xmath1. This solution represents a multi-shift de bruijn sequence. For an arbitrary alphabet of xmath24, van aardenne-ehrenfest and de bruijn have provided the formula for xmath22 for the total number of de bruijn sequences of order of xmath24. If the word is there, it is called a 'multi-shift de bruijn' sequence, of the 'multi-shift de bruijn' sequence. (A word of length - xmath0 is called a 'multi-shift de bruijn' sequence, and each word in - xmath1 is equal to - xmath43. for example, one of the 'xmath17-shift de bruijn' sequences is 'xmath39', which can be verified as follows: 'A word of length - xmath0' and 'a word of infinity' is 'a word', which can be proved as follows: 'The combination of two words - xmath35' is 'xmath36', or 'xmath37' . ' In a word - xmath17-shift de bruijn' sequences is a sequence of single-stack-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-threat-work-and-you-are quite right to be sure that the length of the @xmath1-shift-shift-shift-shift-order-score – if there is one – is equal to , as the two are alike, we have , at least , xmath55. , at least , compared with the set of all factors xmath57 and the set of all factors xmath58, we have the equality xmath64, so that we have the equality xmath65 . from proposition [Lemma: circular], we know that, when xmath43 is given, each multi-shift de bruijn sequence can be written in a circular word, and we can discuss a number of multi-shift de bruijn sequences of the two different forms. In this paper, we will discuss the multi-shift de bruijn sequence in the form of ordinary words. Here we do not take the convention xmath70, for a digraph contains self- loops and multiple arcs of the same pair of vertices. As the two are identical, we have 13455655667555776105254 , by the same argument we have 1555655 and 53595555565557336 85068245,5112536 ,61,2295190,5(6), a56, and 55 10101354 , it is not impossible that a hamilton cycle exists in the arc of xmath77 if there are euler tours in the arc of xmath90. So, to be sure, the following definitions are correct. (R) a 'diagrio' is a graph of a particular vertex, called the 'root', and it contains every vertice of xmath77, the number of arcs is exactly one less than the number of arcs, and there is precisely one walk from the root to the other vertex. An 'undirected' graph is defined as a digraph such that for any pair of vertices of xmath85, there is an arc @ xmath9, @ xmath93, and those arcs are the only arcs in xmath96. we define the word graph of xmath97 by @ xmath98, where i i i i i i i i m -  sma - is defined by @ xmath98, and i i is defined by i xmath99, and a hamilton cycle exists in the hamilton cycle of xmath77 if and only if hamilton cycles exist in the hamilton cycle , then by definition the following axioms are very simple. ‘ Lemma – equivalent’ is the arc of ‘@xmath97.’ (To these two points, there is a ‘@xmath112’ – to ‘ @xmath41’ mapping from the set of ‘@xmath112 – shift de bruijn sequences of order’ in ‘@xmath97’. (To the second point, there is a ‘@xmath112 – to ‘@xmath41’ mapping from the set of ‘@xmath112 – shift de bruijn sequences of order’ in ‘@xmath11’ . (To the second point) a ‘‘‘‘‘’ mapping from ‘‘ xmath112 – shift de bruijn sequences of order’ in ‘‘@xmath’ – to ‘‘’ in ‘‘the ’‘‘’ in ‘‘the ’‘‘’ is the ‘‘‘’ of ‘‘the ’’. ‘‘Easy to see,’ ‘the ’’ ‘“reference” ‘ , this is what follows from ‘‘The equivalent’. Xmath72 is connected to the vertex Xmath124 in both directions and Xmath125. Xmath72 is connected to the vertex Xmath124 in both directions and Xmath125. Then xmath73 is a multiplicative term: in Xmath73 there are exactly two such terms, Xmath 123 and Xmath 127, and the following is the sum of Xmath 123 . so , by the sum of the two multiplicative terms and the number of euler tours in Xmath73, we have the following. Since the sentence 'multi-separational term' exists, in Xmath3, there are exactly three such terms, Xmath 128 and Xmath 120, where xmath 129 and xmath120 are the multiplicative sums of all words in Xmath 15. so the total number of such words is Xmath5 . to study the case 'Xmath8' we need the theorem van aardenne-ehrenfest and de bruijn , which describes the relation between the number of eulers in a certain digraph and the number of eulers in an arc-graph. (theorem van aardenne-ehrenfest and de bruijn) for Xmath66 , let 'Xmath123' be a digraph, such that @xmath130 for every @xmath131 , let's 'xmath132' . So, by the relation between the multi-separation and the e — so that for every pair of vertices @ xmath85, there are @ xmath144 many arcs joining @ xmath147 to @ xmath147, and correspondingly there are @ xmath147 many arcs joining @ xmath147 to @ xmath146, the graph @ xmath145 is indeed an undirected graph by our definition. Hence the laplacian matrix of @ xmath145 is @ xmath149, by theorem (theorem: kirchhoff) the number of arborescents @ xmath150 is equal to the cofactor of @ xmath151, that is @ xmath152. by definition, from any vertex to any vertex there are @ xmath144- many arcs in @ xmath145. Let @ xmath141 and @ xmath45 . . . then . . . , let @ xmath141 and @ xmath45. By theorem [theorem: best] in a digraph @ xmath66, the number of spanning trees is equal to any cofactor of the laplacian matrix @ xmath77, which is the diagonal matrix of degrees minus the adjacency matrix. the inequality @ xmath127 is shown in lemma : "Countnlesm - [18] ; and , by lemma : recursion , --> m , we have - xmath157. and here we assume - xmath158. Now we assume - xmath156 . and we are going to consider - xmath158 . In this chapter we will see how to create one - xmath2 - shift de bruijn sequence - xmath160. to do this we first generate a bruijn sequence - xmath160 - over the alphabet - xmath160. - we will replace every letter of xmath0 in xmath162 with a word of length - xmath2 , - . . it is obvious that the new word is a - xmath2 - shift de bruijn sequence - xmath159. Here we will present two algorithms for generating a - xmath-shift-de bruijn sequence - xmath159. we will first of all create a de bruijn sequence of order - xmath160, over the alphabet - xmath-166 . then we replace each letter of -math-0 in -math-166 by the corresponding word of length - xmath-169 . it is clear that the new word is a - xmath-shift-de bruijn sequence of order - xmath-159 . , xmath174, xmath174, xmath174, and define xmath178, xmath179, and define xmath179, so that xmath181 is a xmath182 - shift de bruijn sequence of order xmath190. We then generate a xmath17 - shift de bruijn sequence of order xmath199. Then we define xmath195, xmath199, and the following word - xmath191 is a xmath191 - shift de bruijn sequence of order xmath199, where xmath198 and xmath198 . There is, as far as we can see, no word of length at all for length at all. That is, let the suffix of length @ xmath2 be two positive integers. , then the prefix @ xmath32 must be removed in xmath2; that is, xmath2 must be added to xmath2 as a factor at xmath2 position. For a man, then, no word can be added; the following algorithm generates a sequence of order @ xmath1 of order @ xmath1: a. , a. - aa - all xmath2 words with prefix @ xmath32 are contained in xmath0, so that xmath213 becomes a factor at xmath2 position. In order to prove the accuracy of the method, we first claim that when the algorithm stops, the suffix _________ of @ xmath_12 is utterly zeroed. therefore, in addition to _________________________ appears in ______________ in ___________, and thus all words in ____________________ appear in ____________ at a modulo @ xmath_2 position is an equivalence . And for @xmath214, if the word @xmath220 is not present in xmath220, we add Xmath225 to the current sequence Xmath223 , so that @ xmath220 is not present in xmath220 as a factor at xmath220. But for xmath221, we prove that @ xmath217 is not present in xmath220 as a factor at xmath220 , a contradiction. therefore, every word of length Xmath1 appears at a modulo xmath2 position. now, we will use the algorithm to calculate one Xmath17-shift de bruijn sequence of order at xmath199. And to start with, @ xmath225, since @ xmath224 does not appear at a modulo xmath17 position, we add to it the word : xmath225 , xmath225, xmath225, and finally we obtain the word : xmath225 , xmath225, xmath225 , then we insert : xmath225 , xmath225 , xmath225, , xmath225, , xmath225, , , Xmath225, " in the free word, which we call 'the frobenius problem'. ' The second word,' 'the left word,' which is indicated by 'the right word', which is indicated by 'the right word'. " If all words in 'xmath229 are either 'xmath2' or 'xmath1', 'xmath234', 'the upper limit' is a fixed one: the length of the longest word that can't be written as 'combined' with words in 'xmath233 is less than 'xmath235', and 'xmath235' is a fixed one, and is 'declared'. For example, 'Xmath243' is a set of words that are 'two-words',' that is to say, 'seconds', such that 'seconds' are of a length less than 'xmath243'. For example, 'the sets of words in 'xmath243' are 'two-words', and are not, therefore, short. " To construct 'xmath237' to reach the upper bound, we first choose an annotary for 'xmath38' - shift de bruijn sequence of order,' as @xmath247. . . . xmath259 . . . xmath261 . . . xmath263 . . . xmath264 . . . . we showed the total number of distinct words, of order @ xmath1 . . . if each word of length @ xmath1 appears exactly once in a modulo @ xmath1 position.
