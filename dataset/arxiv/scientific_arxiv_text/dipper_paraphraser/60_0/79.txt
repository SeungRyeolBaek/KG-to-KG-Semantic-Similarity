The presence of a surfactant film at a fluid-to-water interface alters the dynamics of the interface, and this is manifested in the behavior of the interfacial waves, which are induced externally or by thermal fluctuations. Moreover, the presence of a liquid crystal as a fluid complicates the problem of analyzing the interfacial properties, for the following reasons: a liquid crystal as the main fluid complicates the task of studying the interfacial properties by investigating the interfacial properties; and a variety of systems have been investigated with this method (e.g. refs @ xcite; also the review by cicuta and hopkinson@ xcite) , the dispersion of light at such surfaces is a powerful tool for studying the properties of the saline-film at fluid interfaces, and a number of systems have been recently investigated with this method (e.g. refs@ xcite; see also the review by cicuta and hopkinson@ xcite) , this dispersion of light on the surface-waves is a powerful tool for examining the properties of saline-films at fluid interfaces, and a variety of systems have been investigated in this way (e.g. refs @ xcite, see also the review by cicuta and hopkinson @ xcite). Recently, a promising new direction for the sensing of chemicals and biologicals has been introduced, which utilizes the properties of surfactant films assembled on the interface between water and a nematic liquid crystal. The first explanation is that the amount of analyte in water is not changed, but only the strength of the bond is changed. As a result, the mechanical stability and elasticity of the surfactant has been calculated and compared. However, this result is in a change of the elastic and viscous properties of the interface. For example, if a small amount of analyte is present in the water, it may be adsorbed at the surfactant layer, provided that the molecules have the appropriate chemical properties , the adsorption only changes the position of the elastic and viscous properties of the interface. The theoretical description of the wave-structure of interfaces between nematic and isotropic liquids was formulated in the 1970s. The study of the wave-structure of the interfaces between the two liquids, isotropic and isotropic, demonstrates that the wave-structure is more complex than in the isotropic, and allows the investigation of the wave-structure of nematic interfaces by surface waves. It is presented in this paper that the theoretical description of the wave-structure of nematic fluids in nematic liquids was carried out in the 1970s, and the results showed that the wave-structure of surface waves was more complicated than in the isotropic, and a technique of surface scattering was used to determine the properties of the nematic interfaces. The paper then presents the case of the insoluble surfactant film, which is in its most symmetric phase (i.e., isotropic two-dimensional fluid) , we assume the case of the naive fluid, which is insoluble, i.e., the adsorption will only alter This section will contain a model of the nematic-isotropic interface between a liquid and a nematic crystal. The general form of the dispersion relation is described in the appendix . in the present paper we assume that the film is in the most symmetric phase (isotropic two-dimensional fluid) . although the symmetry of the film should disintegrate in presence of the adjacent liquid-crystalline bulk, the film remains isotropic. The nematic-isotropic interface is an example of the hydrodynamic description of isotropic liquids and nematic liquid crystals . the studied systems are far enough from any phase transitions both in the film and in the nematic phase. we include optional external magnetic field in our analysis and restrict our analysis to the direction of the magnetic field that does not change the equilibrium orientation of the nematic director. This is the most straightforward of all the analyses, and at the same time one of the most important for the biosensors where the direct change in the anchoring angle can not always be observed. Moreover, the system is far enough from any phase transitions in the nematic phase and in the nematic phase. In the present study we assume that the film is in the most symmetric phase (isotropic two-dimensional fluid) , but the symmetry of the film may be broken by the adjacent liquid-crystalline phase, but the film remains isotropic. In the present article we describe the major equations relating to the equilibrium of forces (eq.) and the action of torques (eq.) in the interface. This is precisely the way the network is arranged, so that the inertial interface is at a point @ xmath1 and half of the space @ xmath2 is filled by the isotropic liquid. The central equations in the present article are the equations for the balance of forces (eq.) and the torques (eq.) at the interface. The abstract form of these equations is dependent upon the chosen macroscopic model, and the rest of this section is dedicated to the formulation of the model in the present paper. Here the line of equations is a comparison of the forces of the interfacial force and the bulk strain; here the interfacial force balances, the interfacial force equals the interfacial strain, here the interfacial pressure, here the interfacial strain, here the interfacial pressure, and here the isotropic pressure, the interfacial pressure, here the subscript xmath8 indicates that the bulk strains of the isotropic liquid, Xmath9, and in the nematic liquid, Xmath10, are compared with the nematic liquid. “Equation (eq) ,—eq (eq) ) is expanded in the remainder of this section. We use the equilibrium model proposed by rey, whose equations are given in this part. The equations for the surface stress tensor, @xmath5, and the surface torque tensor, @xmath13 are provided. Here, we assume the equations for the surface stress tensor, @xmath5, and the torque tensor, @xmath13, are summed up. We then derive the differential differential, @xmath23, which @xmath24 is the interfacial tension, @xmath25 is the tangential component of the capillary vector (@xmath26 is the surface projector), and @xmath27 is the bending moment tensor. In the present paper, rey based on the formula of the frictional free energy per unit mass, @xmath20, in the form of a form @xmath20, where @xmath20 is the surface mass density, @xmath22 is the second fundamental tensor of the interface (see Appendix: Geometry) . It is generally stated that the presence of the film at the interface complicates the formation of the entropy by the additional degrees of freedom of the surfactant and by the anisotropy of the adjacent nematic liquid. But if the surfactant is in its isotropic liquid phase and favors homeotropic attachment of the nematic liquid, the anisotropic coefficients of the entropy form the hydrodynamic equations of a higher order than linear, and therefore it can be neglected in the linearization of the system. This is what we shall do, in our model, and in our entropy production we shall use the form of the viscous contribution to the surface strain tensor which is given by rey_____, which is given by rey_______, where @ xmath53 is the surface jaumann (corrotational) derivative @ xcite of the tangential component of the director, and @ xmath55 is the total time derivatives of the components @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 of the nematic director field , tangential and normal to the surface correspondingly. However, if the film is in its isotropic liquid phase and favors a homeotropic tethering of the nematic liquid, the anisotropic terms in the entropy production add corrections to the hydrodynamic equations of higher order than linear, and therefore can be neglected in the linearization process. - we will be limited to the expression for the tangential rotational viscosity: - to calculate the tangential tension at the interfacial level (eq. ( def- tau) ) , the tangential component of the capillary vector at xmath69 (eq. ( def- xi) ), the tangential component of the capillary vector at xmath70 (eq. (def- xi) ) , the tangential component of the capillary vector at xmath70 (eq. (eq. (def-xi) ) , and the bending moment tensor @ xmath70 (eq. (def-m) ), and the bending moment tensor @ xmath70 (eq. (eq. (def-m) ) , then we know the dependence of the surface free energy @ xmath19 on the orientation of the interface given by the unit normal vector @ xmath11, and on the curvature of the second fundamental tensor @ xmath22 , for small deviations of @ xmath11 and @ xmath22, we can add or subtract from the series . All that we need is the continuity equation for the concentration of surfactant. For insoluble surfactants, the continuity equation reads: '@ xmath73,' anchoring strength @ xmath79, bending rigidity @ xmath84, saddle-splay rigidity @ xmath85, spontaneous curvature @ xmath88, and surface viscosities @ xmath66, @ xmath92. The term ' xmath87' guarantees that the curvature energy of a flat interface ( @ xmath88, ... ) is zero . In a smooth surface, with surface velocity @ xmath46, as a time derivative of the small surface displacement @ xmath96, we obtain from the continuity equation eq. (eq: continuity) that this makes it possible to represent the material parameters of the interface as ' xmath99' , ' xmath100' , ' xmath103' , ' xmath105' , ' xmath106', which is , as ' xmath98'. - c) the magnetic field is - 116 - 122 - a lineal equation is given, in Xmath 115 - a permeability of the isotropic liquid, in a permeability of the nematic liquid, in a permeability of the uniaxial nematic liquid, in a permeability of -121 - -123 - a difference of the longitudinal and transverse permeabilities of the nematic liquid: - - xmath 120 - a difference of the longitudinal and transverse permeability of the nematic liquid: - -121 , ignoring magnetization of the interface, the boundary conditions read - -115 - - here the magnetization of the isotropic liquid is - -117, where -118 is the magnetic permeability of the isotropic liquid, the magnetization of the nematic liquid crystal is - xcite - , where -119 is the difference of longitudinal and transverse magnetic permeability of the nematic liquid: -121 the tensor - - 12 | xmath124 , -127 is the viscosity of the isotropic liquid, -127, -127 is the unit tensor, -130 [12] is the strain rate tensor.

As is usually the case with large waves, the dispersion energy is important. . . . in the opposite case of large waves, the dispersion energy becomes important. The following numerical solution uses the following normal values of the material parameters when it is not otherwise indicated. For typical values of xmath257 kg / m @ xmath258, xmath259 kg / m @ xmath259, xmath259j / m @ xmath260, xmath259j, the equation (eq : good - q) reads @ xmath263 - xmath264 - xmath265, which includes the range of wavevectors that are typically probed by surface light scattering experiments.

The equation xmn a dvert – eq dvert – is given in Figure – fig. The indefinite motion of a solid at greater than a datum is increased with greater than a datum. This is qualitatively similar to the case of the surface of a liquid in which it binds. The results of this figure [Fig. 63] suggest that the typical range of xmath234 investigated by surface light scattering experiments (at xmath295, at xmath296, at xmath265) is not well defined, and the solution of the dispersion equation (Fig. 63) must be used instead. Figure 63 is a solution of the dispersion law @ xmath293 for different surface modes, given by the solution of the dispersion relation (Fig. 63) in the presence of gravity at xmath297m / s @ xmath260 , in which a eq. is denoted the real (solid line) and imaginary ( dashed line) parts of @ xmath296, correspondingly. [The prime and the double prime denote the real (solid line) and imaginary ( dashed line) parts of @ xmath296, correspondingly. For the “open” part of the crystalline element, as the name implies, eq. “Qkappa” represents the wavelength close to the atomic scale, and the curvature energy can be left in the experimental light scattering experiment, as was mentioned above. The dispersion law for the forms governed by the relaxation of the nematic director in the radial direction due to the elongation of the nematic director at the interface, as proved by the numerical solution of the dispersion equation with the values of the parameters given above, is well described by the equations (eq. omegan) and (eq. omegas) . The dependence of the real (solid) and imaginary ( dashed) parts of the frequency of xmath152 of the mode 3 (as shown in figure [fig.] no gravity ) part of the frequency of xmath152 of the mode 3 (as defined by figure [fig.] no gravity ) part of the frequency of xmath152 of the mode 3 (as defined by Figure [fig.] no gravity) , normalized by xmath304 (see eq. [eq.] omegan] , on the anchoring strength @ xmath305, calculated at xmath306 @ xmath265 in absence of gravity. At low @ xmath308 the dispersion of a capillary mode in a strong magnetic field is different from the law ([eq] omegac], and is given by @ xmath309 (see eq. [eq] hstar) , the frequency of this mode becomes sensitive to the parameters of the material that anchors it, because the nematic director tends to be oriented in the direction of the field rather than on the nematic liquid. We have calculated the frequency of the deposition of the surface waves of a surfactant-loaded nematic interface on the magnetic field, calculated at @ xmath308 @ xmath309 , 7math305 in the absence of gravity, the result of which is negligible. However, this effect is limited, because at a short wavelength extremely large magnetic field is required, and at long wavelengths gravity is dominating (eq. hstar) . In principle, magnetic fields can influence the surface waves through the changes of the properties of the interface (e.g. surface tension) of the surface by the magnetization of the material. The effects of magnetic field on surface waves are, in fact, small. (eq. qg. ) gravity is still limited by the power of the external magnetic field to the interface, and the influence of the magnetic field is only small if the direction of the magnetic field does not coincide with the equilibrium nematic director , in this case the dispersion law of the surface mode may be quantitatively different due to the anisotropy of viscous dissipation in the nematic director and the different anchoring energy.  i thank prof. c. m. care for fruitful discussion of the results, and prof. p . d . i fletcher for the discussion of nematic nematic interfaces – a candidate for a chemical or biological detection method.  i thank prof. c . m. care for fruitful discussion of the results, and for the discussion of nematic nematic interfaces in general, and for prof. p . d i . . i thank p . . care for fruitful discussion of the results, and to prof. p . d i . fletcher for the discussion of nematic nematic interfaces in general, as a potential method for determining the properties of nematic nematic interfaces and as a potential method for a chemical or biological sensing technique.
