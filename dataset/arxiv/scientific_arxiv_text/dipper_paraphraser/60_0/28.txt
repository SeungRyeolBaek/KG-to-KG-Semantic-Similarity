it is essential that rigorous detection algorithms are in place to maximize the number of detected gravitational waves. In particular, the detection of gravitational waves released during the inspiral and merger of a binary black hole (bbh) system is of particular interest. With the advance of ligo, the detection rate is expected to be no more than ten thousand per year. to circumvent this difficulty, ligo makes use of analytical waveform families like phenomenological models, or effective-one body models. the chosen ones are chosen to cover a certain part of mass-spinning parameter space and are placed in such a way that there is a minimal complication between any arbitrary point in the parameter space and the closest to the nearest template. Unfortunately, the application of this method requires many thousands of templates (e.g. @xcite) evaluated at arbitrary mass and spin; which cannot be achieved by the current numerical-relativistic waveforms. This waveform family is of the kind that describes bbh systems with various masses and of different msrs (i.e. the non-precessing bbhs) . it was constructed by combining a parameterized model of mass and spin with an effective equation. We apply svd to a template bank which is constructed from an analytical waveform family to construct an orthonormal basis over the waveforms, then we project the nr waveforms onto this basis and interpolate the coefficients to obtain arbitrary waveforms, thereby giving an approximation of another imr waveform not included in the original waveform bank. This paper is structured as follows: we begin in the section ‘Discussions’ where we provide definitions for the important terms used in our paper; then we compare our nr waveforms with the phenomb family and show that there is a mass-stacking bias between them. In addition, we have shown in the section ‘Discussions’ that if you project a template waveform to the orthonormal basis of the svd, you re-interpolate the projection coefficients to give an approximation of other imr waveforms which were not included in the original database. Here we show that this method improves the accuracy of the original analytical waveform family. We apply the svd to a template bank, constructed from an analytical waveform family, to construct an orthonormal basis of the waveforms, then project the nr waveforms onto this basis and interpolate the projection coefficients to allow arbitrary waveforms to be built up, thus obtaining a new waveform approximant. This paper is divided into sections: we begin in Section : Method ; we describe the svd accuracy booster. That is why we shall describe, in the remainder of this paper, the whitened waves, dropping the subscript  w . for the purposes of this study, we shall take @xmath11 to be the first ligo noise curve. Using the advanced ligo noise curve will only complicate our approach by making waveforms longer in the low frequency domain. This is accomplished by means of @xmath10, where @xmath11 is the ligo noise curve and @xmath12 is the fourier transform of . note that @xmath11 is the basic complex inner product of @xmath12 . The whitened time domain waveform is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of . . . to measure the degree of agreement between two waveforms, @xmath4 and @xmath14, we will take the time-maximizing overlapping, @xmath17, where - @xmath17 is the complex conjugate of - @xmath14 . in the second place, we use the spectral einstein code spec. For this we use the 15 orbit equal-to-mass (mass-ratio @ xmath 28) and zero-to-switch (effective spin @ xmath 28) , which is described in the Spectral Spectral section (see also fig. 9 of Spectral Spectral Spectra). For the above-mentioned examples, we use the taylort3 post-Newtonian (pn) waveform, described in the Spectral Spectra at frequencies of @ xmath 30 and @ xmath 31 for the relative mass ratios @ xmath32 and @ xmath33, respectively. these taylort3 and taylort4 waves are derived from the same set of sub-nave pnnnri of the equations. Here, however, the error-coulding of the pnnri is greater than the error-coulding at the ratios of @ xcite. For higher mass ratios the pnnnri is a greater error due to the pre-newtonian waveform @ xcite. ‘let’s begin with the phenomb waves, and so let’s investigate how well they can be used to simulate phenombs. For that we take the notation  xmath45 and  xmath46, and they represent total phenombs and phenombs, respectively. For this purpose we use the notation  xmath46 for nr and phenomb waves, whose sum is equal to xmath44. The result of this calculation is shown by the solid line in the bottom panel of Figure   bias. the mismatch in nr and phenomb waves is reduced by a mass-biased method, that is, search for the mass xmath52, of which the mismatch xmath55 is the minimum, and this procedure is shown by the solid line in Figure   biased method. For this purpose we are using the notation _xmath45 and _xmath46 in order to represent total mass xmath44. It seems that phenomb waves are continually underestimating the mass of the nr waves, at least in the region of the parameter space which is considered. The first step is to construct a phenomb bank, based on equal-mass and zero-mass, and we define a phenomb bank with @xmath67 phenomb waveforms, with @xmath69 — the source and destination of @xmath72, and adjacent templates satisfying the relation — @xmath71, where @xmath72 is the required excess of templates, and @xmath73 is an accepted tolerance for this value. This svd of phenomb waveforms, an orthonormal basis for the construction of the bank, will be of advantage, since we consider the svd of the bank as a basis for the construction of the waveforms, to which it is directed. We do not understand how this difference will be resolved. First, we will create a template bank of phenomb waveforms, with particular attention to equal-mass, zero-mass-pitch curves. A second step is to construct a template bank of phenomb waveforms, which is formed with a phenomb svd, with the object of @xmath67, and comprising a list of the phenombs labelled @xmath68 (@xmath69) and adjacent svds, satisfying the relation: @xmath71, where @xmath72 is the desired overlap between svds, and @xmath73 is a tolerance of this value. Using the formulae in xcite, one obtained a more than a dozen templates with a low mass. The higher mass was chosen in order to obtain a reasonably large template bank, containing xmath82; putting the lower mass down to xmath50, one obtained more than a dozen templates with a high frequency. Hence the next step is to transform the template bank into an orthonormal basis, namely the xmath73 and xmath72, where xmath87 and xmath90 are orthogonal matrices, and xmath90 is a diagonal matrix whose non-zero elements along the main diagonal are called singular values. The svd for xmath77 is uniquely defined when the singular values are arranged in descending order along the main diagonal of xmath91. For instance, suppose we want to limit the basis to the first xmath94 xmath95 xmath92 xmath94 xmath93 xmath94 xmath93 xmath94 xmath94 xmath94 , the xmath94 xmath94 is stored in the xmath94 xmath94 xmath94 xmath94 , the xmath94 xmath94 , which has the singular value xmath95 taken from the xmath95 xmath95 element along the main diagonal of xmath91 . That is, the antiquity of the index to the right of the axis of the pyramid is defined in “Galem” (so that the numbers of base-waveforms and base-waveforms can be counted in a fraction of the size of the sheet, and therefore we must examine its accuracy in the following way. If we consider the accuracy of the card, it is necessary, for example, to count the number of basis-waveforms in our fiducial template-bank. (The solution is given in the figure [Galem], and it is easily shown that the mismatch between the card and its projection can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the projection: it is estimated continuously over time and discretely over time in integer multiples of xmath25 . so that the card, if it is quite reasonable, it will be well represented by the reduced basis. If we want to estimate the accuracy of the card, then we have to measure the mismatch explicitly. In figure [Galem] we compare the expected mismatch with the actual mismatch of the card in the card. a general waveform, @ xmath109, can be represented by the reduced basis in this case. since nr and phenomb are not equivalent, it can not be used to calculate the mismatch obtained when projecting nr waves on the reduced basis. Moreover, we are of course more interested in how well nr waveforms can be represented by the reduced basis of the card. Therefore, we have to identify the mismatch explicitly. the resolution of the xmath115 panel is free and we have a strict tolerance of xmath115; when this tolerance is increased we observe the following: (i) phenomb representation mismatch generally follows xmath117; (ii) phenomb representation mismatch follows xmath117 at first, and then (iii) nr representation mismatch follows xmath117 at first and then - diminishes to a minimum as the representation tolerance is gradually reduced. the proportion of nr representation mismatch in the reduced basis is less than xmath35, over most of the skew threshold. This is apparent from the thin dashed line that indicates the mismatch of nr representations between the discrete templates; this line varies smoothly along the incipient mass range and has no particular features at the template locations. This is in contrast to the thin solid line that indicates nr representation mismatch evaluated between templates; this line varies smoothly over the measured mass range and has no special features at the location of the template. Moreover, if this tolerance is increased, the following pattern is observed: i) The phenomb representation mismatch generally follows xmath117; iii) The representation mismatch gradually saturates as the representation tolerance is continually reduced. this pattern is illustrated in figure [figure]: nr and phenomb representation mismatch averaged over the mass boundary of the template bank evaluated both at the centre and between the two centres. This strategy is to sample the projection coefficients of nr waveforms rolled up onto the reduced basis. here, we test it with the fiducial template bank and the reduced basis as an example. We consider that the projection coefficients of nr waveforms vary on the same scale as the waveforms themselves. That is, the space to sample along is the space of constant waveform overlap. We define this space as the space of constant waveform overlap whose masses are mapped in a form: xmath123, moving a distance in this space is the same as a distance equal to the overlap of two or three templates. We observe this pattern in figure ; p. 123 ; a further trend is that the waveforms of higher orders are increasingly complex (i.e. they have less structure) , that is, they are more complex, and therefore they have less structure. this is evidenced by the continuous decline in amplitudes of the waveforms. Hence a suitable space to be sampled is the space of constant overlap of the waveforms. In this space we see the real and imaginary components, @ xmath125 and @ xmath126, of the complex waveforms, oscillatory functions, roughly proportioned to a single frequency . , to arrive at the hexagrams, one should have taken the eigenvalue at the squatted (so-called collocation points of the Gauss) lattice-like chebyshev nodes at xcite @ xmath133 for xmath134. To this the new waveforms are computed numerically by means of the equation @ xmath140,   bf u  k  k ,  k,  k., - in general the interpolation will not be exact, and the remaining residual, @ xmath136, will be introduced: here @ xmath137 is the coefficient of @ xmath45 projected on the basis waveform of @ xmath94, @ xmath138, and @ xmath139 is the coefficient obtained after interpolation. to calculate the impact of the various approximations on the hexagram, we calculate the square of the interpolation, at xmath146, where we have dropped the explicit mass, which is of an amount @ xmath146, where we have omitted the explicit mass. In our new waveforms, we aim to have a non-interpolation error that is negligible compared with the representation error. We therefore see three contributing factors to the total mismatch: (i) the interpolation error, (ii) the mismatch of the discarded waveforms of the reduced basis, (iii) the failure of the svd basis to represent the nr waveform, (iii) the failure of the svd basis to represent the nr waveform, @ xmath155. But in the interest of simplicity we add the last term to the table:   le First, interpolation becomes more difficult for higher-order modes, for they are of more complexity. This is offset by the fact that higher-order modes are less important for representing waves, as shown by their greater amplitudes. And although lower-order modes are much smoother, and thus easier to interpolate, their amplitudes are much larger, meaning that the interpolation errors increase with respect to higher-order modes. In this way we have the basis of a complete phenomenology, which we can summarize by the following formulae: u  n   prime  mu      mu    mu                                                                                                      [3] . I make use of the techniques of the Expression-former to compute the Isometric Saturation. This is an extension of the work already done by the Expression-former for the two-dimensional Description of “Heat-Rating”, a more complex Class of Experimental Matrices, which, through the algebraic expression of the Algorithms, is added, for which I am asking you, to compute the Interpolation Constraints. A method of this kind, for example, is to place template cells hexagonally on the Manifold Xcite, so that the content of Xcite is stored with the Extent of XML, for if you want a double Precision. This method is applied in order to get the polynomial-functions of nr Interpolation of the Elastic Frameworks out of a two-dimensional Template Bank containing different Masses, which is, according to the rate of the Difference between the Masses, and the Masses with an Equivalence of 1 to 6 and the total masses with an Equivalence of XML, a of xML, and a Mass-Ratio . Using this method, the Sum of Separation is obtained, so that the Minimum and the Maximization are equal, if double precision is desired. After preparing the Matrix, Matrix is placed in the Rows of a Matrix, with real and imaginary Components, in the Same alternating fashion, so that the Whitened Waveforms are arranged in such a way that their Peak amplitudes are aligned, and the Matrixes are sampled for a total time of @ xmath At xmath176, the complex phase of the first mode is subtracted from all the other modes. Xmath176, as before, has the same operation, but the second mode, namely  eq: smooth  eq: musy  .  eq : smooth  eq  musy   eq : musy  ., for conventional waveform families, the whole complex phase is not relevant and therefore, there is little attention to how it changes with the parameters xmath177. Nevertheless, if one has chosen a structure xmath177 with a fine structure , this structure will be inherited by the projection coefficients xmath180. in the leftmost panels of figure [the figures: coeff2d] we plot the real part of the smoothed coefficients xmath184 for phenomb waveforms projected on the basis modes xmath185 and xmath186 . whereas in the middle panels we are compared with the nr waveforms evaluated at the set of mass ratios xmath . if the projection coefficients in figure [figure 1] are sinusoidal, they must be sampled with at least the Nyquist frequency along the y-axis. in order to get a reasonable interpolation from these projection coefficients, the present data must be included in the total number of mass ratios. the population of mass ratios has the same generality as before: low-order modes have the smoothest structure, while high-order modes have the complexity of increasing complexity. We have shown that svd can be used to increase the representation of nr waveforms from a phenomb matrix. a suitable method would be to double the number of mass ratios in the family, to include @xmath167 = A special auxiliary technique was used to simulate the coefficients of the nr waves projected on the phenomb basis. There was only a small error introduced by this method, and the new waveforms provided a more faithful representation of the nr signal compared to the original phenomb model. we therefore began to investigate the possibility of extending this method to phenomb-compatible bankers. We thank ilana macdonald for preparing the hybrid waveforms in which this study was conducted. We thank kc, jde and hpp for the support of the national science and engineering research council, the canada research chairs program, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, and industry Canada and the province of Ontario through the ministry of economic development and innovation. This is a technique that is currently not feasible, because the number of mass-ratios covered by the nr simulations are unable to sample the coefficients of the projections with the Nyquist frequency.
