At the start of the debate - burris and lawrence - he investigates the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite groups and rings. he asks whether or not two group expressions (i.e. products of variables and elements of xmath0) can get the same value from some substitution of xmath0 , that is, if xmath0 is solvable, and if not - complete - otherwise. The equivalence problem over finite groups and rings asks whether two group expressions (i.e. products of variables and elements of xmath0) can get the same value from some substitution over xmath0 . In this paper we investigate the complexity of the equivalence problem over finite groups and rings. The first investigation by burris and lawrence of equivalence in finite groups proved the complexity of equivalence. - if a group is nilpotent or - xmath4 - the dihedral group for odd times - then the equivalence problem for xmath0 is of polynomial time. The simplest of the smallest groups, for which this complexity is not known, are @xmath14, @xmath15, and an orderly orderly group, @xmath16. Note that all results for both the equivalence and the equation solvability problem for a group of solvable, not nilpotent groups are about the group of @xmath24, where @xmath24 is a form of a special subset of the upper triangular matrices over @xmath27. Goldmann and Ruel in their study of the solvability of @xmath16 showed that if @xmath0 was nilpotent, then the equation solvability problem of @xmath0 was solvable in polynomial time for certain groups, @xmath24, where @xmath24 is abelian. Note that all results for the equivalence and the equation solvability problem of solvable, not nilpotent groups are about groups @xmath24, where @xmath24 is abelian. horvth asserts in (*? ? ? ] problem 4 , that the complexity of the equation solvability and equation solvability problems for this group is of the group of @xmath24, where @xmath24 is the isomorphic group of the upper triangular matrices over @xmath28. At xmath17, the equivalence problem is at xmath30 an equivalence problem. The equivalence problem on a finite ring is a semipattern group, and theorem [Fotetel] satisfies horvth's equivalence problem is at xmath17 an equivalence problem. Moreover, we extend the proof of theorem [Fotetel] to the equivalence problem of semipattern groups. As a result of the proof of theorem [Fotetel], the equivalence problem of a semipattern group is solvable in polynomial time. As a result, we evaluate some results over xmath30. The problem of theorem [Fotetel] is solved in polynomial time, that is, in polynomial time. We study the equivalence problem for finite rings, and later burris and lawrence generalize their results to non-commutative rings, they prove that the equivalence problem for @ xmath31 is solvable in polynomial time if it is nilpotent, and it is conscientious otherwise. Therefore, we give the known results for rings. sent> and vrtesi proved the conp-complete part of the conjecture in xcite ; the polynomial part is completely proved in the manuscript xcite ; he defines a number xmath32 that depends only on the ring xmath31 , then he proves that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting xmath33 into all but xmath32 - many variables , thus it can be decided whether xmath34 is solvable over xmath31 in xcite , otherwise . horvth , lawrence and willard @xcite prove that if this factor is commutative, then the sigma equation solvability problem is np-complete . horvth proves that the solvability problem is np-complete in the manuscript @xcite . - he defines a number @xmath32, that depends only on the ring @xmath31 . so he proves that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting @xmath33 into all but @xmath32 - many variables . thus one can decide whether or not @xmath32 is solvable in the manuscript @xcite . In the section, "Bev" we summarize the notations, the definitions and theorems that we use in our paper, in particular, in spcs we review the definition of pattern groups, then we define semipattern groups . we will explain this proof in Section 2 (b) where we prove theorems fotetel and nr . In section [c] we discuss the generalization of the equation solvability problem over ring-shaped matrices , in particular, we prove that, for a non-zero ring, @ xmath31 we can decide at once whether or not - in this way we are able to answer the problem of 3 in xcite . we mention that krolyi and szab also discovered a way to decrease the exponent @ xmath32 in xcite . Let the identity matrix of @ xmath42 be called by @ xmath42 , let the identity matrix denoted by @ xmath44 . Let the identity matrix denoted by @ xmath44 , let the identity matrix denoted by @ xmath44, let the matrix of @ xmath41 be characterized by the absence of any elements, except for the @ xmath46 : here the group operation is matrix multiplication. Xmath53 - let Xmath54 - let Xmath55 be the set of matrices over xmath39 over xmath39 whose @ xmath47 element in the diagonal is from @ xmath57 - @ xmath57 - let xmath58 be a subset of xmath48 - then we call xmath54 a semipattern group and we call it by xmath60 - then, let xmath48 - be a commutative unit, let xmath65, let xmath66, let xmath66 be subsets of xmath64, we say that - xmath72 is solvable for substitutions from xmath73 ( and write - xmath74 - xmath75 is solvable over xmath31 ) let xmath48 - if xmath50 is a pattern group, then xmath59 is a subgroup of xmath41 . the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite nilpotent rings is known. horvth proved the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time. So in this section we show that we can characterize the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite nilpotent rings by using the sigma equation solvability problem over special nilpotent rings. We show that math84 is more efficient than math84, where the height of the tower is math84. So he proved that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting math92 to all but math84 math84 math84 math84 math84 math84 . math84 then math86 is smaller than math84, where the height of the tower is math84 , math90 , math92, math90, math92, math92 [91] , math84; math86 in math85 time . Then the modulus will be computed over the modulus of the modulus, namely the modulus of the modulus of the modulus, namely the modulus of the modulus of the modulus of the modulus of the modulus. [*] Let math31 be a modulus of the modulus of math99, and let math99 be a modulus of the modulus of the modulus of math99, and math101 be an independent activation group consisting of math99 delegated generators. [*] let math100 be a modulus of the modulus of math104, and math95 be any modulus of math104 whose factor is math106 . Thus if math109 is modulus of math107, then math109 is modulus of math105 if and only if math108 is modulus of math107. Now let math109 be modulus of math105 if and only if math105 is modulus of math105 . . . and so if math109 is modulus of math105 then math109 is modulus of math105 . - Let n be a natural number - here - we can describe the multiplication of matrices from xmath41 in Lemma - mxszor - we can use this formula - let n be a natural number - let n be a natural number - we can express this element - mxszor - a ten-fold the multiplication of matrices from xmath41 in the form of Lemma - we can handle such matrix rings as we do with the nilpotent matrix rings - we can handle this matrix rings as well as the nilpotent matrix rings - and we can handle such matrix rings like the semma-pattern groups - - and this section, in the form of the ten-fold problem - we consider the solvability of a matrix over xmath87, where every entry on the main diagonal of each matrix is a multiple of xmath103 - so, in our mathematical language, we have the formula. Let n be a natural number. We shall calculate the ten-fold problem over the ten-fold problem in the form of the lemma, " mxszor" - and this is a formula in our mathematical language . The enumeration of the whole thing is only to a greater extent in the lemma. So we shall consider the index of a term (at xmath117) or at xmath118 . We shall add to this index the index of the column of the subsequent term, (in the figure the index of the column of a term is a close (that is, the indices of the first term are xmath135; the indices of the last term are xmath136; and the indices of each term are xmath135; the indices of each term are equal to xmath150; and the indices of each term are at most a recursive number. For every term of the form xmath133 that is above the diagonal, we have xmath138; so the indices of the first term are xmath135; the indices of the last term are xmath136; the index of every term equals the index of the next term; the index of a term is at most the index of the next term . . . and therefore the formula is proved. Now, let two consecutive terms of the product be xmath140 and xmath141 (again, xmath142 and xmath143), between the two terms the products have a row and a column index of xmath144, and the last index is a more than xmath145, and less than xmath146. Hence, between xmath140 and xmath141, only the product xmath147 is the product xmath147. Let @ xmath148 be a polynomial over @ xmath148. Let @ xmath148 be a polynomial over @ xmath148. Let @ xmath151 be a polynomial over @ xmath150. Let @ xmath150 be a polynomial over @ xmath150. Thus, if @ xmath150 is a variable, then @ xmath160 is a variable, which we can substitute from @ xmath56, and @ xmath165 is a variable that we can substitute from @ xmath150. Besides, if @ xmath150 is a variable, then @ xmath165 is a variable, which we can substitute from @ xmath150, and @ xmath160 is a variable that we can substitute from @ xmath150 . so @ xmath178 is solvable over @ xmath126 if and only if the system of equations @ xmath179 is solvable over @ xmath150 . â€œTake the first xmath195 which is the sum of the monomials on xmath101. First, let xmath195 be a polynomial, given as a sum of the monomials on xmath101. It is the sum of the monomials that we multiply from the sum of the xmath105. The number of equations is @ xmath105, which is not dependent on xmath125, but only on the group of xmath60. xmath184 would be a circle of matrices on xmath104, where each entry on the main diagonal of each matrix in xmath104 is a multiple of xmath103. and if xmath185 denotes a monomial, then xmath185 would denote a monomial in the sum. For each monomial, we multiply one term from each matrix Xmath158 Xmath196 , so that the length of every monomial is @ xmath125. However, every nonzero monomial contains at least xmath197 terms on or below the main diagonal, for the characteristic of xmath198 is the characteristic of xmath198. To the same effect, to the same extent as xmath208, we can decide the solvability of the system of equations in polynomial time by the method of theorem [er] . So the length of each nonzero monomial is at most @xmath208. let @xmath214 be the sum of at most @xmath212, for every @xmath216. the input polynomial @xmath171 is the sum of at most @xmath212 (and thus @xmath200). Then @xmath217 is solvable over @xmath104, if and only if the system of equations @xmath221 is solvable over @xmath101. so @xmath220 can be solved over @xmath104, if and only if the system of equations @xmath221 is solvable over @xmath101. The number of equations is @xmath226, which does not depend on @xmath212, only on the ring @ xmath104. thus @xmath220 can be solved over @xmath104 if and only if the system of equations @xmath223 is solvable over @xmath101 . - There, you can find the Polynomial of the ninth form of Xmath103 corresponding to Xmath95 . - if, however, Xmath95 is an arbitrary polynomial of Xmath31, then after rewriting it to a sum of monomials, you can find Xmath243, adding an extra Xmath243 factor to the exponent. Thus, you can decide if Xmath235 is solvable over Xmath236 in Xmath238 . - so, you can decide if Xmath235 is solvable over Xmath236 in Xmath238 . - mikael goldmann and alexander russell . - a ...
