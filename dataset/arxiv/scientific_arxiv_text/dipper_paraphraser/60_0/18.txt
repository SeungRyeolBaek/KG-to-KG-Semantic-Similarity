In this paper we introduce a novel method for calculating the primordial non-gaussianity produced by super-horizon evolution in two-field models of inflation. Our method takes the real space distribution of the inflationary field, measured on a flat surface, and is a probability density function, in which the speed of the elastic contraction is expressed as a form of the collisionless boltzmann equation. Using the cumulant representation of the hypersurface to expand our density function around an exact gaussian, we derive ordinary differential equations, which evolve the moments of this distribution, and we show how these moments are related to inobservable quantities, such as the dimensionless bispectral, as measured by @xmath1 @xcite . in the future, as more observational data become available, it will be necessary to know the non-gaussian signal that will be expected in a wide variety of models and to orient ourselves on the results which can be expected from this non-gaussian signal. Having formulated this new method, we argue that it is particularly suitable to study the contributions of the superhorizon to @xmath1 , since it is directly connected to the moments of the inflaton distribution, so that it is possible to identify significant contributions to the deformedness or other moments . This difference could be difficult or impossible to observe in the context of other mathematical methods, such as the conventional xmath0 formalism. In this study we have applied our methods numerically to prove the evolution of moments in certain models. It would be difficult or impossible to draw this distinction in the context of other mathematical methods, such as the xmath0 formalism. the numerical xmath0 formalism requires the solution of a number of differential equations, which scales at most polynomial (or, perhaps, linear) intervals with the number of fields. For some models there are hundreds of fields, this may be a major obstacle, xcite . a second advantage of our method lies in the computational cost of numerical implementation. Our method combines analytic formulas for xmath1 and xmath2 to determine the evolution of moments in specific models. The numerical xmath0 approach is based on a numerical integration, which is based on a low-noise operation, for finite differences must be extracted between perturbatively different initial conditions after xmath3 e–fades of evolution . so the background equations must be solved to a great accuracy, for every small error has considerable chances of propagating. a third advantage, which we hope to return to in a future publication, is that it yields explicit evolutionary equations with sources. In a general circulation model of the inflaton field, our msfxin 2a subrange functions, in a single field, we have a general circulation of one x msfxn and a certain reduced plank mass 5b are given. in a general circulation model, in a stationary hypersurface, we have our expression for msfxin  2a m. in a spatially flat hypersurface, expressions for the decomposition of the number of e-flairs, and in a corresponding function of the field values on the surface, are obtained. In the final section, we give the empirical definition of msfxin  2212. In this section, we introduce our new method for calculating the non-gaussian parameter 1111. It requires three main ingredients: a formula for the curvature perturbation 222 in terms of the field values on a flat hypersurface; expressions for the derivatives of the number of foldings 67, as a function of the field values 226; a prescription for the elongation of the field distribution from the horizon exit to the time when we require the statistical properties of 2221. . The first two ingredients are given in eqs . You will see that we have used the gradient method, which, in its perturbative form, has been employed by lehners & renaux-petel in order to obtain numerical results. To this purpose, it has been put to our use, rigopoulos, shellard, van tent, xcite. - each volume follows a trajectory in the space of the horizon, which we label with its position @xmath7 in the last term, to be stated down below. The method is simple and well suited to analytical calculation. In this paper, the superscript "at xmath8" means to take account of the results. In any of the forms of observation we will aim to determine the statistics of the perturbation of the curvature, which the observer is measuring. forgetting spatial gradients, each volume will follow a trajectory in the field of the horizon that is slightly displaced from its neighbours. the difference between the paths is determined by initial conditions at the horizon exit, which are calculated by reducing the vacuum fluctuation to a classical perturbation. - In the first place, the order of the first volumes is given by the field of the main line, and in the second it is taken to be a precise series, whereas we say the analysis with the minimum length of the windings. In any of the formalisms discussed above, we aim to estimate the statistical properties of the curvature perturbation that would be measured by such an observer. The results of these realizations are different from the ensemble average, but they are of little interest, without which anthropic arguments might be involved. What properties do we need for a successful prediction? And although our calculation is formally perturbative, it is not directly equivalent to eq., in which case we shall refer to the npar» distinct universe.. It is for this reason that we shall discuss the relationship of our calculation to the conventional perturbation theory. in many cases, the curvature perturbation is synthesized by superhorizon physics, which reprocesses the gaussian fluctuations generated at the horizon exit. We have seen this condition in refs. It is the ‘local’ form of non-gaussianity that we call ‘local’. In short, our curve is so defined as ‘local’ and in no way functions on the basis of the spatial distributions. On a single field, only one non-gaussian change can be present, we call ‘xmath18’ . @ xmath19 can be well approximated by using @ xmath19, where @ xmath1 is independent of the spatial position. . . . in negative cases, convergence may be slow or not at all. . . . this possibility was discussed in refs. The parameter of xmath in xmath depends on the convention of xmath23. in the case of those defined by Xmath12, eq. a second way is to determine the coefficient of xmath22 by means of a bundle of adjacent paths, sampling the distribution of isocurvature modes. (In the case of one field more than one, xmath1 may vary in space, because it depends on the isocurvature modes.) In the case of xmath11, the expression for @xmath11 is a suffix which has the form of @xmath11, and a second suffix which is a descriptive form of @xmath11; in fourier space this is automatically imposed, once more leading to  . to proceed, we require estimates of the correlation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . where, for example, Maldacena as a starting point, and later lyth and rodrguez as a starting point, we adopt  as the definition of @xmath11; in that case, the coefficient @xmath11 is used to estimate the relative size of  by the hypersurface, at a fixed initial time. The number of  is the number of  – folds between this initial slice and a final, swaying hypersurface, where  – folds indicates the type of light scalar fields . . . " * We shall assume, however, that the distribution of field values on 'xmath' is known. In this, we will employ the formula of 'xmath', 'xmath', which is to be read only as 'the gauge transformation' between the 'xmath' and 'xmath'. however, this formula is so much more than a gauge transformation, for which we are unable to infer the numerical properties of 'xmath' only. Unfortunately, it also obscures the physics that determines 'xmath'; and therefore it is hard to infer from eq. alone those classes of models where 'xmath' is always large or small. ' xmath', for example, is a very similar term 'Xcite'. In the present section, we will only speculate on the formulation of 'xmath1' as long as we are convinced that the distribution of field values on 'xmath8' is known. in 'transport', we will provide the prescription for the further evolution of the distribution of field values between 'xmath8' and 'xmath8' . the role of the 'xmath0' formula, 'xmath', is to encode only the gauge transformation between the 'xmath36' and the 'xmath2' . so that one must thus permit for diagonal terms in the two-point of the two-point ... The coefficients are also defined by 1 and 2, and when written in numerical order, the indices of the indices of the indices of the indices of the symbols of  xmath4 are numerically arranged in numerical order. Then we decompose the coefficients of  xmath4 for generic initial and final times. To obtain the coefficients of  xmath4 in concrete models, we need expressions for the derivatives  xmath52 and  xmath34 . It is a function of time and scale. However, without any intrinsic four-point correlation, it follows that  xmath4 is now limited to two-field models, defined by fields math45 and  math46. Besides, in this case we ascribe to the three-point function  xmath4 both in form and in the form of eqs. The number of e-folds, @xmath6, between a flat hypersurface  @xmath8 and a comoving hypersurface  @xmath53 satisfies @xmath55, where @xmath55 and @xmath55 are the field values evaluated on  @ xmath8 and  @ xmath53 respectively. For a more general potential, it is useful to introduce a quantity  xmath61 which coincides with the conserved quantity of vernizzi & wands  xcite , that is, in a space-time hypersurface , which is infinitesimally separated from each other. This addition is because we assume, as a rule, that                                                        ,         ,  ,  , , , ,  , , , ,   , , , ,  ,, in a 2    it is possible to use the equations of As the expression 'Xmath60' is now defined, we find the expression 'Xmath70' which we find in addition to 'Xmath60', which can be obtained by comparing 'Xmath70' with the formulas of 'Fyxcite' which we have already defined 'Fyxcite'. We can obtain 'Xmath72', by comparing 'Xmath69' with the formulas of ref. 'Xcite', which were derived from the 'extended microscopical' theory. ' '    v      ,      , 12   v   , 2    sin  4  ta.   star  cos  2  ta    hspace   6mm    mbox                                           cos  2   sin  2  theta . . . and finally, as we arrive at the one-field situation, we will now return to the problem of the evolution between the horizon and the time of observation and to give an answer to the question of how the distribution of the field values between the two times is interpreted. Here we will return to the problem of evolution between the horizon and the time of observation and the prescription that connects the distribution of the field values at the two-field times. We will describe in detail the concept of the reduced bispectrum, a simplified bispectrum, which describes the third moment of xmath78. , in the language of probability this is called the skewness, which we denote at xcite. In this case we will use a procedure called a cumulant expansion. In our case, we seek a distribution with centroid xmath79 and variance xmath80. in this section we shall omit the superscript @ xmath8, denoting the evaluation of hypersurfaces. In our case, the resulting distribution is one with centroid xmath79 and variance xmath80; therefore, rather than seek a distribution with non-zero third moment, as we have described in ref. xcite, we shall introduce higher moments as corrections for the gaussian. In the language of probability, this is called skewness. In the theory of probability, skewness is zero, and inflation usually predicts that the skewness is small. In this way, the one-field system is a helpful example of the methods we will employ. (i.e.  d) or ‘ d . that is sometimes called the - probabilist convention.’ in these cases the density function referred to in d s is well known and has been used in many ways. It is a solution to the problem of estimating the value of a distribution of nearly gaussian origin, for which d s is usually small. In short, our main use of d s is to extract evolution equations for each moment. In this sense we will not be able to worry that d s may not be a accurate probability density function. We take the average of ds79, ds81, and ds42 as time-dependent, and so evolution of the probability density can be accommodated by finding evolution equations for these quantities. ds81 the moments ds79, ds81, and ds42 may be time dependent, and therefore evolution of the probability density in time can be accommodated by finding evolution equations for these quantities. The density function ds81 is well known and has been applied in many different situations. The example is presented in refs. [e] , for instance, it has been shown in the study of starobinsky ’s diffusion equation, which forms the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation – , it has been shown that the choice of the time variable in the equation is significant, and that different choices are required for the selection of a temporal scale. Thus, we do not assume that the velocity field is _universally_ well-defined by a quadratic Taylor expansion, but simply that it is well-defined near the instantaneous centroid – this is the fact that we extend the velocity field to second order, although this expansion might in principle be carried out to arbitrary orders – but the main problem is how the probability density evolves in time. We have chosen to use the e-folding time, @xmath6 , which means that we are changing the distribution of hypersurfaces of uniform expansion – we have chosen to expand the distribution of hypersurfaces of uniform expansion – the spatially flat hypersurfaces whose fields perturbed by fields disturbs the @xmath0 formulas described in . . . . in the principle, eq. can be solved directly – in principle, eq. can be solved directly – and in practice it is simpler to extract equations for the moments of xmath98, giving evolution equations for xmath79, xmath81, xmath42. Here, a hierarchy of equations – eq. can be understood as the limit of a chapman Kolmogorov process as the size of the hop is zero. I have an expression for the flux of the centroid, which is derived from the vector of the density function, and which is derived from the vector of the arithmetic. But if we take the example of the example he had given, then the tails of the density function were moving faster than the center, so the velocity of the centroid was larger than one might expect, since one had restricted attention to the arithmetic of arithmetic of arithmetic of arithmetic. Hence, in the case he had just given, the tails of the density function were moving faster than the core, so that one tail was shrinking and the other was sagging, so that the arithmetic of the centroid was larger than one might have expected, so that the mean fluctuation value was not in accordance with the axioms of motion. This is where the second term in is necessary. Generally speaking, when we consider the values of variance and skewness in our value of (x)math80 and skewness in our value of (x)math42, the first term on the right-hand side describes how the arithmetic of @ xmath81 and @ x42 scale as the density function expands or contracts as the velocity field increases or decreases. In this case, the upper limit is much greater than the upper limit. Hence, by expanding our pdf to the third moment, and our velocity field to quadratics, we increase our variance and skewness by adding the first term in to the equations. Thus, by increasing our pdf to the third moment, and reducing our velocity field to quadratics, these effects are measured by the the index xmath27 takes values in xmath113. while we consider it probable that our equations generalize to any number of fields, we have only explicitly constructed them for a two-field system. The two-field system is described by a two-dimensional velocity field, Xmath111, where again we are using the number of e-folds Xmath6 as the time variable. The index xmath117 defines the centre of the distribution and xmath119 describes the covariance between the fields. Having stated that, as will be clear later, certain steps of this construction apply to only two fields, and we make no claim at this time about examples of three or more fields. However, in the two-field case, we have obtained a probability distribution of almost gaussian proportions, but the non-zero skewness is minor. Here and in the following, we have returned to our convention that the equivalence of two species indices is summed. In this equation, at xmath120, the variances are defined by a correlation coefficient, xmath121, the matrix xmath81 is defined by two-point correlations of the fields, and at xmath123 all the skewnesses are encoded in xmath124 . “Next we must extract the moment hierarchy, which governs the evolution of math118, math140, math121 and math40 . in addition, we have math133 to which we refer to the non-gaussian factor, which encodes the skewnesses, to be math133 in these variables, we find math134, but math131 . our construction of math138 and math127, therefore, implies that math138 and math127 are one and the same for the two fields. The number of variables math138 and math133 correspond to the same place, and by definition, to the place of the numbers in eq. . we therefore construct math126 and math127, for which eq. a factor, as an equation, to be math133, we define the non-gaussian factor which encodes the skewnesses, to be math133 in these variables, we find math133, but math133. ; if we were to extend the velocity field in order to higher order, or we included higher terms in the moment expansion, we would obtain none – trivial higher-ranking coefficients. . . . but we can describe the function of these coefficients by the expressions in the eq. below, in the form of math148 and math148, respectively, of the degree of azmbh-ds, and of the degrees of azbh-ds, in which the basis of the motion of the centroid is given and its derivatives considered at the eq., . . . it is an expression which cannot be decomposed in components, but can be expressed in a very compact form. This is a useful feature of the velocity field and of the proportions to which it is appended. The decrease of the degree of azbh-ds in the moment division corresponds to the average velocity of the surroundings. Then, by defining the rank of each coefficient m146, we are to distinguish the coefficients with m147 in m147 and by m147 in m148. The first term describes the non-objectionable motion of the centroid, which coincides with the background velocity of m118. The second term describes how the wings of the probability distribution sample the velocity field at certain points. The matrix of numbers Xmath119 and Xmath159 are the extension and contraction of Xmath119 as it is driven by the velocity field . . . so the skew of xmath139 is the result of the correlation matrix. It is the first and second terms of the equations which describe the movements of the numbers Xmath110 as the velocity field moves and shears the xmath165 coordinate frame relative to the xmath137 coordinate frame, and the general spread of the probability distribution. In our case we use our method to investigate two simple mathematical models for which the non-gaussian signal has already been discovered, and in which the standard xmath0 formula is used. We will now investigate two cases, which already know the non-gaussian signal, by the standard xmath0 formula. Having chosen this order, we will be able to produce equations of two orders, first, the first terms in the equations, and then the leading corrections in the equations. We will measure this error in our method, and we will examine it numerically. We have chosen the initial conditions in ref. Xcite, where xmath167, and the linear trajectory has coordinates xmath168 and xmath169. We also apply the method of moment transport, which makes the results of the traditional equation xmath0 separate from the intrinsic non-gaussianity of the field and the non-linearity of the transformation of xmath2 to xmath3 . . . as we have explained in ref. , we denote the former xmath170 and the latter xmath171 and have mapped them separately in fig. . . . , for the final shape and magnitude are particularly sensitive to the relative phase. we have taken into account the increased potential of xmath166, namely, that the potential is xmath166. This model yields a very small, non-gaussian signal, below unity at the peaks. In the double quadratic model, xmath166 is always small. We have in this paper set out to propose a new method of predicting the observable signal. we have given some very significant examples of this non-linearity, as well as some examples that we have described in ref. Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show remarkable agreement between our new method and the result of the numerical @xmath0 formula. We conclude that the slow-roll estimate remains broadly accurate throughout the whole evolution. It is evident that the agreement is precise. In this model, @xmath1 is dominated by the contribution of the second-order gauge transformation, @xmath171, as shown in fig. . . [1] and [2] [3] [4] [5], but we do not claim that this is a general phenomenon. In the literature, the 'ancient' ' @xmath0' method, originally developed by lyth & rodrguez, remains the most suitable method for the analytical study of non-gaussianity. Secondly, the conventional method is best when it operates on the 'jpa', with an initial condition of xmath174, with an initial condition of xmath174, with an initial condition of xmath176 , it is evident that the agreement is unambiguous. For example, the present data already show interesting constraints on the sharpness of the skewness of the skewness parameter, and over the next several years we expect the 'planck' satellite to be very rigorous in these constraints. - is the expansion of the velocity field as given in eqs. - a contraction at every step of integration, so that the result is related to the conventional perturbative calculations in a very similar way to the renormalization group-improved perturbation theory - xcite . the complementaryness of the coefficients in xcite are revealed by the double-zero skewnesses at xcite. This property is shared with any formalism such as xcite which is non- perturbative in time evolution, but which may be an advantage over perturbative methods. in this interpretation the derivatives of xcite are enacted as couplings . in this interpretation derivatives of xcite are interpreted as couplings. The result of this interpretation is that the derivatives of xcite are used to enumerate the systems. Our numerical calculations confirm that our method gives a high agreement with existing methods. as a by-product of our analysis we note that the large non-gaussianities which recently have been observed in sums and product potentials of xcite are dominated by the non-gaussianity in the second-order part of the gauge transformation from xmath180 to xmath2 . The non-gaussianity produced in such cases comes from a distortion of the field, measured by the skewnesses @ xmath40. The mutual scatter of the different methods can be explained by the theory error inherent in any calculation of xmath.
