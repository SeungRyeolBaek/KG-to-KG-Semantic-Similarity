"Yesteryear, he was the first to develop the idea that, if inflation is possible, it is consistent with open spatial hypersurfaces (Gett 1982; Guth & Weinberg 1983), attention was then initially directed at models in which there were very large number of foldings during inflation, and that it is almost the exact flat spatial hypersurfaces for the observable part of the present universe (Gett 1982; Guth & Weinberg 1983) in order to calculate the shape of a cosmological constant - getty 1983; pi - think a cosmological constant - getty 1983; that is, from a large dimensionless parameter (Kazanas 1980; sato 1981a, b) it seems necessary to calculate a small dimensionless parameter for the clustered mass density (Gett, private communication 1994; banks et al. 1995) which would require explanations. In the simplest, flat-at-xmath18 model, we assume a primordial spectrum of the primordial energy spectrum, the primordial power spectrum of gaussian adiabatic energy and density perturbations. This spectrum is derived from quantum-mechanical fluctuations during the early period of inflation, in a spatially flat model, provided that the potential is reasonably flat (fschler, ratra, sneiho, et al.). The gaussian adiabatic open-air inflation model (rp94; kamionkowski et al. 1994; grski et al. 1995, hereafter gsb; liddle et al. 1996a, hereafter lrv; ratra et al. 1995; grsb) can also be made compatible with the observed physical perturbations in the sphere of inflation. The inflation theory alone is unable to predict the amplitude of the normalization amplitude of the energy-density convection induced by fluctuations in an epoch of inflation in an open bubble (ratra et al. 1994; grsb; kamionkowski et al. 1994; grski et al. 1995, grsb; liddle et al. 1996a, llrv; ratra et al. 1995; grsb) ; cayn et al. 1993; 1990, after Benett and Eng., 1993, that is, at the end of the second year of the tests of the (ratraet al. 1992), the dmr: dmr: this is the only parameter that is an empirical parameter, which is calculated by the quantum mechanics in the operation of an epoch of inflation (rp94; kamionkowski et al. 1994; grski et al. 1995, hereafter rp95; bucher et al. 1995, hereafter bgt; lyth & woszczyna 1995; yamamoto et al. 1995, yst): this parameter is Then in the early stage of inflation the open bubble, which has a symmetry, dissolves in a flat, tumbling spacetime (gott 1982, guth & weinberg 1983) , in this tumbling bubble, the nucleus arises and, for a small probability of nucleation, the observed universe is contained in the open bubble. In the simplest form, an open bubble in inflation is created in a (perhaps a) spatially flat, inflating space (gott 1982, guth & weinberg 1983), and in this tumbling bubble, the initial hypersurface of the bubble is somewhat inhomogeneous and spherical, and in a slightly non-spherical bubble, and the observable universe is in the closed bubble. In the tumbling-distance amplitude is highest for the most symmetrical solution (and the deviations from symmetry lead to an exponential suppression) so that it is generally assumed that the nucleation (potential mechanism) does not lead to significant inhomogeneities, and therefore, in the tumbling-distance, the amplitude of the sinking-distance is large for the most symmetrical solution (and the deviations from symmetry lead to exponential suppression), so that it is usually assumed that the nucleation (potential mechanism) does not lead to significant inhomogeneities in the past. In the abovementioned version of this type, the simplest of open inflation models is that one single open inflation bubble nucleates in a (perhaps) spatially flat, inflating spacetime (godt 1982; guth & weinberg 1983) . This model smooths The results of the study, which were almost totally insensitive to the details of the first epoch, are about the square-formal spectrum, which is only present at the threshold of the physical property at xmath; for the observationally valid range of xmath2 is not reached. In addition, a variety of other possible predictions have been investigated, which are not in keeping with the standard model of quantum mechanics and with the spatial curvature of a universe (e.g., w83, abbott & schaefer 1986, kamionkowski & spergel 1994), which are not in keeping with either the standard physical law or with the duration of a geographical trough, and are of historical interest. In the case of a first inflation, the fluctuations induced by this inflation affect only the smallest wavenumber of the energy-density-clustering spectral spectrum, which cannot contribute significantly to the observable quantities because of the distance cutoff by a spatial curvature. The inclusion of these fluctuations in the calculation alters the present value of the density fluctuations averaged over an xmath25 mpc sphere, by xmath26 (which is similar to our computational accuracy) . Besides the predictions for the usual flat space-scale invariant spectral spectrum of an open model, a variety of other spectra have also been studied . . . w83, abbott & schaefer 1986, kamionkowski & spergel 1994, rp95 . In the context of an open-inflation bubble nucleating in a spatially flat de sitter space time, the wavering of the bubble wall, like a non-square integral function, as observed by the “upside down” and “open-ended” effects (hamazaki et al. 1996; garriga 1996; garca bellido 1996; yamamoto, sasaki & tanaka 1996) seems to result in the observational prediction of the single-field, open-ended, inflation bubble. , there is, however, no mathematical calculation which identifies the radiance of the fluctuations of the wall of the bubble in a spatially flat de sitter space (cohn 1996). This fact has proved, for example, that the effect of a finite particle size on the zero-wall of the bubble at the nucleation is only of a very small extent (yamamoto et al. 1996; cohn 1996) . though there is no guarantee that there is a spatially flat de sitter space before the vaporization, the calculation shows the important point that the spatial curvature of the universe (e.g., rp94) is all that is necessary to make observational predictions for single-field open-ended bubble inflation models. In fact, it is actually reassuring that, having regard to the quantum mechanical fluctuations of the bubble wall (rp94) is almost all that is necessary to make observational predictions for single-field open-ended bubble inflation models. We have obtained a few parameters which we have refined by using the derision of the undivided Galactic radiating band as a starting point for all computations, both including and excluding the observed Galactic Cluster. The geometrical study has been made to apply the aberration of the Galactic Plane to the most prominent Galactic Block , as fully explained in Ackebrouckets, 1996. , in a very limited measure of Galactic Blowing, we have found that the predominant source of rays from Galactic Blowing is the Galactic Plane. Since the spatial distribution of Galactic Blowing, that of radiance free of charge and air, seems to be well defined by a well-proportioned Energy Spectrum ( Xmath34 kogut 1996a, g96) the cosmic signal is weakened at the largest Angular Scales. For the simple test of rays of Galactic Fog, we performed all calculations, including and excluding the observed Galactic Quadrat. This extended (4-year study) galactic Blowing has had the greatest effect on the analysis of the DMR. This expanded and extended (four-year) Blowing has been calculated for the largest Angular Nodes. The geometricality of the Blowing has been computed by using the “Earthly Mode” (which derives from this) of the Free and Dust Emission, and from the 408 MHz, all-sky radiance survey (haslam 1981) of the Whole Sky (Hadlam 1981) explains the cosmological signal on the largest Angular Scales. The noise in the Blowing does not remain at all high in the Band, but only decreases in the Ti A likelihood analysis is then carried out, as described by Grski ( 1994) . We consider four open-minded oscillatory power spectrums, in one of these two forms: the perihelionaire air, which is the air that is the result of the evolution of the air, called the perihelionaire air, that is, the air that is the mixture of the two quadrupoles with the multipoles. The data are coordinate system dependent. For the third form, the perihelionaire air, which is the same as the perihelion air, that is, if the air was compressed in a bubble, then we could have an observation that bgt, yst, yst; bgt; yst; cfr, cfr, cfr, cfr, cfr are to be considered in addition to the information of the quadrupole, which would, for instance, have a probability to be called in favor of the air - but here we have left aside the possibility of a tilt or primordial gravity, since they are not likely to have an effect in suitable open models , whereas in all cases we have also omitted the possibility of tilt or primordial gravity, since it is unlikely that they can have a significant effect in acceptable open models. So let us present a complete generalized X-math44 spectrum, i.e., eq. 1—which, in a case of equilibration, is known to be the predicting cosmogony of an inflationary bubble. Thus it is well known that X-math44 is a projection of an open-blocked inflationary bubble, and therefore must be in agreement with the presence of a spatial curvature. The x-math47 energy-density spectrum, below, is of type xmath46. This spectrum can also be considered, e.g., in type xmath48 (w83), but the observation of the spatial curvature is somewhat indistinguishable in an open model. The simple example is that of the inclination of the first epoch of inflation, which introduces a multiplicative factor, xmath46, on the right hand side of eq. 1 . In conventional terms, the fractional temperature oscillation, Xmath53, is expressed as a function of angular position, Xmath54, in the sky via the spherical harmonic decomposition, Xmath55 the cmb spatial anisotropy in a gaussian model can be described by the angular perturbation spectrum, math56, defined by the average, math56 By observation, they do not show an effect in the data: ratra et al. 1995; ratra et al. 1995, ratra et al. 1995; ratra et al. 1995) . It is therefore not a question of adding any of the parameter functions to the parameter space of the ionosphere, the amount of tilt and gravity waves calculated from the dmr data (without any ionization) is likely not very significantly affected by early reionization , however, since the structure is formed sooner in the open model, the other effects of early reionization might be more significant in the open model . ( ) as a result of the inclusion of the values of xmath2 (the hubble parameter @ xmath59) and the baryonic - mass density parameter @ xmath10 . The difference in the low-@xmath66 shapes of the @xmath56s in various models (figs. 26 and 27) are the result of three influences: a) the form of the energy-density and the density perturbation power spectrum at low wavenumbers; b) the exponential suppression of the spatial curvature of an open model; c) the interplay of the usual ‘ (idiotical cdm) sachs-wolfe’ terms with the ‘integrated’ terms, in the expression for the ‘‘[27] spatial anisotropy. Fig. 5 . we compare the various parameters for the different species. in the figure 2 and 3 . the relative importance of the effects is determined by the value of @xmath66, and leads to a non- monotonic behaviour of the large-scale ‘‘@xmath56’ as a function of @xmath66. The Differences in Low-NonContour- @xmath56 in the various models (Figs. 1-3) result from three consequences: a) the shape of the energy-density perturbation power spectrum at low wave numbers; b) the exponential suppression of the spatial curvature in an open model; and c) the interplay between the usual ‘ (cdm’) sachs-wolfe term and the integrated ‘sachs-wolfe’ term in the expression of the Low-Noncontour-‘at-Sw’ parameters in the expression of the mb spatial anisotropy. Its corresponding coefficient of adjustment is the centimetre of the angular spectrum, and the dominant factor is the name of the normal sw term. This is the chief effect on the angular scale of xmath68. Then, as xmath68 sprang lower, the default term for the integration term rises and then falls (i.e., it has a peak). The effects of these two terms, as a function of xmath66, are both effective and important. Then, as xmath68 sprang lower, the integration term grew steeper and then flattened, while the integration term grew less steep and then fell (i.e., it had a peak) . In a case where xmath70 has no discrete features at the low end, as with the flat space-scale invariant spectrum, the “equilibrium” at the spatial length dominates, while the lowest-level “equilibrium” — Xmath — sprang downwards. In this case, as xmath1 is reduced below xmath71, the “equilibrium” at the spatial center dominates, and the lowest-level— xmath66—”equilibrium” suppresses (figs. 3 and 5). The rise of this term on the smaller scales ( @xmath77) is compensated for by the steep rise of the usual "sw" term, and the result is the nearly identical spectrum of the cdm invariant spectrum (this one is more cdm invariant than fiducial cdm) . * * a discussion of some of these characteristics of the cdm anisotropy angular spectrum in the flat space - invariant – model (see Figs. 3 and 5). As can be seen from Figs. 2 and 5 , in an open – bubble model the quantum-mechanical zero-point fluctuations of the first epoch diminish the value of the @ xmath56 s. The non-square-integrable basis function (yst) exerts even greater power than the high @ xmath56 s. So at low - @ xmath66 the @ xmath56 s of figs. 4 and 5 are a little larger than figs. 2 and 5. again, the value of the spectra at lower values of @ xmath1 are influenced more strongly. We have a great deal to say to the participants about the results of the dmr likelihood analyses. Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate this in Figs. 6 and 7. Tables 17 and 13 represent the center values and the 1—1—1, the 2—1—ranges for the five types of images, (a) 1. a. b. a. and b. a. b. c. c. d. The two data sets show the radiance of the flat-space spectrum, the contributions of the non-square-integrable model, all result in very different radiances (fig. 6). Fig. 6 shows the likelihood functions of the ecliptic—frames—, which ignore the correction for the low-pressure galactic emission, and remove the quadrupole moment. Fig. 7 shows the likelihood functions derived from the ecliptic—frames—containing the correction for the faint high-pressure galactic emission, and excluding the quadrupole moment from the analysis. Figs. 6 and 7 show that the two subsets of probability functions at xmath81 and xmath81 represent the maximum normalization that could be inferred from the probability distribution function (the first provided the highest, the latter the lowest). compared with columns ( 2 ) and 6 of table 13, which show the maximal ratio of 2 - xmath80 to 2 - xmath21 for spectra of types (1 ) and 3 - and the differences between @ xmath60 and @ xmath60 between spectra (1 ) and (2 ) are not entirely insignificant, the difference in the value of the @ xmath60 values for the three spectra ( 1 ) are not completely insignificant, but in general the differences in the values of the @ xmath60 and @ xmath60 for the three spectra ( 3 ), ( 5 ) and ( 7) of table 13 are also not very insignificant. , the average value of @ xmath60 and @ xmath60 for the spectra ( 1 ) and , therefore, for the spectra ( 1 ) and , it is larger than the spectra with a larger @ xmath1 , so that the normalization amplitude is somewhat sensitive to the difference between the ecliptic and the ecliptic maps, to the low-latitude, high-latitude Galactic emission of the astrosphere, and to the inclusion or exclusion of the @ xmath60 . The entries in Table 16 illustrate the amplitude of normalizations due to changes in @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . The differences in @ xmath10 and @ xmath10 are not very insignificant, but in the more important sense the differences between the @ xmath2 and @ xmath8 values are quite insignificant . In other words, it is possible to estimate the two extremes of 2 xmath80. These values are recorded in column (five), eight, and twelve of the table (the ecliptic coordinates are not included in the analysis; the value of xmath88 is insignificant. In other words, there are small differences (but insignificant) in the quoted xmath21 values. For example, for the open bubble inflation model (rp94, bgt, yst), which does not contain a contribution of the non-square integral function (yst), we have - math90,  eqno (6) - , which is good to better than math88 for all values of xmath1 (and better than math88 for the observationally-adjustable range of math89). , - this is a calculation of the probability value of the two maximal two - math80 limits , it is the fitting of the flat space scale, the invariant spectrum - the flat space scale - invariant spectrum. Figure 12 compares the ridges of the maximum likelihood @ xmath21 value, as a function of xmath1 for four different math81 angular spectra. Fig. 14 compares some of the probability density points for @ xmath21 in a fixed @ xmath1 slice. ‘d) which is that masked in Figures 15 and 16 in Figures 1721. In this figure we show, with respect to the predictions made in the likelihood calculations, the general features of which are consistent with those predicted by the Figures 15 and 16. a-, but only the peak at the very low @ xmath1 (Figures 1721) is visible. Note that the projections for the Open-Bag Inflation model, relating only to the fluctuations generated in the Bubble, a– (see Figures 1 and 2). b-the projected likelihood density for the Index Standard Observed, at xmath95, is shown in fig. 3 of Grsb, and in general resemble those in fig. 1721 (though again only the peak at the very low @ xmath1 peak is visible) . Moreover, comparing the solid line of the Fig. 11 with their Fig. 11 (presumably) show the implied likelihood density for the Index Standard Observed, the general result of which is in accordance with those derived here. Hence we emphasize that our analysis of the Index Standard is based on the actual values of @ xmath21 as derived from the likelihood analyses, not these formulae. However, as we are limited to xmath95, the lower peak of the Index Standard is only seen at xmath95. Nevertheless, since we are only computed down to xmath95, only the upper peak at xmath1 (in Fig. 4) is seen. , as a given it is not clear what point to take for the corresponding integration of xmath1 . . . but if the quadrupole moment was omitted from the analysis, it did not find the peak at xmath99 in fig. . 19 . . But if the quadrupole moment were excluded from the analysis, as in fig. . . , yb did not compute for the case when the quadrupole moment was excluded from the analysis, so that the peak at xmath99 was not found in fig. . . . in general, it is not at all clear what to do with the integration range in xmath1 . . . focused on fig. . . a) (which is similar to the other quadrupole excluded cases) , the only conclusion is that Xmath9 is the most consistent value of the dmr data (at least amongst those models with xmath14 some of the models have another peak at xmath100, gsb) . . . but when the quadrupole moment is added to the analysis (as in fig. 21b) the open-bounce inflation model peak is at xmath12 (at least in the range xmath14 , gsb) while the flat-space-invariant spectrum open-bounce model peak is at xmath11 . - and show us examples of the spectra normalized to xmath21. Table 8 lists the normalization amplitudes at xmath42 (eqs. [1] and [2]) at xmath101k . Note, however, that these fit are based on the values determined for given xmath62 and xmath63 and do not account for the additional uncertainty caused by the allowable variations in these parameters which might affect the normalization amplitudes of the power spectrum. We have noted, again, that the good agreement of the spectra of open-tube inflation is mainly a reflection of the numerical accuracy of the present study, and the most probable additional, unaccounted for, source of uncertainty is that due to the uncertainty in the modeling of various physical phenomena. Fig. 23 illustrates, in the figure, the good agreement between the spectra of open-tube inflation. , when normalized to the extreme limits of 2 - @ xmath80 - @ xmath81 , eqno (8 ) - ; and for the upper 2 - @ xmath81 - eqno (9) - -  eqno (9) - , these fits are good for -@ xmath104 for -ma. In this respect, the mean square straight mass fluctuations over a sphere of coordinate radius, @ xmath110, is @ xmath111.     eqno (10)] , these fits are good to better than @ xmath88 for @ xmath110; again, they are derived from @ xmath88 values of @ xmath62 and @ xmath63. Given the uncertainties of the normalization procedure (as the result of the results of the statistics and other analyses) it is not possible to quoth a unique normalization amplitude (g96) . . . However, we emphasize that it is not possible to conclude that the model viability is founded on the central value of this central value . . . in conjunction with numerically determined transfer functions the average of eqs.

(13) (sugiyama 1995) for xmath42 (replaced with numerically determined values), the result is Xmath26 (fifteen) - that is, the mathematical fit of the transfer function, which greatly simplifies the calculation and provides the quick determination of the corresponding parts of cosmological parameter space. It is also recommended that we use the resulting statistical fit with the analytic fitting of eqs.

Table 12 is a comparison of the rms, of the Rms, of @ xmath82 and @ xmath122 equations for xmath128, which are usually more accurate than xmath129.

The equations in 5–8 of 1010 give the 2–@xmath82 5–1250, which are used to normalize the perturbations in the models considered. For the masses of the types described in 6> and 120 respectively, the numerical values in [11] and 12] of the numerical equations are expressed in the form of two-character square “Table 13 summarizes the values of the central dmr-normalized parameters for the spectra of type (below) of the type (below) of the type. Clearly, the predictions of the different types are not very different from the predictions for the types above. The ranges in the tables 914 are the maximal values for type (below) , in the general range. The ranges in the dmr-normalized models are the average of the maximal 2 xmath1352 - 2 dmr-80 ranges in the range of column C. (with reference to the result of the mean of the dmr-normalized-to-doing-over formulae of table 14) - and the table 14 for that matter, with reference to the maximum 1 xmath1352 - dmr-80 ranges in the table dmr-normalized models are not really restricted in the observational cosmology. we must bear in mind that the measurement of the observational cosmology remains undetermined and therefore our analysis here should be viewed as tentative and subject to change as the observational situation approaches equilibrium. We have therefore combined the results of the observational cosmology with the forecasts of the dmr-normalized model in order to define the range of allowed parameter values for the two spectra. We make use of recent methods in order to put the model predictions in perspective, and to compare them with those derived from other analyses. The specific constraints we apply are outlined below, where we compare them with those derived from other analyses. in a cdm model, which is formed at a relatively high redshift (as is well observed) these local estimates of @xmath1 constrain the global value of @xmath1 (for, in this case, it is not inconceivable that the pressureless cdm is much more homogeneous than the observed mass of the baryonic mass ). Thus, jimenez et al. (1996) finds that the oldest globular clusters have ages of xmath136 gyr (also see salaris, deglinnocenti, weiss et al., ); and that it is very unlikely that the oldest clusters are younger than 9 . 7 gyr . We find that the predictions depend on the age of the universe . . . for example, in the case of xmath139, a variety of observations have confirmed that xmath1 is low . . . in the case of a cdm model, in which the structure forms at a relatively high redshift (as is well observed), the local estimates of xmath1 constrain the global value of xmath1 (for in this case it is inconceivable that the pressureless cdm is much more homogeneous than the observable baryonic mass). You have seen the former as well, if you want to take a closer look at it. . . . Compared with the standard theoretical predictions of the abundance of light in the primordial days, we can rely on the following: the observed abundances of X-Matrix, - , van den bergh, - sandage et al., ruiz- lapuente, riess, press, & kirshner, - but also see schaefer 1996, branch et al. - for the purpose of our analysis, we assume the following: X-Matrix ,  = x-Matrix ( tanvir et al. 1995) ; doubling the uncertainty, the 2 - x-Matrix range is X-Matrix . - there are bold signs in column ( 2 ) of the tables 912, which indicate that the parameter of the model is incompatible with this range. The high d abundances are of the sort that may be derived from the general interpretation of the d and xmath15 abundances (e.g., fkot; Cardall & Fuller 1996) . and thus the d and xmath15 are closely coupled with the observed d and xmath15 abundances. . . . if the d abundances are coupled with the observed d and xmath15 abundances, they would lead to a total of d and xmath15, so that fkot ( fkot) . carswell et al. (1996) and wampler et al. (1996) have examined other d and xmath15 , but can't strongly constrain xmath15 . . . while the errors on xmath63 from these d abundances are somewhat symmetric, in order to qualitatively assess the values of xmath53 we want to examine, we assume that the errors are gaussian (and where necessary, add all uncertainties in quadrature to give the 2 - xmath55 uncertainties ) . a skeleton model of galactic chemical evolution . . . (Burles & Tytler 1996, Cardall & Fuller 1996) . . . assuming that the white et al. (93) and the white et al. (93) are uncertainties on the total, galactic and gas masses, and adding them in quadratures, we find for the two-dimensional range of the cluster baryonic mass fraction: elbaz, arnaud, bhringer (95), white et al. (95) , david, jones, forman (95), Markevich et al. (1996), and buote et al. (1996), find similar, or larger, gas-mass fractions . note that elbaz, arnaud, bhringer (95) and white et al.

(1996) . . to get a better idea of the value of the linear bias parameter xmath160, xmath160, where xmath164 is the fractional perturbation in the numerical curve in quadrature, we have added the uncertainty due to the assumed cosmological model and due to the assumed evolution in quadrature, which is a statistical xmath80 uncertainty ( maddox, efstathiou, and sutherland 1996) of xmath164, where we have added the uncertainty due to the assumed cosmological model and the assumed quadrature, which is a statistical xmath80 uncertainty ( maddox et al. 1996) of xmath164, with a 2         , in a 2                                            ,     ,         , ,  ,     , , , , ,     ,, , , , ,   , We assume that the uncertainties of ecf are gaussian, and in general they are less than weak at xmath157 (and so on the value of xmath2 and xmath10) . In our analysis, we avoid this slight dependence on xmath2 and xmath10 . (We have already given examples of this limited dependence in the model of cdm which is at the limit of xmath167.) , where we assume that the uncertainty of ecf is gaussian, and that in general it depends weakly on the value of xmath157 (and therefore on the value of xmath2 and xmath10) see fig. 13 of cdm . . . for cdm, at the limit of xmath167, whereas cdm also employs n-body calculations at xmath168 0 . 3 and 1 to calculate the press-schechter model . . . . as mentioned in cdm , this is because vl normalizes the temperature function of the cluster in the middle of the bubble (if there is a rise in the temperature function), so that cdm prefers a higher value of xmath1 for the open bubble inflation model than for grsb . . . , (i.e., if observed clusters are at their redshifts of formation) that might not be as conclusive as it might be if one followed the curve in eq. 19 (as if eq. 19 was used as a reference for analytical fittings to the transfer function) and the confidence of eq. 19 (13) was somewhat less than that of eq. 19. In fact, the standard error in eq. 19 was rather minor (and more like an effect of the exponentials) of the opas and the time-span of the term. As eq. 19 is less sensitive to smaller scales than eq. 26 it is more reliable to measure observational assumptions about eq. 27 than eq. 28 , the more consistent are the observed estimates of eq. 27 in the observable part of the parameter space, when made use of the numerically determined values of eq. 27 . “ However, the gray-lined values of the columns 6 and 9 of the table 912 indicate the exact values of the parameter values which are questioned by the constraints of eq. 19 ( 1– xmath169), as this gives eq. 27 to be better than xmath87 in the observationally viable part of the parameter space (provided that the numerically determined values of eq. 42 Doing so makes the projections of the linear theory mass-power spectra of Fig. 23: in view of the uncertainty of eq.

(5) of cole et al. (1996) to obtain the 2 - 2 c. l. range : @ xmath-174 where we have doubled the error bars of eq. (5 - 1 ) of cole et al. (1995) to obtain the 2 - 2 c. l. For the open bubble inflation model, we focus in the following way on rp94. The boldfaced values of tables 912 indicate those model parameter values which do not meet the requirements of eq. (21) . . . Note from Table 13 that the large-scale structure predictions of the open-walled inflation model do not depend on the initial phase of inflation (bgt; yst), and do not depend in any way on the contribution of the non-square-integrable basis function (yst) . The utmost equivalence of the observations of the surface data described in the preceding section on the parameters of the open-walled inflation model (spectra 1 ) and of the flat-walled, invariant-walled open-walled model (type 4). The strictest constraints on the parameters of the model-parameter values come from the matter-power spectrum observational data constraints on the shape parameter (see table 9 and col. 4, col. 4) . note from Table 13 that the large-scale structure predictions of the open-walled inflation model do not depend on the perturbations of the first epoch of inflation (bgt, yst) and do not depend very much on the contribution of the non-square-integrable basis function (yst) . - But if it were so, it would be difficult to reconcile xmath 8 with the 2 - xmath80 value of the observed xmath145he and xmath146li abundances in the reference xmath152 (fkot, also see copi et al. 1995; sarkar 1996) . , they are not as restrictive as the constraints on xmath113. - and the cosmological baryonic mass fraction in the reference xmath178 is expected to be 0 - pi(3.) , the inferred cosmological baryonic mass fraction in the reference xmath184 is expected to be 0 - pi(3), and so this xmath177 model also fails this test. . . . however, it is quite difficult to reconcile xmath8 with the 2 - xmath80 range derived from the observed xmath145he, xmath146li and current high d abundances of xmath152 (fkot), or with the observations xmath152 (fkot). that baryonic - mass density is consistent with that determined from the current low d abundances, but is difficult to reconcile with the current standard nucleosynthesis interpretation of the observed ma xmath145 he and ma xmath146i abundances (Carall & Fuller 1996). Thus the agreement between predictions and observational data is fairly impressive (although the tanvir et al. 1995 central ma xmath2 value favours ma 199). Note that models with ma199 are not quite consistent with the data. . . . the central observational values for ma199, the cluster baryonic - mass fraction, ma 190, ma199 favour ma199, ma199 favours ma199, ma199 also favors ma199 , so the agreement between predictions and observations is fairly impressive (although the tanvir et al. 1995 central ma199 central ma199 value favours ma199) . . . The larger value of ma199 (and smaller value of ma199) has given rise to small-scale power, but this decline is difficult to reconcile with the standard nucleosynthesis interpretation of observed ma199 and ma199 abundances (Carall et al. 1996) . . . . . Note that models with ma199 are rather incompatible with the data. He discussed the so-called Flat-Scale of Ecology (rp94, bgt, yst) in a more or less equal-to-usual way. In this case, while the central observations for this period are met by Xmath157, 159, and xmath136, prefer Xmath90; but the cluster baryonic mass fraction (and in particular, for Xmath2) favours Xmath190 (although at Xmath90, the cluster baryonic mass fraction constraint is only at Xmath196), whereas models with Xmath197 are consistent with the observational constraints at Xmath4 and xmath198 gyr. It is interesting that in this case the central observational values we consider for xmath157, for xmath26, and for xmath134 prefer Xmath9; but that for the cluster baryonic mass fraction (and for xmath82) favour Xmath190 (although at xmath80 the cluster baryonic mass fraction does not require xmath196) the increase in xmath63 also reduces the mass fluctuation amplitude, making it harder to argue for xmath177; but, models with xmath197 seem to be consistent with the observational constraints, in this case the agreement between predictions and observations is not remarkable. The observational results we have used to constrain the parameter values in the previous sections are the most rigorous , we do not rely on any of these results for the rest of the analyses, but instead on others, which we consider to be less robust, and we should treat all conclusions from these with great caution. In this section we summarize several of the more tentative constraints from more recent observations. As we have noted, the central value of the dmr four-year normalization is very little lower than the one for the two-year one (G96) ; (2 ) the full range of dmr normalizations allowed in the analysis (versus the 1 - dmr 80 range used in the analysis of the galactic-frame quadrupole-included two-year data set); ( 3 ) the half-width of the small-scale dynamical estimates of dmr1 is not the high part of the parameter space with dmr203 ( @ xmath206 ), and the small-scale dynamical estimates of dmr1 turn out to be biased slightly downwards, . . . and if a given domain has the same scale of motion, then the concentration of the universe will be reduced to xmath209. Therefore, we shall be satisfied that the largest scale of velocity results from bertschinger et al. ’s study suggests a lower value of xmath209 than the other numbers used in this paper. We take the values of the tens of thousands of xmaths in . . . to be in the same range, in the case of the models of Table 10. Hence, the enumerable value of the large scale velocity results of bertschinger et al. ’s study indicates a lower limit of xmath213 than that computed by the redshift-space-dislocation analysis of cole et al. (1996) . (This value is quite a little below the lower limit (@ xmath212) of bertschinger et al. ’s (1996), which is equivalent to xmath212. Nevertheless, we strongly emphasize that the central value of the large-scale velocity measurements of bertschinger et al. (1990) has a significantly larger value of @ xmath1 than the other observations presented here . . . Further, as discussed in relation to xmath, a certain degree of uncertainty remains regarding the appropriate interpretation of large-scale velocity data in open models, especially since the vast sample sample size of a single-thrust gyroscope (Bridge 1996, also see llrv) . On the other hand, Baugh (1996) makes the conclusion that Xmath216, and ratcliffe et al. (1996) makes the conclusion that Xmath217 (and Xmath165) is equivalent to the xmath217 figure (and baugh et al. (1996) proposes Xmath218, while kolatt et dekel (1995) have given an estimate of Xmath219, eq. (22), which, however, has an estimate of xmath167, and at xmath169 the X-ray temperature function of the band is eq. (23) which is proportional to eq. (23), for the much higher rise to low xmath1 . zaroubi et al. (1996) argues that the open bubble inflation model is a good description of the large scale of flow if, at two - xmath80 , @ xmath221 , we can see from the table 12 : that the Open Bubble Inflation Model with [12] and [14] provides a good fit to all the observations in [14] . Besides, there is no reference to a lower-order proportion of the difference between the coefficients of the large scales in a given region of scales in the open-door inflation model (e.g., croft et al. 1994; moscardini et al. 1995) . The overall normalization is a little less than that of the dmr data (e.g., ratra et al. 1995). . . . This normalization is somewhat smaller than that of the dmr data (e.g., ratra et al. 1994) . . . . bahcall et al. (1996), observing the observational data well, the result of an @xmath177 flat-ended @xmath18 model with @xmath226 and @xmath227 = 0 . . . . in a model with @xmath229 = 0 . . . ] the universe is created at the xmath230 temperature, and at the xmath232 temperature of @xmath72 . . . Thus, the observational data of xmath177 are better described than the observations of dmr (ratra & sugiyama 1995) . The immense trend in the X-math-235 (e.g.,  dt) is a consequence of the presence of huge stars at X-math-235 (gwyn & hartwick 1996) , and the possibility of seeing objects like the protogalaxy (yee et al. 1996, ellingson et al. 1996) are possible. On the other hand, the recent discovery of large groups at X-math-240 (e.g., francis et al. 1996; pascarelle et al. 1996) is not in the least serious to the open-flat inflation model. As for the adiabatic "x-math-69" model, based on the fiducial cdm (with a normalization inconsistent with that of the elm), the enormous clusters at X-math-240 (e.g., luppino & gioia 1995; pell et al. 1996) can easily be fitted in the model. Fig. 24 compares the one-month range of centimetre-diaotropy predictions of a few representative example of those open-bulb-inflated models and those flat-baked open-bubble-cluster models with those of the smaller-diaotropy observations. The result was reported by grs, who also compared open-bulbouring models to the xmath1351-xmath80 values of the dmr. two-year data (and therefore regarded the open-bulbouring models as being at the xmath-1485 value of the dmr four-year data, see figs. 5 and 6 of grs) . The spectral method for testing the apparent magnitude of the redshift is also supported by the xmath69 models, and, to put it another way, with the existence of the cosmological constant dominated spatially by the flat-bounced model (e.g., ratra et al. 1992; ratra et al. 1996). Fig. 24 compares the range of the xmath80 range of the cdma layer of a few representative cdma layer models. Noticing that hancock et al. (1995) don't consider the systematic shifts of the data set between the various dmrrs, and excluding some data points, e.g. the four msam points and the max3 mup point (which is consistent with the recent max5 mup result, lim et al. 1996), this broad range is consistent with the conclusion of grs that it is still not yet possible to constrain cosmological parameters to the dmrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrlrrr, as well as a few others, for example, the four msrrrpr point and the max3 mup point (reconciling the result of lim et al.,1996) , which do not disdain the lower value of @ xmath1 of the open – budding inflation model (ratra et al. 1996, sha et al., 1994). Our analysis specifically quantifies the small variations in the results due to the following: (i) the small differences between the , it falls between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two numbers of the angular sphere, which is defined above. This is because we have in detail estimated the effect of all known systematic uncertainties on the angular sphere of each assumed cmb anisotropy angular sphere and account for them, in the most conservative manner possible, as little shifts. For the larger possible range of xmath244 and xmath249 (as a general matter, see bunn, liddle, and white 1996) the decimal uncertainty of bw is smaller than the decomposition uncertainty of eq. . [10] (from a statistical and systematic point of view, see here , eq. 19.) since our account of the uncertainties is the most conservative, our conclusions about model-viability are the most reasonable. Note that we account for intrinsic noise, cosmic variance, and other effects (one, (three) above). But in part of this uncertainty comes from the small systematic changes, and the maximal 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 fractional uncertainty is less than twice the maximal 1 - 2 fractional uncertainty. [[2] Since our account of the uncertainties is the most conservative possible, our conclusions about model-viability are the most robust ... One may even reselect this value, but these are more or less fixed for the value of xmath1 and the size of the assumed model power spectrum. These two other sources of anisotropy are not accounted for. For observationally viable open-hole inflation models, the observable predictions do not depend significantly on these two sources of anisotropy. , the parameters for the observable normalization of the different forms of radial anomaly (see below) are an observational type. Having described in the introduction a number of more specific physics of the open-hole inflation scenario, in particular a number of conditions of the vacuum prior to the release of the bubble, many other mechanisms for kinetic energy stress are considered in addition to those described here. They are based on specific assumptions of the vacuum state prior to the release of the bubble. This has to be taken into account only in the case of the changes produced by the dynamics of the bubble wall, and in the case of the nucleation of a non-zero-sized bubble. Furthermore, these experiments suggest that such effects do not add a significant amount to the changes that occur during the development of the bubble, but also to try to find a plausible particle physics-based theory of the open-bubble inflation. in this particular theory of the open-bubble inflation, there are various additional mechanisms for stress-energy disturbance, both from the cyclical nature of the bubble wall and from the nucleation of a non-zero-size bubble, and also from effects from the nucleation of a non-zero-sized bubble. It is reasonable to conclude that, when the quadrupole moment is excluded from the analysis, the Xmath9 spectral shape is most consistent with the dmr data, while the quadrupole-excluded analysis favours Xmath12 (for the open- bubble inflation model in the range of xmath250) . the large allowed range is partially a consequence of the current uncertainty in Xmath10. current cosmographic observations in conjunction with current large-scale structure observations compared to the predictions of the dmr normalized model. the large allowed range is also in agreement with the small-scale dmr normalized model. in a broad class of these models, with adiabatic gaussian initial energy density perturbations, this focuses on values of xmath1 that are larger than the range of values for xmath10 that is inferred from observed abundances of light element in accordance with standard nucleosynthesis. It is possible, however, that mild bias will be manifested in the need to reconcile these larger values of xmath1 with what is determined from small-scale dynamical estimates, as well as in relating the smaller dmr normalized values of xmath251 (for this preferred range of xmath1) with the larger observed galaxy number fluctuations (e.g., eq. 18] .

Two of the four lines in each panel correspond to the results of the analysis of the ecliptic-frame maps that ignore the faint high-latitude, low-level foreground galactic emission correction, and with the quadrupole moment removed from the analysis, either for xmath123 gyr and xmath124 (dotted lines) or for xmath192 gyr and xmath268 (dotted lines) . All the rest of the uncertainties are minor. The effects of different xmath62 and xmath65 are hardly at all perceptible. In a case of open-gap inflation, the fluctuation in the internal bubble is merely a result of the changes that take place within it ( type [1 ]). In a case of open-gap inflation, the dotted and dashed lines show the open-gap inflation cases, that is, only the changes that occur when the bubble is decaying. These are for xmath255 and xmath256. But two of the curves in each panel correspond to the results of the analysis of the ecliptic-framed maps, which include only the faintly high-latitude foreground galactic emission correction and exclude the quadrupole moment from the analysis, for xmath123 gyr and xmath124 (dotted lines) and for xmath192 gyr and xmath268 gyr . The other two curves in each panel are from the analysis of the ecliptic-framed maps, ignoring the quadrupole moment and excluding the quadrupole moment from the analysis, for xmath123 gyr and xmath124 (dotted lines) and for xmath192 gyr and xmath268 gyr . . . projected likelihood density for xmath1 derived from xmath79 (normalized as shown in Fig. ) the other two curves in each column correspond to the results of the analysis of the ecliptic-frame sky maps ignoring the low altitude altitude foreground altitude altitude correction and excluding the quadrupole moment in the analysis, for xmath123 gyr and xmath124 (dotted lines) and for xmath192 gyr and xmath268 (solid lines) . To be continued in a moment. “Let’s suppose, then, that there were two data points, corresponding to the small air bubble for the moment (gbr 1.0), as a pplotical line 1.0. Two of the four lines in each line are from the analysis of the galactic data set 1.0, which involves the faint, high-latitude, ground galactic correction, without accounting for (dot-dotted lines) or ignoring (solid lines) the quadrupole moment. Two of the four lines in each line are the results of the analysis of the galactic data set, 1.0 in which the galactic correction is inferred, either for (dot-dotted lines) or for (dot-dotted lines) the quadrupole moment. The conventions are as follows: fig. a. For the open-bubble inflation model, 1.0, accounting for the fluctuations generated inside the bubble (rp94), while 0.5 is for the flat-space-invariant open-spectra open-spectra model (w83). 1.0 marginal likelihood densities for 1.0 for 1.0 (normalized as shown in fig. b). Now, a side panel, a resemblance of the ecliptic frame, has been deconjured by the faint high-latitude foreground galactic emission correction, and has been omitted from the analysis by the quadrupole moment. The side panels, b and c, are from the analysis of the galactic frame maps, which have ignored the low-latitude foreground galactic emission correction, but which have included the quadrupole moment. The side panels, a resemblance of a resemblance to a resemblance to a resemblance to a resemblance to a resemblance to a resemblance to a line slanting from a height that almost matches a resemblance to the resemblance to the first epoch of inflation (i.e., p. 290), the equator and ruffian are the resemblances of the open-to-air, open-air inflation (i.e., one-dimensional) and the light ones are for the open-to-air inflation (i.e., 1 ) and the light ones for the open-to-air inflation spectrum (i.e., 1 ) which are now also accounting for fluctuations arising from the inner-in-the-in-the-out (i.e., type I spectra) . There are four lines in each panel, although in each of them there are two almost overlapped lines. These are the fractional differences of energy-density to energy-density differences, @xmath Now if we take a closer look at the spectra of the open-ventilation model (at xmath-69) , we see that the spectra of the open-ventilation model (at xmath-69) are exactly the same, and therefore overlap; also, we see that at xmath-69 the open-ventilation model (at xmath-58) accounts for the fluctuations of the early stages of the inflation (rp95), dotted lines (and dotted lines)) are most essentially the same as those which do not constitute the source of fluctuations (rp95, dotted lines) . In a given xmath-69-State Index swarm of spectra, in the following three spectra, from which (a) and (b) correspond to xmath-123 gyr and xmath-275 gyr, c) to xmath-192 gyr and xmath-224 gyr, and (c) to xmath-122 gyr and xmath-122 (composed by the results of the dmr analyses of the xmath-124 gyr and xmath-275 models) ; and d) to xmath-121 gyr and xmath-122 (composed by the results of the dmr analysis of the xmath-26 and xmath-26 models), e. “Simple points of view, I think, are that at a given xmath218 the three spectra nearly overlap, especially for the observed values of xmath212 . . . Note, also, that the calculated mass (not the galaxy) power spectra are not made under the assumption of a specific cosmological model and an evolutionary scenario, i.e., they do not necessarily take account of these additional sources of uncertainty (e.g., gaztaaga 1995). Note that the calculated power spectra are derived from the same cosmological model and not from the same evolution (e.g., the gaztaaga 1995). The solid triangles represent the redshift - space of da Costa et al. (1996) ssrs2 + cfa2 (at xmath278 mpc depth) of optical galaxy data (which was very kindly provided by c. park) . The hollow pentagons represent the real space of baugh & efstathiou (1997) analysis of the apm optical galaxy data (which were very kindly supplied to us by c. baugh) . Note also that the numerical error bars in the test data are based on a particular cosmological model and an evolving scenario, and that they do not necessarily account for these additional sources of uncertainty (e.g., the gaztaaga (2005)) . At xmath177, the parameter values are: xmath177, xmath281, xmath283 gyr (solid lines); xmath286 , xmath287 , xmath288 gyr (dotted lines); and xmath69, xmath289, xmath290 gyr (dotted lines); and xmath69, xmath289, xmath290 gyr (dotted lines); for a detailed description of these models, see Ratra et al. (1996). among the open bubble inflation models of a panel (a) the xmath72 is the one favoured by the analysis of table 10, and the xmath256 is the one preferred by the analysis of table 11 . among the open bubble inflation models of panel (a) the xmath72 is close to what is favoured by the analysis of table 10, and the xmath256 is close to what is favoured by the analysis of table 11 . The xmath177 model is on the edge of the permissible region from the analysis of table 12, and the xmath69 fiducial cdm model is incompatible with cosmographic and large-scale structure observations . , we show the observational results from the smallest window available. – The data shown here are from a dmr galactic model, which does not include the correction for galactic emission (Grski 1996, open octagons with xmath292; – ganga et al. 1994, as analyzed by bond 1995, solid pentagon) – – – from firs (ganga et al. 1994, as analyzed by bond 1995, solid pentagon) – – from firs (ganga et al. 1994, as analyzed by bond 1995, solid pentagon) – – from firs (ganga et al. 1994, as analyzed by bond 1995, solid pentagon) – – – from firs (ganga et al. 1994, as analyzed by bond 1995, solid pentagon) – – from firs (ganga et al. 1994, as analyzed by bond 1995, solid pentagon) – – from firs (ganga et al. 1994, open five-point star) – tenerife (hancock et al. 1996, open five-point star) – – argo (e . g., platt et al. 1996, open six-point star) – – argo (e . g., platt et al. 1996, open six-point star) – – argo (e . g., platt et al. 1996, open six-point star) – As discussed in Ratra et al., 1995), all the vertical errors have vertical (1–1 ) error bars. Note that from the analysis of a large fraction of the data (all these data corresponding to the detection of cmb anisotropy) shown in the figure, grs (figs. 5 and 6) conclude that all the models shown in panel (a) are consistent with the cmb anisotropy. All vertical errors have vertical 1–1 xmath80 error bars. The horizontal line on the observational data points represents the vertical space of the corresponding window function (which again ignores the form of the sky anisotropy signal) . . . as a result of ratra et al.’s 1995 study, all @xmath302 (vertical) error bars are excluded. As a result of the nature of this issue ganga et al.’s (1996) study , the following figures are given: the detection of the cmb anisotropy signal is assumed to be at the head of the detection line (also ignoring the form of the sky anisotropy signal).
