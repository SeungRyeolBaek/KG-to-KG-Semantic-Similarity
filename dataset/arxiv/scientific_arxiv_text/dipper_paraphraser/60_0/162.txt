In recent years, there has been a great interest in the influencing of small-scale and surface influences on the magnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles, and these have provided an interesting and profitable field for synthesis of theoretical and technical works and for biomedical researches. from the theoretical point of view, many studies have been carried out concerning the magnetic properties of the magnetic nanoparticles, such as wires, troughs, and rods, and the physical size of these systems has reduced to a characteristic length, so that surface influences become dominant, and hence some unusual and interesting magnetic phenomena can be observed, which may differ from those of bulk materials xcite. In the previous years, however, the influence of small-size and surface effects on the magnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles have provided a noticeable and productive field for the interaction of theoretical work and technological work, as well as in medical and medical applications xcite. In the past years, the influence of small-size and surface effects on the magnetic properties of nanoparticles has been well studied in the spheres, nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanostructures, and the spheres of these are in a range of experimental conditions, and the magnetization of certain nanomaterials, such as xmath5 - xmath5 and xmath7 , have been investigated experimentally. A significant and unusually large amount of electric impulse has been demonstrated in the above examples, and moreover, as a theoretical example, the total magnetizations in a teeming bi-axial film of at least xmath9 is measured by means of the measurement of the eft and the measure of the mft and found to have two different compensation points with the increase of the thickness of the film. Moreover, as a theoretical example, the magnetic phenomena in a teeming multi-layered film of xmath 9 has also been reported for the bulk ferrimagnetic materials . Moreover, the phenomenon of two compensating points observed in the teeming films has been described for the bulk ferrimagnetic material . . . however, the origin of this compensating point in the nanoscaled magnets is quite different from that of the bulk ferrimagnetic materials. Hence, we learned from these studies that the compensating point in nanostructures ain't large, and bn't well suited to the size of the sphere. Hence, a theoretical investigation of ferrimagnetism in nanostructures opens a new field in the study of critical phenomena in ferrimagnetic materials . . . However, nanostructures such as nanowires or nanotubes are also capable of compensating, since the transition between the core and the shell is not impeded by the same atomic moment. Moreover, the magnetic elasticity of nanostructures, i.e., is not constant, even when the sphere is larger than the nanostructures. As can be seen from the earlier studies, this is a phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and as such is indicated by the entanglement of a dynamic symmetry, which is indicated by the order parameter (dpt), which is defined as the average of the magnetization over the whole period of the oscillating field. In this novitiate situation, a few theoretical studies have been conducted in the last few years in the field of eternally elastic rotors and rods of cylindrical ising nanowire and nanotubes, in the presence of a time dependent magnetic field in the eft, with correlations inferred from them, and reported that the nature of these curves, according to nel theory of ferrimagnetism, is known to be quite well known. Further, by means of simulations and by means of the unixally anisotropic heisenberg model, frequency dispersion of dynamic hysteresis in a core-shell magnetic nanoparticle system was studied by wu et al. in order to determine whether the frequency dispersion of dynamic hysteresis is governed by the power-law or not, and they concluded that the frequency dispersion of dynamic hysteresis is governed by both the reverse and the slanting resonances, and they also found that the exchange coupling on the core-shell interface does not influence the power-law scaling of dynamic hysteresis. The main point of these investigations was the high temperature and high intensity of the periodic magnetic field, and the high temperature and low amplitude of the magnetic field are able to follow the external field with some delay, whereas the low temperatures and There are some examples in the article that are just to give an idea of what is a physical model of a colloidal ferrimagnetic particle forming of more than one compound. In this instance the physical realization can probably be achieved by means of ultrafast laser fields or by means of some novel materials with low exchange interactions, in comparison with the overall strength of the field. The principal motivation of the present paper is to give an understanding of the physical facts of these questions. In particular special attention has been given to the physical realization of a case in which the applied field amplitude is of the same order as or greater than the exchange, and oscillations are tens of times longer (in terms of mc steps per site) . In the section - formulation - we briefly present our model. In -math12 , -math13 , -math14 and -math15 - define the antiferromagnetic interaction between the core and the shell (see figure 1 in ref. ) . -math19 - Denotes the nearest neighbour interaction on the lattice . However, to test the hysteresis loops, to make sure that the loops are stable, the first few cycles of the external field are considered as temporary, and after that temporary, statistical averaging has been performed (see subsection (c)) ). The data were generated over the @xmath30 independent stages of a two-step procedure, by combining the first two-step steps with the second-step steps, ignoring the first-step steps. In our simulations we chose xmath28, and so we obtained xmath28. We obtain the dynamical parameters of the core and shell layers of the magnetization of the magnetization at the time @xmath36, and the total magnetization at the time @xmath36 is calculated. At the moment of the magnetization, we obtain the dynamical parameters. These quantities are defined as @xmath38 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the number of spins in the core and the shell layers, respectively. . . . ’   and the converging area of the field is defined by ’ .   End  aligned   . . . ”] thus the specific heat of the field is defined by  (30) [41] and ’ [29] – where  is the relative temperature of the field.         end        end          ,    [32] In this section we shall examine the dynamic phase transition properties of a ferrimagnetic system. This section is divided into three parts: in part I, we have compared the critical temperature of the particle to the amplitude and frequency of the oscillating magnetic field, and thereby determined the exchanges that are given in equation (eq1) , in part III, we have discussed the hysteretic response of the particle to the alternating magnetic fields, and in part III, we have investigated the size-dependent magnetic properties. We have examined in detail the hysteretic response of the particle to the magnetic field from time to time, and in which we have compared the size of the magnetic field with the properties of the present system. In this section we have investigated two additional order parameters belonging to the core and shell layers of the particle, named xmath47, where xmath47 is the critical temperature, i.e. the temperature at the time of the coaxial connection. As we are dealing with the electro-mechanical properties of the system, we have drawn up a scale illustrating the influences of the antiferromagnetic interaction of the shell and core on the dynamic phase transition properties of the system. The scales are plotted for three amplitudes of the external field, a) at xmath55, b) at xmath55, and c) at xmath55 . . . here we are dealing with a strong electro-mechanical interaction, such as a non-depressing anisotropy of the core which simulates the exchange of surface tension in the system. This phenomenon is independent of the amplitude @ xmath55 and period @ xmath55 of the external field. At high oscillations (i.e. at relatively low frequencies) the dynamic magnetization by the instantaneous ferrimagnetic order of the particle can respond to the oscillating magnetic field with a certain delay; but as the time between the oscillating magnetic field and the relaxation time of the system increases, the dynamic magnetization cannot respond to the external field due to the increase in phase lag between the magnetic field and the magnetization @ xmath55 . ‘If you consider the core-shell coupling to be less than the ferromagnetic chemistry of the materials, the antiferromagnetic chemistry of the materials is less strong than that of the inner layers, and it is possible to observe a dynamic transition of the layers at low temperatures. In this case, we should note that this result contradicts the recent work by N. Xcite. For example, in the bulk ferrimagnetism of nel’s quintet, it is possible to classify the thermal variation of the total magnetism of the system into certain categories. In the present case, magnetism of the present system can exhibit the same characteristics as in the bulk ferrimagnetic systems. Despite this, the total magnetism of the system has been arranged in such a way that the inequality of spins between the core and the shell layers has been introduced into account. Thus, the characteristic order of the phase region in the diagrams in Figures Figs. 1 and 2 is narrower with increasing temperatures. In Figure 2 we can see the effect of the antiferromagnetic interaction between the ferromagnetic materials on the temperature dependence of the dynamic order parameters, as compared with the phase diagrams shown in Figure 2 Figs. 1 and Figs. 2 show the ratio of the antiferromagnetic interaction between the ferromagnetic materials in the void between the core and the shell layers, and the alternating volume of the void is dynamically shifted to the next critical temperature, because of the relatively strong interaction between ferromagnet materials. As we have seen in Figure Fig 3 a, the effect of the amplitude @ xmath61 of the external field on the temperature dependencies of total magnetization, dynamic order parameters @ xmath65, xmath66, and the dynamic heat capacity curves of the particle, as shown in Figure Fig 3 a. , title = “fig: ” , width = 151] on the temperature dependencies of (a) total magnetization, (b) dynamic order parameters @ xmath65, @ xmath66, and (c) dynamic heat capacity @ xmath67 for a combination of hamiltonian parameters corresponding to phase diagrams in figure Fig1 . . . as you can see in figure Fig 3 a the p-like behavior of the magnetization curves, and the xmath49 is lowered with increasing xmath61 values. . . .

I would like to show a diagram of the dynamic phase transitions of the particle corresponding to the diagram in Fig. 5., in which we have, as a supplement to this, some examples of the 'formula' and 'pearl-difference' of the fluxes Fig. 5 , in which, for instance, as shown in Fig. 5, the first hump is sharper, and the second, which is sharper, is rounded and has a sharp transition. - in Fig. 5, we have to examine the influence of the external field time, X-mass, on the dynamical phase transition characteristics of the particle. In Fig. 5, we have to illustrate the phase diagrams corresponding to the phase diagrams Fig. 5 , and in order to compare with the current, we are showing the effect of the external field on the dynamic phase transition. As a complementary investigation, let us present various magnetization patterns corresponding to the phase diagrams of Fig. 5 , we can see clearly from Fig. 5 that at x-mass the values of X-mass decrease with increasing x-mass. The physical facts underlying the behavior shown in Fig. 5 are the same as those in Fig. 2. We shall not discuss these interpretations here. There are only two dimensions of xmath72, xmath73, xmath70, and xmath60 . . . the effect of the oscillation period xmath62 on the temperature dependence of dynamic order parameters xmath65 and xmath66 of the core and shell layers of the particle. In a word, according to the figure, xmath72, we can clearly say that as the value of xmath72 increases, the transition temperature of the system increases. . . . we can also say that the phase transition temperature of the shell is directly related to the value of xmath72, because the antiferromagnetic interaction between the core and the shell is relatively large, as it is in xmath74. This fact is reflected in fig. b. and the hysteresis loops are driven by the coercivity and the remanent magnetization of the magnetic material. In contrast to static models, where the strength of the external field is not clearly changed with time, dynamic hysteresis is characterized by a dynamic symmetry loss at high frequency of the external field. Hence, the temporal spectrum and the amplitude of the external field amplitude depend on the coercivity and the remanent magnetization of the magnetic material. Hence, the selection of the temporal spectrum and the amplitude of the external field is necessary to achieve a pure mechanical phase transition (i.e., a transition that is induced by the magnetic field) . . . this choice of the temperature allows the system to undergo a phase transition which is purely mechanical (i.e., a magnetic transition). One can see that the remanent magnetization of the system is not affected by the variations in the time curve of the moment. However, if one considers the effects of the antiferromagnetic at xmath2 interactions, which are impossible to predict from the results shown in figure X. , there is an interesting phenomenon. We may observe in the following example the effect of antiferromagnetic At xmath2 interactions that can be accounted for, and that is to say, by the exceedingly strong Antiferromagnetic Aspect of the Interface, as X. . We know from the number xmath66 and xmath70 that the properties of the system do not change as the At xmath62 rises. But if the oscillation period is greater than xmath62, the Coercivity of the system is reduced to zero at high @ xmath62 values, whereas at low @ xmath62 the Coercivity becomes independent of @ xmath66. In the following analysis, we will study the effect of antiferromagnetic connections at xmath2, which are inexplicable in accordance with the results of Figure 7. It is shown that the magnetization values of the system do not change as the frequency of xmath62 increases. This effect is pictured in a (a) for xmath68, and b) for xmath71. The genesis of these phenomena can be interpreted by examining the time series of magnetizations. This computation has the origin in a weak ferromagnetic core coupling @ xmath1 and a strong antiferromagnetic inner contact @ xmath2 . The internal contact with a strong magnetic field, as shown in Figure [Fig. 9]b, can be magnetized on a strong magnetic field. As the magnetic field amplitude reaches the value of xmath70, the inner and outer magnetizations easily align with the external magnetic field. We have also observed these types of hysterics recently in circular ising nanowire systems, and in various molecular-based magnetic materials in the presence of static magnetic fields. The function of this phenomenon can be appreciated by analyzing the time series of instantaneous magnetizations. But, the three hysterics observed in the present system are probably unphysical, since the interfacial strength of xmath2 is usually regarded as about xmath86 in the polarity-bias systems of xcite. In this case, xmath71, (see fig. 9 b), the shell magnetization can align in the oscillating direction of the magnetic field, while the shell magnetization tends to align antiferromagnetically, because there is a strong interaction between xmath13 and a weak ferromagnetic interaction between xmath85 and the ferromagnetic interaction between xmath85 and ferromagnets. This results in a maximum phase lag between the magnetization of the core and shell layers, and consequently we observe a triple hy So as a final investigation, we will consider some of the size-dependent properties of the particle in a chosen set of hamiltonian and magnetic field parameters. b and c show the hysteresis curves of the total magnetization - xmath35 for the temperatures - xmath89 and - xmath90. b - c - as a result, the hysteresis curves of the total magnetization - xmath35 have been depicted for temperature values - xmath89 and - xmath90 in b and c . Moreover, the curve corresponding to - xmath93 (black squares) is peculiar, namely, that the coercivity of the system loses its symmetrical shape with increasing - xmath90, which may be considered as a signal of a dynamic phase transition . Moreover, the curve corresponding to - xmath93 (black squares) exhibits a peculiar behaviour - it is obvious from a 'black square' that the coercivity of the system loses its symmetrical shape, and the particle exhibits a dynamic phase transition from a paramagnetic to a dynamically ordered phase, with increasing -math91 values. The hysteresis curves correspond to Figure 11, a, b, and c for temperatures @ xmath91 and @ xmath96. The coercivity coefficients of the shell at xmath91 are shown in Figure 11, a. , title = fig: ", width = 283" , the hysteresis curves of the total magnetization at xmath35 are mapped to temperature values @ xmath89 and @ xmath98 , the corresponding hysteresis curves of the total magnetization at xmath35 are depicted in (b) and (c) respectively. The most remarkable feature of these figures is that the phase difference between the magnetization of the particle and the oscillating external magnetic field drastically reduces, the coercivity and remanent magnetization of the particle are zero in low and high temperatures, and the looping areas reduce to zero. Compared with Fig. 11 , he is clearly visible that the system exhibits large coercivity for high temperatures . . . The hysteresis curves of the total magnetization of xmath35 were plotted in Figures , b, and c, for the temperatures xmath91 and xmath96 . In this respect it is quite clear from the figures [a] and [b] that the maxima of the total magnetization curves increases with the increasing @ xmath91, but the total magnetization curves remain their forms, even if the particle size increases and the curves approach the mass limit with the increasing @ xmath91 values. (b) @ xmath99, @ xmath54, @ xmath70, and @ xmath57. However, if the temperature-induced maxima of the total magnetization curves increases, it changes from n-type to ordinary q-type, where we see monotonic decrease in the magnetization with increasing temperature. (c) @ xmath74, @ xmath76, @ xmath101, and @ xmath56. * It is clear from figures [3 ] a and b that although the system exhibits a ferrimagnetic order, we can not observe any compensating factor. The system was prepared according to the nel nomenclature. The magnetic property of the system was studied according to p-type, n-type and q-type classifications under certain conditions. Among the most noticeable observations that were made in the present study can be summarized in this way: we have observed that in the presence of surface irradiation (i.e. @ xmath54), the system has not exhibits any compensating phenomena. Moreover, we have found that the presence of a strong antiferromagnetic exchange (i.e. @ xmath71) is not sufficient to induce compensating events in the system. . . . a critical point of compensation in the system is the intensity of the external field. The numerical values of dynamic magnetization, particularly the total magnetization, i.e. the total magnetization in the core and shell, are determined so that the number of spins in the core and shell is different in the sphere of a magnetized system. Moreover, the existence of an excellent antiferromagnetic exchange in the interfacial region, it was found, is not sufficient for the occurrence of a compensating force. The most prominent observations in this paper can be summarized in three parts: a. In the first place, we modeled the hysteresis loop. Besides, it is possible to improve the present model to a more realistic one by imagining a simulation of the heisenberg-type hamiltonian with an assembly of interacting nanoparticles instead of a single particle. All of the observations outlined above show that the shape (amplitude and frequency) of the driving field and the particle size have an important influence on the thermal and magnetic properties, including coercivity, remanence and temperature of the particle. All of the equilateral properties of the particle, from paramagnetic to dynamically ordered, exhibit a variable behaviour of the particle, which in turn has a decreasing ferromagnetic shell, in response to an increased angular frequency, which would render the most immutably non-zero scenario in the presence of ultrafast fields. Moreover, the proposed model could be improved to describe more realistic systems by presenting an example of a hamiltonian hamiltonian with an assembly of interconnected nanoparticles instead of one single particle. For this, of course, the new technique of Nowak-Samuel . . . is just an attempt at dynamically calculating the dynamic parameters, which was introduced for the first time by now. This method, as it were, was introduced for the first time by nowak-Samuel . . . in the exchange bias systems the temperature-dependent properties of the particle have been analyzed. As a result of this, we found that the particle's magnetic and thermal properties have a major influence on the thermal and magnetic properties of the particle, such as coercivity, remanence and temperature compensation.
