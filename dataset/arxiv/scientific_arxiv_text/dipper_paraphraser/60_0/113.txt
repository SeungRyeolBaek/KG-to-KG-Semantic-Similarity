But in general it is generally difficult to find exact solutions of physical interest that describe the motion of bodies by analytic methods. Though it is possible to find exact solutions in many cases of interest, it is difficult and time-consuming to find them, and one may ignore some subtle effects and / or remain in ignorance of some basic general characteristic of the solutions. In general, a body of finite size depends on its composition and the internal state of its internal forces. Thus, if a body is confined to a fixed radius and is a black hole, then the point of the limit is already reached. Therefore, to determine the motion of a body in general relativity, such as binary neutron stars or black holes, one simply needs to provide appropriate initial data (complex) on a spacelike block, and then it is necessary to apply the data to the equation of the distribution. therefore, one could start with a treatment of the gravitational force by analyzing a metric perturbation, @xmath, in a background metric, @xmath, based on the stress-energy tensor of a   . therefore, it is of considerable interest to develop methods that yield approximate descriptions of the motion of the entities. Einstein's equation is nonlinear, and a simple analysis, @xcite, shows that the solution of the equation with a distributional stress-energy tensor, supported on a world-line, is not logical. – xmath11 – which is the covariant of the converging =delta function and  = math10 the proper =time along xmath11 . . . In this way, the calculus enumerated here is the ideal solution of a verisimilar geometry of the world line at xmath8 and  =math10 – the proper = time along =math8 – of course, if we use the form of a verisimilar geometry, we ignore the verisimilar geometry of the | of the || of the linearized equation and geodesic movement is assumed. This obstacle, however, was circumvented in « xcite and other references by modifying it as follows: ‘This equation alone has solutions for any verisimilar geometry and if the verisimilar geometry is joined together, the equations are equivalent to the verisimilar geometry of the equation, and geodesic motion can be enforced. However, in the above-mentioned section “Geodesic” we will see, the linearized structure of the particles demands that the geodesic surface be a geodesic of the background space. But since the verisimilarity of the geometry is so strong, it is necessary that the verisimilarity of the verisimilarity of the verisimilarity must be conserved. therefore, in solving the verisimilar form of the calculus of the linearized Einstein equation, one does not even notice that one has modified the verisimilarity of the equation, and there is no attempt to justify the modifications. It has been calculated using a differential equation of the upper half, the forward half, where the integral is taken in the retarded part, where xmath22 corresponds to the retarded part of the equation of the inner half, and where the green function for xmath is normalized with a factor of @xmath22, as a result of @xcite, and which is a combination of the two equations — eq — _br_(25)—, with @xcite , with a factor of @xcite , following @xcite. One approach to the interconnection of the energies with the motion due to _br_ (as a result of the requirement to move a particle on a geodesic of _br_) is almost certain to suffer extreme mathematical difficulties, just as the methods of _br_14 of _br_ are problematic in the re-determination of the motion of a small body (in no way concerned with the flow of _br_) is to be described by a sufficiently small body (with no _br_ incoming radiation _br_), in the manner of _br_15_ (i.e., the interior of the light-conducting) portion of the green s function is used, namely, _br_15__ of _br_, **. This type of mathematical method is particularly natural, however, in the face of its naturalism. It is another method _br_, _br__ of which, if a particle does not move on the geodesic of the predetermined prefix, it He detweiler and whiting deduced from the paper of detweiler and whiting. By way of example, there is a third approach, involving mino, sasaki, and tanaka, and later poisson , the third approach is based on burke , death , kates , thorne and hartle , and the third, involving mino, sasaki, and tanaka, which builds on burke , death, , kates , thorne and hartle , and others by the use of matched astymptotic expansions. a higher rigorous approach to the calculation of gravitational self-force is proposed by geroch and jang , and later geroch and ehlers , resolving the problem of geodesic motion of small bodies (see also xcite). In xcite, one takes a spacetime background metric and a smooth one - parameter family of stress-energy smooth tensors , satisfying the dominant energy condition and sustaining the world-tube. When one parameter reaches zero, the world-tube will collapse to a time-like curve. Therefore, the equations of motion of the body arise from the matching conditions. The third approach, taken by mino, sasaki, and tanaka, and later on, poisson, by retching from the previous work of burke, death, kates, kates, thorne and hartle, and others. As in @xcite and @xcite, we prove that the body (or black hole) is an element of the spacetime in which the body (or black hole) is located, and the balance of the xmath2 corresponds to xmath2 to the first order in @xmath2 , the correction for motion is described by a vector field, @xmath29, on @xmath8, which gives the infinite displacement of the new worldline. in the limit of @xmath27, the body (or black hole) shrinks down to a worldline, @xmath8. In this case, as in @xcite and @xcite, we prove that xmath8 must be the geodesic of the background spacetime, as in @xcite and @xcite. In this work, although the work of @xcite provides a rigorous definition of geodesic motion in a small body, it is not a promising method to derive gravitational force corrections to geodesic motion. In this paper, we will take an approach similar to that of @xcite, but we will take a different smooth, one-dimensional family of metrics - xmath0, where in effect, we have a body (or black hole) which scales to zero, in the same way, the size and mass of the body are proportional to xmath2 . This method will employ a number of preliminaries assumptions, including the form of the 'body' metric and its perturbations, the rate of change of these quantities with time, the imposition of certain gauge conditions, the imposition of boundary conditions in the body, and most importantly the step of lorenz gauge relaxation . Furthermore, in our approach, the notion of a 'point particle' is considered a concept that has been derived rather than assumed. It will also be seen in our method that the results are the same for all bodies (or black holes), and that the physical results are not dependent on a choice of gauge (though gauge itself is a Gauge dependent quantity, i.e., the description of the corrections to particle motion depend on the spacetimes of the gauges in different directions (see section (subsection) and appendix a) . . . although it is a rigorous first-order correction for geodesic motion, it will not be expected to give a good global-in-time approximation, because the small local corrections to the motion referred to by the equation may become large with time, and eq. would not give a good description of the perturbed motion when xmath29 grows large . . . It is for this reason that despite more than a century of study, there is no mathematically legitimate interpretation of the electromagnetic self-force on a charged particle. the methods of this paper can be used to rigorously formulate an expression for the electromagnetic self-force, by identifying suitable parameters of the coupled electromagnetic system. Nevertheless, we shall confine our consideration to the gravitational case. the precise, general conditions we impose on @ xmath0 are given in section . . . in this section, we describe the one parameter family of metrics @ xmath34, which we shall examine by examining the one parameter family of desitter spacetimes with a mass equal to @ xmath2 . we refer to this second way of taking the limit as @ xmath35 as the standard limit . the Standard Limit can be taken any time @ xmath37 on the worldline @ xmath8 . . . but we show that if we take the limit as @ xmath35 in another way and also scale the measure by @ xmath36 we obtain schwarzschild spacetime. . . . the SIGNAL MARKETS OF POWER IN THIS PORTION WANT TO BE STRENGED . . . and to remain constant. . . . . but to a certain extent that it is impossible to set the Limit as @ xmath35, a magnitude equal to the bounds of xmath8, in an asymptotically self-similar way. The precise, general Conditions of @ xmath0 are described in the second section . . . It is necessary that a small body or black hole always moves on a geodesic. In other words, to zeroth order in xmath2 a small body or black hole always moves on a geodesic. In this respect, as we have already said, the geometric perturbation associated with such a body or black hole corresponds to that of a structureless particle . . . as described in the introduction, we seek a one-dimensional family of metrics - xmath42 - that describe a material body or black hole that shrinks down to zero in an asymptotically self-contained sphere. and, as a matter of fact, the upper case latin indices - early in the alphabet (@ xmath40) will denote abstract indices; greek indices will denote the coordinate components of these tensors; latin indices from the middle of the alphabet (@ xmath41) will denote spatial coordinates. , - in the section - about calculation - we derive eq. as the first order in @ xmath2 correction to @ xmath8 in the lorenz gauge . In the section - about the Calculation - we deduce eq. as the first order in @ xmath2 correction to @ xmath8 in the Lorenz gauge . ( an appendix gives an explanation of the transformation to other gauges . ) finally, in section - beyond - we explain the status of the misataquwa equation. No field equations will take part in the discussion of this section; we prefer to use this example for its simplicity and familiarity. for each @xmath2 we can look for a portion of the spacetime which is a quadratic body or a black hole of mass at xmath49 in an asymptotically desitter spacetime . . . for the aforementioned interval xmath47, the spacetime is an abyssal spacetime, which extends straight to the worldline at xmath50, corresponding to where the body or black hole was just before it     disappeared. . . . . as Xmath42 is explained clearly in . . . the limit of a one-parameter family of metrics in xmath42 depends on how the spacetime manifolds at different intervals of xmath2 are identified. This identification of spacetime manifolds in a different interval, is achieved by selecting the coordinates @ xmath51 of each xmath2 and identifying points which are in the same coordinates @ xmath51. But there is another way of taking the limit of xmath42 to be xmath35. This is because of the view that the body / black hole shrinks to zero size and mass, and , as we have already been told, the outer gravitational field of a spherical body or black hole is thus shrinking to a value of xmath36. This enlargement of xmath36, as we have said, is to a value of xmath36. The second limit corresponds to the space-time representation of the observers at the events indicated by xmath36. Now suppose that this same family of observers changes units  by this same factor of xmath68, i.e., they use centimetres rather than meters to measure distances. To say the same of the two parameter family of metrics  xmath36, a unit of measure which is based on the principle of xmath36 exists, but is zero . so, this limit of xmath36 exists but is not very interesting. Then, if one considers the measuring-compass  xmath60 by  62, the limit of this measuring-compass is only  xmath64, that is,  xmath66 , then one observer will see that the body / black hole has shrunk by a factor of xmath68, and one observer will find himself 10 closer to the source  by this same factor  xmath66 . “Attained at fixed @ xmath51 ) as the 'ordinary limit' of @ xmath42 , and we will refer to the second limit (i.e., the limit as @ xmath35 of @ xmath69 taken at fixed @ xmath58 ) as the 'stack' of @ xmath42. The simultaneous existence of both of these limits contains many relevant information about the one-parameter family of spacetimes (‘eq. family’) . . . the existence of the first limit tells us that the body / black hole shrinks down to a worldline @ xmath8 with its mass falling to zero (at least) as quickly as its radius . . . , the body shrinks, and finally disappears, leaving a smooth background spacetime with a preferred world line, @ xmath8. . . . , width = .5 ] Let us now take the above example and remove the general conditions to impose upon one parameter . . . the solid lines illustrating this   ordinary limit ’ of @ xmath35, which is taken along paths that end from @ xmath70, that is, paths that intersect at @ xmath72, and connect at xmath8 . . . . and the metric xmath84 is jointly smooth in xmath85 for xmath85. So xmath84 is joint smooth in xmath85 for xmath85. , for all xmath2 and for xmath76, xmath42 is a vacuum solution of Einstein's equation. Here we have used the notation xmath87 to denote the components of xmath4 in xmath88, while xmath89 denotes the components of xmath90 in xmath88. it should be noted that the pre-set coordinates differ only by scale (and of origin) from the corresponding un-closed coordinates, so we have Xmath91, therefore Xmath92 because the factors of xmath2 are canceled by the definition of xmath90 and the coordinate rescalings. * , so, as a function of @ xmath97, let @ xmath97 denote a polar part of @ xmath98 in the coordinates of @ xmath73. In the sense of these new variables, we shall take the  ordinary limit  which implies that, for math107 and math106, math97 is smooth in math110, and math110 math110 math110. In addition, the last condition of the ordinary limit is that for math109 and math110 math109 math109, math110 math110 , math110 math110 . . . see figure Fig , 2limits - a. . . . but in this case, taking the ordinary limit math103 math104 , @ xmath103 is wretched at xmath104, whereas taking the scaled limit math105 math105 math105 math110 . . . and meanwhile, the last condition in the ordinary limit implies that for @ xmath109 and @ xmath107 , @ xmath97 is smooth in @ xmath110, even @ xmath111 . But if we recompense Xmath130 with a new, similar family, a family of parameters, in which the following are satisfied with our above assumptions about the ordinary and the scaled limits, but which are not at all convergent with Xmath121 at Xmath120 , namely, that Xmath131 may be a family of parameters in which the   curve of curvature is   , that is, at Xmath130 a coefficient of   ,  , at Xmath131. Suppose, for example, the time-time component of such a metric was varied as Xmath122 in terms of the original variables @ Xmath123, that is, the form @ xmath124, if we take the ordinary limit ( @ xmath35 at fixed @ xmath71) of @ xmath125, we find that @ xmath125 smoothly passes to @ xmath126 . . . so if we take the 'scalable' limit ( @ xmath127 at fixed @ xmath128), then @ xmath125 also goes to @ xmath126. "In the same way as [#39][44] ] [12] as follows: all the components of xmath42 in the coordinates of xmath51 are jointly smoothed by the variables xmath133, xmath120, fixed xmath134, where xmath110 and xmath95 are defined by eq. [47] , i.e., the relative homogeneity condition, is presented to us as the conditions imposed on xmath142. But we must note that the general family of spacetimes for xmath141 is inseparable, i.e., this portion of these spacetimes could equally well be filled with ordinary matter or a black hole, satisfying our assumptions. Our assumptions concerning xmath0, however, are closely related to the assumptions about the matched asymptotic expansion of our assumptions. As we shall see later, it may not be obvious at first glance that our assumptions concerning xmath0 are closely related to the assumptions in matched asymptotic expansions. As we shall see later, our assumption about the existence of an ordinary limit of xmath0 corresponds to the assumption that there is a A a Far Zone’ expansion; our assumptions on xmath0, on , are more closely related to our assumptions on , i.e., that the space-time which is contained in , , is not a part of our considerations, so it is only necessary that our conditions be sufficient for  xmath142 for some constant , it may be said that the xmath149th order term in xmath2 is a leading order term in xmath150 at small xmath70 , at least in the near-range condition , it has a leading order in xmath150 at a very small xmath70 . Nevertheless, arbitrarily high positive powers may occur in xmath70 at every xmath in xmath. Similarly, in view of eq. (button-push) we can expand xmath89 as xmath154, by further expanding xmath155 in xmath155 , we obtain xmath158 where xmath158 . . . We are going to call this equation a complication of xmath2 : xmath148 (irascible series) as the far zone expansion of xmath42. It is necessary to note that the angular dependence of xmath151 is further restricted by the requirement that the coordinate components of the metric component xmath152 be smooth at xmath50 when re-expressed as functions of xmath102 . . . in general, that is, that xmath151 can have no angular dependence . and we have thus observed that the background metric (as an example) is given by the metric (as an example) xmath161 where we have taken the metric that follows xmath162 for a numerical measure. – but the total power of a metric (xmath72) is of the highest order and is always allowed to be negligible – of course, there are, of course, some negligible powers of a metric whose origins in the field of perturbation are at the mercy of a distance. However, our  far zone expansion’, eq. ([eq]: rseries), appears to correspond closely to that range of the expansions of matched expansions of matched expansions. Besides, the fact that our “far zone” (19] is a relative rather narrow scale, requires a different  quasi-static’ or slow-time variation assumption to be used to formulate the metric perturbations. The difference between these two measures, as a rule, is that the combined powers of (xmath164) and (xmath72) are allowed to be as positive as the order in the perturbation theory. But, however, our  Near Zone Expansion ”‘” differs from  (19rseries) in that we define a separate expansion for each time math37, rather than a uniform uniform approximation with a single expansion. There is no assumption of the form of the metric for @xmath165, so we do not impose any boundary conditions at small @xmath72. In particular, as we have no assumption of the form of the metric for @xmath165, we do not impose any boundary conditions at a small @xmath72 . Finally, it is useful to express the consistency relation (which is a linear relationship) in a simple, differential form. – a beginning in which we have, by the way, the lowest terms of the far zone expansion eq (eq: rseries) as follows:   xmath164 +    o2  o2 , it can be interpreted as confirming that, to the first order in  xmath2, any body or black hole moves on a geodesic of the background spacetime . – and in fact, much more than this : we will prove that the worldline  xmath8 appearing in the assumption i in section [p. 11] is a geodesic of the background metric     . – in fact, we will prove that the worldline   – which appears in step (iii) of section [p. 11] is a geodesic of the background metric  – (q. – rseries) – then the short calculation shows that   – -  – . - This last relation implying that  –  is stationary, as we have already noted. It should be possible, as it were, to prove that  ’ had got filled in ’ with matter which satisfy the dominant energy condition, that   had got filled in ‘ with matter satisfying the dominant energy condition, that   had to be time-like. (One such possibility would be to choose fermi normal coordinates in the metric Xmath176. We must, however, stress that we have chosen these coordinates only for convenience, so that, e.g., the coordinate time coincides with proper time on xmath8, but it does not play any important role in our arguments.) Let  xmath179 denote the xmath180 part of the metric, and see that  xmath184 has the form  xmath184 where  xmath184 is the term that, multiplied by  xmath185 for any @ xmath186, disappears as  xmath186 . [A) if  is in the region of  in , and if  is in the dominant energy condition, then it should be possible to prove that  is time-like in . [B] A consequence of the analysis of this quantity is that it is a distribution on all spacetimes. Xmath191(14) as a distribution is the action of an arbitrary smooth, compact, and symmetric tensor field xmath199. xmath199 (the spacetime axis, as it were, was a axis of Xmath199) is given by Xmath199, h   ab   square root  d  4x = 0  ,  ,  , , ,   . in other words, the value of xmath199 as a axis of metric perturbation ([10] eq: series], even if all our spacetimes @ Xmath196, @ Xmath192, are excluded from the  source region », to xmath196, but with an equal probability of a tensor, an arbitrary axis, with a symmetrical support, given by xmath199, h - ab  sqrt  d - d - 4x = 0 , , ,  ,  - As a result, we can converge over the region @xmath205 and calculate the limit as @xmath206. Moreover, since the region @xmath205 is smooth, we can draw an easy approximation for the values of h -  d - g -    ab     - f -   ab  [1 - d - f -  h - cd - a f - cd - a d - , a ds - - - , - , , - ] eq - ( eq - analysis of functions -) - with the help of eqs - ( eq - series - series) and - ( eq - adjoint - current) , - , - xmath214, where Xmath214 is a smooth, symmetric, - xmath216, whose components are given in terms of suitable angular averages of xmath216 and its first derivatives. , -  , -  ,  , ,  ] and xmath214, where xmath212 -  , ,  ,  , - , - ][15], - so @ xmath212 = 0 $ [23] ] for xmath189 - the order at xmath207 It follows that, by eq. ( tn) the tensor field of xmath227 on xmath228 on spacetime, a tensor field of xmath227 must be such that for any arbitrary smooth vector field of xmath227 on spacetime, we have xmath228 for all xmath79 and for all xmath231 , we have xmath227 in parts of the form xmath229, where each xmath230 ( xmath231) is an arbitrary smooth function of compact support in xmath174, and xmath232 is a smooth function of compact spatial support, with xmath233 in a close vicinity of xmath8 . in other words, we have shown that xmath215 must take the form xmath237, where xmath7 denotes the unit tangent to xmath8 (i.e., xmath7 is the 4 - velocity of xmath8 . This method, according to which we have just described, is the justification for the concept of “point particles,” a definition that is plausible to the first order in xmath2 in the far zone. This description is valid irrespective of the size of the "point" (that is, to the first order in xmath2) of the body, namely, that is valid for arbitrary metrics of xmath42, satisfying the assumptions of xmath42. In the previous section we established that, to the zeroth order in xmath2, any body (or black hole) of nonvanishing mass moves on the geodesic of the background space. In this section we refer to xmath32 as the mass of the particle. Indeed, we claim that the result we have just derived is precisely what gives the justification for the idea of "point particles" , a concept that has played a major role in the classical physics for more than three centuries. This idea of point particles, however, does not have any mathematical foundation in nonlinear field theories like general relativity . In the previous section, we proved that, to the zeroth order in xmath2, a body (or a black hole) of non-vanishing mass moves on a geodesic of the background spacetime . ‘In the end, however, we have no wish to rely on a weak field’s assumption here, since we wish to describe the motion of small black holes and other ‘strong field’ objects. However, we do not wish to rely on any ‘soft field’ assumptions here, since we wish to describe the motion of small black holes and other ‘soft field’ objects. This second point should be observed. Suppose, in the case of the body at finite @ xmath249, the first order in @ xmath2 perturbative correction ‘ ‘’ (@ xmath248) denotes the supremum of the components of the Riemann curvature tensor of @ xmath61 in the soft’ region, then it should be possible to define a central mass  worldline at finite @ xmath249, and thus to characterize the movement of the body in that cite  . It is not clear how to associate a worldline with the body at finite @ xmath2 and, indeed, the body is excluded from the spacetime region we consider finite @ xmath2 and it is not clear what one would mean by a contrast correction to first or higher order in math2 . The time component I’ll now briefly remark upon the definition of the first order of perturbation. Now, however, let’s take the example of smooth is not smooth at @ xmath116. In order to clarify, let’s suppose we’re performing a smooth (if not smooth) at @ xmath164 on @ xmath8. This is clear, but clearly it is necessary to examine smooth @ xmath256 for our purposes. Alternatively, we may employ a smooth @ xmath256 and describe the same perturbed motion. So, our first order correction, @ xmath256, to the background geodesic motion, contains no useful information by itself, and, indeed, can always be set to zero by a smooth gauge transformation. Therefore, the first order correction, @ xmath256, in relation to the background geodesic motion, is of no importance and is, indeed, not determinate by any smooth gauge transformation. Therefore, @ xmath164 has two sets of mass (  electric sphere ) and angular momentum (   magnetic sphere ) multipole moments @ xcite, and the spacetime is characterized by the values of these two sets of multipole moments @ xcite . In order to see this clearly, it is necessary to consider smooth @ xmath255 for our consensual purposes. It is well known that, if the mass is nonzero, the mass dipole moment is   pure gauge' and can be set to zero by a choice of conformal factor /   origin . The mass dipole moment is the coefficient of  270 of this quantity, at order  239 . , from this equation we can see that at each   38  253from this equation we see that the   particle mass  at xmath32 is also   (particle mass) . from this equation we can see that the   particle mass     from the  source   (Particle)  is also   (particle mass ) of the long-range metric perturbation (see eq . (particle) ) is also   (maximum ratio)   . , we can then, by the method of eq .  rseries  ) we can see that at each       3   2 , if the , m ,  2,  -hof"  (pe) ) the mass,   ,   a 2, of the m -source  in the far zone metric perturbation (see eq . ) , the origin @ xmath283 of the corresponding nodal zone m2 on xmath285 is therefore the interpretation of the nodal point m2 of the body center. For example, we can always choose @ xmath291 to set the mass dipole moment to zero. , in particular, we can always choose @ xmath281 to set the mass dipole point to zero. To take advantage of this transformation, we will modify the movement of the body, to nodal m2 in math2. , by following the following steps: first, we shall choose our coordinates, math51, to nodal m2 to nodal m2 , and then we will formulate our coordinates, nodal m2 to nodal m2, and impose the requirement that @ xmath286 should be such that @ xmath276 be vanished for all @ xmath37 . As the nodal m2 location of the body in the new coordinates is @ xmath287, the first order perturbative correction for nodal movement will be @ xmath254, with the effect that the first order perturbative correction to nodal movement is @ xmath287 . It is well known in the sections [1], and in the section Geodesic, that the first-order perturbations of the background spacetime, xmath176, are due to the interactions between a point particle and self-force effects. In the next section, we will prove, by a lengthy calculation, that such a universal relation exists for xmath289, thus providing us with general equations of motion for all point particles, valid to first-order in xmath2. Finally, we note that, if we want to describe motion beyond first-order in xmath2, we will need to define a representative world line in the far zone to at least second-order in xmath2 . It is convenient to choose our coordinates @ xmath51 to zero-thorder in xmath2 as fermi-normal coordinates with respect to the background geodesic @ xmath8 and select these coordinates to first-order in xmath2 so that @ xmath293 satisfies the lorenz gauge condition @ xmath294, where @ xmath295 with @ xmath2 satisfies the lorenz gauge condition @ xmath294, where @ xmath295 with @ xmath2 satisfies the lorenz gauge condition @ xmath294, where @ xmath295 with @ xmath2 . – by combining this with the form of the background metric in fermi normal coordinates we obtain @xmath298, where the quantities @xmath299 and @xmath300 are defined by the following expressions, the fermi normal coordinates of the Riemann tensor of the background metric @xmath300 and @xmath303 are expressed by the following expressions, and namely, @xmath305 is the del –maxe retarded green function, normalized by a factor of @xmath306 and following @xcite . [9] Thus, when we use the symbol _xmath23 in the previous sentence, we use the symbol _xmath23 to show that the integral extends by the time of the retarded time – that is, only the tail – which (i.e., the inner part of the light cone) is used for the retarded time, so that a choice of the retarded solution (corresponding to the description of the expression _xcite_) is made well-defined. If we accept gravity to first order in Xmath2 there must be second order perturbations. In order to achieve this we will have to follow the expansion of Xmath42 slightly beyond eq. ([q.] metric]) (note: 'math'313 signifies the second order perturbation of Einstein, i.e., the second order perturbation of Xmath311 satisfies the second order einstein equation, which is expressed in ,414.) a special solution of eq. - a geometrical metric (q. ji) is found. The second order perturbation of xmath311satisfies the second order einstein equation, which has the form   xmath313, that is, a linearized Schwarzschild metric in isotropic, (see eq. , metric)) it is obvious that there is a special solution of eq. (q. ) (since the metric xmath315 corresponds to the linearized schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates (see eq. ) ) When choosing a gauge to first order in @xmath2 (see Section 12:30) they can’t choose a gauge to second order in @xmath2 because a gauge to second order in @xmath2 is not bound to change the mass dipole moment of the background scaled metric – xmath330. (Our @xmath330 is contingent on the time of the event.) So we can put @xmath330 in for @xmath328, and so let’s say the lispa line is found at xmath333. . . . with the lispa line of the linearized Einstein equation, wretchedly, the equation is @xmath329. The lispa line is @xmath329, and the lispa line is @xmath330, and where lispa line is @xmath335 and @xmath337 respectively, and where lispa line is an antisymmetric equation, lispa line, and lispa line are not spatially connected, and where lispa line is defined by eq. . We now follow the strategy described in Section S-53—dipoles—. We consider a smooth straight line of the form, @ xmath349, and choose math386 to make the mass dipole moment of @ xmath350 vanish for all @ xmath37. _   alpha  beta                          _    _  j     _      _           alpha  beta        alpha  s                   (  hat  r                                  alpha  beta t -  alpha  s  beta  - j - p - i, 0 - m - a - i, 0 -  right -  - left -  frac  1 -  hat   bar  r     2 - i -   - bar  x   i -    bar  x   i -     -            -   alpha  beta   -     - - -  -  -   -    alpha      gamma  hat                                 - –    3   right) –  hat   bar  t    2  o – left (  frac  1 –  hat   bar  r       – bar  r      – o – left (   lambda  3 ) –  –  –  –  – –  –  – – o – left (  – frac  1 –  hat  – bar  r    –  – o – left (  frac  1 –  – hat – bar –  –  –  –  –  –  – o – left ( frac  1 –  – hat – bar – r –  –  – o –  –  – , – o –  – end – split –  – , we can use einstein ’s equation for this, and thus, we get neither the far zone nor the far zone, which is a perfect match for the far zone. we therefore set @ xmath372 for all @ xmath174. although we have solved’ for @ xmath281 in eq. (ap), we have learned nothing useful about the motion. 1 This article is therefore recast as: to solve enough of the second-order equations for the mass dipole moment and therefore to calculate the movement . . . , it is clear from eq. (eq., scaled-metric) that @ xmath370 is the mass dipole moment of @ xmath371 at the time @ xmath373 . , we set @ xmath372 for all @ xmath174 . . . we emphasize that no new information can be generated from the near and the far expansions, for they have already been completely matched ’t a little in terms of eqs (eq., rseries) . , which will be used in the course of this experiment, and the mass perpendicular terms as zero, will be used in the course of this experiment. (eq: scaled-metric) is as follows: @ xmath356  a   a    bar  x  i  bar  x  j + 2 a   alpha i  beta j  a  i  bar  x  j  h     alpha i  beta j  a    bar  x  i  gamma            alpha i  beta j                            alpha i  beta j   bar  x  i                           ( alpha On the other hand, we see that the terms of order xmath270 and higher in the background scaled metric cannot be added to the linearized ricci tensor to order xmath377 . We are able to calculate one very useful piece of information by extracting the magnetic part of the linearized ricci tensor that is, even when the metric is turned in time , because of the symmetries of the background metric , only the magnetic part of the metric perturbation can be added to the linearized ricci tensor . We thus conclude that there are eight types of tensor spherical tensor spherical symmetries . . . . six harmonics, which correspond to the indices of a labeling table, are of electric origin. We thus obtain one very useful piece of information by enumerating the xmath380, magnetic part of the linearized ricci tensor that is not reversed in time . . . the three vectors on these coefficients correspond to the three different -values of a labeling table for each xmath380 harmonic. After this, we can now get the information on Xmath281 which is in the near zone of the second order einstein equation - Xmath399 - and obtain the whole xmath398 from the first order Einstein equation - Xmath399 - in a vacuum linearized einstein equation - , we can, by means of eq. (eq.) (doped-down - 1 ) in the linearized einstein equation and set the xmath377 part to zero . therefore, the only term that contributes to the xmath377 and the magnetic part of the linearized ricci tensor of the linearized ricci tensor is  xmath377 . thus, the only term that contributes to the order Xmath377 to the  , magnetic spherical part of the linearized ricci tensor is      . therefore, we will not directly calculate the relations arising from the linearized Einstein equation here . . . That is, the terms in this quantity can be divided into the following general forms: (i) @ xmath403; (ii) @ xmath404; (iii) @ xmath405 where @ xmath405 denotes a christoffel symbol of the background scaled metric; (iv) @ xmath407; and (v) @ xmath408. by examination of eq. ( eq: scaled-off2) it might appear that the terms being @ xmath184 and @ xmath414 can neither provide nor do anything for the enumerable-yet linearized equation of the perturbation @ xmath413. Thus, it is possible to treat xmath413 as satisfying the homogeneous, vacuum linearized equation of Einstein. , we shall see that by approving eq. (   metric2), it can be gathered that all the terms may provide for the enumerable the Algebraic. , but that is not hard to understand. Moreover, the total contribution of xmath184 and xmath414 to the equation of the far zone of the linearized Einstein equation will be over-constrained. However, it is not difficult to show that the total contribution to the enumerable @ xmath184 and enumerable @ xmath414 is lost by the fact that the metric xmath171 is an answer to Einstein's equation, and the expression proportional to xmath2 in eq. We shall now turn to the terms in Xmath413 that may help to supplement the ricci. We will start with the ricci-electric part of the ricci-electric tensor of Xmath413. This ricci-electric part, which is cyclic, is cyclic under time reversal, will be written as Xmath418. But the cyclic part of Xmath425 can be combined with the cyclic part of Xmath419, and also under time reversal, to produce a contribution to the linearized ricci-electric tensor of the correct type. We shall now consider the terms in Xmath413 which may be bound to the ricci-electric. The term 'xmath425' is of no xmath424 character. But the cyclic part of Xmath425 can be combined with the 'xmath425' spine term '' @ xmath426 in the background scaled metric to produce an intrinsic contribution to the linearized ricci-electric tensor. . . . though it might be desirable to fit these expressions in order to determine the universalism of the model, we need to examine relations that do not include the xmath436 and xmath437 , that is, the vanishing of the value, time derivative, and second time derivative of the mass dipole at xmath37. The first equation consists of xmath439 and xmath439 and does not limit the motion . . . however, the second equation gives the desired equations of motion. Here we have a long calculation which produces xmath434 by the avowed inverse of the einstein equation xmath435 , so that we have six linear equations for our 11 unknowns. Note that this equation is given by a the homologous square root of xmath435 and not by a linear fraction of xmath439 , this is a temporary derivative of xmath439, but a second equation produces the desired equations of motion. The third condition of this equation is made from the first order in the near zone , which we did not well understand. It can be shown that there are two such relations in the theory of near-zone perturbation, the disappearance of the value, time derivative, and the second derivative of the mass dipole at time  xmath37 , it can be shown that at time xmath37 there are only 28, namely 416 621 - sent> (eq. eomcov - 2s) - a contribution of the higher multipole moments doesn't appear in our equation because it scales to zero faster than the spin dipole moment, and therefore it should occur at a higher order in @ xmath2 in our perturbation. Finally, we note that although our analysis has many points of contact with previous analyses using the same asymptotic expansions, there are many significant differences . we have already noted that in other approaches to self-force in @ xcite , what corresponds to our scaled metric at xmath38 is assumed to be of Schwarzschild form. . . . in these other approaches first order perturbations in the near zone expansion are treated as time independent, and are required in order to do so . . . in this second term is the geodesic deviation equation, and appears because the perturbed worldline is not, except at special points, correlated with the background worldline. .. the final term is the  gravitational self-force', which is seen to be of the form of a regularized gravitational force from the particle's own field. . . . as already mentioned at the beginning of the section sec: dipole , this quantity of xmath29 is a disaster vector (disaster) defined on the geodesic background, and is, therefore, guaranteed to give a good approximation to the disturbance in the geodesic movement, as math35 . finally, the gauge conditions imposed on the motion are also different: in math165, the electric part of what corresponds to the second order near zone is set to zero, without justifying the electric part, and therefore does not have any obvious interpretation of the  center of mass. Besides, our no mass dipole' condition applies to the no mass dipole's metric, and has been justified as a source of no mass center of mass  . in math255, for example, the quantity math29 in eq. is a vinve vector defined on the background geodesic xmath8 that describes the first order in xmath2 perturbation of the motion. However, this guarantee is of the form that if one wants to describe the movement accurately up to time xmath174, it will always be possible to choose math174 for a given parameter family of spacetimes math42 that satisfy the assumptions stated in section : example , eq. is therefore guaranteed to be accurate at xmath2 . - is to be continued to treat motion as a small deviation from @xmath8 , but that doesn't mean that the perturbative description is accurate when the deviation is large . . . It is clear that the exact description of motion at xmath447 becomes very large at a very late time, and it is clear that the approximate description of motion at xmath447 is not good, because when xmath447 becomes large, the motion can't be accurately described in the sense of being a 'small correction' to xmath8 . . . in essence, as soon as the deviation from xmath447 is very large, the second order corrections are comparable in magnitude to the first order corrections, so the second order corrections are comparable to the first order corrections, and so xmath447 is not correct. However, the main purpose of the first order corrections is to calculate motion in the case of spirals, in which the deviations from the original geodesic are very large at such late times. Thus, it is clear that eq. is not worth the trouble in calculating long-term effects, such as spirals. Only by going through all the orders in perturbation theory can we get an accurate, global in time description of motion. It is necessary, however, that one consider the following example: the cooling of a black body. As we will see, it is a fairly simple problem: let us consider a body (such as a lump of coal), put in a box with perfect reflection walls, and cut a hole in the wall. This hole will be closest to the geodesic, which will give a better approximation of the motion for that part of the time. At the limit of many such patches with short time intervals, the result will be a single 'self-consistent' differential equation, which will well approximate the motion, if it remains in the Geodesic. However, let us consider an example of a one-parameter family of cavities, where @xmath82, in a complex range of cavities, is completely zero, at least at xmath35 . This is a very difficult problem, since the body will not remain in thermal equilibrium through the hole , as the energy is passed through the hole . . . . , it is, therefore, important to determine how the energy of the body changes with time. if we take the first order perturbation theory and study the energy in xmath2 to be satisfied, the initial order in xmath2 is as small as a normal wavelength of the radiation (which, as is the case when we take the first order perturbation theory), the energy in satisfies becomes small compared with the typical wavelengths of the radiation . . . That only the smallest temperature, math460, is to be found on the right side of the equation, because the quantity math466 is already first order in math2; that the effect of any change in temperature would be primarily due to the higher order in math2. Thus, first-order perturbation theory approximates the behavior of math468, as math469 is, though this is good in the beginning, it is terrible in the late stage, because it predicts that the energy will be negative. Therefore, although perturbation theory from math2 has some unfavourable results at early times, it is also the first-order perturbation theory that has an excellent accuracy at all times. However, there is an obvious major improvement that can be made by observing that if math468 is sufficiently small, then the body should remain near thermal equilibrium when it loses energy. Thus, if math468 is sufficiently small, then the body should be described by math470 when added to the formula math471 which relates energy to temperature in the body when the body is in thermal equilibrium, and this equation will be an excellent description of the cooling of the body at all times. Thus, although the first-order perturbation theory produces poor results at late times, the first-order perturbation theory produces very poor results at all times , as long as it is localized, at all times. " These equations are usually written down for systems which are able to describe themselves in time, but in which a small deviation from the simple solution is observable. " 'Constantia' is an equation which corresponds to the application of first-order perturbation theory to a background which undergoes changes resulting from the perturbation. But the following criteria seem to be suitable for a self-contained perturbative equation: (a) it should have a well-defined initial value; (2) it should have the same number of degrees of freedom as the first-order perturbative equation, so that the correspondence between the initial-time equations of the self-contained perturbative equation and the first-order perturbative system can be made quite clearly; (3) for the first-order perturbative equations the solution to the self-contained perturbative equation is close to the solution of the first-order perturbative equations of the first-order perturbative system; (3) the solutions of the self-contained perturbative equation must be close to the corresponding solutions of the first-order perturbative system, over the time interval for which the first-order perturbative description must be accurate. and if one could find a self-contained perturbative equation satisfying all these criteria, it would not be impossible to find one for any given system. , we have dropped the term "dot" as a last resort. The work was supported in part by a nsf grant Phy 05 - 56619 to the university of chicago, and by a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship to sg. (although no mathematical analysis of this integro-different system was performed, it seems plausible that our above criteria (1, 2), (1, 3) were satisfied by the equations of the misataquwa. a well-nigh perfect solution of eq. ((disa2 - 1 - 2), would be an excellent candidate of perturbative equations for corresponding to the above first order perturbative system) since, in the perturbative equations, the deviation from the self-consistent worldline disappears. * But, as we have already stated at the end of the section on example (see equation) above (see equation) the allowed coordinate freedom includes any transformations which are not smooth at xmath50. For such fluctuations may arise in practice in singularity along a string @ xcite, and therefore do not satisfy our assumptions . . . but here, in the case of a smooth gauge change, the description of motion changes by eq. [2]|(3]|. if so, then it will be a good, global in time description of motion for the extreme mass ratio inspiral . As the cube of first-order Gauge Transformations on second-order Problems. To satisfy the limits of allowed gauge transformations (see Equation), the components of @ xmath480 must be of the form @ xmath480, i.e., @ xmath485 is equivalent to the derivative operator associated with the background metric @ xmath171 . by eqs. ([xiform],] dg200, [dg100], we see that the induced change in the mass-dipole Moment is @ xmath486; and therefore, @ xmath486 can be extracted from the formula @ xmath487, where ds is the area element on the sphere of radius @ xmath488 . thus, we have at our disposal the induced change in the Mass-Dipole Moment, @ xmath486, where xmath32 is the mass of the body. .. This is the first-order Gauge Transformation of the second-order Measurement. The change in the deviation vector described by the perturbed worldline is @ xmath498, whereas the change in the loop around the worldline is @ xmath499, provided by eq. (eq: gauge-law) and, for the sake of simplicity, we have omitted the spin term. It is not clear how we may want to modify the evolution equations for the metric perturbations in the new gauge. It is not clear how one would want to modify the evolution equations for the metric perturbations in the new gauge (one would have to simply rewrite eq. (eq. eom-law) and add the additional eq. (eq. eom-law) to obtain the desired equation of motion in an arbitrary allowed gauge, the terms of components of eq. xmath504 must still be computed in the lorenz gauge. Suppose we have a self-consistent perturbative equation associated with the new gauge (eq. eom-law) (reference eq. eom-law) , we may also write eq. (eq. eom-law) so that we have the following eq.
