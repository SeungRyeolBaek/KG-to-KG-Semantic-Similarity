if you were to perturb a black hole from outside, whether it returned to its original state after a while, or whether the perturbation, which it does not admit of, produces the instability of the black hole. In general, the dynamical evolution of perturbations of a black hole can be classified into three stages, the first of which consists of a sudden outburst of waves corresponding entirely to the initial perturbing field, the second of which consists of damped oscillations, known in the literature as quasinormal modes (qnms), whose frequency becomes a complex number, the real part represents the oscillation frequency, the imaginary part a damping, which is totally dependent on the background and not on the field causing the perturbation, and therefore of enormous importance to the modes used to calculate the black hole parameters (mass, charge, and angular momentum) . The study of black hole perturbations remains an extremely interesting topic which has tremendously affected various important properties of a black hole. In general, the study of black hole perturbations is classified in three stages: the first stage is an initial wave, depending completely on the initial perturbation, the second stage is damped oscillations, known in the literature as the quasinormal modes (qnm), whose frequency is a complex number, the real part represents the oscillation frequency and the imaginary part represents the damping. in the third case, a kinetic tail with the final stage of activity. But we shall discuss the second of these three stages of black hole evolution in a regular black hole background in asymptotically de sitter space-time. We will deal with the second of the above three stages of black hole evolution in a regular black hole background in asymptotically de sitter space-time. In general, the sitter space tends to be a maximally symmetric solution to the vacuum Einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant. Other than that, it is well known that general relativity is plagued by the appearance of singularities. This problem of avoiding singularities in general relativity is the most fundamental one, and it is an extremely ancient one. Here, on the other hand, we know that general relativity is plagued by singularities. In general, the problem of avoiding singularities in general relativity is one of the most fundamental and has been the subject of considerable research for some time. But, in general, we will examine the second of the three stages of the evolution of black hole perturbation in a regular black hole background in the sitter space. These solutions of such regular black holes with non-singular geometry satisfy the weak energy condition of the black hole were obtained by Bardeen, which is now known as the bardeen black hole. The Author of this paper took the work of Fernando Xcite and threw it into a special type: an enlightened version of its style of annotated ‘dragon-shallow’, which is the theory of a density-sealer in such a black hole. But since this type of black hole was not yet known to exist, the system of the dirac-field was relatively little studied. Thus, in addition to the scalar perturbations, it was more interesting to investigate the dirac-field perturbations in the usual black hole backgrounds. In this particular study, cations are made up of the cations in a black hole, and the corresponding cations in a vacuum, although the cations of cations are not terribly new, the cations of cations are less studied, and, so, one might be interested in studying cations of cations in the regular black hole background in a vacuum. In the following section, we will briefly examine the cations of the bardeen de sitter (and henceforth cations of cations of cations) black hole, after the work of Fernando ‘In a particular case of the black hole, there are three probable roots – one corresponding to the cosmological horizon, and the other to the cosmological horizon. In a particular case, in a black hole of bds, there are three probable roots – the inner and outer horizons, and the cosmological horizon – there is the possibility of obtaining a real root corresponding to the cosmological horizon for a set of parameters, or a degenerate root corresponding to a merger of the inner and outer black hole horizons for a range of parameters, i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., the klein-gordon equation for a massless scalar field is i.e., i.e., which explicitly takes the form i.e. i.e. , i.e., i.e., x. ; the interesting character of bds geometry is that it has a non-separable structure everywhere. Moreover, it is shown in i.e., that the event horizon is larger in i.e. i.e. compared to i.e. . . . but it was observed in i.e. This is an example of the fifth order wkb-r method, developed by @xcite . the sixth order wkb-r method is more accurate than the third order, and in fact is almost equivalent to the numerical integration of the wave equation @xcite for low overtones, that is, modes with small imaginary parts, and for all xmath32-xmath32-xmath32 . Thus, from this time on, we will only talk about xmath33-xmath32 modes. The sixth order wkb-r method is more accurate than the third order, and the latter in fact is almost in the process of putting together the whole numerical equation for the xcite , that is, of the lowest frequencies, the lowest at the outer horizon of the black hole, as described in xcite . , . note that the potential @ xmath29 is also @ xmath30. Similarly, the potential @ xmath29 is also @ xmath30 , in xcite it can be clearly seen from the graph of the scalar potential to the radial coordinate (), if different values of the multipole number () are to be compared, the @ xmath32 mode has a distinct local minimum between the outer horizon of the black hole and the cosmological horizon (see fig. 1 ) which was also noted in xcite .

We have taken the klein-gordon equation as in equation ([as in equation]), and finally we have the schrdinger equation with a modified effective potential, @xmath63, where the tortoise coordinate @xmath24 is related to @xmath25 by @xmath26. We have made a definite assumption that the black hole space-time is static, symmetric and asymptotically flat. This assumption is only assumed by the fact that the black hole space-time is static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat. However, there is a non- trivial example of non-asymptotically flat near-extreme schwarzschild de sitter black hole space-time. Furthermore, a method is used to calculate the eikonal limit by the wkb method. We choose the ansatz as in the equation (the ansatz) and finally we have the schrdinger-like equation and modified effective potential as @xmath63 where the tortoise coordinate @xmath24 is related to @xmath25 by @xmath26. He proceeded to calculate, according to the numerical table, the qn frequencies of the qn and qn frequencies of the qn, with a description of the qnms of the same parameters. In table ii, we calculate the numerical values of qn frequencies with the different parameters of qn, as defined by the qn constant. Since qnms are known to be the waves that are in the center of this potential xcite, we expect that the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency varies with a decrease in qnms, while the real part of qnms increases with increasing qnms. As we have discussed in qcite, we expect the same thing for bds-black hole, that the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequencies decreases with increasing xmath62, while the real part of qnms increases with increasing qnms. [13] In table ii we plot the values of the numerical values of qn frequencies with corresponding parameters. Since we know that wkb method is more accurate for xmath71, we only plotted the frequencies of qnms for xmath71. As in massless case, we plot the qnms frequencies with xmath13 and xmath56 for xmath57 and xmath70. The magnitude of xmath41 is decreasing with increasing scalar mass, and the magnitude of re (@ xmath41) increases with increasing scalar mass. However, the real part of qnms increases with increasing scalar mass. In this section we will extend our discussion to massless dirac disturbances for bds black holes. The effective potentials are given by @xmath77, the height of the potential increases with @xmath13, and the im (@xmath41) increases with @xmath13. We will calculate the quasinormal modes by solving the equation [sc1] by only xmath77, since we know that dirac particles and anti-particles have the same quasinormal spectra @xcite. a schrdinger-like equation has been obtained, so we will say that for scalar field perturbations with the large mass of the current, the oscillations decay faster with the large cosmological constant @xmath13, and the oscillations are more active with the large magnetic charge @xmath56. In this section, we will extend our discussion to massless dirac perturbations for bds black holes. a, we have shown the behaviour of the effective potential (at xmath77 only) for bds black hole with spherical harmonic | xmath70 | xmath77 | xmath25] vs xmath25 for different values of xmath31 for massless dirac perturbations, wid=25 ] , we have computed massless fermions semi-analytically with sixth order wkb method . . . . but as we increase the cosmological constant, the imaginary part of the frequency increases, but, when we increase the magnetic charge, we increase the other parameters. Then, we examine how the frequency scales as a function of the mass of the field, the multipole number, the scalar number, the magnetic charge (@ xmath31), and the frequencies from low to high overtones, taking into account different wkb orders, we find that the comparative accuracy is better for @ xmath81. We study how the frequency scale varies with the mass of the field, the multipole number, the multipole number, the magnetic charge, the scalar mass (@ xmath32) and the magnetic charge (@ xmath56) for scalar (both massless and massive) perturbations, and dirac perturbations, but i m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m Some authors, however, have been using the conformal properties of the spinor field to obtain the dirac quantities for the schwarzschild-tangherlini black hole; they have also described these types in the light of so-called split fermions, where quarks and leptons exist on different branes to maintain the stability of proton atoms; such split fermions are also massive fermions, and it will be interesting to study these massive dirac quantities in the context of higher-dimensional generalization of black holes. - 102 - 151102 birmingham d, sachsii and solodukhin sn 2002 - rev. - d66 - 104026 horowitz g t and hubeny v e 2000 - phys ... d66 - 00409 cardoso v and lemos a 2000 phys ... d67 - 104026 - b86412 konoplya r and zhidenko a 2011 phys ... abott h - p et al. 2015 - phys ... d773 ... d66 ... f 0 ... t   , berti e, cardoso v and starinets a 2009 - class . . . * 0110 , 034 strominger a 2001 jhep . . . d68 , 124017 konoplya r a and zhidenko a 2004 jhep . . . d68 , 124017 konoplya r a and zhidenko a 2004 jhep . . . d68 , 124017 konoplya r a and zhidenko a 2004 jhep . . . . . . . d69 , 124017 konoplya r a and zhidenko a 2004 jhep . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . - 5470 d. brill, and j. a. wheeler, rev. d. r. - shoy d. a. , d. t. - p. 291 - l34 iyer s, d. c m. astrophys . . . rev. d79 - 064016 akira ohashi and masa aki sakagami - Phys . . . d. d. d. d. l. . . . y. - d. . . akira ohashi and masa aki sakagami - classical and quantum gravity . . .
