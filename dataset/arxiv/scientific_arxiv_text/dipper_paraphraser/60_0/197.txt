A very important fact is that dna molecules have been subjected to intense research, both theoretically and experimentally. From all these studies of charge migration in the dna molecule, it is clear that there are two mechanisms for the transfer of charge, according to the structure and parameters of the dna, which are superexchange and incoherent hopping . Hence, the charge migration leads to the change in geometry between the nucleotides and the surrounding environment, which greatly contributes to the transfer of charge. We propose, therefore, to calculate the electronic coupling between the two nearest nucleobases, their charge distribution and their inner-sphere reorganization energy, when they are placed in the (a-t) - xmath1 and g-c - xmath1 oligomers. This is so, as it is said, in the decentralization of the electrons, to the whole quantity of the charged particles, and the formation of the inner-sphere, and the excitation of the outer-sphere, as well as the degree of change in the nano-structural characteristics. The discovery of charge-mimicry in dna molecules has opened new avenues to study various possibilities, from its role in the oxidation and repair of dna, to the application of dna in nano-electronics. However, our research focuses on the elemental structure of the dna molecule, which is to say that it contains two groups, which are based on the dna structure, the superexchange charge-mimicry and the incoherent hopping , i.e., If charge migration is taking place in weakly interacting systems, such as in dna molecules, the electronic transfer rate of electrons is standard high-temperature nonadiabatic electron transfer rate @ xmath6 where @ xmath6 is the electronic donor-acceptor matrix element and fc is the franck- condon factor. In sect. iii a, we simulate the electronic transfer of the nucleobases in the (a-t) @ xmath1 and (g-t) @ xmath1 oligomers by means of the quantum chemistry of the jaguar 6 . . . the homogonalized electron transfer coefficient of the dna molecules is indicated by a simple expression for the deviation of the electro-mechanical connection of the sequence number @ xmath2 by a simple expression of rhf / 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 . thus the 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 basis is acceptable. Moreover, in the past, in the result of some previous investigations, it has been proved that extension of the circuit does not have much influence on the electro-mechanical coupling . , the interaction between the molecule with the solvent environment is included in the outer sphere reorganization energy, while the relaxation of the acceptor, the donor and the bridge geometry are included in the inner sphere reorganization energy xmath13 . the reorganization energy xmath15 is the energy to remove an electron from the neutral geometry, and xmath23 is the energy to add an electron to the neutral geometry, where xmath16 and xmath17 are the hole-doer and the hole-acceptor. fc factors on the effect of the vibronic interaction on the energy of charge and are described in the figure  Xmath10 , where xmath11 is the free energy of the reaction, and xmath12 is the reorganization energy. a reorganization energy in math15 is the energy to remove an electron from the acceptor, math17, and math23 is the energy to add an electron to the donor, math17. The results of the hf method are shown in table [tab] of the table. First we consider the stacked structure of two stacked duplexes. We tested the use of the hf method and the dft theory for the vertical ionization potential (Vip) calculations and found considerable qualitative and quantitative disagreement between the hf and experimental data, and therefore we think that the becked-p86 method is appropriate. The results for the highest occupied base orbital (hobo) are shown in table [tab] [tab]: table . For oligomers where the pyrimidine and the purine bases are stacked in the same strand (a-t - t - a, g-c - c - c - c), for some of the hobo orbitals are delocalized, but the electronic coupling is weak. Similarly, for the case of the pyrimidine - pyrimidine and purine - purine, the hobo orbitals are delocalized only over the two strands, and therefore the weak interstrand and interstrand coupling can be considered. and, as we have already stated, the association of a-t and a-t with the duplex of a-t is mutually dependent on the overall electric potential of the system. According to our data, with the elongation of the (a-t) and the g-c (a-t) (a-t) @xmath1 oligomers the slighting of the base pairs contributes most importantly to the calcification of each nucleobase and the reduction of the a-t as well. In the case of a dna duplex oligomers (a-t) @xmath1 and a-t @xmath8), as we have already seen, @xmath30 depends on the structure of the chain. The elongation of the (a-t) @xmath1 and a-t @xmath1 oligomers is the main contributing factor to the deformation of the geometry of each nucleobase and the deformation of the @xmath30. The results of the same equation [fig.3] are given in Fig. 4] and are seen in Figure [fig.4] in which the decrease in @xmath14 is due to the contribution of the rotation and translation of the base pairs relative to each other and the letting go of the charge. o–b, p–h+ g+ c+ xmath+ , are calculated with ub3p86 = 6 – 311 – xmath+ – . – o-b - - xmath+ – o-b – g+ - o-b, - xmath+ – -o-b – o-b – o-b – o-b and – g+ – g+ – g+ – g+ – g+ – g+ – - o-b – - -o-b for the a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b-a-c- - g+-c- – - – i-i-v. the model results for =x-mx+t is in agreement with the results in ref. -oc- et ce-m-et ce-c-i-et ce-m-et ce-m-et ce-, incl. and - g+c-- x-mx=x-axis. The amount of the charge in the oligomers in the oxidized state, is the maximum extent of geometry relaxation in the centre of the dna chain. , the angular distribution of orbits in oligomers with the hobo occupying the central nucleobase is seen to be the major cause of the appearance of a charge on the base pair at the very center of the chain.
