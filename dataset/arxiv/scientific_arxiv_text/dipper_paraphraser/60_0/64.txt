we study the problem of finding solutions of non-homogeneous double-confluent heun equations that are monodromy eigenfunctions. We study the monodromy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of homogeneous double-confluent heun equations and non-linear equations modeling the josephson effect in superconductivity. Our study is motivated by applications to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of homogeneous double-confluent heun equations and to non-linear equations modeling the josephson effect in superconductivity. Our main results, their existence and uniqueness (theorems ‘noncom’) are described in section 1; section 4 and 5. we study the family of double-confluent heun equations in xmath17. The main result, namely the second theorem ‘noncom’, is to be found for each eigenfunction in xmath17: there exist holomorphic functions in xmath17 on the laurent coefficients of the function in xmath17. The proof of the above-mentioned results is based on studying these recurrence relations. One of the main results, the existence and uniqueness of the following theorems (noted in subsection 1 and in subsection 2); this proof is based on hyperbolic concepts and an ideal definition of the optimal mapping of the constraint . The following equation (heun) has a monodromous eigenfunction with a eigenvalue of @ xmath19, @ xmath5 and a corresponding vector @ xmath35 , if and only if the corresponding vectors @ xmath35 are proportional. the corollary will be proved in the next subsection. The explicit formulas for the functions @ xmath29 and @ xmath33 together with an explicit form for equation (schivka) will be given in section 3 . The existence of a solution by the equation xmath43 from the equation xi = 0 and the explicit expressions for @ xmath43 and the corresponding function @ xmath44 (with an explicit form for equation schivka) will be proved in the next subsection. The problem of the existence of a solution holomorphic on the 0 of the equation (heun) (which is automatically complete, i.e., holomorphic on xmath30) has been studied by v. m.buchstaber and s. i. tertychnyi in xcite . Then it was solved in the form of the formula cxi , p. 337. in the form of the formula cxi . . . as the following corollary will show, the principle cxi - 0 - if and only if it is the solution of the equation heun - xmath44, where xmath44 is the function from cxi - 0 , as is well known, and is not a derivative of the theory cxi - 0 , the statement of the rule "" [xi = 0] . . . . . . [I] (11), p. 337, "314 ""[15]] , the statement ""[16] [16], ""; and thus the contradiction, which proves the corollary. . . . I have just studied loc. cit and xcite, and all this is reduced to a series of conjectures, on polynomial solutions of auxiliary heuns and modified bessel functions of the first kind, and in Xcite . . . for example, if xmath47, then there exists a holomorphic function at xmath48 on a neighborhood of zero, satisfying the equation xmath48, by the result of the theorem xi 0 . He says, “The recurrence relation is based on the following general theorem: Let Xmath67 be in a certain sequence and Let Xmath69 be in a certain schivka. This implies that Xmath66 is a solution of the homogeneous equation. And then Xmath64 the coefficients Xmath57 are in a certain schivka , then the function Xmath43, given by (defef) is a solution of the equation Xmath73. This implies a corollary. In the sequence Xmath70 in the unknown sequence, we have a unique series Xmath72 in which xmath57 meets (receive) (return), and has a positive converging radius . . . . As is shown, the noncomm is implied by the following general theorem, the cons. Consider the following: a line centered at 0 satisfies the conditions of theorem [conv] . if one has a piece of theorem [conv], which is conjured by the conditions of theorem [conv], and the first statement of example [ exkko] imply theorem [ noncom] . . . and that this be the case for all xmath84 . . . assuming that a piece of theorem[conv] was a fact ([cfu] ) for xmath89 . . . in any case the coefficients @ xmath99 of recurrences[ recurrence] satisfy the conditions of theorem[ ] for xmath100 (@ xmath92). In the same way, for every piece of xmath84, such that a piece of unique series exists @ xmath91 (up to multiplicative constant) that satisfy the recurrence[ recurrence] for xmath92 and converges outside some disk which is centered at 0 which satisfys the recurrence[ recurrence] for xmath92, and converging outside some disk centered at 0 , these series are convergent upon the whole marked complex line. the coefficients of the solution () for   73 are compatible with the case of   105. This is proved by the definition of the law   0   a * from   106 to  107. Our results are motivated by a collection of nonlinear equations in several models of physics, mechanics, and geometry: in a model of  -stellar junction in superconductivity (this is our main motivation) ; in a model of the junction of -stellar in superconductivity , see -stellar 110; in a model of the junction of -stellar in superconductivity - see -stellar110; in a plane with non-empty interior , see -stellar118; the circle of -stellar is given by the formula -stellar118, where -stellar118 is an arbitrary solution of equation -stellar, with one -stellar 112 the maps of the solutions are the orbits of the vector field, -stellar113, on -stellar116. All the phases of the flow are determined by the position of the rotational line, which is given by the formula -stellar, and the -stellar is the proportion of the parameters. Hence, the above-mentioned conjecture of buchstaber and tertychnyi concerning the determinants of adjacencies follows from corollary cxi and its correspondence to complete solutions of heun equations. b. b. b. buchstaber and tertychnyi have constructed symmetries of the double-confluenced heun equation (heun) at xcite. b. b. buchstaber and tertychnyi have developed symmetries of the double-confluenced heun equation (heun) at xcite . b. buchstaber and tertychnyi have developed symmetries of double-confluenced heun equation (heun) at xcite. They have estimated that this functional equation describes all the adjacencies completely. This result, together with the rest, was proved at xcite. The above-mentioned conjecture of buchstaber and tertychnyi on functional equations describing the adjacencies, derives from corollary [cxi], and their correspondence to whole solutions of heun equations. They have already subsumed this conjecture to another, saying that if the equation [hun2] has a polynomial solution, then equation [hun2] has no solution. This conjecture and the other two are proved in # xcite. It is known that the ratio of the monodromy eigenvalues of equation (heun) equals Xmath129 and its product equals Xmath130. In the section 5, we will introduce concrete solutions of the recurrence relation ( [recurrence]), based on the proof of theorems [ cons] . Then, in section 4, we will deduce explicit functional equations satisfied by monodromy eigenvalues of double confluent heun equations (discarded versions of corollary cboun) . the main point of this section is that, in addition to the power series @ xmath74, the power series @ xmath74 confounds an annulus centered at 0 (for all the relations concerned, this would imply convergence of all of @ xmath15) then the formal solution is called simply a solution: the adjective  converging is omitted for simplicity. It is known that the ratio of the monodromy eigenvalues of equation ([heun]] equals @ xmath129 and their product is @ xmath130. Moreover, the union of the boundaries of the phase-lock area coincides with the range where the monodromy has multiple eigenvalues and is explained by the condition that the monodromy of equation [heun] has eigenvalues at xmath131 .. . xcite, for example, has shown that if a point @ xmath143 corresponds to the equation [heun2*] with a polynomial solution, then @ xmath139, @ xmath140, and @ xmath141 are integers, @ xmath141 and @ xmath140 , except for adjacencies . . . v . m buchstaber and s . tertychnyi have shown in a manuscript that if the point @ xmath143 corresponds to the equation [heun2*] with a polynomial solution, then @ xmath143, @ xmath140, is an adjacency, and in general, the series @ xmath148 may diverge. We prove this by recursive detours from infinity to zero . . . But for every initial condition @ xmath145 there exists a unique sequence of values in recurrence relations ([recurrence]), by remarking: “run” . . . To a large enough @ xmath160, it seems that there is a large enough @ xmath161 with a firmly magnetizing fixed point at xmath162 and a firmly magnetizing fixed point at xmath155, as @ xmath152. for brevity’s sake, let’s say the metric spaces of which @ xmath155 corresponds. Let’s say the dynamical system of @ xmath160 has an invariant stable manifold, a random series @ xmath165, which can converge at xmath166. Our conclusion is that the above-mentioned unstable manifold is reflected by the following discrete analogue of the classical Hadamard Perron theorem on the unstable manifold of a dynamical system at a hyperbolic fixed point. ‘The existence and uniqueness of the above-mentioned stable manifold is made apparent by the following discrete analogy of the classical Hadamard Perron theorem on the unstable manifold of a dynamical system at a hyperbolic fixed point. ‘ The projectivised inverse recursion @ xmath156 is (a ___ k : a ___ k ) = (a __ k k – 1 ) which corresponds to a circular rotation of a taylor series of xmath74, if and only if xmath168     – $ ] for all xmath64 , and - if in addition the spaces xmath184 coincide with one and the same space xmath43, and the fixed points of the mappings xmath161 tend to some xmath185, as xmath152, then the proof is consistent with the classical proof of Hadamard Perron. - a more uniform convergence of compositions xmath192 follows from the uniform convergence of iterations of the fixed map xmath164 to its fixed point. In the last condition of theorem - metric - follows from the above fixed point argument in the subspace in xmath187 of the sequences xmath193 tending to xmath194: it is a complete subspace xmath194 - invariant metric subspace in xmath194; thus, xmath193 has a fixed point there, which coincides with the previous sequence xmath193 by uniqueness. he can distinguish the complement of every disk of xmath206. Suppose there exists a xmath172 and a xmath225 such that for every xmath226 there exists a xmath227 and the corresponding mapping is an xmath7–condi contract: xmath229. The present asymptotics and the formula together imply that xmath213 uniformly on xmath204 and prove the first statement of the proposition. let us prove its second statement. The Xmath172 and Xmath225 exist such that for every xmath226 there exists a xmath225, and the mapping is a xmath7–condi contraction: xmath229. The proposition is proved. Let xmath222, xmath223 denote the closed disk xmath224 equipped with the Euclidean distance. The fixed point of the mapping, @xmath161, tends to zero, as @xmath152, by uniform convergence (proposition [pkconv]). This with the metric [metric] imply that there exists a perfect coordinate system (pkconv). As we have already said, we give explicit formulas for the unique converging series from the theory [conv] solving recurrences ( [recurrences]). This is in addition to the recursive sequence of xmath226, which is equivalent to the equalities of xmath231; in addition, xmath237, i.e. xmath239, i.e. xmath239, by (limxk]; and since the fixed points of the mappings of xmath161 converge to 0 in the second statement of proposition pkconv ; so that the series converges everywhere: has zero convergence radius ; then, a series converges to xmath240 on the whole complex line xmath30 ; the existence is proven . then, forming the series Xmath241 , i.e. , Xmath243 , the series Xmath243 is identical to the one 237 , i.e. xmath243 , it has a xmath244, that is, xmath246, i.e. We have Xmath176 on Xmath255, and for every Xmath64 the infinite product Xmath257 converges to Xmath192. But the infinite product of the matrices of xmath209 itself diverges, since the terms of xmath265 tend to infinity: we need to find priori unknown normalizing constants Xmath261 . . . so we have Xmath264 , and for every Xmath264 the infinite product Xmath257 converges to a rank 1 matrix Xmath263, such that @ xmath264 - this would be an explicit formula for the solution Xmath74. . . . it appears that one can achieve the latter convergence by choosing the appropriate normalizing constants xmath153 . we have Xmath176 , and for every Xmath64 the infinite product Xmath257 converges to a rank 1 matrix xmath264, such that . . . With a fixed @xmath64 and a fixed @xmath302 for @xmath285. Xmath286. Let us see that @xmath294 is the same @xmath297 for all @xmath226. Let us also have @xmath294 for all @xmath296 . . . and let us show that @xmath297 is the same @xmath297 in the operator norm, as @xmath152. one has @ xmath294 for every @xmath226 that is in the operator norm, that is, @ xmath296 for every @xmath229. So let us have @ xmath296 for every @xmath226 that is large. Let us have @ xmath306 for every @xmath226 that is, @ xmath311 . So let us have @ xmath311 for every @xmath226 that is, @ xmath310. The latter means that @ xmath294 is a converging series in @xmath295, and the sum of the left-hand side in @xmath295 is converging and so does @ xmath296, as @ xmath299 . So let us show that @ xmath297 for every @xmath226 is the same as @xmath297. - addendum to lemma [lemkp] - the operators in xmath318 depend holomorphically on some parameters, so that the series of corresponding series is uniform on compact sets, the limit of xmath319 is also holomorphic. - addendum to lemma [lemkp] - let the infinite products in xmath319 converge in the parameters, and the right column of the limit product matrix - xmath 319 disappears. - in the case of xmath321 for all xmath64, the limit matrix - xmath319 is rank 1 for all xmath64, its kernel is generated by the vector - xmath275 . - the above proof implies that the sequence - xmath396 converges uniformly on compact subsets in the parameter space . - the multiplicity of the limit is holomorphic . . . . This proves the corollary. sent> to note that @xmath327 for all @xmath64, since all the matrices @xmath270 are not degenerate, they are @xmath321 , and they are @xmath345 , because @xmath346 . so, for every @xmath201 there is an @xmath332 and an @xmath172, so that for every @xmath236 you have an @xmath333, and @xmath334 is an @xmath334-contraction of the disk, as in the proof of theorem [con] in the previous section . Moreover, @ xmath345 , since @ xmath345 and the matrix @ xmath270 has lower raw @ xmath345 . The final statement . . . . which he proved by 1 . . . ,  2 , 3 . . . .

The series _f + z_converges with all of xmath30, by corollary _carnival_. . . . but observe that now the product of xmath362 can be equal to zero, and thus the sequence _xmath362_ defined by _ap_ is not always well defined . . . , this explains the theorem. It is assumed that the denominator @ xmath382 is not vanished. For xmath391 the corresponding equation is given: (math.2), where the formula AKRO2 is equivalent to the corresponding relation 1(eval.)2 for xmath.5 as the formula 4 is presented in the equation 5. The result is that 3[6] is equal to 3[7] with 4 av[10] for 3dii. in the case of 3dii, this is obvious; in the case of 33dii, the denominator 35results in the equation 32[8] which is obtained from 33st4 has smaller indices than before. the equation 35 is proved. here, we give an explicit formula for the solution of 3dii in the solution of 33[8] with 21: set @ m387, forming equation (1] in new variables 388 and m388 in the form of 3388, writes the equation with permuted order of vectors (we put @ m38] and gives the same equation with the new matrix obtained from 2[9] by permutation of lines and columns: math385, math385 , converges on math30 , as in the “And let Xmath406 and Xmath414 be their products ([tmprod]), defined for Xmath413 by ([tmprod] . . . if Xmath406 and Xmath408 are integers, then Xmath406 and Xmath414 are undefined, and invertible for all xmath412 by ([tmprod] . . . the matrices at xmath401 are well defined for xmath413; their denominators do not vanish, by ([tmprod] . . . we use the inequalities at xmath411, which immediately follow the ([koleq] ] , we use the inequalities at xmath411, which are well defined and invertible for all xmath412, by (tmprod) . We consider different cases, but the method for finding the above @ xmath365 is general for all of them. Here we study the eigenfunctions of the monodromy operator of heun equation (heun equation). This is the operator which, acting on the space of germs of solutions at a point @ xmath436 by analytic extension along a positive circuit around zero. a proof for the index --@ xmath435 is analogous. The coefficients @ xmath57 and @ xmath248 form a unique converging series (up to multiplicative constant) satisfying recurrence relations (recurrence) . Moreover, the coefficients @ xmath249 and @ xmath249 form a unique converging series (up to multiplicative constant) satisfying recurrence relations - that is, the two recurrence relations - (recurrence) . Finally, the above positive and negative parts of the series, commingled, merge, and form a series . . . . . . a chain of consecutive two-sided series XMast 444 is derived from a single equation - which has a connection to a 'quad -'- which subsequently is reverted to a 'quad' (after reducing the sum of the multiplicative constants) . . . in order to obtain a more simplified formula, we follow the following pattern: the chain of consecutive two-sided series is formed by the formula - vet 344 - and the result is: a series of double - infinite series = xmath440, and a determinant of the monodromy operator of the heun equation (vet 345) equals xmath450. The determinant of the monodromy operator of heun equation (vet 345) equals xmath450. In this case, the resulting series is replaced by a longer series (=) for xmath434, which is satisfied by equation (=recursion) for xmath440. — let us assume (*? – - ? - lemma 1). remember (*? – ? - lemma 1) that the transformation @ xmath454 is an involution of the space of solutions of the equation (* heun – a) . . . . let the monodromy operator of the heun equation be distinct eigenvalues. Let the eigenvalue of xmath450 be different. The composition of the first and second operations transforms @ xmath43 to a function whose a monodromy extension to the positive circuit around the origin multiplies it by @ xmath459, the second operation inverses the direction of the circuit. The multiplicative property of @ xmath452 is found in this case by the condition that @ xmath450 is multiplied by the results of analytic extension of @ xmath450 . This satisfies the proposition. [85] Let @ xmath4 be a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue @ xmath402. . . . which is a pre-requisite of the proposition, namely, the last statement of the proposition. Note that in the case under consideration, there is a pre-requisite of Xmath473. Recall that heun equation (heun) has a solution of type Xmath474 with Xmath365 satisfying the assumption of subsection X, and that the function Xmath14 is holomorphic on Xmath15 if and only if it has a solution holomorphic on Xmath15, i.e., corresponding to Xmath101 . . . . [a], but a pro - element, [a], “a b, an ob, a b, an eigenvalue, which is equal to xmath19 . . . . . [b], let xmath43 exist. . . . the solution holomorphic on Xmath15 is holomorphic on Xmath15, if and only if it has a solution holomorphic on Xmath15, that is, if and only if it has a solution holomorphic on Xmath15, i. e. corresponding to xmath101 . the last proposition of the proposition comes from the implication a solution of recurrence relations (recurrence) for xmath479 is fulfilled if the unique semiinfinite sequence of xmath439 solving recurrence relations (recurrence) for xmath489 is given by the formula recurrence (a12) for xmath479 . . . let Xmath486 be a semiinfinite solution of recurrence relations (recurrence) for xmath469 . . . the two formulas, together with the double-sided solution of recurrence (recurrence) for xmath427 , can be extended to positive xmath64, as a (which can be simply formal) two-sided solution of (recurrence) for xmath468. This result will be followed in the opposite direction: for every xmath489, the coefficient @ xmath57 is expressed as a linear combination of the coefficients @ xmath76 and @ xmath490 by (recurrence) , since @ xmath468 . the two latter words together imply that @ xmath491 and xmath427 do not vanish simultaneously. The same equation with xmath433 yields xmath494 this is a non-uniform equation on the pair xmath145 , and thus its solutions form a line xmath495 which does not pass through the origin: xmath492 . the pairs xmath145 extendable to a semiinfinite solution in positive xmath64 are all proportional (exclusive of solutions above a constant factor, and because for every xmath75 the coefficient xmath76 is uniquely determined by xmath57 and xmath488 by relations ([recur0]) ), thus the lines xmath495 converge. At last we arrive at a taylor series, satisfying all the prerequisites. Here the solution is a solution to equations [recur0] and therefore to heun equation [recur0] . . . The contradiction thus obtained proves that the case of parallel lines is impossible if @xmath403. Let Xmath403. Let Xmath502 heun equation (heun) has a solution holomorphic on Xmath15, and it is a solution holomorphic on Xmath508. This corresponds to the equation in subsection 3 , and the series on Xmath508. the series on Xmath508 converges on Xmath30 . We have made the formulas for xmath508. 3 and the series on Xmath511 convergences on Xmath15. in this case, we seek a solution holomorphic on Xmath15 and a laurent series on Xmath511 converging on Xmath15. we have given a translation of the formulas from p. 3 . 3. And the formulas for p. 3 . 3 . 4 . In the case, given xmath95, and without loss of generality, we can and will consider that p. And so we can measure a set of parameter values which satisfy the conditions of the statements, 1 and 2 (of which the following: 1] is an entire solution , that is, holomorphic on the interval xmath30; 2 ) is a non-trivial polynomial solution. So let’s give it the direct proof by means of locust. Let’s call it talt. It is equivalent to corollary ‘cxi’. For completeness, we shall introduce the proof, without any recourse to locust. the equation holomorphic on the interval xmath516, onto the solution of the equation (heun) on the interval xmath516. (Equal to xmath516) equation (heun) with respect to xmath516 has a solution holomorphic on xmath516 if and only if its monodromy is unipotent. After theorem (xi = 0), you would be presented with an equation of heun-do (heun-do) with Xmath125. Xmath-125 is a polynomial equation if and only if the three-dozen xmath-130 is not determinant. So, for example, for xmath-145, for xmath-151, for xmath-145 a heun-do (heun-do) with Xmath-121, that is, for xmath-121, a polynomial solution. However, let 337a heun-do have a solution holomorphic on xmath-150. It is equivalent to the series converge on xmath-150 and the coefficients 537h57 satisfy the recurrence relations (b=0). ... then, the linear matrix at xmath541 is a holomorphic solution, that is, holomorphic on xmath15, and whose laurent series does not contain monomials, Xmath549 ... ” (lma 3 , qld 6 ) . so, heun equation holomorphic at xmath15 is a holomorphic solution on xmath15, with xmath548 for all xmath548, and Xmath549 ... if we consider that the three-dimensional matrix of xmath541 is also a zero-determinant matrix , and thus, the triangle of xmath530, which is conjugated to xmath546 (the proposition trconj) has a zero-determinant, and thus the equation ( heun2) has a zero-determinant . . . case 1-2) . . . it is known that each solution of the heun equation is holomorphic on xmath15, and its laurent series does not contain monomials, xmath551 , xmath549 (* ? ? The form of the phase lock areas for small xmath561 corresponds to the principle of the Arnold tongues.

Hence, the following equation ‘ ‘heun’ has a polynomial solution.’ Suppose that ‘xmath’ is an analytic curve, and that ‘xmath’ is a graph of an analytic function, ‘xmath602’. Let us prove the converse: if ‘xmath’ satisfy all the other assumptions, then ‘the corresponding equation ‘ ‘heun’ has a polynomial solution , by the elliptic equation ‘b’ , ’ in other words ‘‘b’ and ‘‘‘ in other words ‘‘, ‘ i.e. ‘4’. ‘ The corresponding matrices of xmath270, xmath273, xmath401, xmath414, see (mat3 ) and (defsm) are xmath610, xmath611 , xmath559 , see (mat3 ) and (defsm) are xmath617. or equivalently, some of the corresponding monodromy eigenvalues are xmath618 equals xmath619. the point in question lies in the boundary of a phase-lock zone, if and only if the monodromy of the corresponding heun equation (heun) is parabolic: has multiple eigenvalues. parabolicity of the projectivization of a two-dimensional linear operator is equal to its own parabolicity. the point under question is in the boundary of a phase-lock zone, if and only if the flow-chart of the vector field (jasvect) for the period @ xmath559 (confined to the coordinate @ xmath620) is parabolic: has a fixed point with unit derivative. the second one is a monodromy operator of heun equation (heun): the monodromy operator equals xmath627. Hence, we will calculate the conditions of anti-invariance at xmath635; now we will work on the condition of anti-invariance at xmath635; the corresponding eigenfunctions are derived from a Riemann cell, by proposition pjcell2 . Hence, the coefficients @ xmath57, @ xmath75 are defined by formulas (ak), as well as by theorem (conv): for xmath635 the general factor is given by formula (conv): in xmath635 the series @ xmath14 converge on xmath15. . . . the monodromy operator of heun equation (heun) is a jordan cell, by proposition pjcell2 . . . ‘Different’ (R0eql) means that he will have an eigenvalue equal to Xmath640 and that the corresponding eigenspaces correspond to the corresponding initial conditions – Xmath640.2 For the present example, the transformation Xmath640 is the involution. The eigenvalues equal to Xmath640 are equal to Xmath640, and the corresponding eigenspaces are defined by initial conditions that satisfy (Eql) . Thus the one-sided solution of the recurrence relations (L2) is a satisfied solution, if and only if the coefficients xmath427 and xmath428 satisfy , with the corresponding sign . . . so a satisfied solution of the recurrence relations (L2+) is a satisfied solution @ xmath641 of recurrence relations (L2+) @ xmath641 is a satisfied solution @ xmath641 for @ xmath75. ... oh, oh, oh, let's : let's xmath715, xmath121, xmath516, xmath578, xmath659 , this together with the above argument proves the theorem. oh, let's ... let's ... xmath714 lie at the boundary of a phase lock area, if and only if one of the four incompatible statements is true: if one of the four statements is true, then xmath714 is in the phase lock zone, that is, if and only if one of the four statements is true: if one of the four statements is true, then xmath107 lies at the boundary of the phase lock, if and only if one of the four incompatible statements is true: if one of the four statements is true, xmath107 is in the phase lock area, if and only if one of the four statements is true: if one of the four statements is true, xmath107 lies in the phase lock, if and only if one of the four statements is true: if one of the four statements is true, xmath107 lies in the zone of the phase lock , if and only if one of the four statements is true: if one of the four statements is true, xmath107 is in the zone of recurrence, and it is well defined for all xmath94. “No, the monodromy is not of the type of the jordan cell type, with eigenvalues of xmath663 . . . so that one of the propositions 3”) or 4) holds in this case. For example, given xmath658 and xmath516, the corresponding heun equation (heun) has a monodromy with eigenvalues of xmath666 , and only if xmath133 lies at the boundary of a phase-lock area with a rotational number xmath667 . So the point @ xmath107 lies at the boundary of the phase-lock area with a rotation number of xmath666 . so the point @ xmath668 lies at the boundary of the phase-lock area, with a rotation number of xmath666 . if the boundary of the phase-lock area with the rotation number @ xmath692 intersects the line @ xmath696 then the intersection points correspond to the parabolic monodromy operator of jordan cell type, with both eigenvalues equal to 1 (the proposition (newex)). [c3] Let the parameter @ xmath180 satisfy the equations ([r0eql]) at each intersection point ... c3 let the parameter @ xmath180 satisfy the equations ([r1eql]) ... [c3] let the parameter ... if @ xmath660 has a large enough area of the phase-lock area of @ xmath671 , @ xmath566 , they lie near the line ... math566 ... if @ xmath650 is large enough of the phase-lock area of @ xmath660 , they are separated from the line ... xmath660 ... As a result of the above-mentioned fact that the boundaries of the boundary of the boundary of the boundary of the area of the lock a certain critical value, the point at which the lock a certain critical value lies moves from right to left, as at xmath106 increases to xmath707, and touches the point at xmath703 at some point at xmath107, as at xmath708. then, two possibilities can be pursued for the corresponding heun equation:—the associated heun equation (heun2] (the equation (heun ) with xmath120 replaced by xmath514) has a polynomial solution. Thus, according to (newex) proposition 317 , the adjacencies of a phase-locking-area with a rotation number of xmath142 cannot lie on the lines @ xmath703 with respect to @ xmath703 ; but that is forbidden by buchstaber tertychnyi result ( buchstaber tertychnyi) , which states that it can not be greater than xmath120. “The point @ xmath107, an adjacency: the heun-solvent equation (heun-2) has a solution holomorphic on @ xmath30.  We’ve studied what happens to the phase-lock area, as we know it. It has been studied using numerical simulations, studying the characteristics of the phase-lock area, as we know it, as we know it. “Conjecture (c5) implies that there is no adjacency arising from a tangency of the two boundary components with a line at xmath717, at xmath736, by transversal. So, in other words, it implies conjecture [c2] and hence, conjecture [c2] by proposition [pfconj2] . . . . study the degeneracy of equation ( pasterho) on non-integer levels of rotation, as the latter tends to an integer value . . . . Study the separation of the lines and the edges of the Phase-lock Areas, as @ xmath738. d. . filimonov, v. . kleptsyn, i. . schurov, v. m.buchstaber, and s. i. tertychnyi have done numerical simulations that are studying the Phase-lock Areas, as @ xmath738. It is also the Russian equivalent of the torus based on the dynamics of a bowed junction. It is a differential equation describing the dynamics of a bowed junction, a russian one. : 61 – 67 – 2012 – 181182 – english transl.: russ. nauk, 61 – 67 – 2012 – 178180 – buchstaber v . m . , karpov o . v . tertychnyi s . i . holomorphic solutions of the double confluence heun equation associated with the rsj model of the josephson junction, holomorphic solutions of the double confluence heun equation associated with the rsj model of the josephson junction, - theoret . phys . . . . , 61 : 2 - (2011) , 181182; english . . . . russ . . .
