There is a subject of considerable interest in the subject of phase transitions and the associated surface phenomena in a mixture of matter. It has long been understood from the viewpoint of theoretical physics; but they have not been investigated in the highest degree, and in particular were not firmly derived from local interactions. In addition, several physical principles for pure systems (Gibbs's phase rule, the wulf construction, etc.) have been established mathematically and if necessary supplemented with suitable conditions ensuring their validity. Moreover, quantitative analysis also reveals the following fact: 1 The salt-water melts at a temperature below that of pure water, this is the phenomenon of the 'frozen water'. The latter, in particular, is not peculiar to the salt-water system; in addition, (13) are not peculiar to the salt-water system; however, (13) are not peculiar to the salt-water system; there is a well-known example from the real world: the formation of brine ponds in frozen sea water. This phenomenon is also an important one: 1 The salt-water melts at temperatures lower than the temperature of pure water; this is the phenomenon of the 'frozen water equilaterality'. in this sense, one can observe two important physical phenomena: 1 . the migration of nearly all the salt into the water in which the ice-water mixture remains liquid. 2 This is the 'frozen water depression'. In the presence of pure systems, such topics have been well understood at the level of theoretical physics and, more recently (as measured on the above time scale) at the level of rigorous theorems in two and higher dimensions. - in the case of pure systems, such topics have been well understood at the level of theoretical physics, and, more recently (as measured on the above time scale) at the level of rigorous theorems in two and higher dimensions. This, and the next paper, is to study the qualitative nature of phenomena () by means of the formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The following general purpose of this and the subsequent paper is to study qualitative phenomena (in the formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics). For these models, we show that phase separation dominates a non- trivial region of chemical potentials in the phase diagram, a situation that is quite different from pure systems, where phase separation can only occur at a single value (i.e., the transition value) of the chemical potential. Hence, to describe the shape of a column, a wulf construction is necessary with the caveat that here the crystalline phase is on the outside. (Of course, even in pure water the phenomenon of freezing is so complex that crystalization in realistic models has only recently been observed and barely discovered in computer simulations . . .) thus, we will resort to a simplified model in which salt and both phases of water are represented by discrete random variables in a regular lattice , we will show that in these models, phase separation dominates a non-discreet region of chemical potentials in the phase diagram, an area which is quite unlike the pure system, where phase separation can occur only at a Our model will be based on the hypercubic, hypercubic lattice xmath0; and the quantities math7, math8 and math9 are the ice, , ,  and   239 there, math5, math6, the opposite to math4, math2, math3, are the inverse temperature (to be incorporated in the hamiltonian) ; math4 and math5 are the sites in math4, and math6 denotes the neighboring two sites. In the simplest (and the most tractable) sense, there is no direct Salt - Salt interaction, only an interaction between ice and liquid (the latter are most attractive), an energy penalty - math13 for simultaneous presence of Salt and Water at one point , and finally, fugacity terms for Salt and Liquid. for simplicity (and the most tractable) there is no direct Salt - Salt interaction, but there is no direct relationship of Salt and Liquid, except for a one-way interaction between ice and liquid (these are already attractive), an energy penalty - math13 for simultaneous presence of Salt and Liquid at one point , and finally fugacity terms for Liquid and Liquid. To a very large extent this is by means of the assumption that _something must be present in _xmath4_ (the concentration of water in water is the same) ; but, perhaps, it is unrealistic to apply @xmath7 and @xmath8 only to the extreme values, namely, xmath16. (This discussion, of course, applies to salt variables . . . but here we are limiting the allocation of @xmath17 to the full range of the results of this note. It is no longer difficult to see that the ice and liquid sector' of the general hamiltonian reduces to a ferromagnetic ising spin system. However, we will not make such mathematical claims; much of this paper relies on preexisting technology which, strictly speaking, is made only for the discrete case., so it is not difficult to see that the ice and liquid sector' of the general hamiltonian reduces to a ferromagnetic ising spin system. @ xmath19 where new parameters @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are given by @ xmath23 , it is noticed that the third sum in is still based on 'ice' indicators, so that the third sum in will still have a clearly defined meaning even if @ xmath25 is, that is, prohibition of salt entirely at ice-occupied sites. (Please note, however, that the authors are confident (e.g., on the basis of 'xcite') that almost all the results in this note can be extended to continuous variables . After the grand canonical description the salt particles are clearly integrated into the ising model, which produces the corresponding equation at the limit of the xmath and the external field, which, at xmath26, is concerned with the phase relations between the two, i.e., a simple curve in the xmath plane. Unfortunately, as is well known, as it is known, a very little knowledge of the subject of phase separation can be gained from studying the ising magnet in the external field. As will be seen in section 1 the reference to the “precise” failure of the grand canonical equations indicates that the correct ensemble in this case is the one that has a fixed amount of salt per unit volume . This is in part due to the fact that, in our - based model of the fluid-sudden system, the chemical potential 1drops out of the problem, a relevant parameter is the salt concentration . This condition is physiologically relevant because, at the moment of freezing, the salt does not have enough m mobility to be gradually withdrawn from the system . (For technical reasons, the technical definition is conditioned on the grand canonical measure, see section . , as if it were a liquid-ice crystal. Consequently, the natural phase diagram to be studied is in the plane affixed to xmath33. Clearly, we can reaffirm the standard argument by first defining the case xmath39 (which implies xmath40) and , i.e., the usual ising system of Xmath22. Let xmath35 denote the partition function of the ising magnet with constrained magnetization of xmath35. The central property of xmath43 is that it vanishes for xmath45 in the interval xmath46_ , where xmath47 denotes the spontaneous magnetization of the ising model at xmath21, while it is strictly positive and strictly convex for xmath45_. we can remember that math41 is approximately written as math42  ,   , where math43 is a suitable constant, and math44 is a (normalized) canonical free energy. the principal point of math41 is that it vanishes for xmath45 in the interval math46   ] where math47 is the spontaneous magnetization of the ising system at tying math21, while it is strictly positive and strictly convex for math45. The presence of salt variables dramatically changes the whole picture. Moreover (and again because of the absence of salt-salt interactions) when this is chosen, the spin configurations are the typical ising configurations with overall magnetizations @ xmath61 . . . notwithstanding (and again because of the absence of salt-salt interactions) once this @ xmath45 has been selected, the spin configurations are the typical ising configurations with a constant volume of xmath60. We discuss the analysis of the phase diagram and the corresponding description of phase separation, with the results. In . . . 3. we study the asymptotic of infinitesimal systems . . . . in . . . . in . . . our main results are proved in section . . . in . . . In . . . we discuss the asymptotic of infinitesimal systems. In . . . in . . . in . . . we use a geometrical equation, a flow-line, and an overview of the section - s. . in . . . the exponential growth of xmath58 for xmath59 is thus no longer a function of a flat piece, but for each xmath22 there is a unique value of xmath45 that optimizes the corresponding free energy . . . In . . . We will then consider fixed configurations @ xmath69. Most of the time we will talk about cases @ xmath70 or @ xmath71, called the plus and minus boundary conditions. The numbers on xmath68 and xmath17 are the same as the ones on xmath70. For each xmath70 we have the water and salt variables, xmath68 and xmath17. (In the light of the discussion in section (Section 3) the last word in has been omitted. We shall start with the interactions hamiltonian. The probability distribution of the pair @ xmath75 follows the usual gibbs-Braidzmann form: @ xmath76, where the normalization constant, xmath77, is the partition function. In order to simplify future discussion, we will adopt the convention that    concentration @ xmath36 is fixed. But as you know, the proof of the theorem (Thm3:1) is that @ xmath93 is continually and strictly increasing from the value of spontaneous magnetization at xmath94 to the value of a new resonance on xmath95, as if by a pulse in Xmath95 swayed through Xmath95. In order to describe our first result, we will require a few facts of general knowledge about the ising model . As already mentioned, if @ xmath101, where @ xmath102 is the critical coherence constant of the ising model, then @ xmath103, and thus @ xmath104 for xmath105 . (since @ xmath106 is the only one for @ xmath56, the resulting flat square on the graph of @ xmath107 appears only in dimensions @ xmath56 .) As is well known, cf the proof of the theory [ thm3] [24] [25], @ xmath93 always (and strictly) increases from the value of spontaneous magnetization in @ xmath94 to one as the flux of @ xmath22 passes over @ xmath95 . . . in particular, for each @ xmath96 there exists a unique @ xmath97, such as @ xmath98. At this point we consider the classical ising-model with a constant ratio of xmath32 and no external field, and let xmath127 be the measure of the volume of xmath78 and xmath128 by the boundary condition. Having defined all the necessary quantities, we are ready to present our results. On the basis of this large-distribution principle we can now characterize the typical configurations of xmath88. To start with, we will introduce a very large-distribution principle for magnetization in the measures of xmath88: “thm1”; “thm2” let xmath118 and xmath112 be fixed. In this we will first obtain a general definition of the entropy of the properties with fixed salt concentration, fixed overall magnetization, and fixed fraction of the salt residing on the plus spins (and fraction of the fraction @ xmath112 residing on the minus spins) . The unique minimizer @ xmath126 of xmath121 is continuous in xmath123 and xmath122, and the precise increase in xmath22. .. In this respect, the above-mentioned large-distribution principle can be applied to the magnetization of the measures of xmath88. . . . if a finite set, xmath65, and any two sets, xmath135 and xmath136, where the numbers @ xmath138 . . . are based on the same equations @ xmath139 . . . since the xmath129 has a reduced density at xmath138 , the salt concentration is asymptotically supported by the usual xmath140 isometrically supported by the regular xmath140 isometrically supported by the usual xmath140 isometrically supported by the usual xmath140 isometrically supported by the usual xmath140 isometrically supported by the ordinary xmath140 isometrically supported by the usual xmath141 isometrically supported by the usual xmath141 isometrically supported by the general xmath141, where xmath45 isometrically supported by xmath121 . The principle underlying this model is shown in this section (so we refer the reader to section .4 ) . and, in particular, in the phenomena of thawing-point depression . . . . the horizontal axis indicates the concentration of the salt in the system, the vertical axis indicates the external field affecting the spins. the ice state is shown by xmath143 in the shaded region. . . . once xmath143 is on the left of the shaded region, the entire system is in the ice state. . . . the description and the asymptotic allow us to characterize the distribution of spins in a canonical ensemble of the ising ferromagnet . . . for positive concentrations @ xmath142, the system remains in the liquid-water phase for a non-zero-negative range of negative values of xmath . . . for low values @ xmath13, the type of convexity of the transition lines may change from convex to convex near xmath144; see the companion paper . . . , width = 336 ] . if xmath149, the system (with minus boundary condition) looks like the minus condition of the ising model with a more or less even external field, i.e. the average magnetization on the scale xmath148 is approximately xmath148. the total magnetization is within xmath151 , the volume fraction of the droplet is such that the overall magnetization is near xmath151 , i.e. if xmath150 , then in a normal way the system is advection, in the sense that the repulsion is one phase in the other. ( if xmath150 , then the system is a separate entity, namely, that the typical equivalence is represented by a large droplet of one phase within another. . (this is not in the least, for not all values of xmath101 and xmath61 are permitted in principle, but not all. The depth of conclusion ( 3), of course, depends on the degree of knowledge of wulf construction, which is still rather different in size, xmath152 and xmath153. , in particular, two continuous and decreasing functions, namely xmath162 $], such that xmath163 is equal to xmath163 for all xmath142, and we can then measure xmath162 as a function of xmath36. the solution is obtained from the following observation: - Let xmath105 be the solution of xmath81 and, with xmath78, let xmath16 be the solution of xmath164. - In general, xmath161 is the probability of having a salt particle on a given plus spin, and xmath168 is the corresponding quantity for minus spins. - This is a manifestation of freezing-point depression, see also remark: - - this is a consequence of - freezing-point depression, see also remark: rem0. , etc., and a concise application of thermodynamic relations between free energy, magnetization, and external conditions. For completeness (and the convenience of the reader), we will provide a proof. : xmath179 is convex on xmath180, real analytic (by the -yang theorem) on xmath184, and therefore it is strictly convex on xmath180 . the limit is found by subadditivity arguments and is independent of the boundary condition . consider the function xmath178, where xmath177 is the expectation with respect to xmath178, and let xmath178 be the boundary condition corresponding to xmath78 and xmath128 - boundary conditions. We have in the section ii. 1, to be complete (and for the convenience of the reader) a proof is given. - 'iii.' - the proof is considered standard, see e. g. xmath197 and xmath198, and xmath199 for xmath105 $] . . . The right-hand side of xmath200 tends to zero, as well as xmath203 tends to xmath204. As @ xmath202 tends to zero, so does @ xmath204 tend to xmath204 . . . , to prove when xmath105 $] , we must observe that the left-hand side of is non-positive and concave in xmath45. . . . Since @ xmath204 tends to zero, so does @ xmath205 , then the following . . . the ellis theorem (see (*? . . . theorem v. 6 ) actually guarantees the following . . . large deviation principle: @ xmath205 for any closed set @ xmath206, while @ xmath207 phi  phi       m Then we have the number Xmath222, the total amount of salt, on the plus spins ... ’ and we are to be given the result ([3] ] that all spins with given xmath222 and xmath225 the entropy of salt is the rate of exponential growth of the amount of xmath227 which, for each spin, corresponds to a quantity xmath225, in the following way: ” Lemma3 ... ” in the following way, with respect to the spin configuration xmath207, let us introduce the quantity xmath215 which is the total amount of salt in the system ... ” (since if he has given the salt entropy from xmath224 a size xmath226 as an exacne of the absolute amount of xmath225 to an exacne, a total of xmath230 . . . [3 . 4], the equations ([3 . . 4] . . . the relations ([3 . . . ] . . . : that is, the number of these positions is the same, that is, exactly @ xmath239 of them is on xmath240 plus-sites and @ xmath241 on xmath242 minus-sites. Therefore it is not surprising that, for spin configurations, @ xmath259 with given magnetization, @ xmath260 tends to a product measure on xmath259 . We also need to calculate how many salt configurations in @ xmath227 are set to get given values in a finite subset of @ xmath252 . In that case, for each @ xmath253 and for each @ xmath135, we will define the quantity @ xmath254 as a moment's thought reveals, @ xmath255 is the probability that @ xmath256 occurs in (essentially) any homogeneous product measure on @ xmath214, if @ xmath256 is set to have @ xmath257 and a @ xmath258. (In latexmath it is possible to do this: But the conditions of the form of the form are, as follows: the amounts of plus and minus are represented by the quantities of xmath273; and the quantities of xmath274 are the numbers of salt particles on plus and minus; and, finally, the quantities of xmath275 are the quantities of the volume of xmath66. As for the numerator, we will treat the numbers of xmath277 and xmath279, as an extension of xmath274; we have a means of interpreting the arguments from lemma[xmath265] . . . , that is, we will expand on the argument of lemma[xmath265] . . . “The configuration of xmath235, xmath135, and xmath135 is a salt configuration in xmath66, and in xmath268 (this one by lemma[xmath268] we can easily find that xmath287 since xmath293 and xmath294, which are both of xmath285 and xmath285 with xmath286, in a regime where it makes sense to seek a asymptotic form of quantity xmath287 — that is, for every Xmath 300 and each Xmath 118, then for every Xmath 118 and for every Xmath 119 there exists an Xmath260, such that if Xmath 303 occurs in the event of Xmath 301, then for each Xmath 118 and for every Xmath 119 there is an Xmath262 such that for each Xmath 119, there is an Xmath 310 and a salt configuration Xmath 310, which is optimized for all Xmath 310, xmath 310, and xmath 311 and the size of the system. . . . you have a good arithmetic of spin by a good measure of quantity. Here we have the common paroxysm of spin, i.e. the basic fact that the spin marginal of xmath88 dominates the product measure xmath315 that is given by xmath316 for all xmath4 . In general, we have a lot of xmath317 . . . Let xmath318 be the proof for a proof of the corresponding estimate for each of them . . . So let xmath317 be the probability that xmath317 will occur given a spin configuration xmath308 in xmath309 and a salt configuration xmath310 in xmath78, and the region between xmath313 and its absolute neighborhood , let xmath317 be the proof for xmath The remaining two events, which determine whether xmath218 is less than xmath211 or more than xmath320 times the total number of plus spins, are accounted for by the same argument, with standard convexity estimates. So let xmath326 denote the expectation with respect to xmath326 and note that xmath330 . . . here, looking back, we have Xmath338, where Xmath339 is now considered for Xmath339, and thereby Xmath340 is accounted for Xmath339, so Xmath340 is decayed exponentially in Xmath338. . . . . . . In order to prove this, we use a routine application of jensen s inequality, and as we have Xmath335 we set Xmath335 to observe that the right-hand side of the probability in Xmath334 is inversed by Xmath335 . In this case, we define Xmath336 as the sum of xmath336 over all xmath311. As to the other event, namely xmath343, we note that this is contained in xmath343, where xmath343 counts the number of plus spins without any salt. " Xmath191" and Xmath1981 " that is to say, Xmath1984 is the complete set of all Xmath191 and Xmath1982 . . . first we note that - by lemma - [Lemma 3] - where - xmath1981, where - xmath1991, where - xmath1992 - in the part - xmath1993, - and - in the part - xmath394 - we can obtise the sum of xmath326 , for which - xmath352 and - xmath352 are integers and - xmath367 and - xmath368 are integers. (this is exactly the combination of magnetizations and spin-salt - this is the combination of the set - xmath371 ) is an observable and an observable set, so let - xmath326 denote the sum of xmath326 over all xmath350 and - xmath350 , that is, the sum of xmath360 over the relevant (removed) values of xmath45 and xmath115 , so that - xmath326 is an integer, and - xmath368 and - xmath368 is an integer. Supposing that @ xmath381 is given, let us cover @ xmath382 by finite number of sets of the kind @ xmath335 times (theta  ell  ell  ell  ell  ell  ell  epsilon  epsilon ) and so on. Our evidence is the strict convexity of @ xmath121 and the continuity and monotony of its minimization. The result is the proof of theorem [thma], the conclusion is made from similar arguments which prove . . . (*) first, note that @ xmath391 is strictly convex on the set of @ xmath115 where it is finite, and is a simple consequence of the strict convexity of @ xmath121 . . . and thus @ xmath376 can be bounded as in @ xmath32. Furthermore, the right-hand side is bounded by the left-hand side times a polynomial in @ xmath32 . . . . and combining these observations the result is proved. At xmath110 Xmath398 is solved for xmath115 from the equation xmath114 where xmath228 is as in . but xmath400 is strictly concave and its derivative vanishes at xmath401 . . . so the solution of xmath413 must obey. (On this point we can actually distinguish the function xmath404, which is twice differentiable on the set in which it is finite, and we also rely on the known convexity of xmath44 . . . . because of strict convexity and the abovementioned -diffuseness  at the boundary of the interval xmath124 , the function xmath121 has a unique minimizer for each xmath119 and xmath142, as long as the quantities from xmath411 satisfy xmath411 . . . . . because xmath408 diverges from xmath409 as if it were to xmath104 , oh, it was strictly convex on xmath402 . . . For given @xmath119 and @xmath118 , let @xmath419 be the minimizer of @xmath354 , let @ xmath419 be the minimizer of @xmath354 , then for all @xmath411 and @xmath414 , let @ xmath419 be the minimizer of @xmath414 , then for all @xmath414 and @xmath415 , let @ xmath411 be fixed and let @ xmath419 be the minimizer of @ xmath354 . . . this means that @ xmath45 must be strictly increasing with @xmath22 . . . the proof of the second main theorem , let us observe the values of @ xmath421 in minimizing @xmath415 and @xmath115 , let us remark the fact that @ xmath411 is unique and the same as the proofs for claiming that the probability on the left-hand side of the bottom of the field of the probability decays exponentially in @ xmath238. And as we see from the definition of xmath115, we have xmath429, and from the very definition of xmath421 we have xmath429; and as we see that xmath421 satisfies the same equations as xmath166, then by this uniqueness assumption, we must hold . . . let xmath419 be the unique minimizer of xmath437 . Let xmath432 be the unique minimizer of xmath432 . to prove the relation, let us also note the derivative of xmath432 over xmath46 . . . to prove relation, let us also take into account the derivative of xmath432 over xmath45 . . . Note that the sum of xmath433 over all the salt configurations of xmath214 with xmath221 is a number dependent only on the total magnetization of xmath434 . - the aforementioned lemma, for example, claims that xmath447 is within xmath211 of the probability that xmath447 occurs in the measure, in which the probability of xmath448 is xmath449 if xmath450 and xmath411 if xmath456 . Let xmath419 be the unique minimizer of xmath446. The next thing to be proved is proposition - prop2b - establishing the basic features of the phase diagram of the model under consideration: proof of prop2b from lemma - 7 , we know that the axis of the math160$ is given by the equation. take for example, above xmath453 with xmath450, and in the course of the continuity of xmath421 in xmath45 and xmath115, we find out that xmath457 actually merges with xmath421 in xmath45 and xmath115. We then know that a line in the math  is drawn by xmath  and xmath   is drawn by xmath . I'll give you the expression, which is required because the above functions are Xmath466 and Xmath142. It will be sufficient to prove that Xmath466 is strictly decreasing, and that Xmath477 is also negative once Xmath469 . we will use the expression that is employed because Xmath466 is a strict monotone and negative for Xmath142 . (we shall denote the derivatives by superscript p.) we will add the following variables, Xmath468, and by writing Xmath469 and @ Xmath469, we shall differentiate between xmath36 . . . . but this is immediate. By the second equation, we will conclude that at least one of xmath475 must be a strict positive one, and by xmath476 we will conclude that both xmath476 and @ xmath476 are positively negative.
