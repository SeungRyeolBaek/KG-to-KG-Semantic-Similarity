in the local universe a supermassive black hole (smbh) generically exists in the center of early-type galaxies, with the mass of the black hole close to that of the star’s bulge @xcite . Therefore, a connection and co- evolution between the central smbh and the host galaxy have been proposed. In a single popular co- evolution scenario, the galaxy has been proposed to introduce gas into the centre of galaxies and cause the central star to grow and the central smbh to grow quickly. The recent studies, however, have been of mixed results. On one side, the moderate-light x-ray selected agn hosts (@xmath4erg s @xmath5) exhibit the same disk-shaped morphologies as those of non-active galaxies, and there is no significant difference in the distortion fraction between @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite. On the other hand, the high merger fraction (@x-math8) was detected in a subsample of the bright (@x-math9erg s @x-math5 ) quasars (@x-math8 ) @x-math5 , dust-red quasars @x-cite. It is therefore necessary to study the connection and co-evolution of the central smbh and host galaxy. Observation by xcite and xcite of the galaxies of the rhas group of hyperluminous, hot dust-obscured galaxies (after this – the doggies) have been used as a criteria. The doggies, examined in this letter, have been selected from the has collection of the celestial sky catalog at xcite. The hot dogs that have been studied are selected from the rhas list of the world catalog of the rhas–haasasryvered universe, or the universe library. We purposely use this to examine the host morphology of the doggies of which we examine an analysis of the number of redshifts of this group. In a lightening observation involving x-ray traces and spectral distributions (sed) analysis (assef et al. 2015; fan et al. 2016) it has been shown that their glowing mid-ir emission is caused by a dense, highly dust-shrouded agn; because of this thickening of circumnuclear dust the host morphology of this population is easily observable. In order to examine the host morphology of hot dogs, we shall take a sample of 18 objects (see table 1 in ). These are all collected from the ‘Panaemones’ catalog (see table 2). In this study, we assume a flat, xmath11cdm cosmology, xmath12 km sy, xmath5 and xmath14. (d) , and all except w0831 and 040 , we see the red and blue lines in the figure 2 in . . . black diamonds are taken from the compilation of @xcite . . . , and only w0831 and 040 use the f160w ... (i.e., at xmath15) , it is shown that the hot dogs have a high ml/ml ratio. As a result, we can conclude from the ml ratio of the hot dogs that the hot dogs have a high ml ratio (, , , , , ,  ), which is shown in figure 2 as a red asterisk. And, in order to understand the ratio of ml/ml ratios to ml ratios, we get the data in the literature and plot them in figure 2 . the blue and red lines in figure 2 are the standard deviations of the the variability-driven model of xcite (red and blue lines in figure 2). . . . if the ml ratio is high, then the ml ratio is low, while the ml ratio is very weak. The ml ratio of ml/ml is high, and the ml ratio is less than the ml ratio of the dust-red qso in xcite. In our sample we present the spectrogram of the distribution of srsic indexes. In the figure we show the distribution of srsic indexes, as shown in Figure 3, and the range of srsic indexes between the two quadrants of w0851 + 3148 and w2207 + 1939, the quadrants of w0851 + 3148 are considerably skewed, as you can see from the figure. Both quadrants of w0851 + 3148 have significantly skewed morphology, as you can see from the figure 1 , the results of a single quadrant have a high value of the reduced values of w0821 + w2207+1939 – but in most of our quadrants the quadrant of wales are still a reasonable one. Our result indicates that most of our quadrants have an intermediate morphology (one with a prominent bulge) in our quadrants. This intermediate morphology has been expected in a merger-driven situation when hot dogs lie at a time when major mergers with gas-rich disks are building the luminous agns at w08–5—which is quite typical of our pet dogs. In this respect, the quadrant of wales is of a good agreement with the predicting model. In our quadrant, the parity of the stars is shown in figure 3. The fractions of disk-dominated, intermediate, and bulge-dominated morphologys range from 21. 2 %, 60 %, and 16 %, respectively, of our hot dogs. “To calculate the merger fraction for a subsample of 18 hot dogs we obtained a masked count of 18 hot dogs, to show the shape of the stars. Using the dislocation algorithm to derive the merger fraction in a subsample of 18 hot dogs, we found that the merger fraction was high ( @ xmath1); the high masked fraction in these luminous, highly obscured agns was consistent with the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations and the variability-based model @ xcite. it is also possible to calculate the agn bolometric luminosity by averaging the bolometric luminosity of the agn bolometrics. as a result of this, we conclude that the high masked fraction in our hot dog sample was probably responsible for the heightened activity. from the point of view of morphology, this work confirms our previous work (fan et al. 2016a) which confirmed our earlier result (fan et al. 2016a) that hot dogs were of intermediate morphologies. Unfortunately, we do not know the perfect match for the sample, for the star masses and the black hole masses of hot dogs are not well known. The masked fractions of hot dogs derived from sed analyses by @xcite are about 20.5. At xcite, enormous, inactive galaxies show a relatively low fraction of strong distortion morphologies , for instance, only at xmath35 galaxies in an inactive galaxy with the median stellar mass 20.5 show a number of common merger features . this indirect evidence suggests that the high merger fraction in our hot dog sample was likely responsible for The evidence for major mergers between agns is low, comparable to that of inactive galaxies. Therefore, it follows that major mergers are not the main triggering mechanism of agn activity. The results from us, however, appear to be contradictory. But, we may further explain the question by considering that uv/ocular-selected qsos and ir-selected qsos are distinct phases in the emergence-driven evolutionary model of xcite . gas-rich agns fuel an intense star-burst, and a phase of underexpressed bh growth, followed by a phase of underexpressed bh growth after the gas has been consumed or taken out of the galaxy by qso feedback. a similar evolutionary sequence has also been proposed by xcite involving x-ray-selected agns and q-ray-selected agns. But we emphasize that this conclusion is only valid for radio-sensing agns, while it may be another story for q-sensing agns. in a merger-driven evolutionary model, gas-rich galaxy mergers fuel a great fire, a phase of obscurity followed by an unobscured phase after the gas has been consumed or released from the galaxy by q-sensing.
