- the electromagnetic waves - the circularly polarized electromagnetic waves - guided almost along the external magnetic field in dense plasmas. Since, more than a century ago, the whistler waves are a main physics particle. As a consequence of the low frequency (lf) of these waves (in contrast to the electron-cyclotron frequency, xmath0) in a round circle (rcp) electromagnetic waves (em) guided almost along the external magnetic field in thick plasmas . Moreover, the large amplitude of these radiated waves in a magnetized plasma can induce a great variety of nonlinear effects , e.g., three-wave interactions, parametric instabilities, modulational instability and subsequent soliton formation - smearing theory1 , smearing theory2 , smearing theory5 , smearing theory5 , smearing theory5 , smearing theory5 , smearing theory5 , smearing theory Parametricinstability . . . . . the description of the magnetic field created by the em-whiskers in a thunderstorm . . . In recent years, there has been an interdisciplinary interest in the field of quantum effects, and more experimentally progressed in nanoscale particles, ultracold particles, spintronics, and plasmonics. In the superdense subatomic particles, the spherical electrons follow the fermi-drac pressure law, and there is generally a factor of quantum force associated with the Bohm-de-Broglie potential, which results in wave dispersal at nanoscales, i.e., in subatomic particles. Then the electrons in superdense subatomic particles are omnipresent in compact astrophysics, e.g., in giant white dwarfs, jupitors, magnetars, etc. on the other hand, in superdense subatomic particles a superdense subatomic particle is omnipresent in the air, in the interior of enormous white dwarfs, in the interior of jupitors, magnetars, etc. ; the absorption of electrons by the decay of the dipole force is facilitated by the dispersal of the Pauli equations by the conversion of the pauli equation into fluid variables ... more elaborate models are also formulated ... more complex kinetic models have been developed ... We must mention that in a dense magnetized plasma there also exist spin waves, which are stimulated by the intense neutrino fluxes. Therefore, the theory of ponderomotive force in plasmas must be developed in its own right, accounting for all these quantum effects. The radial representation of the high-frequency (hf) em wave field is given by xmath3c . c . , where xmath4 is the slowly varying (in space and time) envelope of the radial field and c . c stands for the complex conjugate . . . We shall be able to examine the propagation of localized em whistlers, which may arise in the interior of magnetized white dwarfs, magnetars, and in the next generation of intense laser-solid density plasmas. The dynamics of the ion-dielectricity, the dispersive effects of the charge separation and the tunneling of the electrons, are also included. Let us examine the propagation of nonlinearly coupled em whistlers and ion-acoustic (ia) density perturbations along a constant magnetic field xmath2 in a quantum electron-ion plasma, where the equilibrium velocity is zero. In the same way, xmath7 _ _ __ ____ is the number density, mass and velocity of electrons, xmath13 the magnetic field, xmath13 the lf field, ... read _____. The nonrelativistic evolution of spin electrons in an electron is suitable, but this may not apply to the magnetic fields, where the electrons are occupied in the lowest energy spin states. But in the cases of extremely strong magnetic fields (or extremely low temperatures) the spin state is well represented by the thermodynamic equilibrium spin configuration, and in such cases the above model can still be applied. Besides, we will concentrate our studies on the magnetic fields and high density plasmas. -  frac  2  mu  e  hbar  frac  partial   partial t   left ( hbar    frac  partial    partial t  left ( hbar     e  hbar      frac  partial   partial t  left ( nabla  times nabla  times nabla sent>  e   hbar n  e    hbar n  e   mathbf  s    right [227]  e   hbar n  e    mathbf  s   right]  e   mathbf  b  b       ev  end  aligned  ev  end  aligned      ev  end  aligned   ] , the nonlinear dynamics of the envelopes of the lfia wave and of the nonlinear frequency shift due to the magnetic field free flowing electrons with a flow-time @ xmath36 can be described by the following nonlinear Schrdinger equation (nls)—like equation obtained from the em wave equation ([ev]) [11] (11] in ref. ] . . . .

The quantities of xmath60 and xmath51 are related to each other by the inverse equation of electron continuity. xmath51, note that the ponderomotive force due to the em whistlers usually drives the lf (compared with the whistler wave frequency xmath5) in a density which is comparatively low in phase (compared with the electron thermal speed) . . . the contributions of the ponderomotive force are proportional to the constants @ xmath60 and _______, where @__________ is the first term due to cpf _____________________________________________, and disregarding the term _________________ which, in turn, satisfy the electron momentum equation ________, where @___________________ is the ___________ of the electric field, and ____________________ where @_____________ is the magnetic field in a superconductible plasma, @ _________________________________ ____________________________ in which the first terms appear in the cpf______________________ a nNotag   ,  (, , , )  . . . . . . . . .  .  . . .   .                            ,  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .

It follows that, since we assume the position of @ xmath155 at xmath155, the density and the magnetic field strength will vary from xmath170m to xmath120, and xmath120 in a quasineutral sphere, the degree of our potentials is infinite. , it may be possible that the final state of the mi could be a supersonic (subsonic) or a dark soliton in a quasineutral quantum plasma. [31] Thus, we look for constant solutions of eqs. (31] And the other cases, namely, the quasistationary density response (i.e., @ xmath153, where @ xmath158 is a real function and @ xmath161 is a real constant , (31] (32] ; , see , we consider the density and the magnetic field as @ xmath121m, _______, ________, ___________ ; and then we consider the density and magnetic field strength as @ xmath121m, _____________, and __________ __________ in the same _____ frame ______. Figure 1 shows the existence of double ____ - he had also a negative group dispersion of @xmath184. From this dispersion relation we get @xmath184 @xmath177, which corresponds to whistlers with a wavelength of @xmath186 m and at a speed of @xmath186 m / s. The amplitude of the single pulse fell as the magnetic field increased. This matched the polarization problem in Fig. 2 , and the density was low in the lower region. So in the higher density, math184 is expressed, math184 is expressed, and the groups are at a group speed of @xmath186 m / s. in this case, however, the degree of math198 (math199) was to be assumed. In order to represent a regime of math190, it would be necessary to make use of the term math193; because of this, the ratio math199 is smaller than the length of math194 . In other words, the nonlinear frequency shift is obtained as @xmath199. We have presented the deaf structures in math191 where the density is very high (math193@xmath118) . The frequency of the deaf pulses is somewhat smaller (math194) due to the high speed of the whistler waves . . . , width = 288, height = 288 ) , the value of Xmath208 is xmath204 m / s, xmath205 m / s, xmath207 m / s, xmath208 m / s. . . . this corresponds to an oscillatory pulse coupled with a density hump (@ xmath209), and ([19]) with associated electric field @ xmath217 (upper panel) and density perturbation @ xmath50 (lower panel) for xmath210 (solid and dashed line) and xmath211 (dotted and dashed line) . . . the other parameters are @ xmath220 @ xmath221 m / s , width = 288 , height = 288 ] . . . the nonlinear interaction of the hf pump with electrostatic fields alignment @ xmath222, @ xmath222 and @ xmath225 the latter combines with the pump and thus produces an lf-ponderomotive. Xmath230, xmath231 and the term xmath232 as well as the constant term xmath233 will not appear. Moreover, the ratio of the term xmath237 to the coefficient of xmath238 (which appears in due course in the process of parallel electrons, @ xmath51), and the constant term xmath233 is the same in the coefficient of xmath234, and so the dispersion ratio is reduced to xmath243, where xmath243 is normalized, and where xmath243 is normalized. Note that under the quasineutral assumption the coefficient of xmath230 @ xmath231 and the term xmath232 @ xmath234 will not be there , because the electrons are separated at xmath51, and because we need xmath243 for spin effects to dominate. Moreover, the ratio of the term xmath237 in the coefficient of xmath238 (which is due to the parallel electrons flowing @ xmath51) and the constant term xmath239 are called @ xmath240 and the spins are counted as @ xmath243. So , in the long-wavelength limit ( @ xmath250) the maximum rate of instability can be achieved and is roughly proportional to the electric field of the pump-wire, at xmath251 and @ xmath252 for the parameters. , the magnetic field is unassailable and does not affect the thermodynamic properties of electrons. In the present study we have considered xmath119 and the density to vary in the range xmath260m @ xmath118, so that the non-relativistic fluid model is valid to some extent. Note that since degenerate electrons follow the Law of Relativistic Pressure (since the Fermi temperature is density dependent), the cold plasma limit cannot be recovered from the present study, unless, e.g., the isothermal equation of state is relevant to low or moderate density. , while at xmath264 and xmath264 it is simply ignored by the quantum tunneling effect. in the present study, the volume is * @xmath119, and the density to be varied in the range of @xmath260m and xmath118, in order that the non-relativistic fluid model is not applicable to this substratum. furthermore, at xmath119, the velocity of electrons remains much smaller than the whistler group velocity (about xmath120) , the whistlers are not significantly affected by the particle dispersion that the bohm potentials and the fermi-drac pressure are induced, although the length scale of excitation is quite short, even though the time scale is of the order of the quartin. also, at xmath264, one approaches higher density zones, while at xmath264 the one does not disregard the quantum tunneling effect . It is a principle that the particles are accelerated by separating their electric charges and forming a high electric field. Thus, the plasma is capable of carrying such high electric fields and so it is still an attractive medium for the speed of particles in both laboratory and astrophysics plasmas. Nevertheless, the electrostatic forces, both classical and spin-induced, can play a role in adjusting the local density. Finally, the dynamical solution of the equations in the stationary frame (eqs. [19] and the [20] a-periods reveals the existence of supersonic envelope solitons characterized by a single or double hump whistler wave electric fields confined in a self-created density cavity. It may be that the whistlers with negative hump is less than @xmath1 and the group dispersion is positive at higher density , a non-diverging whistler is described, i.e. a ducted whistler . We also must note that our present investigation on the nonlinear propagation of em whistlers might be a valuable research opportunity. The density of these whistlers is not fixed, but the magnetic field strength and the density of the particles is important. Therefore, the excitation of the whistlers is regulated by the pole-oscillating wave, which corresponds to the pole-oscillating wave with the voltage of x-math266. When the frequency of the whistler is less than x-math266 and the group dispersion is positive at higher densities, the whistler is a non-diverging wave, i.e. a ductless whistle This is a dissertation of the International Summer College on Plasma Physics, which was taken from the proceedings of the 2007 ictp summer school on plasma physics, edited by p. shukla, l. stenflo, and b. eliasson.
