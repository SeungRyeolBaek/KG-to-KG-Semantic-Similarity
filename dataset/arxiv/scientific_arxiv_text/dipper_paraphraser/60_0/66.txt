It is not the time of the cp violation to the internal decay of the kobayashi-masako phase of the Kba-kobayashi-masako (CKm) matrix . . . in the standard model sm, the only cause of cp violation is the kobayashi-masako phase of the Kba-kobayashi-masako phase (xcite) . . . thanks to the precise measurements at the current factory, cp violation could be observed in the @xcite-xcite-xcite-mi, leading to the measurement of @xcite-xcite, where the world average yields @xcite-xcite-mi. . This is a rather difficult analysis because the ratio of penguin to tree amplitude is important. In this talk, we will discuss the result of @xcite-mi, in which the transparent method of exploring the ut of the cp violation in the @xcite-mi is compared to the xcite-mi in the Gold-Piece matrix. qcd, the in-vector cp-asymmetry, in @xmath0 decays, is defined by @xmath13 @ xmath14 with @xmath15, and @xmath16 and @xmath8 are ckm angles which are related to the Wolfenstein cp-asymmetry in @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the usual way @xcite . a model-independent lower bound on the ckm parameters, as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath1 is derived. for any given value of @xmath21 and @xmath22, a measurement of @xmath12 and @xmath23 defines a curve in the xmath17 and xmath18 plane, expressed respectively by @xmath. A recent analysis gives the penguin parameter @ xmath26 @ xmath28 where the error includes the estimation of possible significant corrections. In order to gain an additional insight into the structure of hadronic @ xmath3 decays, it would be interesting to investigate these quantities by other channels, or by other methods.   a  a  u 4 + r  p  chi a  u 6 + r  a [a b  b  2 + r  2 + r  r    a [a  b  2 + b  2]  a  a [b  1 + b  3 + 2 b  ]  a    end  aligned   ] It is possible to obtain the ut by combining the information from @xmath12 with the value of @xmath1 , which is well known from the «gold plated4« mode -@xmath41 , although the definitions are somewhat different from @xmath40 - . . . , to which they contribute only at order - @xmath34 . - [10] in the rqcd of (rqcd) , the coefficients expand to the first order in - @xmath29 and - at -math30 we find that the uncalculable power corrections, @xmath32 and @xmath33, do not appear in -[12] of [11] and which they contribute only at order - - xmath34 , although their definitions differ slightly from -math40 (see -math40 for further discussion) The angle @ xmath16 of the ut is given by @ xmath42 the current world average @ xcite @ xmath6 , that is, @ xmath43 given a value of @ xmath44 , @ xmath17 is connected to @ xmath17 by @ xmath45 , the two observables @ xmath44 and @ xmath12 are calculated as the relation between @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 , because the dependence on @ xmath22 is introduced in a hcdf, since the dependence on @ xmath22 enters into etataus xmath18 and xmath17, in principle, are not quite obvious, but they are ignored in the standard fit of the ut (see @ xcite for more details) . After considering the implications of xmath12 on the ut, let us now turn to xmath23. if xmath24 is positive, Xmath24 will be positive, as if xmath48 were in the same order, and any sign change in xmath24 would simply shift the sign of xmath24. Besides xmath24, in contrast to xmath12, the hadronic quantities xmath21 and xmath22 played a prominent role in xmath23, as can be seen in (Chrhoeta ) . , that will make the interpretation of an experimental result for @ xmath23 more complicated if we fix the weak parameters and study the influence of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22. This will in general complicate the interpretation of an experimental result for @ xmath23. In Fig. 1 [Fig. 2] , a useful representation is obtained by plotting the contours of constant @ xmath23 in the plane (@ xmath21, @ xmath22) in the plane, for given values of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22. if @ xmath52 , /sent> ) . As it was shown in xcite, there is a bound to the parameter @ xmath23, which is given by xmath49 and @ xmath50, where the maximum occurs at xmath51 . It is, however, if @xmath53, that the sub-unit math54 is multiplied by math55, and math54 is the universal sub-unit math56 . it is, however, if @xmath53 is increased, the sub-unit math56 is maximized, which gives the general sub-unit math56. If now we have now @xmath65, we have @xmath66, and @xmath67, we emphasize that this lower sub-unit of math18 is based only on the observed observations @ xmath44 and math12 and is essentially free of hasronic uncertainties . As we have just done so, let us briefly remark on the second solution for xmath18, which takes the minus sign in front of the square root replaced by a plus sign. For positive xmath12 this solution is always larger than etataus, and the bound (etabound) is unaffected. For @xmath70, the second solution is always larger than etataus, and the bound (etabound) is not affected. For the difference between the lower bound (etabound) and the unitarity triangle, the lower bound (etabound) is a fairly strong one, close to the actual value of @ xmath68 (see @xcite for more details). quote> angle @ xmath16 or @ xmath44, the lower bound on @ xmath18 is equivalent to the upper bound on @ xmath72 . . . we do, however, demonstrate the region in the xmath74 plane that can be strained by the measurement of @ xmath1 and @ xmath12 by the bound in quote . . . we show the region in quote , the region in quote , which can be influenced by the measurement of @ xmath1 and @ xmath12, the lower bound on @ xmath18 becomes stronger as either @ xmath12 or @ xmath1 increases . . . from fig. . . . utbound , we illustrate the region in quote , which can be restricted by the measurement of @ xmath1 and @ xmath12 by the bound in quote . It is observed that the filtering-induced inequalities in @xmath12 in @xmath12 can be found easily by combining them with the corresponding observables from @xmath2 and @xmath1 to obtain the unitarity triangle parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18. In this article we have proposed strategies for extracting information on weak phases from cp violation observables in @xmath0 decays, even in the presence of hadronic contributions from the penguin amplitudes. The sensitivity of the sensitivity of the hadronic quantities, which have normal values @xmath78 and @xmath79, is very weak. In particular, there are no first-order corrections in @xmath22.
