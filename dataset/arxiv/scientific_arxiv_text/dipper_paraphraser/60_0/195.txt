(P. 181] We suppose, for instance, that @ xmath270 is equal to xmath270 . [13] In other words, we suppose that @ xmath270 takes the value of @ xmath270 in the limit of @ xmath63. Here, in the range of @ xmath270 we take the difference between the corresponding units and the proportions of the quantities given by @ xmath270. On the other hand, we have: @ xmath270 takes the value of @ xmath270 in the limit of @ xmath63. Xmath289 and Xmath290 have no problem approaching Xmath72, and Xmath292 is so small that Xmath23 is smaller than Xmath67 ... So, we define the bare parameter xmath179 in such cases.
