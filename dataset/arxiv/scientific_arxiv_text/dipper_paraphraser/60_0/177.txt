Let xmin> denote the integral of xmin> along xmin2 (tomogram), xmin2, where xmin2 denotes the integral of xmin3 along the line xmin3 (tomogram) . [38] from the mathematical point of view the reconstruction problem is formulated as follows: the goal is to determine the internal structure of an object without cutting it, that is, by means of a method that allows for the presence of a piece of data that remains undamaged, namely, the interaction of the object with various probes, rays, electrons, and many others, resulting in what we call a projection, or a tomogram, as a rule, if a fit, as a rule, is a tomogram, as a rule if a curve had been constructed on a line, a line of one side, and a resulting curve of one side of xmath3, which demonstrates its axiom in xmath5, and the two sides, and the whole, can be extended to the xmath7—xmath7. , so that if a complex function is to be defined, it is to be calculated in an appropriate fashion by the knowledge of a certain set of integrals. The calculations of tomography are fast developing, for they provide a broad range of information, for their usefulness in the diagnosis of difficult, unconnected problems, such as medicine, biomedical science, archaeology, and archaeology. Thus, if we take the xmath7, we take the same This radon transform of the wigner function was considered in the tomographic approach to the study of quantum states in the tomographic approach. It was experimented with different particles and in various circumstances. A good review of recent mathematical developments is contained in xcite and xcite , where particular emphasis is laid on maximization of the calculations, which enable one to obtain the most reliable information from the available data. The tomographic solution to the problem of obtaining a satisfactory estimate of the unknown function is made up of two main factors: the first is the difficulty of the reconstruction process: in order to obtain a good estimate of the unknown function it is necessary to have a extremely precise knowledge of its tomography. Several important generalizations of the radon transform of the wigner function have been made by john , gelfand , helgason , and strichartz . a recent study of the modern mathematical aspects of classical and quantum tomography is referred to in the following sections: namely, a discussion of symplectic transformations , the deep relationship of classical systems and classical dynamics, the formalism of star-product quantization, and the study of slight marginals along curves not straight. a tomographic problem may be defined as follows: in the given data - xmath3 - the task is to find xmath3 from the equation xmath15 , it is necessary to know very well the tomographic tomography, and a logical explanation of this will be given in a subsequent chapter. And so it is clear that we must abandon the demand of uniqueness in the field of imaging. Therefore, to compensate for the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem and to reduce the uniqueness of the inversion process, a regularization method has to be introduced to stabilize the inversion. We have a powerful approach in the introduction of the mumford-shah (ms) functional, introduced in another context for the denoising and segmentation of images @xcite. in the sections below radon , the dual map and the inversion formula are introduced, and a short introduction to the ms functional is given to the image, namely, to the determination of the boundaries of the internal organs. A significant contribution is that in many practical applications, it is not only the reconstruction of the density of the image, but also the extraction of certain special features or patterns from the image. This method is very well established and can be used for enforcing the inversion. The main motivation is that in many practical applications, one is not only interested in the reconstruction of the density, but also in the extraction of some special features or patterns of the image, e.g. the determination of the boundaries of the internal organs. In section (sub-section) ms, a technique for enforcing the ms function is presented. In particular, in subsection (sub-section) ms, the piecewise constant model and known results are discussed, together with a short list of some interesting open problems. ‘if we know the family of tomograms on xmath29, can we reconstruct the density function of xmath3? The answer is affirmative and in the following part we will show how to get this result. We may have the following mathematical model: a smooth function of xmath23 on a plane, a line of xmath24, and a line of xmath12 , let’s suppose that the tomogram for that line is given by xmath25, where xmath26 is the Euclidean measure of the line on which it is formed . . . . if another ray, with a different direction, is considered, we may compute the integral of the density of the line on that line . . . in this way we have created an operator . . . that translates a smooth function xmath3 on the plane xmath1 into a function xmath10 on xmath2 , the manifold of all hyperplanes in xmath2. , . . . a unit vector in the vector in the sphere in the sphere of @ xmath12 . . . a value of one and a half percent. The equation of the hyperplane @ xmath12 is that of @ xmath42, with @ xmath43 as the inner product of @ xmath45 . . . . we say: * xmath36 is the unique probability measure on the compact set @ xmath37, which is invariant in the group of rotations around @ xmath38 . . . observe that the pairs @ xmath46 are mapped in the same hyperplane @ xmath47 . . . . , dylan - . . . , thy xmath36 is the euclidean inner product of @ xmath45 . , have a multiplicative potential. ... . (Changed width = 45.9) This is critical. There is, indeed, an integral energy in the laplacian-dependent (equal) power of the laplacian, which can be seen in the inversion formula for the radon-transform . . . the only dependence on @ xmath7 is in the strength of the elementary charge . . . xmath . . . The equation ((inversion formula )) states that the function @ xmath3 can be recovered from its radon-transform . . . in the radon-transform . . . let’s . . . the enumeration of the Law of Inversion, if the Inversion Method is considered, the General Proof of the Law of Inversion can be found in . . . . . let’s . . . . , t_ . . . , we have defined the radon transform of any function @ xmath82 as @ xmath10. A well-known analogous decomposition is given by the fourier transform. for example, when @ xmath81, one finds the inversion formula (eq. radoninversion) originally discovered by radon @ xcite. [1] radon inversion is a linear one-to-one mapping of @ xmath50 with @ xmath84, and where the space @ xmath84 is defined as follows: @ xmath85 if and only if @ xmath85, and for any integer @ xmath87 the integral @ xmath88 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @ xmath89 in @ xmath90. Unfortunately it is well known that @ xmath27 is not continually invertible on xmath91 - xcite, and this implies that the problem of inversion is ill-posed . to compute the density distribution , the radon linear operator - xmath27 is a linear, one-to-one mapping of @ xmath50 to @ xmath84, where the space @ xmath84 is defined as follows: if and only if @ xmath86, the integral - xmath88 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree - xmath89 in @ xmath90 . it means that in an ill-posed problem the operator Xmath100 does not exist, or is not defined on all of xmath97, or does not exist in general. To correct this, we introduce the notion of a regularization of Xmath100. It is a family of linear continuous operators Xmath105 defined on all xmath97 and for which Xmath106 is defined on the domain of xmath100 . vThe number xmath117 is called a _reproach_ parameter . the number xmath117 is called a _reproachable_ parameter . this is a family of linear continuous operators Xmath104 which are defined on all xmath97 and for which Xmath106 is defined on the domain of xmath100 . . . Well, of course, the homogeneous regions correspond to meaningful parts of objects in the real world, and the edges correspond to their apparent contours. The classic mumford-shah functional—xcite—is the following: (x10). The first term, math121, denotes an open set (a screen); (x12) is a closed set (a set of edges); (d) xmath125—reflects the equilateral gradient of math126; (d) math125—denotes the distributional gradient of math126; math125—denotes the angular distributional gradient of math124;; math125—denotes the radial inclination of math126; math125—denotes the geometrical height of math124; math129—denotes the hausdorff measure . . . a distinction between accuracy and segmentation , the compromise depends on the modification of the parameters @ xmath132 and @ xmath133, which have different roles. The modification of the parameter @ xmath132 determines how much the proportions of the proportions of the fraction of xmath126 can vary; if @ xmath132 is small, then some variations of xmath126 are allowed, while as @ xmath133 increases, the proportions of the fractions become coarser. The condition Xempose is the perfect compromise between accuracy and segmentation. This compromise depends on the correction of the parameters @ xmath132 and @ xmath133, which are different in their role. The inclusion of the parameter Xempose is a parameter of the functional and a parameter of the thickness, so that @ xempose is closed and @ xempose is increasing. Besides, the functional of this kind, the centre of which represents the image in the mumford-shah model (edges @ xcite) . I have taken the weight of the first term, i.e., the fidelity term, which ensures that the reconstruction of the equation for xmath3 is close enough to a solution of the equation for xmath140, while the other terms play exactly the same role as explained above for the functional for xmath133. In addition to the reconstruction of the density at xmath3 we are interested in the reconstruction of the singularity at xmath120, that is, the set of points at which the solution at xmath3 is discontinuous. As we have already explained, it is often useful to restrict the reconstruction to the density at xmath3 that is constant with respect to the partition of the body, because the tissues of the inner organs, bones, or muscles are approximately constant. The main difference with respect to the normal mumford-shah functional ([c]] [c] is that we have to translate the information of the sharp discontinuities of the relation at xmath13 (and therefore, the space of the radon transform) into information about the strong discontinuities of the relation at xmath3 , that is, the synthesis of the density of xmath3 with respect to the partition of the body, as the tissues of the inner organs, bones and muscles have approximately constant density. if the functional ( * : msfunctional) is restricted to the functions in Xmath141, then the second term (involving derivatives of Xmath3) disappears, so that it remains to minimize the functional Xmath159 over Xmath141 in respect of the functional variable Xmath160 (a vector of Xmath142 components) and the geometric variable Xmath161 (a partition of the domain Xmath55 with at least Xmath142 distinct regions satisfying the non-degeneracy condition ([nondegeneracy] ) . . . for technical reasons it is necessary to assume a non-degeneracy condition on the admissible partitions of xmath55: Xmath149 for some Xmath150, for all Xmath151, where xmath152 denotes the lebesgue measure on xmath90. . . . if we condescend to a special function, Xmath153, we see that the second term (involving the derivatives of Xmath3) disappears, and therefore we continue to minimize the functional Xmath159 over xmath141, with regard to the functional variable xmath160 (a vector of xmath142 components) and the geometric variable xmath161 (a partition of the domain of Xmath55 with at least xmath142 distinct regions satisfying the non-degeneracy condition ([nondegeneracy] . ‘The first result is that there are minimizers of the functional ‘xmath167’ in ‘ [functional ‘xmath167’ ), and for all ‘xmath168’ there exists a minimizer of the functional ‘xmath167’, with ‘xmath169’, and with ‘xmath174’, that is, a minimizer of ‘xmath167’ with its initial data ‘xmath166’. Finally, the last result is that the maximal dependency of the minimizers of ‘xmath167’ in ‘xmath166’ is a calculated or a reduced proportional part of the total error of ‘xmath166’. For all ‘xmath168’, let ‘xmath174’ mean ‘an estimate of’ the approximate cost of ‘xmath167’ with ‘xmath166’. Now, for all ‘xmath173’, let ‘xmath174’ denote ‘the approximate cost’ of ‘xmath167’ with ‘xmath166’. The second result concerns the stable dependence of ‘xmath167’ on the error level @ xmath166. In short, the second result concerns the strict stability of ‘xmath166’, the fractional error rate @ xmath166. Let’s assume we have noisy data, say, in ‘xmath168’, with ‘xmath174’. Let’s say that ‘xmath174’ be ‘xmath174’, where ‘xmath174’ is ‘xmath174’. Let’s suppose we have a noise-rich data set @ xmath168, with ‘xmath179’. Let’s suppose we have , so there is an equilibrium of xmath189, and, in addition, if xmath195 is the unique solution of this equation, the sequence converges to xmath195 at xmath197. Finally, we will enumerate some open problems: * is there any non-degeneracy of the non-cond condition ( (nodegeneracy)) necessary? * is there any kind of a priori-estimate of the value of xmath198 of different values? * and, finally, it would be very important for applications to prove that the minimization of the functional (defn: msfunctional) is not restricted to the logically constant functions at xmath197. Observe that all these problems are quite natural and have been fully solved in the case of the standard mumford-she-she functional @ xmath134 in (defn: jms) , see e.g. @ xcite . in this section we restrict our attention to the @ xmath199-dimensional case. , we have the inversion formula (inversion formula0) and the electrostatic identity (Electid) , respectively, which are called by different names: for all @ xmath201, the function xxi is an inversion of the equation xxii and the alternating finite element (eq.

Using the property based on the electrostatic interpretation of the tomographic reconstruction, we can try to simplify some of the appropriate functionals in the new variables xmath222 (electric field) or xmath223 (electric potential) and then calculate the corresponding xmath3 (charge density) . The function xmath225 is a new function for the vector function xmath222 and the corresponding xmath120, and we take advantage of the fact that xmath226 is conservative. Observe that the function xmath227 is a second order functional for a vector field xmath222 in which a measure of the set xmath120 is the measure of the set xmath3 that is the set of discontinuities of xmath3 and thus is the set of discontinuities of xmath228. From the electrostatic formulation of the radon transform, we can prove that the fidelity term in the functional xmath139 imposes that the electric field produced by the distribution of xmath3 must be close to the measured electric field ... “Second recurrence, then ”—(then, if a factor of concentration is allowed, there will be no illusory particle . . . “(subject) – sent>; the above equation ([p1]), tells us that the blake-zisserman model can be applied to the vector function of [p2]—a more exact segmentation than the mumford-zisserman model, in that it approximates the curvature of the original picture. The blake-zisserman model is a relaxed version of the mumford-zisserman model. The blake-zisserman model is derived from a divergence of the [p2][2] vector field and from the [p2][p3][p3][p3][5], that is, from the set of discontinuities of [6][6][7][8] [8][9] [10], as a python (i.e., from the set of creases of [9][9][10][9][10], from the [9][10][9]: [10] [10][12]].[10]|2] The blake-zisserman function permits more precise segmentation than the motherford-shah function, since the curvature of the original picture is also approximated. The blake-zisserman function allows for more precise segmentation than the mumford-shah function in the sense that also the curvature of the edges He concluded this section with some remarks: * We proved that the measured data at xmath14 is actually the measured electric field produced by the unknown charge density, and therefore the term 'at xmath200' in the functional is a fidelity term in a weak sense. This analysis of the blake-zisserman model would provide immediately new results in tomography . Moreover, the peculiar tomographic features, such as the intrinsic vector nature of the variable at xmath222, the fact that the support cannot be bounded, and the extra constraint at xmath246 make new research directions in the study of free-distance problems. to reverse this fidelity, one could reformulate the reconstruction problem in terms of the electric potential at xmath223 (@ xmath248), obtaining a third-order functional in which the fidelity term is at xmath249, where potentials are given by (eq: potentials). in this case, the electrostatic description of tomography given in this section does not appear. Moreover, in a generic dimension of xmath250, the situation is quite different because the inversion formula for the radon transform involves a power of the laplacian. Hence the electrostatic description of tomography in this section is not applicable. In order to restore this equilibrium, it is necessary to consider another radon-type transform, which is integral of @xmath3 over a linear line with codimension @xmath251 such that @xmath2514 4 , that is, an integral of @xmath3 over a linear swarm with codimension @xmath25 ‘Submit . . .’
