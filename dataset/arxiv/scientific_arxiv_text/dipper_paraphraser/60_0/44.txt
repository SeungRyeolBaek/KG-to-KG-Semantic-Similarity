Xcite – the first rbfe and fe were prepared from stoichiometric amounts of rubidium, arsenic, and iron . the rbfe and fe at xmath3as were mixed and heated in evacuated and sealed silica tubes at 350 c and 800 c. then the obtained rbfe and fe at xmath3as were mixed together in a molar ratio, one and one alike, pressed into pellets, and placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in an alumina ampoule. At this point the samples were annealed for three days at 650 c and ground for three days at the same temperature. When an ac field of 10 oe is heated, the atomic positions used in the calculation are the atomic positions obtained from the room temperature x-ray diffraction. . . . the atomic positions used in the calculation are those obtained from room temperature x-ray diffraction . . . for the exchange-conducting function we used the generalized gradient approximation of perdew, burke, and ernzerhof. . . for the exchange-conductivity function we used the generalized gradient approximation of perdew, burke, and ernzerhof. . . . . since the efg tensor is extremely sensitive to the charge distribution, a well-converged basis is required in order to grant the /sent> . . . . wiggle-curves and abreast-distances, and relative to the reciprocal space was investigated. By means of this procedure, a smearing of 270 mev was performed on the methfessel-Paxton map, and this convergence was carefully checked. We chose the nominal radius of two-thousand-millimetre muffins of 2 =40510704204164 , in the form of @xmath712, where @xmath721020427044121620424447610910 1191191/101010 1010conveyor components  as and pn1rb are derived from eq. 1 in the main article . At a few temperatures the T-q-symbols of T-q-symbols of T-q-symbols were derived by combining the fourier transforms of half the echo recorded at various frequencies but the necessary features were not found in the spectra. In the T-q-symbols of T-q-symbols the T-q-symbols spectra were obtained by combining the integral of the T-wave and the X-ray Spectrlogram of T-Q-symbol spectra as a function of the irradiation frequency . 2 mhz in accordance with the experimental values (@ x-wave71) @ x-wave7414 . 1 mhz and this dft is not based on any pretexts, but on a magnetic order of magnetic elements, and the internal field of the body shifts the resonance frequency to much higher values . 1 mhz, the nqr is in /sent> . 1 mhz, and the discrepancy represents an estimate of the accuracy of the dft calculation, which is known to not include electronic correlations. The narrow xmath13rb nqr spectra are shown in Fig. [rbnmr] , which is fully compatible with the quadrupole frequency of the xmath13rb nqr spectra. The narrow xmath13rb nqr spectra were obtained from the fourier transform of half of the echo signal, after the same echo pulse. The decay, if @xmath77 22, can be calculated with a value of 152 > and the temperature dependence of 68(fig. [figt2]) can be the result of the slight temperature dependence of 4, Fig. [figt2]) , the redfield contribution to the relaxation is @xmath82  . So, in the case of a nuclear spin @ xmath16, along the @ xmath85 axes of the efg, one would have: xmath88, where the symbols xmath88 and xmath89 refer to the external field orientation in relation to the crystallographic axis of xmath86. The differences of xmath93 from 2 [2, 3], as is the case in a dense system, xcite, is probably due to the partial irradiation of a /sent>. Taking into account the @xmath94 corrections we measured the +/- dependence of the +/- spectrum of the central line below 50 k and saw no significant change. The recovery of the +/- spectrum of the +/- line of the central line by the saturation recovery pulse is calculated according to @xmath98 , the recovery is shown in fig. t1rbnmr , corresponding to grains with the axes perpendicular to @xmath97 .  t1rbnmr  , and one observes, like that of @xmath98 nqr , two components appearing at a low temperature. The long component was measured only in nmr, for in nqr the very long math1rb relaxations and the much lower signal intensity make the measurements very nimble. The fast component, the only one at @xmath99 k, was measured . . . A nuclear magnetization function was obtained according to the recovery laws expected for a magnetic relaxation mechanism in the sphere of a magnetic disturbance, xcite, xmath102 for xmath1 and xmath2 . Notice that if the relaxation were caused by efg fluctuations, xmath14 would scale with the square of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment and a value of xmath105 would be about 50 times smaller than the experimental value . . . in nqr irradiating either xmath1 rb @ xmath100 transition, or xmath2 rb . . . . the ratio between the xmath14 of the two nuclei for the fast relaxation was measured at a few selected temperatures from 4 to 25 k and xmath104 (fig. [t1rb] ) in good agreement with the ratio of the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei @ xmath43, confirming the adequacy of the recovery laws we have estimated xmath14 and the fact that the relaxation is driven by electrons. sent> he found that the recovery laws did not change much in the spectrum (fig. [t1]] . namely, math32, math32, math27 and math28 show a negligible frequency dependence. Lastly, we have verified that math32, the amplitude of the slow relaxation component, is zero over 20 k by recording recovery from math106 to math39 (fig. [t1]) . Finally, we checked that math32, the amplitude of the slow relaxation component, is zero below 20 k, and we saw that math32, math32, and math32 seem to depend a little on the thermal history (i.e. on the cooling rate) , which will be the subject of future investigations .
