One way of looking at the modern observations, such as sneia (supernovae), cmb (cold in the cosmic background), converges to the fact that there is a spatially homogeneous and gravitationally repulsive energy component, referred to as dark energy, which accounts for about 30 years of the energy density of the universe. Recent work has shown that dark energy can behave as a ghost and thereby violate the weak energy condition. Some heuristic models that roughly account for the observable consequences of dark energy have been proposed in recent years, a number of them derived from physics, and the others are simply phenomenological. Some thirty years ago, a bouncing cosmological model with torsion was proposed in ref.. [44] (a model with torsion as a potential source of acceleration in the early universe). Nester and collaborators of Goenner et al. examined the torsion potential in a model based on a Riemann-Caran geometry: dynamic scalar torsion. They hypothesised that the dynamic pgt link, a reflection of the nature of dynamic pgt torsion, would provide the accelerating force. In various models, the fundamental quantities are either geometrical (if they are constructed from spacetime geometry directly) or physical (if they depend on physical fields). Physical quantities are obviously model-dependent, while geometrical quantities are more universal. I have seen that Xmath4 may be the only feasible dynamic pgt torsion cosmology. Some investigations have found that Xmath4 and Xcite can be the only valid dynamic pgt torsion cosmology. . . . the pseudoscalar mode @ xmath5 is naturally driven by the intrinsic spin of elementary fermions, so naturally it can contact such sources . so it is generally thought that axial torsion must be small and small, and only small, at the late cosmological evolution. In a cosmological context with the scalar mode, cosmological models offer a situation where dynamic torsion can be observable at the late cosmological period. . . . , this is an important point for the torsion cosmology of xcite , and a good model should constrain this fine tuning as much as possible . the cosmological equivalence of cosmology has received strong confirmation from modern observations, which have greatly restricted the possibilities of non-vanishing fields. Thus the scalar mode at xmath6 has only a time component and can be defined as the gradient of a time dependent function. , therefore, the cosmological model with a scalar mode presents a situation in which dynamic tessellation can take place at late time . However, sahni, saini, starobinsky, and alamah_sobiyetinsky have introduced the pair of parameters Xmath12: Xmath13, Xmath14. , it is evident that this is a natural step beyond xmath10 and xmath11. It was observed in the literatures on xcite that the states of the statefinders are capable of discriminating among a number of cosmological models. This fact is already well known in the literatures of xcite , and the statefinder diagnostics of cosmological models have the advantage of being capable of discriminating between them. fortunately, as is often demonstrated in the literatures on xcite, the statefinder diagnostics of the torsion universe are able to successfully distinguish between a number of models. It was found in the statefinder diagnostics that the universe is naturally both accelerated at low redshifts (late) and decelerating at high redshifts (initial). Therefore, the cosmological model of scalar torsion is capable of avoiding some of the problems that can occur in other models. This is an extraordinary possibility and one that requirments an investigation. If the course of the statefinder has an early phase (@xmath15), then we can understand why the expansion of the universe continues at xmath16. pgt @ xcite has been regarded as an interesting alternative to general relativity because of its gauge structure and geometric properties. pgt, by implication, is an inverse of riemann-cartan geometry. It is based on a Riemann-Cartan affine connection, xmath20, where xmath21 is the levi-civita connection and xmath22 is the torsion tensor. Furthermore, the ricci curve and the scalar curve can be expressed by Xmath29, where xmath32 is a lagrangian variable, and xmath0 is a torsion parameter. . . . the gravitational lagrangian density for the scalar mode is xmath30, where xmath32 is a torsion parameter, and xmath0 is a torsion parameter. Therefore, the field equations of the scalar mode are formulated in advance, and the field equations of the scalar mode are formulated in advance. . . . theoretically, the scalar mode is considered a tendentiously dynamic mode. The field equations of scalar mode are discussed in the following way. In the corresponding equations of motion in the matter-dominated era are as follows: @xmath44, where @xmath45 and the energy density of the matter component are @xmath46; and the spatial parts, if there is an effective pressure, are . . . , the torrence field, are by turns (     ) and the diagonal terms vanish. For the case of the scalar torsion, the effective energy - momentum tensor can be represented by @xmath56,   label  torpre         []                    ,   ,  label                ,   ,      ,  [atr] [with the equator, which is the right parameter, but which is not the left parameter, i.e., yu can be made to a large extent with only time, and so one can set to xmath45 and the energy density of matter of the component of the force, which is obtained from general relativity . . . . However, this result depends on the type of data and the values of the parameters. . . . - Fig. [336] is shown in fig. [336] in which we have chosen @ xmath60, @ xmath61, @ xmath62, @ xmath63, and @ xmath64, and set the current time to xmath66. In the following sections we will investigate the statefinder and give the dynamics analysis for all values of the parameter @ xmath0. The dynamic torsion (a geometry quantity in the riemann-cartan spacetime) is bound to exhibit an essential distinction with different dark energy models. therefore, its statefinder diagnostics will be able to reveal a diverse feature.  Therefore, the scalar torsion cosmology is not suited to solving the fine-tuning problem of the At-xmath65 . , which is, the value of the scalar parameter @ xmath10 is indefinitely in a negative range, math67 == , that is, the universe is currently accelerating. For the flat, math69 cdm model, the parameter @ xmath70 corresponds to a fixed point math70, and math71 for the standard cold dark matter model (scdm) containing no radiation. Therefore, the scalar cosmology must exhibit an essential distinction in contrast to other dark energy models, so the diagnostic function will reveal a different feature . “Let’s say xmath74—save”—“head”—“leave”—“start,” “off,” “End”—“middle,” “leave,” “after”—“(48)) – “that is, to take the directions in a trajectory based on the ratio of the number to the number of the orbital number. We will examine the direction of the divergence in xmath76 from one hour to the next. Thus, we will plot the trajectories in Fig. “Cartridge3,”—”“ in the curve, I; that is, in a direction, parallel to infinite, y=m; and in the direction of “near xmath80”—“on the right”—“on the left”; and we will notice that the spatial distribution of the movements in xmath78 corresponds to the numerical solution of ref. It is quite easy to see that the movement of the cosmic masses alternates between deceleration and acceleration in the rising trajectory of Xmath77; and the greater the period, the greater the degree of acceleration. In the second place, we will discuss the time evolution of the positional indicators at xmath81 and xmath81; we will also discuss the time evolution of the positional indicators at xmath81, where we have chosen xmath82 and xmath83; we will draw the trajectory in fig. _planet_4 , where we have chosen xmath82 and xmath83; we will now outline the positions in Fig. _plane_4 , in which we have chosen xmat The arrows indicate the direction of time evolution.

We see that the morphometries are identical to the Xmath103, except that they pass the xmath69cdm. Besides, we can easily see that the morphometries of the statefinder are in a similar form to the Xmath103, but they do not reach the xmath69cdm. So, we see, the scalar torsion has the capacity to accelerate the universe for every torsion parameter xmath0. But, in addition, the factors affecting the speed of expansion are positively determined by torsion. As a result, the kinetic energy is being distorted. As a result, we can observe the evolution of the statefinder curves in Fig. [2] where we have chosen xmath97 and xmath98. The statefinder diagnoses show that the universe is naturally accelerated at low redshifts (late) and decelerated at high redshifts (early) for the cases of xmath105 and xmath18. It is interesting to note that scalar torsion is the accelerating force in the universe for any of the torsion parameters @ xmath0. However, it is dependent on the torsion parameters that there is a decelerating ( @ xmath15) expansion and a decelerating ( @ xmath104) expansion. " Why the torsion parameter "xmath0" is divided into differential ranges by the statefinder answer is very simple. This diagnostic directly relates to the attractor of cosmological dynamics. In the case of the determination of critical points by the calculation of eqs. (dth) - (dtr) is an autonomous system, we can use the qualitative method of differential equations. By substituting linear perturbations at xmath107, - -108, -109 near the critical points, gives three independent equations, from which we can obtain three eigenvalues. (dtr) is an autonomous system, and so we can use the qualitative method of differential equations. The critical points are often the extreme points of the orbits, and so describe the asymptotic behavior. In cosmology, the critical points are always constant solutions. There are five critical points, as follows, at xmath110, where @ xmath112 , @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 . Using eq. [ critical points] we can obtain critical points and study their stability. By substituting linear perturbations, @ xmath107, @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 near the critical points, we can give the evolution of the linear perturbations to the first orders of the perturbations, from which we can obtain three eigenvalues. stability requires the real part of all eigenvalues to be negative. - Then eqs . . . (dthphirlinear) have an exact periodic solution at xmath120, where xmath121, xmath122, xmath123, xmath124, xmath125 and xmath126 are first values. - The linear system - dthphirlinear - has an exact periodic solution at xmath120, where xmath121, xmath122, xmath123, xmath124, xmath125, xmath126 are initial values , evidently, xmath127 is a critical line of the linearized eqs. ([he]) . . . This is the geometry of a plane, a circular plane, which is from the xmath-x-x-x-x-x-p-p-m point to the xmath-x-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-c-d-c-c-c-c-p-p-cd-e-s-c-p--a-e-e-e-in-c-d-c-e-e-e-x-c-c-c-cc-cc-d-c - c-cc-cd-cd-c - so that the to-and-fro-c -cn -C (d-cv-cdcl-cs-e-e-cvs-e-v-ccdm-1) corresponds to the stable focus (cf. Fig. 6), and the stable-weighted saddle with c-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-c As an example, if you presently consider the expansion of the universe to xmath140, the main goal is to form an arbitrary ansatz for xmath140, which is not necessarily physical motivated but is specially designed to give the best possible solution to the data for xmath140. The cosmological model for xmath140 is given, where xmath150 is the model parameter, and a maximum likelihood technique is employed to evaluate the good fit of the parameters to the data, and to assess the goodness of the fit of the model to the data. The observational data consist of the apparent magnitudes of xmath150 and redshifts of xmath152, and their corresponding errors, xmath153 and xmath154, which are assumed to be gaussian and uncorrelated. On the other hand, if one observes the distance between the observed apparent magnitude and the theoretical prediction, xmath140, it is the magnitude of xmath150 which is the 'jumping point' between the observed apparent magnitude and the theoretical prediction. One usually define the distance modulus of xmath164 and express it in terms of the dimensionless, "heartless free" distance, defined by xmath164, and the zero offset xmath165 depends on xmath48 (or the normal candle is ordinary). The parameter(s) given in a numerical calculation is found to be X-math186, and X-math187 to X-math187 the values of parameters X-math139 and X-math138 in fig. 192clcontours – are all measured by the parameters (@ x-math178) – a parameter (‘same’ as X-math174), a parameter (‘same’ as x-math174), a priori value (that is to say, the value of a dimensionless hubble parameter – a parameter equivalent to a dimensionless hubble parameter, a parameter – a parameter – as a function of -math173 – a parameter – a parameter – a parameter – ‘ a parameter –’ – ‘ a parameter, a parameter, a parameter of the dimensionless hubble parameter – a parameter, a parameter, a dimensionless hubble parameter, a parameter which is incompatible with -math173 – -math173 – a parameter which – in its originality – is considered a function of xmath173; if, however, the convergence radius of the series (E1 ) is 18 1 – e1 , a maximum of 1 , we can in the case of the redshift being 18  – 1 – 1 –  – 1 – The new series defines an analytic function @ xmath194 which is said to be obtained from @ xmath195 by direct analytic continuation. In general, we have to take the essence supernovae data, which is one of the most reliable data set, consisting of 192 sneia ( @ xmath198). In general, we have to consider a succession of power series, @ xmath195, @ xmath194, and @ xmath196, each of which is a direct analytic continuation of the preceding one. Moreover, we have the function @ xmath140 from eq. (E1) . furthermore, we have the function @ xmath140 from eq. (E1) . and 0 . . . . . . . . therefore, it is easy to determine that xmath206 is in the right with the best fits of scalar torsion cosmology . . . in fig. [289] We show that the scalar torsion model (@ xmath208, @ xmath210, @ xmath211) has a close curve to the one from xmath206 (@ xmath212) . . . , title = fig: , width = 264 , the scalar torsion model (@ xmath208, @ xmath209, @ xmath210, @ xmath211) gives a close curve to the one from xmath206 (@ xmath212). We can see that the scalar torsion model ( @ xmath208, @ xmath209, @ xmath210, @ xmath211) gives a close curve to the one from xmath206 (@ xmath212). You have just guessed the first few values, and then you can make a dynamical calculation. The statefinder diagnostic is of a much greater use than dynamic analysis in the simpleness of its calculations, but the latter can furnish more detail. the statefinder diagnostic divides the torsion parameter @xmath0 into four levels, which is in keeping with the requirement of dynamic analysis. the statefinder diagnostic has the advantage over dynamic analysis in the simplicity of its calculations, but it can also furnish more information. The trajectories with the shape of tadpoles show that they pass through the fixed point @xmath69cdm in the course of time; then the statefinder pairs are traveling along with a loop and will pass through the fixed point @xmath69cdm again in the future. The most interesting feature of the trajectories is that there is a loop in the case of @xmath217. Similarly, the quasi-periodic feature of the trajectories in the case of @xmath68 show that the numerical solutions in ref. @xcite are not periodic but are quasi-periodic near the focus of the coupled nonlinear equations. We found that the scalar torsion can naturally explain the accelerated expansion of the universe for any torsion parameter. However, it is dependent on xmath0 and xmath32 that there is a decelerating expansion before an accelerating expansion. ‘' mi shet / 10671128> - a better estimate is to be obtained by using the preliminary parameters and their corresponding initial values, which can also be adapted to different conditions. In order to obtain a quantitative understanding of the scalar torsion cosmology, the density of matter, at xmath222, the effective mass density, at xmath222, and the quantity of matter is also important . . . torsion cosmology, in contrast with xmath69cdm, has a rather different structure. In this case, in the high redshift, the density of matter has been observed as a 222cdm universe, and the value of 222cdm is found in the observations of the local density of matter. At low redshift, the density of 222cdm becomes 222cdm, and the 220cdm is renormalized. , , 222cdm is a bit different, and is thus to be expected in a future work . . . , a higher-level of 222 in the torsion cosmology and in the 69 cdm can also be different. ‘227‘ astro ph / 9805260 – hao j g and li x z 2005 – phys. b * 611 ‘7 astro ph / 9805260 – hao j g and li x z 2005 – phys. d * 68 ‘ 074019 – hep th / 0303093 – hao j g and li x z 2006 – phys. d * 68 ‘ 074020 – hep th / 0303093 – hao j g and li x z 2006 – phys. d * 68 ‘ 074019 – hep th / 0303093 – hao j g and li x z 2006 – phys. d * 69 ‘ 074020 – hep th / 0303093 – li x z and hao j g 2004 – phys. d * 69 * 074020 – astro ph / 9805260 – sahni v and shtanov yu 2003 – phys. d * 69 * 074020 – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci – ci sent> kudin v i 2007 class. sent> kudin v i 2007 class. sent> kudin v i 2007 class .  47  astro-ph / 0612738 - li x z, sun c b and xi p 2009 - phys. d * 78  023708 - arxiv : 0903 .  1157 - astro-ph / 0612738 - li x z, sun c b and xi p 2009 - phys . d * 82  2253 - - hecht r d, nester j and zhytnikov v 1996 - phys. a  2253 - hecht r d, nester j and zhytnikov v 1996 - phys . d * 78 - 023522 - arxiv: 0903 - 3834 - yo h j and nester j m 2009 - phys. a - 39 - 219 - yo h j and nester j m 1998 - mod .
