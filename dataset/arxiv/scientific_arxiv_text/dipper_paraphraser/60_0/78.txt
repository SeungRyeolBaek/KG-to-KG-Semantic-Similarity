' in ' xcite' we introduced 'the propositional-logical'; in 'xcite' he proves that propositional logic is constituted of eleven equational axioms, some of which are dependent upon the constants @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 for the truth values @ xmath10 and '11 . ' xcite's most common expression is 'xmath4'; but to reason systematically with conditional-logical statements a form of 'the short-circuit' evaluation is necessary. , in 'xcite' we use the name 'xmath13' for conditional propositions. ' xcite' , in this paper the ternary connective is introduced as 'conditional'. = = = = xcite. In this paper the ternary connective, 'xmath0', is introduced as 'conditional'. in this paper the ternary connective, 'xmath0', is introduced as 'conditional'. In this paper the ternary connective, 'xmath0', is introduced as 'conditional'. [259] In a conditional statement of xcite, first, @ xmath2 is compared, and depending on the resulting evaluation result, either @ xmath1 or 'Xmath7' is examined, and determines the value. “Excellent valuation congruence is less than the equivalence of hoare’s axioms in @xcite (that appeared in 2012). two conditional statements are equivalent to free valuation congruence if their evaluation trees are equal. Let’s say we have an atomic proposition, #xmath19, and a conditional statement @xmath20, which is not identical to free valuation congruence, although they are identical to static valuation congruence, which is the congruence which characterizes propositional logic. As an example, the atomic proposition @xmath19 and the conditional statement @xmath20 are not equivalent to free valuation congruence, although they are equivalent to a _static_ valuation congruence, which is the congruence which characterizes propositional logic. in this section, rp, we characterize repetition-proof valuation congruence by defining a transformation of evaluation trees that produces repetition-proof evaluation trees: two conditional statements are equivalent to repetition-proof valuation congruence if, and only if, they have equal repetition-proof evaluation trees. And as an example, @xmath22 and the left-hand and right-hand conditional statements are equivalent to repetition-proof valuation congruence, but are not equivalent to free valuation congruence. a general spin-off of our approach can be described as “the basic semantics of proposition algebra”: for each valuation congruence that we consider (including the case of c = free) two conditional statements are c–congruent if and only if they have equal c– basic forms, where c– basic forms are obtained by a syntactic transformation of conditional statements, which is a form of normalization. For the sake of the purely functional analysis, we do not attempt to prove any general occurrences of valuation congruences. Thus we call the signature @ xmath24 with constants @ xmath25 and @ xmath9 for the truth values @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 for the atomic propositions, further called ‘atoms’, to which we add the constants @ xmath19 over the signature @ xmath28. In addition, we define the double @ xmath29 of @ xmath30 as follows: @ xmath13 is an axiometically self-diminal axiomatization: by defining @ xmath13 for each variable, we enumerate the double axiomization of @ xmath32, and these axiomisations are simple and natural, and only for static valuation congruences we use a slightly more complex transformation. We end by a short detour into short-circuit logic, an example of repetition-proof valuation congruence, and some comments on the side effects. “Post-conditional composition over Xmath19” . . . in the evaluation tree of Xmath40, the root is represented by Xmath19, the left branch by Xmath41, and the right branch by Xmath42. This is what we call “the evaluation tree” in Xmath36. . . . in order to define our  evaluation tree semantics, we first define a “replacement” operator, “replacement,” in math36, as follows. . . . “Replacement”   a      footnotesize,” “   ” ;    underline    ;       ” . sf t “     sf t . . . [162] And that’s the phenomenon. So an evaluative of a conditional statement is a complete path in xmath68 (from root to leaf) and contains evaluation values for all atoms . . . in that sense, an evaluative of a conditional statement is a complete path in xmath68 (from root to leaf) and contains evaluation values for all occurring atoms . . . so the evaluative of a conditional statement is a complete path in xmath68 (from root to leaf) and contains evaluation values for all atoms that occur. . . . for example, the evaluative tree of xmath79 from the example [Ef] inf . . . this is evaluative tree of xmath84 (note the syntactical correspondence). . . . I will give you the main result.

At xmath19 the same result will be achieved; and if the conditional statement in xmath17 is different from xmath17 it is of the form of xmath178. The function math178’ is inductively defined: math25 and math9 are rp- basic forms, math174 is a rp- basic form if xmath175 and math176 are rp- basic forms; if xmath177 is not equal to xmath17 or math178, then either the central condition of math177 is different from math19 or math178 is of the form math178 . . . note that and are one another dual. math179 is defined by math180, the auxiliary function math180 is defined as follows: math180 for math53; the auxiliary functions math183 and math184 are defined by math185, math186 , so , math187 maps a conditional statement math1 to math144, and then transforms math144 according to auxiliary functions math188, math189, and math190. For all xmath30, Xmath198 is an rp-basic form. The bases for xmath103 are simple . . . if xmath197, then xmath197, then xmath199 and xmath200. For all xmath202, we have to distinguish the cases xmath201 and xmath202. if xmath201, then xmath202, shoud be a basic form. . . . We find the basic form of Xmath208: it is rp-basic because, by lemma [ la: 3] and 'rp-basic' by lemma [ la: 3] (A); that is, by lemma [A] -basic. For all Xmath30 and -210, xmath208 is an basic form; for the basic form of Xmath203 it is necessary to distinguish the cases xmath204 and -110. if xmath204 is, then xmath103 is, and therefore -205 is an basic form. - In a case like this, we'll start with the auxiliary result: if xmath224 is an rp-basic form, then xmath225 and xmath226 . if xmath229 and xmath230 are rp-basic forms with central conditions @ xmath19, so - xmath231 and the equality for xmath7 is the same. - The base case, that is, xmath228, is trivial . . . . . if xmath229 and xmath230 are rp-basic forms, then xmath225 and xmath226. if xmath229 and xmath230 are rp-basic forms with central condition xmath19, so xmath231 and xmath7 is equal, the same as the equality of . . . . if xmath229 and xmath230 are rp-basic forms with central condition, then xmath231 and the equality for xmath7 follows in a similar way. if xmath229 and xmath232 are equal, then xmath237 and xmath237 are equal, because xmath238 is equal.

Our final result in this section is the completeness of our result in contractive valuation congruence . . . For instance, let Xmath415 be a subset of a . . . [5] the . . . . -Mem- Basic Forms are inductively defined: - A. Xmath425 and - Xmath9 are mem- Basic Forms over A. Xmath416 is a mem- Basic Form over A.

And we are able to find the Inequalities of that Type by means of inductive equivalences on xmath-106. if xmath-204, then xmath-103, and hence xmath-453 is a Basic Form. For the Inductive case of xmath-207 it must be the case that xmath-207 is a Basic Form. if xmath-420, then equalities follow xmath-440, and equalities follow xmath-440, equalities and can be proved in a similar way . . . if xmath-450, then equality follows xmath-450, and that is a similar result. We first prove an auxiliary result, Xmath-450, which follows from induction of the depth Xmath-87 of Xmath-420, and if xmath-440 is equal to xmath-450, we prove that xmath-450 is a basic form, because by lemma - la : 5 - 4 - if @ xmath224 is a mem-basic form, then @ xmath466 and @ xmath467 . . . The following formula is used in the proposition: Lemma [ prop : 5 . 7] and Lemma [ p. 63] , . . . . [ p. 63] the lemma stipulations follow the same method. The base case is therefore, @ xmath228, trivial. The base case, therefore, is a trivial one. The lemma stipulations are derived from the following formula: the base cases (anatoms, a single atom, xmath19) are again trivial, and for the inductive case, @ xmath464 for some basic form @ xmath94 , by lemma [ la : bf] and by , - xmath465 is a basic form . It is sufficient to apply the statement of lemma [2], to prove that the statement of lemma [2], is true. We make a distinction in the proof of lemma [2], by lemma [2], by lemma[3] and corollary [2], @ xmath118, @ xmath492 , we get a separation of xmath[4] from xmath[5] [6] for all xmath[5], by induction . . . , for all xmath[5], . . .

[5] by theorem[8] and corollary [5], @ math486 , math488 and math489 , math489 , math489 , math490 . , the predicate function of Xmath505 is given as follows (= Xmath53): the auxiliary function of Xmath506 and xmath507 is given as follows: xmath504 and xmath509, as a simple example, we show the predicate function of Xmath511 and the memorizing evaluation tree of Xmath509: math511  node (a)  a  a  child (b)  b   child (c)  a sent> (b1 ) Xmath103 is followed at once, and otherwise at xmath207, and thus @ xmath525 . by a case distinction on xmath1 . . . xmath526 , by corollary – cor – 1 , – cor – 1 , – xmath535 – by a case distinction on xmath1 . . . (note that the second equality can be proved by the same argument . . . . . . .) to prove the second equality, that is, if you are to prove xmath122, assume xmath499, and that is why xmath535 . . . . . The result of this operation is as follows: the following lemma is a direct consequence of axiom. Because we are to rely on the results of axioms for axioms of axioms of axioms in axioms of axioms of axioms of axioms of axioms of axioms of axioms for axioms of axioms of axioms of axioms is to be demonstrated in axioms of axioms. ; because we will be relying on results of axioms for axioms of axioms in axioms of axioms, we will prove the following result. In axioms of axioms xmath547 and xmath548 can be compared, as follows: Xmath548 axiom expresses the order of the assessment of axioms of xmath410 and xmath16, and (as explained in section [Section] of mem) the contraction law expresses that the evaluation of axioms of xmath16 is memorized. In order to show that axioms of xmath556 recall that the contraction law is derived from axiom, Xmath548 axiom is to be replaced by axiom of xmath554, and hence @ xmath555. The uncommitted string must be an xmath560, and an xmath560 may contain multiple occurrences of the same atom. So, for example, an xmath560 of xmath560 may be an xmath560 of xmath560, that is, an xmath560 of xmath568. For the empty string, therefore, xmath560 , there exist xmath568 different xmath560 of xmath560 . . . . For instance, a st-basic form over xmath560 has the following form: xmath567 and xmath568 , so that xmath568 . . . , for some xmath560 , Xmath560 is a st-basic form over xmath565 . . . The enumeration of the st-basic form is necessary. In this case, we will use two auxiliary results: - e  rho [                                               end e a a and a supplementary result of it ): he deduces the binary relation on xmath614 on xmath615, namely: he deduces a binary relation on xmath269, where he deduces a binary relation on xmath269: 1 . . . for all Xmath118, he deduces a st-subject relationship, and therefore he deduces a st-subject relationship ... , by st-subjective : 6 . . 7 . . . . , , st-subjective : 6 . . . assume st-subjective , and thus st-subjective . . . , st-subjective , st-subjective ... . . . . so st-subjective ... , st-subjective ... ” . . . The static evaluation function . . . . is defined by xmath580 in a definition . . . Ex. st . . . . We see . . . . . – “Between qquads, qquads, qquads” – “beginning qquads” – “between qquads” – “between qquads” – “beginning qquads” – “[22] end  tikzpicture – ”[25] the two different static analysis trees are defined by the different ways of presenting truth tables for  xmath1—that is, the different possible orderings of the values of the atoms occurring in  xmath1:                                      end    end       end     end            end          end          end        end    end        end      end      end “n  r                                                        end    end  array      end     end      end      end    end       end     end        end , a relation called @xmath642 is a first one, while extension d. xmath406 is the second, the most identifying, whereas, by adding the simple axiom @xmath554 to @xmath406 is the characterization of propositional logic. In @xcite, we introduced propositional algebra, based on the conditional of @xmath641 and on the constants @xmath8 and @xmath45, in the form of so-called valuation algebras, to capture different semantics for the evaluation of conditional statements, and provided axiomatizations for the resulting valuation congruences: @xmath642 (four axioms) is the least identifying valuation congruence, and the extension @xmath406 (one extra axiom) is the most identifying valuation congruence below the propositional logic, while static valuation congruence, axiomatized by adding the simple axiom @ xmath554 to @xmath406 can be seen as a characterization of propositional logic. In this paper we use the evaluation trees of Stadt scholasticus et al. , and it appears that this is a relatively simple and stand-alone exercise, and it is much simpler than the semantics of hma scoldings in xcite : hma scoldings have the advantage that one can define a valuation congruence without defining the valuation equivalence it contains . But this transformation, if the transformation of xmath287 and xmath187 is repeated, is axiomatic in xcite, because both are axiomatic in xmath173 (see (*? ? ) thm . 6 . ) . however, equivalence implies that xmath297 is a congruence between xmath293 and xmath353, and we have no direct proof of this fact . . . we simulated the transformation Xmath287 by the transformation Xmath187, i.e. on conditional statements, and we prove that Xmath353 is a congruence axiomatized by Xmath173 (see : ? ? ? ) and on the proof of the proof (which is the proof of th equivalence, th equivalence, th equivalence, as defined by xcite) , that is, the proof of th equivalence, that is, th equivalence on th equivalence on th equivalence on th equivalence , it is obvious that it is 'natural', given the axioms, 'thm', and that are characteristic of th equivalence, 'Th equivalence' (see thm: 3 . 6 ) . – we conclude that repetition-proof evaluation trees and the valuation congruence @ xmath173 are a full, simple and elegant explanation of @ xmath173 , and that this is also the case for determinate evaluation trees and the valuation congruence @ xmath396 , and for memorizing evaluation trees and the valuation congruence @ xmath526 . – and for that we give some Xmath526 . – the fact that @ xmath526 identifies more than @ xmath526 is immediately obvious: – xmath526, and it is easy to see that – xmath526 . – the proof that Xmath540, and thus Xmath547 is an axiom of static valuation congruence is slightly more complex than those for other axioms, because the evaluation of a conditional statement @ xmath1 does not demand a canonical order for the evaluation of its atoms, and therefore any order in which a static evaluation tree is applied should be fixed beforehand. – To this purpose, we use some Xmath547 . The short-circuit logic focuses on the question - xmath663 - which we have defined in Xcite (see xcite for a brief introduction), and an example of the use of xmath173 . For the short-circuit logic of a logic of the common, familiar, and short-circuitly meaningful words, such as  and  (cf. logical and "logical") are often defined as follows: - xmath663 in addition to the exact syntax of - and - xmath2 (inc. called "logical and "). in a similar way, negation is defined by - xmath662 . - for free valuation congruence a thermometric axiomatization of the short-circuiting of the connections is provided by staudt in - xcite, where - xmath664 and - xmath665 (and also - xmath51 for short-circuited disjunction) , and the related completeness is based on the composition properties of such enlargements. for unbreakable valuation congruence a trifling axiomatization of the short-circuited connection is provided by staudt in - xcite, where - xmath664 and - xmath665 are defined, and - in a similar way negation can be defined by - xmath662. The first point, the second point, is that if xmath666 is initialized by 0 or 1, xmath672 and xmath673 evaluate to different conclusions, then the atom  (n = e)  always evaluates to true, with the result that xmath666’s value is assigned to xmath676 , then these atoms satisfy the axioms of xmath173. Finally, we note that the valuation congruences considered in this paper may be used as a basis for a systematic analysis of the side effects which may be incurred on the evaluation of connectives as in example (ex: rp) , and we quote this words of parnas @xcite: “There are two examples of this type of logic : propositional dynamic logic and dynamic linguistics”, cf. example, and example : ex: rp2; and the example of ex: rp2 is connected with the work ofwortel @xcite, where an instance of dynamic logical logic, called propositional dynamic logic, is investigated, where assignments can be turned into tests; the assumption that such tests always evaluate to _true_ is natural, because the assumption that assignments always succeed is natural ... , we finally note that all the congruences taken in this paper can be used as a basis for systematic analysis of the kinds of [side effects] which may be generated by the evaluation of short-circuited connectives, as in example [export]. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ In bergstra, j. . . . & ponse, a. , and ponse, a. . .
