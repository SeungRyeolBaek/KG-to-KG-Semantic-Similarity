the aim of this paper is to study some aspects of the relative motion of free particles in the gravitational field of an astronomical source. let xmath2 be the free mass in orbit about the central source of mass xmath3 and angular momentum xmath4, where xmath2 and xmath5 are constants. Suppose that a probe is launched at xmath13, and for a time xmath14 is closely followed by observers that are at xmath14. Suppose that a probe is launched from xmath13 at xmath13, and for some time xmath14 observers are closely watching the movement of the probe. Let Xmath15 be the fermi coordinates of the probe, then a unique space-like geodesic of length Xmath17 connects Xmath17 to the path of Xmath2 at an event xmath18, with a proper time xmath6 such that Xmath19 and xmath20 are the units of tangent tangent tangent tangent to the space-like geodesic angularly shifted along xmath2 . , the minimum space occupied by the probe is given by the tensor of the tetrad frame, that is, the tetrad frame of xmath26 along the reference worldline. a general feature of the geodesic is that it contains a critical speed given by @xmath38, particularly in the case of one-dimensional motion. the four-forced motion of the probe is given by @xmath29, that is, @xmath30, since @xmath32 is a time-like vector. a reduction of the geodesic equation @xcite___ xmath________. a reduction of the angle of the geodesic equation by @xmath________, where @xmath________ is the critical velocity of the probe relative to @xmath________. for the sake of simplicity, we confine our considerations to @xmath________. we are particularly interested in the role that the critical speed @xmath________ plays in the motion of the probe, so that the probe can be launched from @xmath________ at any initial speed, but for the sake of simplicity we concentrate on its motion only when it is relatively close to the particle @xmath________. "This point is made by the definition of fermi coordinates and by the fact that the relative velocity of the earth is calculated from @xmath48 , where xmath49 is replaced by the refractive angle of @xmath5 by @xmath6 in the argument of xmath51. It is necessary to point out that once xmath46 is determined from the jhobi equation or the jhobi equation, the worldline of the earth is completely characterized. that is, if the earth's worldline is given by @xmath47, then the earth's worldline is determined by @xmath48, where @xmath49 is replaced by the temporal angle of @xmath5 by the argument of @xmath6. But, it is necessary to note that once xmath46 is determined from the jhobi equation or the jhobi equation, the worldline of the earth's earth is completely characterized. For the earth's geodesics, kerr spacetime has been discussed by many authors. See, for instance, ref. xcite and references therein. To make up the equation we are dealing with, there must be a metric @xmath54, where @xmath54 is the specific angular momentum of the source . . . we assume that @xmath65 all the way; so the sign of @xmath66 indicates the sense of the orbit. we refer, in general, to the surface of the kerr domain, and the geometrical formula @xmath54, where @xmath54 is the specific angular momentum of the source. The geodesic equation has the constants of motion of the reference worldline, the specific energy @xmath72 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath73, respectively, the time-like and azimuthal killing vectors @xmath73, which are included in the equations . . . let us observe that in the orbital equations, a prograde orbit becomes retrograde and vice versa when @xmath63 is at its source; that is why the combination of xmath64 usually appears in orbital equations. At last, Section s5 contains a brief description of our results. In the spacetime region, the kerr domain is found, with the metric xmath54, where xmath54 is the specific angular momentum of the source, the upper (lower) sign signifies orbits where the rotational sign of xmath2 is in the same (opposed) sense as the source. On the constellation of @xmath83 a new orthonormal tetrad is found at xmath85. The lorentz property of @xmath84 is given by @xmath85,  tilde  gamma   lambda   mu  hspace   myspace   ( 3).  tilde  gamma   tilde  beta   lambda   mu  hspace   myspace  0 ,  end  aligned   ] ,  end  aligned  ][37][38][38] [40] , [38]  tilde  gamma  [40] [40] [40] [40] [41] The first order in xmath98 and xmath99 can be written as xmath100, that is, the difference between these angles is due to the conjunction of geodetic and gravitomagnetic precessions. Finally, we must consider the projection of the Riemann tensor along the orbit of the tetrad, as in adquisition. The Riemann tensor, however, is given by xmath110, which is symmetric and traceless, containing respectively the electric and magnetic components of the Riemann tensor. xmath111 is a matrix constituted by xmath110 and Xmath110, in which xmath109 and xmath110 are indices belonging to the set xmath110. This matrix has the form xmath108, [stretched][xmath110], where xmath110 and xmath110 are symmetric and traceless matrices containing respectively the electric and magnetic components of the riemann tensor. But, in the first case, we will not use the angle coordinates of fermi at xmath136, but the _tangible_ angle coordinates at xmath137, where @ xmath138 , these angle coordinates are now derived, for example, from the position of the probe relative to xmath2 . . . let us now turn to the solution of the jacobi equation. . . . let us take the tidal tensor of xmath109, for instance, by the work of marck at xcite. . . . For example, for xmath134, xmath127 is always negative for retrograde orbits, but not always positive for prograde orbits; in fact, Xmath127 vanishes for a prograde orbit with a radius of xmath133. . . . . if, for example, @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 have components in the local @ xmath152 system, we find at xmath146,         sigma  v 0  sin  vartheta  sin  sigma                                                                      ,                                  ,                                            [ In the shortest form @ xmath167, and in the shortest form @ xmath168, the deviation of this frequency from the keplerian frequency corresponds to the Einstein precession frequency for an orbit vanishing eccentricity, while the first-order correction in @ xmath169 corresponds to the de sitter-lensing precession frequency, @ xcite. In fact, it is necessary that the probe be near the reference particle, which means that the initial value of @ xmath41 must be very small compared to @ xmath34; for the sake of simplicity, we have chosen the value of @ xmath172 throughout this paper. . Finally, let us make a slight point of the boundary condition of @ xmath177, which corresponds to the assumption that the probe is first launched from @ xmath2 . It follows that in the newtonian limit of @ xcite the system of the mighty hill system discussed in ref. xcite is equivalent to the limit of the mighty hill system, discussed in ref. xcite . . . system . . . system in the newtonian limit of @ xcite is equivalent to a limiting form of the hill system discussed in ref. xcite . . . system of ref. xcite . . . . system of ref. xcite . . . . . in the first order correction in xmath169 corresponds to the de sitter - lense - thirring precession frequency - gpa - 2 - beta - xi - delta - zeta - nonumber -  gpa - 2 -  gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa - gpa -gpa -gpa -gpa -gpa Let us have the exact solution of the Jacobi equation as the result of an unresponsive solution, and to give the result of a corresponding normal expansion in terms of Xmath189, it is possible to get a correct solution of the equations by the classical perturbation of the axis (A) (In this case, it is not possible to use such a perturbation, based on the small parameter A) , only in conjunction with higher-order tidal terms, that is, terms neglected in the expansion of the gravitational potential in equations, and which would result in equations of motion which are different from the linear order in the equation of motion in the A” (A). The term “a” (A”) is “A” (A”), and “b”), and “c” (Z), “c” (Z)  z  z  z – z – z  z – z – z – y   y  [a] – ” ( y  delta  zeta  zeta  y  ] , “z  y   y” – [2  gamma  2  beta  zeta – 3 – sigma  2  zeta – 2  gamma  2   beta  zeta If the probe is launched vertically in the #xmath159 direction, then its motion will be limited to the #xmath159 direction, according to the generalized Jacienski equation. It is also true that if the probe is launched vertically in the #xmath159 direction, it will have a direct motion in the #xmath159 direction according to the generalized jacobi equation. The vertical motion can be described exactly in the #xcite way, since the equation implies that the motion is uniform for @xmath206, that is, the critical speed @xmath207 is the critical speed, which is opposite to the low speed that is predicted by the newtonian expectation. However, for the time being, for the reason that the gravitational energy is infinity, the motion is infinity. Therefore, the particle gains enormous tidal energy. In this case, the answer to the question of the admissibility of the fermi coordinates is difficult to resolve. If the following conditions are met, if the rotation of @xmath211 is satisfied, then the rotation of @xmath212 decreases monotonically to zero as the Xmath203 axis passes. - as a result of our previous study, tidal dynamics involving an escape path along the axis of rotation of the central source, in a degree of acceleration above xmath216, tidal deceleration occurs in a cone of angle @ xmath217, measured from the rotation axis, where @ xmath217 is given by @ xmath218 and corresponds to an angle of about @ xmath219, tidal acceleration occurs outside this cone, i.e., within the complement of the critical-speed cone, encompassing latitudes from @ xmath220 to @ xmath221, where @ xmath223 is equal to an angle of about @ xmath223 , and @ xmath223 is for the equatorial plane . For the purpose of analyzing the problem in detail, let us first note that if @ xmath229 is a solution of equations, then so is @ xmath232 . Hence, we limit our considerations to xmath230, which corresponds to motion antiparallel to the kerr axis in our convention. At xmath248, i.e. xmath247 and xmath248 (i.e. xmath249) , where xmath235 vanishes, as illustrated in figure Xmath257, where xmath258 and xmath209 are at the same time xmath259 , the length of the domain is characterized by xmath245 , i.e. xmath246 given by xmath247 and xmath248 (i.e. xmath249) , where xmath226 vanishes, as shown in figure Xmath 257, where xmath258 and xmath259 are the same , on the other hand , for xmath258 the curve of the domain is characterized by xmath259 , where xmath258 is a positive constant such as xmath262 . Xmath147: since the motion is in the @xmath270 plane, it is in a time-like geodesic if @xmath270 a solution of the generalized Jacobi equation (GJE) in the @xmath270 plane is characterized by the parameters @ xmath127, @ xmath189 and @ xmath270 , for @ xmath270 a very small number compared with unity, the solution of the GJE is in general, like the corresponding solution of the JCV, as explained in the previous section. This difficulty can, however, be avoided in the case of the purely radial variations with @ xmath275 and @ xmath276; either way the JCV has periodic solutions that maintain the circular reference orbit under small radial perturbations. Thus, although a quasi-period oscillation, such as xmath277, is occurring, this effect is not large enough to be of any physical significance, as the quasi-period oscillations (qpos) @ xmath270 are of relatively small size compared to unity, the solution of the gj can be given essentially by the corresponding solution of the Jacobi equation. however, the quasi-period oscillations only occur for xmath277, which is, in general, not sufficient, since higher-order tidal terms of equal magnitude have been neglected in our analysis. Intended for the study of relativistic physics in a space station, the tracking of artificial satellites, and the doppler trajectories of satellites. In addition, in the relativistic astrophysics of accretion disks about (revolving) astronomical sources, our results may be relevant to the gravity-related aspects of the complex plasma physics that would be involved in the formation of high-energy jets — that is, the vertical acceleration phenomena we are attempting to describe may be a reflection of how relativistic jets are formed above and below a kerr black hole. * 14 ... 2025 c & mashhoon b 2005 — astron ... c & mashhoon b 2005 — astron ... c & mashhoon b 2005 — class . . . ...
