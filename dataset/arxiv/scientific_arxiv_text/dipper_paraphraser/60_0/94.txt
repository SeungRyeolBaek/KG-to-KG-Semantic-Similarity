The mauritius radio telescope (Mrt) at xcite is a fourier synthesis, T-shaped, non-coplanar array, i.e., a non-coplanar array, for i.e., at xcite. mrt is designed to be the southern sky equivalent of the sky survey of cambridge 6c, at xcite , which is located at 151 - 5 mhz . astrophysics driving factors include acceleration, turbulence, and propagation in the galactic medium, to investigate the high redshift universe, transient phenomenon, and the neutral hydrogen signature of reionisation of cosmologically important epochs . . . mrt survey of 151 - 5 mhz - is a step in this direction and a step in this direction. The survey of mrt at 151 - 5 mhz is a step in that direction and a step in that direction. The secondary astrophysics drivers are acceleration, turbulence, and motion in the galactic interstellar medium, and exploring the high redshift universe and transient phenomena, as well as looking for the redshifted signature of neutral hydrogen from the time of cosmologically important eors - . . . * the entire survey data was reduced to xmaths , and this was a quarter of the xmaths observed over a period of xmaths . . . however, there were errors in the images, which hindered the usefulness of the xmaths images for multi-mode analysis of sources. In addition, the sources were not investigated. The problem of determining the spatial errors in xmaths6 and xmaths14 was investigated by comparing the positional errors of the common mrt, and of the molonglo catalog (Mrc) , was introduced by @xcite . The model of the mrt series was a programme of computing and graphics and was used to identify the errors in the pixel domain. During this process a number of complicated stages were taken that were linked to the image domain, and particularly due to the non-conlinearity of the image. This method was then applied to the new generation of radio telescopes, where only images after a certain integration would be captured, as opposed to raw visibilities in mrt. . Our theory of the pixel domain and its confirmation by re-expression was confirmed and confirmed by re-expression. This paper also describes our investigation into the interaction of the positional errors with the geometry of the image. the positions of sources common to the mrt catalogue and the mrc were compared. Moreover, for sources of listed flux density at xmath23 (at 151 mhz) the catalogue was reported to be reasonably complete and , as a matter of fact, to be in agreement with Xmath22. , it was reported that the catalogue was substantially complete and, a comparable resolution of 99.9 %@ xcite . Lastly, we summarized and presented our conclusions in section (s) in section (s) (c). because the mrc has a source density of @ xmath26 source deg @ xmath26, the chances of observing two unrelated sources as common are very small. a flux threshold of 15-@ xmath0 ensures an abundance of sources abundant enough to estimate homography (described in the next section) . for further discussion, the errors in the position of mrc sources are considered random, without systematics. c) . . . . if the flux threshold of 15-@ xmath0 is greater than 15-@ xmath0, the average flux density of the two catalogues is reported to be substantial, and the reliability is reported to be 99. 9 % @ xcite . . . To re-examine, in order to correct for errors in the images, one would need to re-program the data for the first time. The data to be re-examined is represented by two sets of the corresponding point in the projective coordinates, at xmath32. The resulting homography is a non- singular linear relationship between points on a plane . . . the homography which has been sought here is a non- singular, non-uniform matrix , _xmath36. The first set of points corresponding to the second set of images is given in projective coordinates, at xmath32, and the second set of points corresponding to the second set of points _xmath36 . . .                                                                                   left ]  left ] , the homographic coordinates make it possible to be transposed into two sets of two points . . . so that the two 2d points are in a homogeneous space . . . for our system, both errors in xmath6 and xmath3 are dependent only on xmath14. in the homogeneous coordinates, the two 2d points are in a plane hovering at a unit distance . . . in a homographic coordinates, the 2 d space is a plane hovering in the third dimension at a unit distance . . . Note that , @ xmath48, representing the translation in xmath6 dimensions, is simply added to the normal dot product @ xmath49, which in turn represents the rotation and the translation. a single matrix with xmath46 coordinates, able to represent rotation, scaling, and translation of 2 d lines, requires six - dot [ xcite] , so in xmath38, the xmath50 and xmath51 are zero. xmath14 is a natural choice for one of the coordinates, and it is indeed so in the present case. dtd> xmath14 is a natural choice for one of the coordinates and is used in the present case . we preferred xmath42-format because all mrt images were already generated in this coordinate system . [f] : sourcecomparison a and b (fig. ] ). This choice made us look for the solutions of errors in xmath6 as a function of xmath14 rather than xmath66. , the recurrence of the errors in xmath6 against xmath66 and xmath14 is only xmath67 of the beamwidth in xmath6. However, the residuals of the fitting functions xmath66 and xmath14, for the xmath3 range of mrt, is only xmath69 of the beamwidth in xmath6 . The molars of mrt on the meridian are one and the same, made on the same day and placed on the same time . At the first one —1 — there are two rows of 1 — 0— and at the second one —there are two rows of ———. in the first there are rows of ———. the result of this is that the discordance between the original points and the new ones will be exceeded by the inverse of the centroid. . . . the interval between the echoes is ——— . The basic function of the normalisation is to get freedom from arbitrary ranges and cosines, leading to mathematical minimization in the canonical frame. The Normalisation scheme for the Normalization of the Fluid Universe is given in Brief Section . . . normalisation of the Fluid Universe consists in the following: normalisation of the Fluid Universe by the least squares method, the function of the singular value of a polyhedral decomposition (svd) . . . . normalization of the Fluid Universe is then used to denormalise the Fluid Universe to form @xmath38. For this reason, we derived the Fluid Universe from the Normalized Intersections of the Fluid Universe by the same method as discussed earlier in the Specifications section. This Complex Universe is summed up in the following way: . . a single homography matrix for the whole steradian. And there are, in principle, a number of bright sources in each image (@ xmath88) which can be used to estimate a homography matrix. . . . Xmath90: the predicted homography matrix, Xmath91, means that there is no correction required in Xmath6 as a function of xmath6 . . . Xmath92, on the contrary, indicates that the correction should be in Xmath14, if it be dependent on xmath6 . . . . , if mrt images are compressed in Xmath14 by a factor of xmath95, the estimated correction is above xmath93 of the beam in Xmath6 at the extreme ends of the range of xmath14 . in the estimated correction, the mrt files, under xmath90, are not different from each other, as a result of the variance in the four retardations and the range of xmath6 . It is a fact that the estimation of a single homography matrix for the whole source population is sufficient to represent errors. From the images, each pixel is repositioned to a new position, effectively correcting for positional errors in the images. [f] The positional errors in xmath3 are compared to those in xmath6 after homography. Notice, after homography (see fig.] [f] the rectangle is almost circular, as opposed to elliptical after correction (see fig.] [f] a) . Notice, after correction (see fig.] a) the rectangle is almost circular as opposed to elliptical after correction (see fig.] a) . [f] The contours of the corrected mrt are given in fig. [f] b. The contours of the corrected mrt are given in fig. [f] b and c show similar comparisons for a source around xmath99 . meridian transit imaging, xmath103 . the overlay is visible in a satisfactory way . . . the 2 d homography has corrected the positional errors in the image domain. - By the rectilinearity analysis it is clear that the observations of the mrts are stretched (shrunk) in declination, i.e., at xmath104, the height of the stars (= xmath10), and the complex visibilities measured for different values of the component of the north - south baseline vector, in the Ns arm, are wrongly measured as xmath104, (in a part in 1000) . By the two-dimensional homography the second-dimensional error was corrected. The corrections that the 2-dimensional homography computed for the position of the figures were 0 . 9990 . Moreover, for the meridian transit, Xmath103 . . . for the meridian transit, Xmath103 . . . . note that for the images the 2–dimensional homography estimated a correction (compression) factor of 0 . . 9990 . . . The following section will describe how we traced the sources of these errors and corrected them in the visibilities domain . . . mrt measures the fourier components of the brightness distribution of the sky in 63 different configurations (calling them “ allocations”) in order to sample ns baselines every 1 m. the effect of this is shown in the instrumental phases estimated by different calibrators. This effect is shown in the visual phases estimated by different calibrators. As we have mentioned earlier, our analysis of the positional error of sources and the homography matrix refers to the positional error of antenna positions. In this way, 945 antenna positions (63 allocations – 15 antennas – each allocation) are located in the ns arm and a total of 30 , 240 (90 – 32) visibilities are measured. a small error in a measuring scale of relatively short length will systematically accumulate, while establishing the geometry of longer baselines. This effect will be observed in the instrumental phases estimated by different calibrators. Here, , , , , , , , , , , , – , – – where, – – – – – ‘xmath112’, the observed phase of the horizon with components of xmath113, due to calibrator xmath114 with cosines of xmath115, is given by: – xmath112 , – xmath120 – , – – , – here, – – So the equation (eq) diffantenna1         , which is based on a different background to the rest, is calculated as follows: @ xmath126  nonumber    lefteqn  hspace  22 mm  +  delta w      ij   left [  cos  left (za   mathcal  s           right] .   eq: diffantenna2   ] the equations  eq: diffantenna2      ” , [25] this difference is of particular importance for detecting errors in the position of the antennas, as we have two unknowns and one equation. . . . there is a left-hand side of the equations [eq] diffantenna1 and [eq] diffantenna2] . . . and [eq] diffantenna2 . . . and the sensitivity of the above-mentioned elements, as measured by mrt, is at xmath150 jy. The sensitivity per baseline at mrt is xmath148 jy for a one-mhz bandwidth and an integration time of one second. The accuracy of these three instruments, as seen by mrt, is @xmath148 jy for a 1 mhz bandwidth and a integration time of one second. furthermore, the calibration devices are unresolved and isolated from the not so well known sources, and have well known measurements. Fig. f: phasediff - - Fig. f: error - estimate - show the estimated errors in 945 ns antenna positions. . The errors show a 'biggest part of the difference' in 1000 areas of the ns arm. e ssi tsd , 170mm - 100, equal to a radial distance of a radius of xmath155 , this is the cause of a small @xmath14-dependent error in @xmath6 that was detected in both the positional error analysis and the homography matrix. We find no systematics in positional errors, so we endorse our re-estimated array geometry. we also simulate the synthesised beam in xmath6 with the old ew antenna positions and the corrected ew antenna positions, that is, confirm this @xmath14-dependent error in @xmath6 . this is the cause of a small @xmath14 dependent error in @xmath6. we obtain the estimate of the ratio Xmath14 in @xmath6 by applying a homography-based correction, which is able to correct for systematics in the image domain and error in about 10 % of the beamwidth for sources above 15 - @xmath0. In addition, our swarm of images of one steradian are available to download at _http://www.mrt. / surveys / mrt. That would have been a very time-consuming exercise. Development of a two-dimensional homography correction enabled us to correct for the positional errors in the image domain. __radian_ . this confirms our estimates of the array geometry. The authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for the constructive comments and suggestions. This new technique will be of use to new generation radio telescopes, where, due to the huge data rate, only images with certain integration will be recorded as opposed to raw visibilities. __radian_ . soobash daiboo acknowledges a bursary from the South Africa Square Kilometer Array project .
