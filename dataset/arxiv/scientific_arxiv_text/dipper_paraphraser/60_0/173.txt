xcite has recently been introduced a new method for analyzing multifractal functions xmath1; it exploits the fact that the fractional derivative of order xmath2 (described here by xmath3) of xcite has, for a suitable range of xmath2 , a power-law tail in its cumulative probability, xmath4 the exponent xmath5 is the unique solution of the equation xmath5; where xmath7 is the scaling exponent associated with the behavior at small distances xmath8 of the order xmath9 of the structure function of order xmath9, i.e., xmath10 . . . . it was proved that the effect of the power-law tail on multifractality is restricted to a finite range of scales, and this difference is well illustrated by ref. xcite in ref. xcite. . . . . so far, the theory of such power-law tails has been developed only for the synthetic functions, namely, the random multiplicative processes Xcite, for which kesten-type maps and large deviations can be applied. For the feigenbaum measure, all scaling exponents can be obtained with arbitrarily large accuracy . . . The organization of the paper is as follows: section s: thermos: thermodynamics - - we describe the thermodynamics for the feigenbaum attractor - - in a section s: formalism - we remember the method in ref xcite for mathematical details - and we show how we can use this formalism, based on the geometrical properties of the attractor, in a way that connects it to the standard multifractal formalism, which focuses on the statistical properties of the feigenbaum measure - - to the best of our knowledge the exact relation between the two forms is discussed here for the first time - - the fractional derivative analysis of the feigenbaum measure is presented in section - fraclap - phenomenol - in section - fraclap phenol - we briefly recall the phenomenology of the tails of power-laws in the distribution of fractional derivatives and the limits on observability . The fractional derivatives of the feigenbaum measure are discussed in section - fraclap phenol . fractional derivatives are discussed in section - fraclap phenols . We recollect in Section - fraclap phenols . In Section - fraclap phenols , we briefly recall the phenomenology of the power-law tails in the distribution of fractional derivatives and the limits on observability . The fractional derivatives of the feigenbaum measure are described in section - fraclap phenols . To compute the fraction of the intervals of xmath26 we would make a collection of intervals of xmath27 , for example: xmath27 , g      (i   delta   (n)  0 )  equiv    i   (i   delta      i = g  circ g  circ g  cdots  circ g  circ g   circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g   i = g   i = g  i    i           end  aligned   ]           End  aligned   ] As we have seen, all intervals at xmath29 are exponentially small, but the exponent varies from xmath49 to xmath50. notice that exponents at xmath51 give all possible scalings of the fractal set at xmath24. Note that in ref. xcite a function of thermodynamic potential exists for all infinitely dyadic sequences such that i. there exists a constant @ xmath53 for which @ xmath54  ii. for all those sequences which coincide on the first xmath57 positions @ xmath57 with xmath58 . . . -        leq  frac  |  leq  frac     epsilon 0 ,  dots,  epsilon 0 ,  epsilon 0 ,  dots,  epsilon 0 ,  epsilon At xmath61, a situation relating to intervals xmath63 with odd numbers xmath64 has to do with a restriction that translates into a condition corresponding to intervals xmath65 with odd numbers xmath64. Xmath70 here is a term for a periodical phase of the thermodynamics of xmath71, a periodical phase of a degree of the gravitational potential Xmath73, an inverse temperature Xmath66, and the boundary condition Xmath74. The free energy Xmath78 contains all information on the multifractal properties of the gravitational magnet. Here, we shall denote this gravitational measure by Xmath77. In thermodynamics, the probability distributions at xmath71 are of the kind of gibbs, with potential Xmath73, inverse temperature Xmath66, and the boundary condition Xmath74. notice that the free energy Xmath78 corresponds to an invariant measure, while xmath79 corresponds to a conditional distribution which corresponds to the lebesgue measure of Xmath19. left ( frac  ln ,  delta   n )                                              left ( frac   ln |             left (  frac    ln                                left (    ln                                 left (    ln                           left  left  ( - In the order of @xmath77 - measured against the measure of xmath99 - we find xmath98 - ,  sim  ,  exp f ( beta ) ,  exp ( beta) n - ,  exp f ( beta) n -  [ ex.] - which gives xmath98  , ,  ,   , it is easy to see that xmath105 - a ratio of the feigenbaum measure calculated with xmath108 bins of uniform length xmath108 in xmath19 - - . It is, , the integral of xmath1 of the feigenbaum measure calculated with xmath108 bins of uniform length xmath109 in xmath19 . . . . and that it was a unique invariant measure. This is why the Multifractal Analysis we have given here is quite interesting. Using the Multifractal Analysis we can find the spectrum of Hlder-Equilibriums. In this we can find the spectrum of the Hen-Equilibriums @ xmath22 for which the Hen-Equilibrium of @ xmath11 corresponds to @ xmath110. Here @ xmath110 corresponds to a Hlder-Equilibrium of @ xmath112, where @ xmath113 corresponds to the Heat-Equilibrium of @ xmath110, where @ xmath110 corresponds to an inverse Temperature @ xmath115, so that @ xmath110 corresponds to an inverse of Temperature @ xmath115, where @ xmath115 is the inverse function of @ xmath110. It is interesting to compare the multifractal analysis which we have just presented with the one in ref. xcite. In fact, our analysis is valid only when the system is described with the thermodynamic formalism. This formalism makes use of considerable dynamic information about the system, namely the dynamic index xmath25 . The multifractal analysis of ref. xcite is based on a function (# xmath124) which can be defined in the following way. Consider a partition of the interval, # xmath19, into sub-intervals of xmath125, of length # xmath8. f the measure is @ xmath138, in which @ xmath137 is an inverse function to the free energy xmath80 . if we determine the first relation, we consider the dynamical partition, # xmath13, and assume that @ xmath136 is but @ xmath137 . the dual-relative relation allows one to find @ xmath132 from @ xmath0: , , , . . . . . , 124, 5, 4, 5. the thermodynamic formalism of the above means that these scalings are asymptotically determined by the potential @ xmath73 and hence do not depend on the @ xmath64. rescaling the invariant measure in the form of @ xmath141 by a factor of xmath141, we conclude that @ xmath142, where @ xmath143 is the total number of @ xmath143. and we prove this by the latter. Let math147 be a partition of math19-$] into intervals of length math8 . . . In a last aspect, we explain the relationship of exponents of xmath7 for the structure through the thermodynamic properties. math147,  alpha p  [[F] f   ln 2]   beta  [[7]] left [7]  frac  alpha   ln 2  z + f  ln 2  f   [7]] right [8]  -    [9][10] ,      z   left [8]  frac  alpha   ln 2  f      right [10] , , , , ,      left (&     alpha     ln 2  f     z ) ,             left [10]        left [11] – First, to find approximations of the thermodynamic potential for xmath52. – For example, it is shown in xcite that the limit in ([kapprox]) exists and, if we use a markov approximation for the transfer operator @ xmath84 is exponentially fast. In the next section, we shall show how to use the transfer operator @ xmath169, starting from xmath170 to general xmath171 . – Here, in order to provide clarity, let us consider the operator @ xmath174 as a scalar. It follows from – kapprox1 – that @ xmath161 corresponds to a certain @ xmath164 matrix. – So, by -  ( epsilon    (0     ) in the matrices, the operator @ xmath166 corresponds to a certain @ xmath164 matrix.

For the numerical calculation of the functions xmath167 and xmath7 associated with xmath1 and xmath7 we use the expansion ([G]] for xmath17 as given in ref. 3.0.0 [Xmath7] — the corresponding (F0] beta] of the corresponding (xmath67) — wherein, resulting from the enlargement of the region xmath215, it is observed that the multiplication of the matrix is stopped when the relative error of the most dominant eigenvalue increases to xmath13 and is therefore in absolute error on the xmath80 function. On the other hand, there is an alternative, based on thermodynamics and yielding a 10 digit accuracy, in ref. . . . , which is also based on the thermodynamic formalism, and yielding a 5 digit accuracy . . . in set-up: enlargement of the region xmath216; when increasing xmath172, alternate convergences are observed.

Taking into account the singularities with all possible exponents @ xmath22, we can express the probability that the singularity of exponent @ xmath22 contributes a fractional derivative of order @ xmath2 which exceeds (in absolute value) a given large value @ xmath231, that is, we require @ xmath232 as the codimension of the set @ xmath233, the probability to satisfy (e: y, x) is written as @ xmath235 here, @ xmath235 is the spatial dimension (@ xmath236) . As we shall see later, the situation is much more favorable for the feigenbaum-invariant measure. Before turning to numerical questions, we note an issue raised by an anonymous referee, who emphasized the nonlocal nature of fractional derivatives, and wrote that our approach is, strictly speaking, for the nonlocal (or, as the expression goes, statistically) invariant system: otherwise, the system may consist of components of a rather different nature, and the result will be dizzying. It was seen in ref. xcite that, for example, fully developed turbulence velocity data – well developed – are usually of the order of xmath250, i.e., i.e., @ xmath243 – which is the strength of the elasticity of the data, which is given by the Multifractality parameter, which is a measure of the distance of the data from self-similarity (which would imply @ xmath250) – which is represented by the Multifractality parameter @ xmath243 – the strength of the multifractality – this strength is given by the Multifractality parameter @ xmath243, a measure of the strain of the data which departs from the self-similarity (which would imply @ xmath250): @ xmath243 – where @ xmath56 is the number of octaves over which the multifractality has occurred. if the graph is asymmetrical, there is no reason for a linearized triangle to exist. In physical systems, such as homogeneous turbulence, such triangles are difficult to define strictly. Nevertheless, the invariance with respect to the space coordinates is still present, and forms a basis for the application of the multifractal calculus. Fig. 4. [ f: feigenbaum-zetap] says that the minimum slope of the graph is between xmath251 and 701 . (in putting xmath252 into the partition function xmath253 , we have xmath254 ) [ which shows the position of xmath255 in the limit xmath256. . . . ) [11] the minimum slope is easily found. (Putting xmath252 into the partition function xmath253 , we have xmath254) the minimum slope can be easily found. The actual values of xmath249, attached to the values of xmath9 ranging from xmath258 to 3 by increments of xmath259, are shown in table f . fzetap , in addition to the number xmath243 , are displayed in the table t . fzetap There are a couple of possibilities, and a couple of the possibilities are left. In practice, on a 32-bit machine, we can only work on a resolution of about 25 octaves in resolution, as well as for a dynodic interval, as xmath261 , that should be sufficient to observe the probability of a probability. a probability of a probability of fractional derivatives of various orders as a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability. a probability of a probability of a probability of a certain value at least as close as the predicted value. b. d. d. d. d. d. d. d. e. e. , e. e. ] m. j. a. a. b. x. c. d. x. e. , e. d. x. e. , e. , e. “feigenbaum : cumulative probability, fig.
