reticulation is a reticulation that occurs in living organisms without reproduction. The horizontal transfer of genetic material between living organisms is believed to be a very significant reticulation (doolittle and bapteste 2007; treangen and rocha 2011). reticulation, for example, is a phylogenetic tree with xmath0 leaves, the number of nodes at the most, is xmath4; a phylogenetic tree with xmath0 leaves has at most xmath2 nodes, whereas a arbitrary tree with 2 leaves has as many nodes as possible. In recent years, phylogenetic networks have been shown to have been able to render an account of reticulation in particular classes. , such networks as galled trees, galled networks, and reticulation visible networks are three of the popular types of phylogenetic networks that have been introduced to study combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of phylogenetics (wang et al. 2001, gusfield and et al. 2004; huson and kloepper 2007; huson and kloepper 2007; huson and et al. 2011): a single-cell organism like doolittle and bapteste (Doolittle and bapteste), treangen and rocha (2011). a random network of two leaves, in the case of a tree with @ xmath0 leaves, has @ xmath4 nodes at most (fancy a network with two leaves has @ xmath5) nodes (fancy The acyclic digraph is a simple connected network, and there are no linear oscillations , that is, in a reticulation visible network. In this section we have introduced some basic concepts and pointers, which we have recently discovered. , We have recently shown that there are a large number of reticulations in a reticulation visible network . . . if xmath7 is an acyclic digraph, and if xmath9 is an acyclic digraph, it is called an incoming edge of xmath8 and a incoming edge of xmath9; xmath8 and xmath9 are called the tail and the head of the edge. Note that in a rooted acyclic digraph there is a directed path from the root to all other nodes. In the section _conc_ we end our work with a few remarks. The definition of a graph in the acyclic style is: a simple connected digraph without a directed cycle . Let _xmath8 be an acyclic digraph, let _xmath8 and _xmath9 be two nodes in _xmath10 . The number of incoming and outgoing edges of a node is called the indegree and the outdegree. This is a root acyclic digraph in which each node has either indegree 1 or indegree 1 and exactly at xmath26 nodes have indegree 1 or indegree 1 , that is, exactly at xmath26 nodes have indegree 1 or indegree 1 , and there are precisely at xmath26 nodes that have indegree 1 or indegree 1 and which correspond one-to-one with the taxa of the network. For a phylogenetic network, a node is called a tree node if it is either the root or a node with indegree 1; it is called a reticulate node if its indegree is greater than one . note that leaves are tree nodes and a node can have both indegree and outdegree one . . . in general, if there is a directional path from @ xmath8 to @ xmath9, then @ xmath8 is an ancestor of @ xmath9 and @ xmath9 is a descendant of @ xmath9 . . . The network we are interested in is called a network and a tree a tree. In the rest of the paper, the network is called a network and a tree a tree . . . so a node is visible in @xmath42 if it is visible in @xmath42 . . . and for each path from @xmath42 to @xmath42, since it is a path from @xmath28 to @xmath41 in @xmath27, it has to pass through @xmath9 . . . so that @xmath42 is visible in @xmath42 as well , so a node is visible in @xmath42 if it is visible in @xmath42 . . . . so that a node is visible in @xmath42 if it is visible in @xmath42 . . . so that @ xmath42 is visible if it is visible with respect to the same leaf in the network . . . we end this section by presenting a technical model which will often be used to determine the tight upper bound on the size of a network in each of the four classes described above. A network is tree-based if it can be obtained from a tree with the same leaves by insertion of a set of edges between different branches in the tree . . . theorem ( gambette et al. 2015) indicates that every tree-based network is tree-based. Theorem (Stay-Free) is true, that every tree-based network is tree-based. Theorem 1 is true, if a network is tree-based, it is given a subset of edges , at xmath49 , that each edge 53 is a parent of 53, or if 53 is below another 53 in 53, or if 55 is a path from 53 to 53, 53 is a path from 53 to 53 that avoids 8 , then a path from 56 to 41 avoids 8 for every 53 node 7. Now, what is the tightest bound on the number of reticulation nodes? Since Xmath is acyclic and Xmath64 is below Xmath8, Xmath69 prevents Xmath8 . . . So, what is the tightest limit on the number of reticulation nodes? gambette et al. (2015) proved that there are at least Xmath74 reticulation nodes in a network with Xmath0 leaves . . . . but, on the other hand, there are as many Xmath2 reticulations in the network , in the figure [fig. 1]. - As a word, if xmath64 is below xmath64, then there is a path xmath69 from xmath64 to xmath70 for each xmath71 . - Taking the xmath27 network as a subtree with the same root and leaves as xmath27 (theory of stability, - at xmath9) , we find the following Xmath72, from xmath73 to xmath41 that avoids xmath8 . ‘Count down a path’ xmath78 that contains the root of xmath56 (fig. 1). if xmath56 is of degree 2 , xmath78 passes through xmath28 and terminates at a degree -3 node – then xmath78 is simply the open edge entering xmath56. Note that xmath80 is a cross edge. a cross edge is called a cross edge if xmath82 is a cross edge and a cross edge if xmath89 is a cross edge. for a cross edge @ xmath47 such that if xmath8 and xmath9 are in xmath90, then xmath79 will have its head in this trivial path. in this way, these @ xmath79 paths are called the trivial paths of xmath50. In the following, the facts of this proposition appear in the proof of theorem 1 in gambette et al (2015) . . . note that if xmath80. for each non-cross edge xmath47 such that if xmath86 is called a cross edge if xmath82 and xmath83 (at xmath91) there are at least one cross edge xmath89, which is between xmath8 and xmath9 in xmath90 . By the formula 'strong' one, 'long and narrow', 'long and narrow', 'long and narrow', 'long and narrow'; 'long and narrow'; 'long and narrow'. ' Long and narrow' - (a) long and narrow, 'long'. ' Long and narrow' are the three short, little points between ' xmath103 and ' xmath112 in ' xmath113 ; 'long and narrow' is the cross edge, that is, the cross edge that crosses, and the cross edge that crosses over ' xmath107 is the cross edge which crosses over ' xmath107,' and the non-cross edge that crosses over ' xmath107 jumps over ' xmath104 for ' xmath110' . '' ' a '' (see fig.2) . . . Suppose that if xmath118 were to be inserted in the xmath133 at xmath133 (fig. 3b) then xmath119 would be inserted. For simplicity's sake, we'll put xmath124 before xmath125 to indicate that there is a unique path from xmath126 to xmath127 between a node xmath126 and a descendant of xmath126 in xmath128 . If xmath114 is not in the xmath134 path, then xmath135 will not pass xmath113, and so xmath111. If xmath114 is not in the xmath134 path, xmath135 will not pass xmath103, and so xmath111 . . . if xmath114 is not below xmath133, xmath135 will not pass xmath133, then xmath110 . . . the common root of xmath27 and xmath128 is written xmath73 . . . so, by lemma . . . When @ xmath111 is below @ xmath112 in xmath128 (Figure [fig2] b) , @ xmath111 is below @ xmath112 as a reticulation node. Considering that @ xmath111 is below @ xmath112 in xmath128 (let it be noted that @ xmath111 is not below @ xmath112 in xmath131 , it is possible that @ xmath138 is not in @ xmath138, or else either @ xmath110 or a path from @ xmath143 to @ xmath140 is not passing through @ xmath41. hence, @ xmath112 is not visible, which is a contradiction. combining this fact with that @ xmath140 is not between @ xmath103 and @ xmath141 in xmath141 for example, we conclude that either @ xmath140 is below @ xmath141, or there is a path from @ xmath73 to @ xmath140, which does not pass through @ xmath45. hence, @ xmath111 is not visible, a contradiction. xmath43 isn't visible, but the reticulation network, which is not visible at xmath0 isn't visible, a contradiction. Thus, the reticulation network isn't visible at xmath45, a contradiction. So, either xmath140 isn't in xmath103 or xmath141, as Xmath143 was proved earlier. Note that any trivial path other than xmath78 begins with a node in xmath150, that is, xmath151; xmath150 defines: xmath152 for xmath150. then , xmath149 denotes the internal nodes of degree 3 in xmath50; and if xmath151 is in xmath78, then the lowest reticulation in xmath78 is not visible, a contradiction. xmath145 is below xmath110, and xmath114 is below xmath115, indicating a cycle in xmath27 (fig. 1c). Thus, xmath147 is not visible. -  . - ; since - 148 - the inequality means that - 157 - 168 -   - v - 1 - 2 - 3 - v - 4 - v - 4 -    & = -  - & - & - (v - 0 - v - 2 - v - 2 - v - 3 -  - v - 4 -  - - in this section we will prove that there are at most @ xmath1 reticules in a galled network with @ xmath1 leaves . . . in the galled network shown in fig. 3 - , it is not @ xmath1 , it is , there is a non-cross edge @ xmath47, so that @ xmath8 and / or @ xmath9 have both the [xmath1] and the "6" as the fourth. . . . . " The first inequality is derived from the substitution of @ xmath168 for  - 167 . The above numbers are indicated with the same notation as in the second half of this chapter. We will first prove this by proving that @xmath49 does not contain any non-cross edges, and that only one cross edge can be at a node in each @xmath90 for a @xmath145. In our opinion, because xmath27 is a net, by the theorem  stable, 1 , there is a set of edges on xmath49 such that (a) @xmath49 contains exactly one incoming edge for each trap, and (b) @xmath50 is a subtree with the same leaves as @xmath27. In our opinion, if xmath78 contains only the open edge that enters xmath73, then there is no edge in xmath49 that enters xmath75 . we prove the result by showing that xmath49 does not contain any non-cross edges, and that one cross edge can end at a node in each xmath90 for xmath145. Since xmath27 is acyclic, and there is a directed path from the end of xmath78 to a node in xmath90 for any xmath145, there is no cross edge @ xmath81 such that xmath8 is in xmath90 and xmath9 is in xmath78. , since xmath27 is galled and xmath177 is a reticulation node, there are two paths @ xmath178 and @ xmath179 which are derived from the common tree node and from xmath177 in xmath27 such that (i) they are internally disjointed, and (ii) xmath177 is the only reticulation node in them. This is impossible, for the reticulation node @ xmath9 is in xmath181 . . . then , @ xmath185 must be a non-cross edge and @ xmath186 is also below xmath111 . (not visible . . . ) we have shown that there is no edge in xmath49 that enters xmath78 . . . assume that xmath183 and xmath184 are two edges in xmath49, such that xmath139 is below xmath139 in some xmath90 (at xmath145) . . . . so , xmath180 is a subtree of xmath50 . The network is in a particular state. Xmath177 is a reticulation node and Xmath27 is hardened. There are two internally disjointed paths, Xmath178 and Xmath179, from a common tree node to a tree node, where nodes other than xmath177 are nodes. Note that Xmath192 are all nodes in Xmath90, ordered from top to bottom. So, if xmath178 contains more than one edge in Xmath128, it must pass through Xmath111, a contradiction. if Xmath178 is equal to xmath93, then Xmath179 must pass through Xmath139, a contradiction . so, there is at most one edge in Xmath49, that is, in each trivial path, xmath90, xmath145. therefore, if xmath191 is equal to xmath93, then Xmath179 must pass through Xmath139, a contradiction. Thus, Xmath193 in this section we will give a tight estimation of the number of reticulations in a nearly stable network. The class of nearly stable networks is different from the class of visible networks, but surprisingly, the tightest estimate is Xmath2 . sent>, ent> (a) @ xmath50 is a reticulation visible subnetwork over the same leaves as @ xmath27, and ent>, ent>, is a subnetwork of ent> in the same leaves as @ xmath27. ent>, with four leaves, it has nine reticulations (shade circles) and five of which are not visible. The circles in ent> are the edges removed to obtain the reticulation visible network of @ xmath42. (*c * ) and d  (*d ) are two cases which are tested in the proof of part c in lemma ns 2: a non-cross path from ent> and ent>4 is a tree node of ent>4 of ent>4 and a reticulation node of ent>4 of ent>4 [fig. ] , scale=80 . ent> the edges in ent>4 are said to be ent> edges . . . . The paths in xmath197 are identified by the principle that the cross paths in xmath197 are either a single edge or two edges in xmath27. 128: is the omission of the internal nodes and edges of the paths in xmath197, and the differential value of 128 is obtained by removing the internal nodes and edges from the paths in xmath197 . 128: the total amount of math198 is equal to math198 , and math200 is a subtree with the same leaves as math207 . 128 - as the differential value of math198 is equivalent to math198 . 1. 128 a) every internal node in a path in xmath197 is invisible in xmath27 , b) if xmath36 is a cross path in xmath197 from xmath89 to xmath177, and if xmath178 is a cross path in xmath198 from xmath8 to xmath9, and if xmath89 is between xmath8 and xmath9 (Figure 4 b) , then xmath36 and xmath178 are both a single edge in xmath27. If there are two or more internal nodes in a path in xmath197, by (a) they are consecutive and not visible in xmath27, a contradiction which implies that xmath27 is nearly stable. Then, the node of @xmath96 is denoted by ____ ah, and is an internal node of @xmath96, which is the root of @xmath96 and of __________________________ in _______________. Consider, therefore, that @xmath96 is the child of @xmath8 and of _____________ in ____________. And note that ________________ is a sub-path of @_____________ and is internally a duplicate of @___________. In accordance with the above principle, if there are two or more internal nodes in a path in ____________, it is by virtue of ___________ that they are not in __________, and contradictory that ___________ is almost stable. if xmath213 (see figure fig. 4), then the other incoming edge Xmath214 has been removed to obtain xmath42. - and if xmath214 is not below xmath9, then xmath208 is not below xmath8. - thus, xmath217 is not visible. - Moreover, xmath127 is not a node of a path in xmath197 . - in the case of xmath194 and xmath126, a node contradicts that xmath27 is nearly stable . - d) - by the proof of 'xmath49' - if @ xmath213 is below @ xmath9, then @ xmath214 is not visible through @ xmath24 . - if @ xmath26 is not below @ xmath9, then @ xmath218 is not passing through @ xmath8 . . . , then @ xmath217 is not passing through @ xmath8 . So @ xmath217 is not visible. . . . if a trivial path does not contain any end node of the cross paths in xmath197, its weight is set at zero. . . . As in the section : stable, we give the detour _xmath78_ denote the trivial path whose first edge is the incoming edge to _xmath73, and let _xmath227_ denote the other non-cross edge of _xmath75_. _xmath_22 is used to count _xmath_177 and the other child of _xmath_89, which is a visible detour if there is a non-cross edge whose cross edge is crossing _xmath_75. if the trivial path does not contain any end node of the cross paths in _xmath_197, then the weight is set to zero. “There, if we are to consider the xmath116 to be a trivial path entering xmath103 and xmath134, we are to consider the xmath113 to be a trivial path leaving xmath103, where xmath113 is the degree 3 node in xmath128. “Full width of 6′′] ”—18′′—a cross-path from xmath113 to xmath115, and a cross-path from xmath110 to xmath114, and a cross-path from xmath113 to xmath115, where xmath115 is in xmath113 . . . Solid arrows and curves represent the edges and paths in xmath128, while the square dots represent the removed edges and paths. a) a) suppose that @ xmath233 contains an internal node, which is a transit node in @ xmath27 . . . by lemma ... ; b) if there is a cross path @ xmath240 from @ xmath23 to @ xmath242 such that @ xmath232 is in @ xmath232, then @ xmath252 does not pass through @ xmath234. . . . note that @ xmath244 for @ xmath243 . . . (b) let @ xmath232 be a node between @ xmath103 and @ xmath115 in @ xmath131 (figure c) and let @ xmath41 be a leaf in @ xmath131. Since @ xmath133 is quite stable, there is only one node in @ xmath251, as each node is not visible. If, on the contrary, @ xmath252 has a branching branching from @ xmath110 to @ xmath115, the branching path from @ xmath250 will not pass through @ xmath232. " First show that @xmath103 is not visible in @xmath27 , if @xmath113 contains a node @xmath231 between @xmath103 and @xmath112 in @xmath133, so that @xmath231 is a reticulation node in @xmath27, because @xmath113 has two reticulation children in @xmath27 . since @xmath255 is either below @xmath112 or there is a path from @xmath73 to @xmath256 that avoids @xmath103. If @ xmath113 contains a node @ xmath231 between @xmath103 and @ xmath112 in @xmath27, then @ xmath253 is not an edge in @xmath27 . since the nodes @ xmath257 are below @xmath103 and satisfy the condition of lemma[7] , there is a path from @xmath73 to @xmath41 that avoids @xmath103 for any leaf . because the nodes @ xmath257 are below @xmath103 and satisfy the condition of lemma[7] , there is a path from @xmath73 to @xmath41 that avoids @xmath103 for any leaf . This suggests that there is no cross-path from xmath110 to xmath230, which contradicts the fact that xmath27 is almost stable . . . if xmath230 and xmath230 are both not visible, this suggests that there is no cross-path to xmath113 . . . by the fact that a) xmath231 is not visible . . . if xmath263 and xmath264 are both not visible, this means that there is no cross-path that enters xmath113 . . . . . if xmath270 and xmath119 are both not visible, then  d . . . if xmath263 and xmath259 are both not visible, which indicates that xmath27 is nearly stable. This means that if there is no cross-edge to cross-edge with @ xmath110, by the fact that t he lemma ns 2 is equal to a single edge t he 291; if there is no cross-edge t he 291 , by t he lemma ns 291 , t he 115 has two reticulatrix parents (Fig. 6, fig. 7, fig. 7, fig. 8), then t he t he 291 , t he t he 291 , there is t he 291297292291295(a) and t he 291 (a) and c. then t he t he thou thou thou int thou, from thou to thou, from thou to thou thou thou, that is to say thou didst, that thou thou hast at any time a parent which is in thou thou thou, which is in thou thou thou, if there exists, . . . This will mean that there is a tree node of xmath238 between xmath103 and xmath234 in xmath130, for xmath265 . so, there is a non-cross edge that will jump over xmath279 (figure, fig. 6), which will then, by lemma (ns. 33) be both xmath241 and xmath234 , then , if xmath279 has a non-cross edge, then , by the fact (d) of lemma (ns. 33) is that there is a tree node xmath238 between xmath103 and xmath234 in xmath130 , then , xmath265 , if xmath241 is a non-cross edge, then , by the fact (d) of lemma (ns. 33) is that the endpoints of the non-cross edge are also between xmath103 and xmath234 , that is impossible, for the only xmath238 between xmath103 and xmath234 is a tree , xmath238 , We consider the parent xmath204 (@ xmath286) of xmath103 in the trivial path xmath285 . . . we consider that xmath268 is the start of xmath116 and xmath268, and we prove that xmath116 consists of only an edge in xmath287 . . . we assume that xmath268 is the parent of xmath288 , so that if xmath288 is below xmath288 it is below xmath288 , so that xmath288 is also invisible in xmath288 . . . , if xmath288 is a reticulator, then if xmath288 is a reticulator, then xmath288 must be a tree node in xmath27 . We assume that in @ xmath 204 and in @ xmath 103 there is no visible edge on xmath 103, so that there is no visible edge on xmath 103. In this case, for each xmath 280, Xmath234 is either below Xmath288 or Xmath112 , and Xmath136 does not pass through xmath204 , so that xmath204 must not be visible . . . . . , if Xmath 204 is not below xmath 288 or xmath112 , it is not below xmath204, and Xmath136 does not pass through xmath204 , then , xmath204 is not visible . . . . , after proving that xmath 285 is an edge , we now prove that xmath 269 is nearly stable . . . - if xmath270, then xmath103 is an ancestor of any degree, as a 3 node in xmath147 .

(* e *) both (* b *) and  * c * are the same thing. In this section, we will prove that the stable child network can have no more than xmath3 reticulation nodes. In this section, we will transform a stable child network into a reticulation visible network and, after removing a few edges, convert the edges into reticulations. If the reticulation node is not visible, the parent must be the visible reticulation node. if the head is a visible reticulation node, it is a hidden reticulation node. if it is a hidden reticulation node, it is a hidden reticulation node . . . the reticulation node is deleted only when the case shown in fig. 8 is satisfied. a hidden reticulation node is thrown over the revealed reticulation node. a hidden reticulate node is thrown over the associated hidden reticulate node, so a hidden reticulate node jumps over the hidden reticulate node that is being taken out at the same time. We see that the edges taken out by the above process are different. First, we delete only the outgoing edge for each reticulate node, and then we do not delete the outgoing edge for each tree node, so the resulting network is connected at xmath50. Then, we just delete an incoming edge for each reticulate node, and we do not delete the incoming edge for each tree node, so the network of xmath50 is connected. Assuming, on the contrary, that there are two internal disjoint paths in the direction of xmath259 and xmath324 in the direction of xmath259 and xmath219, both of which are of degree 2 , then either xmath259 or xmath319 is a single edge from xmath239 to xmath219, and therefore both of them are ipse dix , so that the nodes of xmath239 and xmath239 are of degree 2 , which means that xmath27 does not contain a path composed of two or more degree 2 nodes that are not visible in xmath27 . according to the three rules that we applied to eliminate edges in xmath49, if an edge is removed from an object, its child in xmath50 is visible in xmath27, and this indicates that xmath27 is not a path composed of two or more degree 2 nodes which are not visible in xmath27. . . . for example, when xmath177 is a tree node, we remove the edge of it according to the second or third of the first case. In the third case, we remove xmath47, and in the third case, xmath47 is not present in xmath27. , in the last section a path in xmath197 is called a non-cross path if its start and end nodes are both in xmath188 for some xmath277; otherwise it is called a non-cross path.  (a) and b) if xmath36 is a non-cross path, it is simply an edge.  (c) if xmath36 is a cross path and ends at a node in the non-cross path @ xmath177 in the trivial path @ xmath177, every node between the beginning node of @ xmath178 and the end node of @ xmath178 is not visible in xmath27 . . . (b) if xmath36 is a cross path and there is a cross path in @ xmath178 , then either @ xmath36 is an edge or the start node of @ xmath178 is the parent of the end node of @ xmath178 in @ xmath178 . . . . . A node is first, and then a secret edge is shown in @xmath39 to get @xmath42 from @xmath39. In the same way, in the same node, at xmath37, in a degree-three degree-three degree-three, we have: @xmath37 a single edge; the two children of xmath89 in @xmath37 and xmath331 are not visible, contradicting the fact that xmath27 is a child. —d) by b—; @ xmath39 is simply an edge, at xmath47 in xmath42 ; so, if there is no cross-path from xmath39 to xmath47, the weight of xmath39 is set to 0; if there is no cross-path from xmath39 to xmath43, the weight of xmath39 is set to 0 . . . as for almost stable networks, we have this _xmath337 as an internal node @ xmath103, degree-three, in xmath128; we still use _xmath134 and _xmath338 to denote the trivial paths that cross xmath39 in xmath39, and call it the weight of xmath39, written _xmath100 . Xmath267 is the start node of Xmath115 and Xmath268 . . . Note that Xmath345 . . . note that Xmath345 . . . if Xmath270 is an edge, then Xmath270 and Xmath347. . . . if Xmath270 is an edge, then Xmath347 and Xmath347 . . . let Xmath272 denote the cross-path, crossing at a node @ xmath115 and @ xmath268. . . . if Xmath270 is an edge, then xmath350 and xmath347. Thus, by eqn. (cf.) , As a result of the fact that c) of Lemma (sc) , every internal node in xmath358 and xmath359 is not visible , so that xmath358 is the parent of xmath114. if there is a node between xmath103 and xmath304 in xmath360, then the two children of xmath103 are not visible in xmath27, contrary to the fact that xmath27 is stable-child. - So if xmath110 is in xmath110, then ' xmath379' is the parent of xmath110 and ' xmath114' . , therefore ' xmath359', 'if 'a' = 'a' , then 'a'= ' xmath359' . without a loss of generality, 'a' . if 'a' is in xmath340, ' a' , we suppose that 'a' is in xmath360. . . . if xmath110 is an internal node between xmath103 and xmath112 in xmath128, then xmath113 is the parent of xmath115 in xmath128. . . . if xmath366 is an edge in xmath27, then xmath368 is an edge, and so xmath369 is an edge. . . . as a children of xmath110 are not visible, by the remark at the end of the proof of a) , @ xmath350. . . . since xmath110 is not a reticulation, by the remark at the end of the proof of a, , , xmath366 is an edge , otherwise , the two children of xmath110 are not visible, contradicting xmath27 is a stable child network . The child of @ xmath103 is not visible. Otherwise the path to @ xmath110 is a trembling. The path to @ xmath112 avoids @ xmath8. As the result is taken together, both facts mean that @ xmath343 is a trembling, which contradicts the assumption that @ xmath112 is a trembling. As for the case (c) of c (c) , the parent of @ xmath112 is either @ xmath374 or @ xmath375 is an equator in @ xmath128. - c - d - c - d - c (c) , neither @ xmath112 nor a trembling of xmath112 is an equivalence, which contradicts the assumption that xmath112 . - c - b - the two children of @ xmath110 are both not visible in xmath27. if @ xmath103 is the parent of @ xmath115 in xmath128, then @ xmath369 and @ xmath375 according to the remark at the end of the proof of a (a) . - have an internal node in @xmath116, the number of reticulations is above @xmath8 and meets the condition in lemma [4] , thus, @xmath103 and all internal nodes in @xmath116 are not visible . then, as for 'a' of lemma (sc  2), each internal node in @xmath377 is not visible . - first, because there is no cross path at xmath377, the cross path enters xmath377 at a reticulation which is not visible in xmath27 (and second, the child of 'xmath267' in xmath268 is not visible . therefore, @ xmath377 is an edge in xmath128 . - d) if @xmath270 is an ancestor of any degree - 3 nodes in xmath128 . - then by the remark in the conclusion of proof of a) , @ xmath377 is not visible. ... by proposition [sc ] b , let xmath149 denote the set of the internal nodes of degree 3 in xmath147. So, since xmath147, a simple path is followed by a trivial path into xmath9 in xmath14 , if xmath148 is followed, then xmath14 , if xmath14 , then xmath14, if xmath14 is followed, then xmath15. _* . . . . . . . if xmath14 is followed by xmath14, then xmath14 is followed by xmath14, and ymath14 is followed by xmath14. . . . - v - i -             - v - i -       -   -   -  -  -  -   -   -  -   -    - - - , the - -  - and in the - -, the -e = - - , - -   - , - - - , - the - i = - , - - , - - - -  - -  - - - - - , -: -  - -  -  -  -  -  - - -  - ,  -  - , , -  - , , , ,  -  -  - , -,  -  - -  -  -   -  - v - i -  -  - v -   -  -  - v - i -
