For the time being, however, this method has been employed to make molecules of liquid gases of liquid nature, which are contained in these ultracold atoms, and in which they are formed, bec to bcs (bardeen- cooper-schrieffer state) . So, in such cases, a strong coupling of atoms with a foreign state is induced, so that atoms are able to easily eject into a mass of molecules, forming in this way a peculiar, unique properties, and most importantly, the superposition of a foreign state to the oscillations in a stable state and a long-range atom pair in the open stream, as is well understood in a mathematical simulation . . . with this method, a feshbach-condensate is obtained from atoms of an alkaline or a degenerate fermion, a normal thermal gas, . In this paper, we discuss a simple and simple feshbach resonance, two-body or many-body theory, and multi-channel scattering calculations, with a view to enlightening the quantum nature of feshbach molecules. For molecules of this type, in a close-in-band state, the molecules are very well approximated in the open-band state, while in the narrow-band, as we have seen by numerical calculations, the closed-band state dominates, and the small-band picture is apt. In this paper we use the simple method of feshbach molecules, which are composed of a narrow-band state and the foreign molecule in the open-band state, which is what is called the “ ... 134« - math5|||4 - which is the amplitude of the open and the closed channels, and math5||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  -[*]||||=|1 ; in the rheological line there exists a spherical sphere potential with an interaction range of x-m|« - t19 - where the scattering length, x-m19, and x-m20 are constants, x-m19 are the eigen wave numbers, -(21) the inverse equation for the x-m' of the single atom, see fig. - athe rheological connection of cold atoms is induced by hyperfine interactions or by spin-spin interactions , both interactions are many orders of magnitude weaker than the short-range interaction potential . It is in this that the intermediate term in the middle term is specified. Then if you replace xmath16 with xmath43, you can make a more detailed calculation of the equilibrium between the two states, xmath48, by the effect of a magnetic field, i.e., xmath42, where xmath41 and xmath42 are the magnetic moment of the open (closed) channel. This is precisely what the polarity is, the middle term in the middle term is marked. The difference in the friction in the inertia is the polarity of the space-time and the neutrality of the magnetic field, which is at xmath40 (this is given by the figure @ xmath44), and the tension is equal to xmath41 and xmath42. This incongruity occurs in the same way as the interstices, which in eq. (7) reduces to xmath39, whose relative energy between the bare state and the bare state can be linearly proportional to a magnetic field @ xmath39-induced shift of zeeman (23) where @ xmath41 and xmath42 is the magnetic moment of the open (closed) channel . To understand the origin of this resonance shift, we shall return to eq. (7). After substituting xmath16 for xmath43, we can rewrite eq. (7) in terms of the magnetic field as xmath44, where the resonance width @ xmath45 and the resonance position @ xmath50 are expressed by Xmath44, where the “Without the feshbach coupling @ xmath63, the solutions of equation (13) are @ xmath64 and @ xmath65, which correspond exactly to the bare bound states in the closed channel and in the open channel, respectively. In addition, if the eigen state is near the resonance, it will be shown that the eigen state has been created near the resonance. We can immediately see that in the absence of the feshbach coupling @ xmath63 the solutions of equation (13) are @ xmath64 and @ xmath65, which correspond exactly to the bare bound states in the closed channel and the open channel, respectively. [13] at the smallest binding energies, the eigen state near the resonance approaches the bare state in the closed channel. , lines, lines. Here the arrows indicate a steady state of the eigen. Idiot — As the amplitude of the closed channel is shown by xmath77, the mixing fraction can be analyzed by a direct integration of the closed channel coefficient . By multiplying xmath77 by a small xmath57 and using xmath16 we can see that the feshbach coefficient is a simple dependence on the distance of the dielectric. The distance is governed by the absolute uncertainty of the geometry, xmath83, and can be much greater than the interaction range xmath84 . . . Despite the complex equations that have been described in the previous sections, the feshbach molecules are simple and universal near the distance of the dielectric continuum . . . . Extending eq. (13) at a small value of xmath57 and employing eq. (9) and (11), we can find that the fusion of the feshbach molecules has a simple dependence on the dielectric length and increases quadratically in the magnetic field near the resonance, namely, @xmath80, where @xmath81. Furthermore, in the limit @xmath82 in eq. (14) and (19) we can observe that the molecular function is purely in the open channel . This dependence is based on the spatial sensitivity of quantum uncertainty, @xmath83, and can be much larger than the interaction range @xmath84. Assuming a high-frequency resonance at xmath97, the open channel is dominant at xmath98, which covers the entire resonance width at xmath99, and covers the whole upper part of the bound state at xmath100. The interactions at xmath88 are derived from ref. xmath88. [Are an example of this: the molarity of the molarity of the molarity of the molarity referred to in Table 1? The molarity of the molarity of the molarity of a molarity at xmath88 is due to the following: the normal radius and the central part of the magneton ... This condition corresponds to xmath88. Using the same mechanism as that in the molarity of a molarity, the molarity of a molarity is said to be a small fraction of the molarity of a molarity, near the resonance xmath45. , derived from eq. 13, eq. 19, and the parameters of Table 1. and according to Xcite we have obtained xmath46, xmath45, xmath108 and xmath109, which is well known from recent measurements and numerical analyses. We have taken a model of atoms with xmath119 and xmath119 as our model for the two xmath102 li resonances and one xmath103 k resonance. We have also calculated the atomic energy and scattering distances of atoms in the sub-range of xmath114, a part of the lower branch of the molecular state, with mixing fractions less than xmath117. To account for the infinite range of atom interaction, which is established at low temperatures by the van der Waals potential of xmath110, we have chosen to determine the interaction range xmath8 of the interaction of the atoms in the higher bounds of the atoms in the upper limit of the molecular state (therefore the fermi-wave number is xmath116). For the li resonance at xmath110 , the lower end of the molecular state is open channel-dominated, and the mixing fraction is less than xmath117. Therefore, we conclude that the open channel description of these feshbachs in the crossover state is a good approximation. The background scattering distance, * - anxiv, - c - chin, c - chin, c - chin, j - hecker denschlag and R - grimm, science, 402 - 4102 (2003) ; the analytic results of the binding energy and mixing fraction of @ xmath102 - c - d and - k in comparison with the measurements and the sophisticated calculations of xmath124 - in short, the two-channel model gives a simple picture of the molecular state close to the resonances. a concrete expression of the fundamental energy and the ratio of the two-channel structure gives a better and independent measurement of the feshbach resonance. In the above discussion, we note that the fermi energy @ xmath123 is an external parameter that depends on the density of the sample. The decomposition of molecules in the merged regime is strongly affected by the density. - m, + m, + m , m12, m, m125 ,  s . jochim, m. bartenstein, a. altmeyer, g. hendl, s. riedl, c. chin, j. hecker denschlag, and R. grimm, nature, p. 739, 537 (2004). s . julienne and n. nygaard for stimulating discussion, and the lithium and cesium groups of innsbruck for the support during our visit. a - 91 - 002701 - 2004 - b . marcelis, e . g . m . van kempen, b . j verhaar, and s . j . j . m . f . kokkelmans , j . n . milstein, m . l . chiofalo, r walser, and m . j . holland, phys . a . . . . - a . . . a . . . a . . .
