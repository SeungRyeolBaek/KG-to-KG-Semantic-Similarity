The lep experiments at the resonance of the xmath1 boson have tested the Standard Model (sm) at a quantum level, measuring the decay of fermions to fermions with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand. The good conformity of the lep data with the sm predictions severely limited the behavior of new physics at the xmath1 pole. This factory can be realized in the gigaz version of the international linear collider (ilc) in the shape of a polarized beam of the ilc, and the gigaz version corresponds to the operation on top of the resonance of xmath1 . . . the gigaz option corresponds to the operation on top of the resonance of xmath1 . . . The high light, xmath14 ...' Besides the xmath1 decay into light, a cross-section at the resonance of the xmath1 decay , xmath15, is produced in an operational year of xmath17 in gigaz, so that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of the decay by @xmath1 can be improved from @xmath17 in the sm to @xmath19 in the gigaz. In view of this, the properties of the xmath1 decay, especially its exotic or rare decays, which are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics, should be investigated comprehensively in order to evaluate their potential in probing new physics.Among the rare xmath1 decays, the flavour changing (fc) processes were studied most extensively to examine the flavor texture in new physics - xcite, and it was found that although they were very severely suppressed in the sm, their branching ratios in new physics models were greatly enhanced to xmath19 for lepton flavoring decays - xcite and xmath20 for quark flavoring decays - xcite . ' The inverse of xmath22 is a rare process and is studied widely, e.g. the decay of xmath22 with the particle xmath0 as a light higgs was studied in xcite, the decay of xmath23 was studied in the two-highly doublet model (2hdm) @ xcite and in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (mssm) @ xcite, and the decay of xmath4 was studied in a model-independent way @ xcite, in xcite, in mssm @ xcite and in mssm @ xcite. These studies show that, in contrast to the kinematics barred in the sm, these decays can be as large as @ xmath18 in new physics models, which lie within the expected sensitivity of the gigaz. In this work we extend the previous studies of these decays to some new models and investigate them completely. (*) The nmssm (*) is the non-destructive, supersymmetric model, nmssm, in which a light cp-and- odd hb1230 with a singulart-dominant component may naturally arise from the spontaneous breaking of some approximate global symmetry, like @xmath24 or @xcei_quiuin symmetry @xcite. these non-destructive supersymmetric models can not only overcome the @xmath24 problem, but they can also remove the arithmetic and non-complexity of the atoms by such a light hb12030/sent> . So, it is necessary to review the earlier studies. However, the proportion of the lightest hb110, and the physical size of the hb1101/sent0 is much lowered by recent experiments. We are also motivated by the fact that the properties of the light hb11212323221210320 It is explained as follows: [indeed,] we consider carefully the constraints on light @ xmath1 by many recent experimental results. * We shall analyze the rare at xmath1 by decaying in the nmssm, at xcite, at xcite, and at xcite gev in the lepton – a certain 2hdm, at xcite . With a light C-bomb cp – odd huv’s, the z-decomposition is allowed. Observing that the decay in the nmssm is forbidden by bose symmetry, we examine the rare at xmath1—decompositions @ xcite, at xcite, at nmssm, and at nmssm. In this work, we analyse the constraints on light @ xmath0 from many experimental studies. In the new physics, the higgs are usually extended by adding higgs doublets and / or singlets, and consequently more physical higgs are predicted, along with more free parameters involved in the simulation. In the last analysis, in sec. v, we report numerically the branching ratios of the rare xmath1 decays in different models. in the latest physics, the higgs is usually extended by adding higgs doublets and / or singlets, and so more physical higgs are predicted, along with more free parameters. In the standard 2hdm there are two innumerable zero-dimensional qubits, @ xmath33 and @ xmath34, and with the assumption of the cp-preserving draught it is possible to parameterize its potentials as @ xcite: @ xmath35, [ ] - end  aconcerned      ] - [ ] , where @ xmath36 , @ xmath37 , are free dimensional parameters, and @ xmath38 , @ xmath39 , are the parameters with mass dimension . Noting the constraint @ xmath44 with xmath45 and xmath46 denoted the vacuum expectation value (vev) of @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 respectively, we choose @ xmath47 as the input parameters, and @ xmath49 as the mixing angle that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the cp- even-homo fields. The difference between type ii 2hdm and type l2hdm comes from the yukawa coupling of the higs bosons to quark / lepton. The difference between type ii 2hdm and type l2hdm is caused by the yukawa coupling of the higs to quark / lepton . For instance, in the type iii 2hdm one higgs-dimens’ doublet is restricted to leptons and the other to quarks , so that the yukawa interactions of @ xmath0 to fermions are given by @ xcite @ xmath50 with @ xmath51 denoting the generation index. Clearly, in the type ii 2hdm the @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 can be simultaneously increased by @ xmath54, while in the l2hdm the @ xmath53 and @ xmath53 are only increased by @ xmath55 . so in the type ii 2hdm the @ xmath52 coupling and the @ xmath53 coupling can be simultaneously increased by @ xmath55 . " I see that it's a combination of the sigma and the sigma. The sigma, as it were, has the subtraction and the sigma, a subtraction in the sense that sigma and sigma are one and the same. sigma, sigma, sigma, sigma, sigma, sigma, and sigma, have the subtraction of sigma and sigma, respectively. The subtraction and the subtraction of sigma, together with the superpotentials and the subtraction terms, will give you the subtraction potentials of nmssm and nmssm respectively. The right hand of the equations, sigma, and sigma are respectively the coaxial fields of sigma, sigma, and sigma, defining xmath71, sigma72, sigma61, denoted by sigma73, sigma 75 and sigma 75 are respectively the zero and sigma neutral higgs bosons, sigma 76 and sigma 77 are the gold-stone bosons taken by sigma1 and sigma78, and sigma79 is the charged sigma cp-even higgs, two cp- odd higgs, and a pair of charged higgs . . . so the difference between the interactions of xmath0 and the squarks is as follows: the density of xmath80 and the density of xmath81 is then proportional to xmath82 , so the volume of xmath83 is a small quantity, and the couplings are suppressed. Just like the 2hdm, where we use the vevs of the higgs fields as fundamental parameters, we choose xmath68, xmath69, xmath87, xmath88, xmath66 and xmath89 as input parameters to the nmssm “If we discuss the nmssm and the nmssm, we shall note three points: firstly, the nmssm is in fact the same as the nmssm with xmath94 and xcite, because the tadpole terms Xmath95 and Xmath96 in the nmssm do not stimulate any interaction except the tree-level, higgs boson masses and minimization conditions. And secondly, despite all these similarities, the nmssm has its own peculiarity, which comes from its neutralino sector . . . on the basis of Xmath97, the neutralino mass matrix is given by xcite , where xmath99 is @xcite , where xmath99 is a metric function of @xcite . * this expression has the meaning that a mass of the lightest neutralino is needed in order to give a weight of xmath107 with a weight of this kind: xcite ... @xmath10 this is an expression indicating that the weight of xmath10 must be lighter than that of xmath110 gev for xmath110 (from the lower bound on the mass) and xmath111 (with perturbation ). Like the other supersymmetric models, xmath10 is the dark matter of the universe, but because of its singlino dominated nature it is difficult to eliminate sufficiently to get the correct density in the current universe. In the relic density of xmath107, that is, the simplest form of enumeration is that which occurs in exchange for xmath1 for xmath113, or if a small cp- odd-hu-on cp-identical boson of xmath0 has mass which satisfies the relation Xmath114 for Xmath115. However, a large cp-identical boson of xmath0 will suppress Xmath117, which will make the annihilation more difficult. The properties of the lightest cp-identical-hu-on boson of xmath0, such as its mass and eq., are also limited because xmath0 is an important component of xmath107 annihilation. " It is also possible to apply the resonance effects of xmath119 to a given diagram, viz., Fig.1 , Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , to account for the possible resonance effects of xmath119 in Fig. Fig.1 , fig.2 and fig.3 respectively, in order to include the resonances of xmath119 in fig. Fig.1 (c) for xmath2 and fig. 3 (a) for xmath11 (a) , meanwhile, for xmath11 (b), we have calculated all the decays of xmath11 and included the width effect in the propagator . It only occurs through loops mediated by quarks and leptons in the type ii 2hdm and l2hdm, and also by spherical particles in the nmssm and nmssm. In general, this process is much less common than the other two. However, we should note that in certain cases of the type ii 2hdm and l2hdm it is necessary to count only the contributions from fig. fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. 3 , we may suppose that it is enough to count only the contributions from fig. Fig. 3 , and so we may think that, as a rough estimate, it is sufficient to count only the contributions from fig. Fig. 3 . in the lowest order, this decay proceeds as shown in fig. Fig. 3 (a) , and therefore it may seem that, for a rough estimate, it is sufficient to merely count the contributions from fig. Fig. 3 . After that, for example, the downward convolution of cnt the possiblely large couplings of the new “cnt” [ fig. 3] with cnt, cnt (iii 2hdm , cnt (l2hdm ), the additional contributions of cnt and cnt (cnt) may dominate the tree-level contribution. But when the tree-level contribution, cnt (cnt) exceeds cnt, the upward convolution of the quark- and quark- and cnt—by-difficulty of the cnt , is not always the case. On the other hand, we observe that the contributions of cnt and cnt can be safely neglected if cnt@xmath127 is true. We also calculate some of the potentially large neutralino corrections (see the diagrams of cnt@xmath@xmath@xmath@xmath@xxxxiii] loops. And we could not forget it too. The figure was extracted for the four models. Because considering all the radiative corrections would make our numerical calculation rather slow, we limited our analysis to only one correction, which was induced by the interaction between the squarks and the interaction between the xmath132 and the xmath133. Since the xmath132 interaction conserves the chirality of the squarks, while the xmath133 interaction violates the chirality, for the chirality to be non-zero, the squarks must have at least four flippings, three of which are the xmath131 interaction, and the rest to the left-right mixing. Therefore, if the amplitude is estimated in the chirality with mass insertion, the amplitude is suppressed by the mixing factor @xmath13 . But if the light should be a light, the doublet component, parameters of which are parameterized by Xmath84 in eq. (mixing), will usually be small, the couplings of xmath0 with spherical particles will never be enormously large xcite , so the chargino and neutralino contributions are not as important as chargino and neutralino contributions . . . So, we’ve taken the constraints of Xmath140 by looking for a peak in the mass distribution of Xmath1-bison @ xcite, and to find the constraint of Xmath144 mev at xmath148 @ xcite, and compare it to the corresponding data in our code. Similarly, we consider the constraints of Xmath138 by looking for the peak of Xmath143’s mass distribution on the xmath141 plane, with the subscript Xmath148 denoting the coupling coefficient of the xmath148 interaction. These constraints, if so, limit the quantities, which are such as xmath146  times br (h ii to b b b) on the xmath147 plane, and the subscript Xmath148 denotes the coherence coefficient of the xmath148 interaction . . . They are greatly lower than that of the sm, i.e., xmath154, in part, because in new physics models, unconventional decay modes of xmath155, such as xmath155, are being made accessible. As for the nmssm, a specific reason for allowing a much lighter cp-and-even p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing, are that the p-axing p-axing is either weak or sufficiently heavy p-axing. et cetera, the p-axing p-axing p-axing, and the latest babar p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing . . . in the case of the lightest p-axing p-axing p-axing p-axing, we found that the mass of the particle was not less if the @ xmath157 interaction was weak or the p-axing p-axing was not so heavy . As the higgs sector can make a great deal higher order corrections to xmath165 couplings, we calculate them to one loop level, and we require the corrected xmath165 couplings to be within the same range of their measured value. * the constraints of xmath165 couplings. - about constraints (5) and (6) of xmath171 leptonic decay . - about constraints (5) and (6) xcite in our calculation . - about constraints (5) and (6)  xcite in our calculation . - about constraints (5) and (6) - about constraints (5) and 6 . Since all the bosons of the boson are constrained by the self energy of xmath171 lepton, they rely on xmath54 for the corrections, and therefore the box for xmath176 is given above. The other point is that in the type - ii 2hdm, xmath177, b-physics and xmath178 decays mentioned above can constrain the model in a tighter way than the constraints (5) and (6) since the yukawa couplings of xmath171 lepton and xmath179 quark are simultaneously enhanced by xmath54. However, for the l2hdm, the more tightly xmath54 is limited by xcite . “Li-cone and S–Cone will have to be used. “The S–Cone and S–Cone should be used in conjunction with the LE-CONE and S–Cone and a fixed multiplicity of their respective indices. “The remainder of the work will be devoted to enumerating the main effects of Le-Cone and S–Cone in a couple of different ways. In our system we have made use of the formula based on these observables at the rate of 5 sm/s, and in combination with x–Cone and x–Cone respectively. In computing @x–Cone, @x–Cone, and @x–Cone, ... we need to get the x–cone or ... co-ordinates to be within the range of experimental value of @x–cone. In calculating @x–Cone, @x–cone, and @x–cone, ... we need to set the physics predictions for @x–cone which should be within the range of the experimental value of @x–cone ... —we note that these observables occupy the dominant position by the elasticity of the gauge bosons, @ xmath1 , @ xmath192, and @ xmath193 — since there is no xmath194 coupling or xmath195 coupling, @ xmath0 must be associated with the other self-energizing bosons to make the self-energizing bosons. In this case, we will make a direct connection between the av convergence of these two quantities, and the uv convergence of these quantities will be shown to indicate that the light of light , namely, a light xmath0 and a light xmath196, may still withstand the constraints of the precision electroweak observables, since the proportion between xmath150 and xmath198 is moderate. That is, in the type ii 2hdm and the l2hdm, the only impurity in this structure is the charged higgs boson, which contributes only to the observables by loops, and one could reasonably expect that @xmath198 versus @xmath54 would be limited . As for the l2hdm, physics cannot even make any constraints on it because in this model the coupling of the charged higgs boson to quarks is proportional to @xmath206 and in the case of large @xmath54, which we are interested in, they are suppressed . in our sent> values if[14] we try to exclude the unlucky ones . . . in our work we take the results of fig. 11 in @xcite to exclude the unwonted points. It is now in the experiments, both the theoretical prediction and the measured value of xmath208 have achieved remarkable precision, but there is still a significant deviation: xmath208,                                                                            :    ,    n , :  , 2  i   ,   ,   ,   , , . . . . But the type ii 2 hdm is less constrained by the xmath210 process at the lyph at xcite and the decay of xmath178 at xcite, and the Barr Zee diagram’s contribution to xmath178 is insufficient to advance the theoretical prediction of xmath208 to xcite by a large margin. In the type ii 2 hdm, because xmath54 is confined to the process of xmath210 at the xcite lep and the decay of xmath178 @ xcite, the barr zee diagram’s contribution is insufficient to advance the theoretical prediction of xmath208 to xcite – this means we need the type ii 2 hdm to explain xmath208 at xmath211 level. So we require the type ii 2 hdm to explain xmath208 at xmath211 level. as in the case of the nmssm and the nmssm, the above constraints become more complicated because in these models not only more nmssms are involved but also spherical particles are also involved. In our case, for the case of the electron-hole, we found that for the case characterized by xmath214, the coefficient of the interaction with xmath125 is usually larger than the electroweakness of xmath125, and therefore a large decay width is obtained. . . . because this paper concentrates on the light xmath0, the decay xmath212 is opened up with a possible large extinction ... It is this way that the charged atoms in the process of xcite, which is in the same way as the atoms in the ii 2hdm, is allowed, as far as xcite ... . Since in the nmssm and in the nmssm xmath208 receives the contributions of hoops and of neutralino / chargino ... as hoops is one of the subtypes of hoops in the ii 2hdm ... . . . As hoops are influenced by hoops, hoops as light as hoop215 is permitted even for hoop220 ... as a result, although hoops affects the synthesis in the same way as that in the type ii 2hdm, charged higgs as light as hoop215 is allowed even for hoop216 ... as a result, although charged higgs affects the process in the same way as in the type ii 2hdm, charged higgs as light as hoop215 is allowed even for hoop216 ... In this way we can calculate, using the two contributions, that a light, xmath0 and a light smuon of moderate size, is preferable to dilute the difference . . . note that in the other constraint of sparticle masses, namely, those of lep1 and lep2 and the tevatron experiments xcite . . . c the lep1 bound on invisible z decay xmath223 , lep2 bound on neutralino production xmath224 and xmath225 xcite . . . Dark matter constraints from wmap density 0 . . . . When we analyze the nmssm, we calculate the constraints (3), (5 - 7), and the code nmssmtools is used to implement the rest constraints. The biggest problem we face is how to adapt the code micromegas to the nmssm. We find this most difficult by observing the following facts: as we have mentioned before, the nmssm is the same as the nmssm with the trilinear singlet term set to zero, so we can use the model file of the nmsm as the input of the micromegas and set @ xmath230 . . . since the lsp is too light to annihilate into higgs pairs, there is no need to calculate the effective higgs potential, so we only need to calculate the annihilation channel @ xmath230 with  xmath61 denotes all the higgs . . . . We thank the authors of the nmssmtools for a helpful discussion of this problem when we are about to make this extension. We vary the parameters in the following ranges: @xmath231 for the type ii 2hdm, @xmath232 for the type l2hdm, @xmath233 for the type nmssm, and @xmath234 for the type nmssm . We vary the parameters in the following ranges: @xmath231 for the type ii 2hdm, @xmath232 for the type l2hdm, @xmath233 for the type nmssm, and @xmath234 for the type nmssm . since these parameters are not necessary for the properties of @xmath0, we fix them to reduce the number of free parameters in our scan. We consider the soft-breaker masses and the trilinear parameters to be of a hundred and fifty mcv . The slepton sector will assume all the soft-breaking masses and trilinear parameters to be of a hundred and fifty gev . in this case we require the grand unification relation of the gaugino masses, @xmath240 , @xmath243, - xmath244 and - xmath243; in the nmssm we assume the principal component of the singlet field (as a numerical   vs a numerical  vs a numerical  vs a numerical  vs a numerical  adv>, and the phenomena of the nmssm and the nmssm, which are confined to - xmath245 , and for the nmssm, to which we assume all the gaugino masses and all the geometry of the different gauge groups. We finally conclude the grand unification relation with @xmath240 for the gaugino masses, @xmath243, @xmath243, @xmath243 and @xmath242 samples of the type ii 2hdm, l2hdm, nmssm, nmssm and nmssm respectively. " Xmath246 ) so that their couplings to the sm fermions are suppressed @ xcite. . . . . the graph in fig. [F], shows that the allowed range of xmath54 is from xmath250 to xmath251 in the type ii 2hdm, and from xmath251 to xmath253 in the type ii 2hdm . just as we said before, the lower bounds of xmath254 come from the fact that we require the models to explain the muon-obvious moment, while the upper bound is from the lep process @ xmath . There is a thin band of light xmath256, so that large xmath64 increases the mass of dark matter to make its destruction difficult (see xcite and also sec. ii) , but for the nmssm, this is because we choose a light xmath86 so that large xmath64 enhances the strength of xmath208 too much to be experimentally unacceptable . . . in fig. [fig5] and fig. [fig6] we show the branching ratios of @ xmath260 and @ xmath259 respectively. [fig. 1] The figure . . . indicates that in among the four models the type—ii 2hdm predicts ... if nature prefers a light @ xmath0 to @ xmath260, then the rate of decay for @ xmath260 is at least one order smaller than for @ xmath263 . . . i. . the underlying reason is that in the type ii 2hdm, the @ xmath264 coupling is enriched by @ xmath54 (see fig. [fig. 4]), while in the other three models, the coupling is weakened either by @ xmath265 or by the singlet component of the @ xmath0 . . . we repeat that if nature prefers a light @ xmath0, then @ xmath260 and / or @ xmath269 in the type ii 2hdm, then the rate of decay is at least one order smaller than that of @ xmath267. if either of these decays are small or not detectable, then the singlet extensions of the mssm are preferred. As a result of comparing the optimal cases of the type ii 2hdm, nmssm and nmssm shown in fig. 5 and 7 we can see that the relation of xmath /sent> may be determined. Compared with the optimal cases of type ii 2hdm, nmssm and nmssm, we can show that the relation of xmath /sent> is reduced to xmath270 . this figure shows that the branching ratio of xmath121 can reach xmath270, xmath270, xmath270, xmath270, for the optimal cases of type ii 2hdm, l2hdm, nmssm, and nmssm, which means that the decay of xmath121 can never be observable at the gigaz if the studied model is chosen by nature. " This, in a word, is one of the main differences between the nmssm and the nmssm, that is, it's an underlying reason. In Fig. , Fig. . the rate is plotted as a function of xmath270. This figure shows that xmath270 may be the largest among the ratios of the exotic decays of xmath1 , reaching xmath277 in the optimums of the type ii 2hdm, the l2hdm and the nmssm. The cause of the underlying reason is, in some cases, the intermediate state xmath119 in fig. . . . . in fig. . [b] may be the outer shell . The decay at xmath119 in fig. a, in the nmssm, may be on a shell (of the amplitude xmath278) while in the nmssm it seems impossible. So, we conclude that the decay at xmath11 may serve as a means of testing new physics, especially if supersymmetry is found at the lhc and the decay at xmath11 is observed at the gigaz with great regularity. sent> in the nmssm the higgs boson @ xmath0 is lighter than @ xmath279 without conflicting with the low energy data of the decays at xmath178 (see fig. fig. 4 ) . . . we checked that among the rare xmath1 decays we found the largest branching ratio at xmath280, which can reach xmath281 .
