For example, in qh liquids with filling factor xmath3 , where xmath4 is an odd integer, laughter’s excitations have an electric charge xmath5 , where xmath5 is the elementary electric charge. Alternatively, the incompressible state is formed at the edge of the 2deg. The qh effect manifests itself in the precise and universal quantization of the hall conductance. It consists of a two-dimensional element of electrons, exposed to a strong magnetic field parallel to the plane of the gas , forming an incompressible liquid. In the two-dimensionality of the 2deg, there exist gapless chiral modes, which are the quantum analog of the classical skipping orbits, but in the presence of very strong coulomb interactions, these modes can be regarded as collective edge plasmon modes. Nevertheless, there are, at the edge of the 2deg with the qh effect, gaps that are gapless and can be seen as collective plasmon modes. The qh effect has been observed in two-dimensional xeg liquids with a filling factor of xmath3, where xmath4 is an odd integer, laughinglin quasi-particles have an electric charge @ xmath5 where xmath5 is the elementary charge , these quasi-particles can be scattered between opposite edges at narrow constrictions, forming quantum point contacts (qpc) , thus generating a backscattering current. The so-called charge fractionalization in nonchiral, one-dimensional systems is an inherent property of collective modes and has nothing to do with the existence of quasi-particles. In these experiments, the chiral edge of a chiral system is formed a loop. xthousands are entangled, in this loop, by changing the strength of the homogeneous magnetic field or by deforming the edge of the chiral system with the help of a modulating gate. The most elegant method is to make use of the ab effect, which relies on the fact that the interference of quasi-particles is affected by the magnetic flux of the body. , while the quasi-particles are detected by distinguishing their contribution to the ab effect from the electrons with a period of xmath0. . . . the quasi-particles can then be distinguished by distinguishing their contribution to the ab effect from the electrons with period of xmath0. A certain amount of the relative phase between the two amplitudes, for the upper and lower paths, is shifted by a certain amount, which, resulting in the ab oscillation of the current from the source to the drain, is increased by a substantial amount, which, in turn, produces ab oscillations of the current, from the source to the drain, in the proportion of the flux, with period of xmath2 = . Finally, the dichotomous principle of the ab effect itself leads to a paradox: in all electronic systems, including fractional qh systems, ab oscillations have an electronic period, according to the Byers-Yang theorem. the ab effect itself is of a gedanken nature: the ab effect is in any electronic system, especially fractional qh systems, a 'fourth' math3; but in the case of a fractional qh system, it is not enough to relax to its initial state, since the quantum is removed by a single-valued transformation. The second problem, the only one, can be solved by a different qh interferometer of another kind, the electronic analog of an optical mach-zehnder (mz) interferometer. In this interferometer, the two atoms are inserted into the end, forming a so-called corbino disk, which is formed of two atoms, shown by dashed lines, which act as optical source and drain. As the chiral edge states are used, two qpcs (not shown by dashed lines) serve as optical source and drain. In this interferometer the 2deg is confined to a topologically equivalent to an annulus, i.e., a so-called corbino disk. ohmic contacts are glued to the inner and outer edge of the corbino disk and serve as source and drain. The results of these experiments are difficult to interpret at the level of good theories. . . . but the results of their experiments are difficult to interpret at the level of effective theories. in the thermodynamic limit, averaging the current of the quasi-particles over these quantum numbers is supposed to restore the electronic ab periodicity. Although thouless and gefen have taken a considerable first step in the development of the ab condition in qh interferometers, their study was qualitative, and some of their assertions about the tunneling rate and currents were not firmly justified. They have, however, been able to illustrate the sub-problem of the byers-yang theorem. More recently, a number of authors (see ref. 14) have proposed that in the proper description of the qh interferometers the presence of additional quantum numbers may be added. These quantum numbers are usually expressed either in terms of so-called Br ir; or as additional phase shifts caused by quasi-particles confined to the inner edge of the corbino disk. this is the status of the thermodynamical finite element in a qh state. We are familiar with the existence of some mathematical axioms to resolve this paradox. However, in earlier work [1], thouless and gefen have worked out the atomisation of a qh liquid confined to a corbino disk and weakly coupled to ohmic contacts. They have found that the energy spectrum of the liquid is, as a result of a superfluous quasi-particle tunneling between the inner and outer edges of the corbino disk, and consequently, a m—n There is no certainty that the result will be the same as a microscopic analysis. The results of these studies can be summarized in the following way: they resolve the paradox of byers-yang and assert that ab oscillations with quasi-particle periods cannot be observed in the steady-state current through an mz interferometer. To clarify this important observation, we will first remark that the original formulation of the ab oscillations is based on a single particle picture, through which a particle wave passes through the interferometer, as shown in the upper panel of fig. The upper panel shows that in fig. 15 the ab oscillations of the electron pass through the mz interferometer are inversely proportional to one another and should differ by a factor of xmath4 with regard to the periods of the ab oscillations. In this paper we will present the theoretical foundation of the ab effect. our calculations can be tested in the laboratory by pinching the qpcs off and comparing the states of weak electron tunneling and weak quasi-particle tunneling, where the ab oscillation periods will differ by a factor of xmath4 . in previous works, at xcite, we had proposed that quasi-particle ab oscillations should be observable if the magnetic flux is varied by deforming the edge of the qh system or, alternatively, by changing the strength of the homogeneous magnetic field . We have proposed to use this effect to test scaling dimensions of quasi-particles in different filling factors . But in the case of correlated systems, such as qh interferometers, the naive (gedanken) formulation of ab may lead to serious misconceptions and problems, such as the byers-yang paradox (see also the discussion in sec. [conseq]). In particular, the naive (gedanken) formulation of the ab effect can lead to serious misconceptions and to difficulties, one of which is the Byers-yang paradox (see also the discussion in sec. [conseq]). to this end, we consider a microscopic model of an mz interferometer, schematically depicted in fig. a qh liquid at a filing factor of xmath3 is confined to a region between two circles of radii at xmath12 and xmath13 , between the centers of the two circles we define some quasi-perpendicular tunneling of the qh boundaries between points @ xmath12 and @ xmath13. * at points @ xmath12, @ xmath13 and @ xmath17, as shown in fig. mz by dashed lines. We generalize this eq. to account for the deformation of the qh boundary caused by the modulation gate eq. ( w modg) . in general, we present a corresponding eq.  ( ), in which we apply the eq. . (   ). But the performance is incompressible due to the fact that the regularity of the H-gauge and the Quantum Magnetic Field (Gawk) becomes incompressible by the constrained deviation of the local polarity of the polarity. Thus we come to the rather remarkable conclusion that the ab effect, in its original formulation, does not exist in qh interferometers. in its original formulation, the latter did not exist in qh interferometers. This phenomenon, which we will call the quasi-particle ab effect, does not violate the byers-yang theory. Note that this phenomenon, which we shall call the quasi-particle ab effect, does not violate the byers-yang theorem. , and we take the lower-energy effective theory of the qh effect (q q q q q q q q q q) as a general mode of flux. In the presence of a singular magnetic flux, the light-weighted factor (q q q q) of the w and b function (q q q q) contains a flux-dependent factor which depends only on the distance of electrons to the flux-tube. in other words, the ab phase of the gauge is canceled, locally, by the physical deformation of the w and b function in response to the singular flux. This fact is independent of the shape of the qh system and leads to an exact cancelation of the relative ab phase in the amplitudes (h- tun-f) of the current. This phenomenon is called the quasi-particle ab effect , which we propose to call a quasi-particle ab effect , does not violate the It is a set of operators which describe 'void' plasmon excitations at the edge of the qh liquid. These operators describe in that sense the "broken" plasmon excitations at the edge of the qh liquid. To interpret the hamilton (or 'open') of the tunnels are, in fact, given in turn by the flatness of the charged area, as a function of the quatrain operator ( [emu]); and the spaced tunnels are characterized by innumerable commutations of canonical form ( [emu] ). In the effective theory the three contributions to the general phase shift of the current oscillations, the dynamic, the kinematic and the ab, are all taken into account; in order to construe the ab phase, we note that the effective theory is a boundary contribution to the topological 'Sima' theory , a theory which relates the bulk of the 2deg quasars, and of the differential effect of the modulation gate and the magnetic flux. Moreover, contrary to previous reports, the tunneling hamiltonians at different points in space do not collide with one another (see Appendix - appendix - comm) . - the hamiltonians of the qh liquid are projected as vertex operators ( h - tunnel). Moreover, contrary to the earlier suggestions, the tunneling hamiltonians at different points in space do not meet (see Appendix - comm) . - So there is a reduction of the flux of the electric field from the electric field to the electric field, and therefore the effects of the sounding of the individual electrons are reduced to a few zeros, with the increased number of zeros. we consider the limit of strong electron tunneling. The dynamics of the mz interferometer on a long time scale is described by a single equation for the probability of finding the system in a state corresponding to given values of xmath29. We call this effect topological screening in order to emphasize its independence from the specifics of the system. We, having constructed the low-energy theory of an isolated qh system, proceed to analyze the quasi-particle transport at qpcs and the electron transport at ohmic contacts. In the particular gauge, the cancellation is local and can be regarded as the filtering of the singular flux by the qh liquid . finally, after solving this master equation, we find the current through the mz interferometer as a function of the magnetic flux, thereby establishing the main result of our paper. We obtain, in conclusion, that the current through the mz interferometer is oscillating as a function of the magnetic flux, and the electronic period, xmath, is a decrease of xmath. The density matrix in the electronic sector is also a product of two equilibrium distributions, rho-eq , the number of quasi-particles on the inner and outer edge of the corbino disk, and the number of quasi-particles on the inner edge, where xmath28 . In such a case, the uq to be investigated in principle is to change the area of the hole by a modulation gate, but retain the area of the qh liquid inside the qh liquid, as shown in fig. 'Expert'. Our work is organized as follows: sadoet, sbaopa-v bde, by introducing the microscopic hamiltonian and tunneling operators into the subspace of states corresponding to the small incompressible deformations of a qh liquid , sbbeyond , the effect of the topological screening is not influenced by the distribution of the flux in the hole and the geometry of the sample, and our prediction also applies in a homogeneous magnetic field. Thus, the effect of the topological screening can be tested, in principle, in an experiment with an mz interferometer, changing the area of the hole with a modulation gate but preserving the area of the qh liquid inside the interferometer, as shown in fig. . [Experient] , because the flux through the hole is screened and the ab phase is proportional to the area of the 2deg enclosed by the interferometer path , that is, the flux through the hole is screened and the ab phase is proportional to the area of the interferometer path , this fact, the latter, also leads to another important prediction: in a strongly disordered system stuck on a qh plateau, the topological screening leads to a linear dependence of the ab period (measured by ab oscillations, as At the end of the section, we present a range of many-particle wave functions of the ground state and the unequal excited states of a mz interferometer . . . this is achieved step by step, starting from the laughlin wave function and manipulating it, so as to arrive at a realistic model of the interferometer . . . we proceed in turn, starting with the laughlin wave function and manipulating it, in order to obtain a realistic model of the interferometer . . . we also draw an approximate ground state, at xmath31, of a qh system, filled with xmath24 electrons at xmath3: here, xmath32, denotes a set of complex coordinates, describing the position of the electron, xmath35, and xmath37, and xmath37 is the magnetic length. In this section, we construct the many-particle wave function of the ground state and of the gapless excited state of a mz interferometer. Using the classic plasma analogy, it is known that the wave function (w-ring) describes a circular droplet of a qh liquid of constant density and radius, xmath39. “Knowing that the state of qh is subdivided in two dimensions, a wave function of the type “xcite” will be analytic in the corbino disk (see Fig. 7-28 ) and where  xcite  langle  underbar  z   n, m  rangle,  label  wave-1  ] where the function “xcite”  label  omega  ”” will be analytical in the corbino disk (see Fig. 7-28 ), and  xmath48  label  omega    ] where the function  xcite  langle  underbar  z          n, m  rangle  label  wave the classical plasma analogy in qh states has proved to be an efficient method in the analysis of qh states. Using the first term of q (extphi) to describe the basic system, it is clear that the subordinate function ( z1 ) is a gas of charged particles interacting with the two-dimensional (logarithmic) coulomb potential confined by the external potential. This is reflected in the inverse temperature of the plasma and the energy: xmath56 [as shown by the label e e [a] end [] [see] ] [13]  this is invariable by a spectral error, so that the overall deformation of the wave function is not affected by the spectral deformation. this is called the second multiplier     . it is important to note that the function (w - magn ) is singular, and is deformed by the spectral flow, in order to retain its singularity. , this effect is described by the additional multiplier   xmath56 . here, we apply this method to the wave function   . . . Finally, we take the mean density of the flux, @ xmath67, as a basis for the equation of the ga xmath70; and this works to exclude the background charge , so that the total potential vanishes in the region where the ga is not yet depleted. The most important consequences of this simple equation are the following. Firstly, the electron density is proportional to the thickness of the disk, and the only constant is the swathing of the surface, as we see in the Figure. For the efficiency of the plasma is a quadratic function of density; and besides, the electron density is quadratic, since the mass of the electron is a quadratic function of the density. By means of perfect screening, the outer edge is without regard for the position of the hole, and thereby displays the symmetry of the boundary conditions in the distribution of the background charge (see the first term in eq. (extphi) ) . Hence the average density, xmath70, is given by the solution of the saddle-point equation (the equation  Xmath70) , which reads xmath70, and the average density math70 is given by the solution of the saddle-point equation ( eom-1), which reads  xmath70 . the complete potential, xmath73, disappears in the region occupied by the 2deg. After this, after assuming that the integral of the undeformed corbino disk, @ xmath81, cancels the first two terms of eq. (extphi), we arrive at the following result, @ xmath82, in polar coordinates (see fig. . . def) in the following polar coordinates (see fig. . . def): the boundary of the deformed disk can be defined as @ xmath82 in polar coordinates (see fig. . def): the boundaries of the deformed disk can be defined as @ xmath82, where @ xmath82 is the explicit expression 02 for the potential  xmath50, and this result can be interpreted as fourier series: @ xmath86, and with the explicit expression 02 for the potential  xmath50, we calculate the equation (eom- 2 ) by power series. It is easy to verify that the flux through the depleted area under the modulation is properly calculated, for example, through xmath89. The result can be represented in fourier series: [sol-def] @ xmath89 , the values of the wave function (w-modg) are accurate and precise, and for each edge there are ten points. “We have found the set of states (for example, wave-1) describing unrestrained deformations of a qh liquid; so, we have built up operators generating subspaces of such low-energy states when applied to the state unscathed by the ground. Having found the set of states (for example, wave-1) describing the incompressible deformations of a qh liquid, we have now devised operators that produce subspaces of such low-energy states, and ascertain their commutation relations. To arrive at this conclusion, we take into account the following commutation relations for the operators of zero-modes, namely: states with different numbers of electrons, namely, quasi-particles, in the system (fi), [fi], xmath96] [fi] [fi] [fi], - n , e  i  phi , n , e  i  phi n  e  i  phi n , e  i  phi n   e  i  phi n The holomorphic structure of this bilinear form allows us to extend the result for the norm @ xmath106 to the scalar products @ xmath107. Similarly, by defining differential operators, we give the states @ xmath111, by the parameters @ xmath22. As @ xmath110 merely repeated the same calculations for the operators @ xmath113, we get:  langle n, m,  underbar  t  ,  rm c . . . ” ,  rm c . . ] ,  label  free en     end  gathered  ” . . .  rm c . . .  . . . . ” And we are to assume that we are to assume that we are in the presence of a magnetic pulse. So we first implement our approach when we have not an external magnetic pulse. The projection of the microscopically hamiltonian operator to the subspace of incompressible deformations is given by the expression: Xmath123, where xmath124 is the potential of a screened 3d coulomb interaction, and xmath125 the holding potential which forces electrons to form the interferometer. Note that we have not included the kinetic operator, for, as it operates on the lowest landau level, it gives a constant contribution, @ xmath126, where xmath127 is the cyclotron frequency. We then consider angles in which the diagonal elements are located, Xmath132, Xmath132 , and Xmath130. xmath131 The potential energy for xmath123 in the large-axis area is given by the expression xmath123, where xmath123 is the potential of the screened 3d coulomb interaction, and xmath125 is the constrained potential, which combines the electrons to form the interferometer. The electric density in the deformed state can be rewritten in terms of the electronic density, as follows: xmath133 in the large-axis area, and for the long-range interaction, we approximate this function as xmath134, without omitting the -acquiescence' contribution. . . . if a particle, Xmath, is deformed, the energy of the core, Xmath140, Xmath84, is calculated by the interaction of the two bodies and the force of the eccentric potential: Xmath140 . . . if the potential, Xmath142, represents coulomb interactions screened at a distance, Xmath146. . . . the equation of “linearity” consists of the holomorphic structure of the bilinear bilinear form ([linearity]), in which we further calculate the boundary conditions, [lead ] and the measured power. . . . where @ xmath137 is the energy of a qh system confining to an undeformed corbino disk, and the last two terms come from the energy of the deformed state, @ xmath148, replacing the mode with the wave vector @ xmath149, we arrive at the final form of the edge hamiltonian , @ xmath150, replacing the mode with the wave vector @ xmath149, we arrive at the final expression for the edge hamiltonian , @ xmath150, adding the mode number to the wave vector , @ xmath150, we reach the final expression for the edge hamiltonian , @ xmath150 ‘Poissoning hamiltonian’ may be written as a sum of tunneling operators at the left and right qpc. The tunneling operator is an operator that annihilates a quasi-particle at a point @ xmath155 and reassembles it at a point @ xmath20.’ (Refer to the earlier ref.) as follows: ‘Poissoning hamiltonian’ is the sum of tunneling operators at the left and right qpc: ‘Loissoning hamiltonian’. Taking the left and right qpc as analogies, we can imagine that a quasi-particle operator can be described by a series of equilateral states, ‘Loisson’ ; in other words, we can define the tunneling operator as an operator whose matrix elements consist of the overlap of wave functions with quasi-particles on the inner and outer edges. , there are, in fact, a few equilateral states, ‘Loisson’, ‘Loisson’, and ‘Loisson’, where Loisson’s equation has a multiplicative effect on the amplitude of the tunneling amplitudes.’ As for the ‘Loisson’, the projection of the tunneling operator, ‘Loisson’, is expressed in terms of matrix elements in deformed states, ‘Loisson’,’ where we have excluded a combinatorial factor, for it is possible to obtain this constrained factor. and we say: ‘Word : z     –’ –  ‘lens       –  –   –‘   – a whole  -  – left –  – right –     langle n, m,  t   – langle n, m,  t   – underbar  t  –  r  – n, m –    langle n, m –     langle n, m –  underbar  t  –   langle n, m –   – underbar  t  –  r   –   –   –    left –  k –  –  exp – left –  – sum – k > 0 – left –  –  left –  –  – left –  – k > 0 – left –  –  left –  – left –   –  left – – left –     –  – right –  –  – Using expression (free-en) for the logarithm of the norm @ xmath180, and defining (ak) [ ) [ ][ ]—all the constant multiplicative factors are absorbed into a prefactor @ xmath180, and we have also introduced the following notations: bsefield . . .  ] . [ ][ ] ][ ] , and [ ][ ][12] [13][15] , [17][16] [17] to complete the physics of the interferometer, [18][17] [18][17] is necessary to see the projection of the operators of electron tunneling from the edge of the quantum hall to the upper ohmic contact . . . [19] The result of this projection is given by the xmath185    times  exp  big [i phi n + im phi  ln + m  ln ( xi d  z 0    ] At the first instance, we consider the case when the flux is varied by a modulation of the gate voltage. The wave function of the interferometer in this case is given by eq. (w modg), and the density of the surface is given by eq. (d dens - g). In this case, expressions (h- Tunnel - [ rho-li-li-li] and [ elec - d] create a unit charge at the corresponding edge. The resulting low energy theory agrees well with the effective theory of refs ... and [ ]. After having explained the self-reproachable method for the projection of observables on low energy conditions, we will examine the projection of the hamiltonian and of the tunneling operators in the case where a magnetic flux is threading through the interferometer. In this case the wave function of the interferometer is given by eq. (w modg) and the edge density is given by eq. (dissein - g) . And in eq. (wave - 1). Next, we will consider the deformations of the ground state (w modg) as follows: @ xmath194 langle  underbar    , n, m  spline,  label  w def - g   . - Next, we see that the density of the XM surface in the state of 'W - def - g' coincides with the result of 'W - def - g' (the values of which were 'Si - def'). - From 'A' to 'B' we have the result 'Sol - Def' - but with 'A' replacing 'A' by 'A'. This does not affect the energy of small deformations, which is still bilinear in the coefficients @ 'K'. We will observe in sec . ' So' - so we find that after a gate voltage the tunneling operators are on the left qpc and on the right qpc the tunneling operators acquire relative phase @ xmath205, proportional to the flux from xmath8 to the area of 2deg which is depleted by the gate. So, as we have seen, the only effect of the gate voltage on the edge hamiltonian, down to the irrelevant constants, is given by: ' xmath200' ''     times  exp ' d' d ( xi  * z   0 ) . " - ... Note that, according to xmath, the deformed states are generated in the presence of a singular flux, - Xmath1 * so that the expression of the tunneling operator is different from eq. (h - tunnel) only by a real prefactor. - - Tunnelling - in this case, we show that the low energy effective theory, in the last section, is formulated in a universal gauge-invariant form. In this section we show that the low-energy effective theory derived in the last section from the specific wave function (i - a) can be formulated in a universal gauge-invariant form - so that it is local and gauge-invariant. Then we show that the gauge-invariant edge hamiltonian coincides with that of the microscopic theory, see eq. (i - edge) and the tunneling amplitudes correspond to those of eq. (i - tunnel) . So we conclude that, in contrast to the situation in which a modulation is introduced, the tunneling operators at different qpcs have no relative phase due to the singular flux. This is interpreted as an exact cancellation of the phase-change caused by the flux itself and the phase-change caused by the deposit of charge at the edges. In this section we show that the low energy effective theory, derived in the last section from the specific wave function (52), can be formulated in a universal, gauge-invariant form. He also takes into account the parameter space and all the circumferences. The thermoelectric effect is, if possible, invariant under gauge transformations @ xmath220. Adding the dimensions, we can easily see that the rectilinear action of the potential on xmath220 is induced by the immutability of the gauges, @ xmath221.  frac  1  2  pi   int d  3r  mu j  mu =  frac  1  2  pi   int d  3r  mu  nu  lambda  b  lambda  b  lambda      lambda  [Number 2] end  collected          [Liquids]  [Less distance] greater energy, [Liquidity], [Elder] had zero dimensions, and all other possible terms had the same, higher dimensions, i. e., they remained irrelevant at large distances and at low energies. ‘Latin — a bigger thing — mu — mb — a bigger thing — a bigger thing — a smaller thing — a smaller thing — a smaller thing — a bigger thing — a smaller thing — a smaller thing — a smaller thing — a bigger thing — a smaller thing — a smaller thing — a smaller thing — a smaller thing — a bigger thing — a smaller thing — a bigger, smaller thing isn’t as big as the bigger thing. In the “fatal” form, the “large” form is like a fraction of a pie in a foreground, as xmath233, “foreground” or “deep” form is a result of a polarized winding and a thin film of phosphorescent water.

Xmath240, note that the commutation relations of the field Xmath241 are determined by the first term in the canonical action (s - edge1); e.g. ac: frac  2  pi i  m  delta (x-y) . Finally, if we extend the effect of the charge density on the edge of a qh system, we find an expression that is of the most simple form for the qh system , a chiral chiral chiral dynamics with a linear dispersion law. The action (all the action) arises from a topological theory, where the action is described by wilson lines. The analysis of the statistical phase of two excitations of this kind (all the action (all the action) is based on the braiding of corresponding wilson lines . . . the simplest expression, called xmath243, justified in the case of small deformations, leads to the chiral edge dynamics with a linear dispersion law . . . - (for example, see Fig. e-b) - where the 1-d and 2-d coordinates are related by the terms: @xmath259 for the outer edge and @xmath260 for the inner edge of the mz interferometer; (see fig. e-b) - an operator that makes a jokelin quasi-particle at point Xmath20 and a jokelin quasi-hole at point Xmath155 has the form of a wilson line between these points: @xmath258 note that this operator is not gauge invariant.

In this section, we show that the effects of a singular flux and a modulation gate found in sec. s. can be reformulated in the hamiltonian theory. So we extend the theory to the subject of the aspect of the tunneling operator (‘emb-d’), and in that way we translate this value into the area of the current at xmath290. Next, we consider the effect of the modulation gate on the declining operator (‘emb-d’). As a consequence, we extend the border operator to the lowest order of the tunneling operator, that is, by the product of two operators of such operators, taken at two qpcs. Consequently, we express this result in terms of the edge density by the aid of eq. (eq. ham-gate) , which is in full agreement with the microcosmology. (By substituting into this equation the normal mode expansion of the homicide (phi-a), we arrive at the result (h-edge) that is, @ xmath290    big)                               end  drawn out In that case, we may conclude that, after adiabatic insertion of the singular flux, the quantum number @ xmath21 is shifted by @ xmath307 by a proportion of xmath307. Thus, we may conclude that the effect of the singular flux is reduced, in the presence of an external electromagnetic field, to the same degree as the effect of the gauge-invariant effective theory. In order to this effect, we estimate the effect of the singular flux on the voltage densities of the field, in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. This, therefore, entails the following equations of motion: math303, math304, math305, where math304 is the electric field at the edge of the sample. here we have derived the Maxwell equations and have returned the physical units. Thus we conclude that after the adiabatic insertion of the singular flux, the quantum number math21 is shifted by math307 ; and this entails an effective hamiltonian of the form: math327  ,  nonumber, 2 ... ” This cation is the result of a high-frequency current in the matg. 303Me3d.; // to the byers-yang theorem. we have demonstrated above that the ab effect does not exist in the qh interferometers, since the tunneling operators do not depend on the magnetic flux threading the corbino disk. Thus the phase shift of an edge excitation on a closed contour, caused by a change of the vector potential @ mat3ir, is prevented by the reconstruction of the qh liquid. This topological distinction is reflected in the effective theory on the level of the effective theory of the fact that after the insertion of the singular flux the measurable wave function (w-mn) undergoes a deformation in order to preserve its singular value. This , however, does not imply that the current through the interferometer is independent of the flux. In this section we demonstrate that the charge current is oscillating as a function of xmath8 with the electronic period xmath0, in accordance with the yang theorem. I give you the electron quantum numbers, xmath26 and xmath25, varying during the ohmic tunneling process, while the quantum number xmath27 changes by xmath317 when a quasi-particle tunnels from one end to the other, as illustrated in fig. [Mirror] . It is this recurrence of the two quasi-particle tunneling amplitudes at the left and right qpc . formally, these oscillations are the effect of the 10-dependent phase factor of the tunneling operators . But in addition, we don't have to define the exact form of the coupling to the ohmic contacts, because the only role of this coupling is to balance the edge states. Furthermore, it is not necessary to specify the exact form of coupling to the ohmic contacts, because the only function of this coupling is to stabilize the edge states . . . Thus, in this section we find the enervative equation that describes weak quasi-particle tunneling, and we find the tunneling rates using the effective theory. quantum coherence manifests itself in oscillations of the quasi-particle tunneling rates as a function of the magnetic flux , namely, the inverse temperature, the inverse electrical potential of the ohmic contact, and xmath326 the partition function. It follows that in a stable state mz interferometer is an interesting example of a system with a broken detailed balance. Here the operator xmath344 projects onto the states with given numbers xmath345 and xmath27, and the operator xmath346 is the equilibrium density matrix of the oscillators. Note that the detailed balance equation xmath338 is satisfied only if xmath339 is satisfied. Hence, in this system the following quantities are independent of xmath336, that is, from the periodic condition xmath337, which can be verified directly with equations ( [rho-eq] and ([rho-fact] ) . 2 The following calculations, based on the fermi golden rule, give the following expression: math333 , math345, math333 , math346 math346 the inverse density matrix of the oscillators. In the following part, we take the frequency a result of an incoherent and coherent part: xmath354 [2] ; xmath354 [2] ; we remember that xmath354 is the total number of electrons in the corbino disk, and xmath14 and xmath16 are the 2d coordinates of the qpcs. Note that the magnetic field enters the frequency adequacy (tu -rc-rc-rc-rc-rc) particularly via the frequency adequacy [3] [ xmath355] ; in this situation, the power-switch operators @ xmath357 and @ xmath358 have the relative phase @ xmath359 ; for the convenience of this reading we shall rewrite the above expression: tu -rc-rc-rc-rc-rc 213] [h364] [ni =] [1024]; and , from the modulation of the gate, we shall observe that the flux in the tunneling-rates (( tun-rates-rv)) is increased by an additional flux dependent on the tunneling operators [g -rc) and on the left and right of the qpcs, which acquire a relative phase (g - m][25][26][27][26][28] and which, for the sake of our convenience, we shall rewrite the following: “[37] , which consists in the fact that the energy of the Zero-Modes simplifies, where @xmath364 , where @xmath365 , the energy of the Electron becomes, and to an equal degree, compared with the energy of the Electron (‘ tun-therm’). In this respect we observe that the Electron is equal to xmath364; this is precisely in keeping with the energy of the Electron from @xmath365. In this we obtain the following expressions for a ringing rate: @xmath370 ,  label  tun-therm’s 3   end  gathered     [  end  gathered   ] with @xmath374 in the second term, given by @xmath371 , as follows from the expressions: ‘Quartier          end            end This is not the case, for we assumed for the sake of simplicity that the coulomb interaction would be screened by a nearby metallic gate, so that the inner and outer edges of the corbino disk would not be tangled. Hence, we have demonstrated that, in the case where the flux of the interferometer is varied by inserting a unique interferometer, the electronic periodicity of the current is restored. The potentials at xmath374 and xmath313 are then measured against this gate. the potentials at xmath374 and xmath313 are then measured at this gate. We have to admit that the degree of grating is different according to the details of the experiment. However, we must not deny that these details do not affect the generality of our conclusions concerning the periodicity of ab oscillations. We may now pass to the thermodynamic limit and replace the sum over xmath378 by an integral, to obtain the expression - tun-therm. , if @xmath380 is large, we expand the cotangent in the integral ([integr_2]) and keep the leading harmonic: @xmath380 . . . if this second, sub-leading, term, is located far from the real axis: @xmath388 . . . it means the increase of the cotangent in the thermodynamic limit . . . as a result of the above experiment, we find that the transferring of variables to @xmath380 corresponds to the following function: the expression: @xmath380 , where we have omitted the unimportant constants, and @xmath333 are the tunneling rates ([ta . . . ]. next, we use the analytical ta . . . function of the variables @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 to deform the integral contour of (                non . . .  a . . . , for the second, sub-leading term, the saddle point is far from the real axis:   . . . because After the passing through the lines eq. c.

As we have seen, the tunneling rate (Tun-Rates-Rates-Rates-Rates-Rates-Rates-Rates-Rates) has harmonic contributions in c. . . . which are exponentially suppressed by the thermodynamic limit. We may interpret this modulation as a consequence of the coulomb-blockade effect. However, we may observe that the tunneling rate in c. . . n4444445474141030r-fc7101010130 is periodic in c. . . according to the -u=td3r14p92... Our study then turns on the following example: an example of a liquid with filling factor of xmath400, where we also apply our theory. The following: we show that the average current oscillates in xmath400 in the presence of the single flux with the period of xmath0, a very contradiction with the effect of topological screening. We will now present a simple example of a liquid filled with qh at filling factor of xmath400, where our theory is applicable. It is this last fact that makes interferometers of qh systems stand out from the many other electronic interferometers, where ab effect is regarded as a simple textbook physics. So we will introduce the analysis of a qh liquid at filling factor of xmath400, which our theory also deals with. Since the position of the orbits is constant, being a vector, the only effect of the singular magnetic flux is to change the phase of the single-electronic wave function, which consequently results in the overall ab phase shift of the single-electronic wave function. As we have just mentioned, the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the many electrons is combined with the cooperative action of many electrons, and the single-electronic wave function is omitted, which leads to a broad reduction in the amount of the average current. As we have already seen, the synthesis of the synthesis is now capable of being used as a straightforward definition. To continue to illuminate the important role of topological screening, we will discuss here a simple example of a qh liquid, at filling factor of xmath400, in . . in the case of an asymmetric corbino disk (see fig. [1] ) and show that the eigenstate of the non-interacting hamiltonian is not the eigenstate of the non-interacting hamiltonian in the presence of a confining potential . . . in a qh system the eigenstates of the non-interacting hamiltonian are only the orbits of the single-particle orbits drifting along the common line, as shown in fig. [2] . . . the first orbits are filled with the adiabatic insertion of the singular flux into the hole in the corbino disk, because they do not surround the flux . . . in this case, the orbits that belong to the other two groups encircle the flux, and therefore, the orbits that belong to the other two groups are changed to each other, in order to retain their original value. Consequently, the single-particle picture, based on the eigenstates of a non-interacting hamiltonian, cannot accurately describe the insertion of the singular flux, because it leads to compressible deformations in the bulk of the 2deg. He will observe that in this case the total flux in the hole in the mz interferometer is screened and does not contribute to the ab phase, for the homogeneous flux is viewed as a distributed singular flux. In addition, in a case where there is a considerable disturbance in the magnetic field, such as exceeds the cyclotron gap, such a process may exist in a broad range of magnetic fields. Consequently, the incompressible qh liquid in the mz interferometer is occupied by several holes which result from the perturbation of the disturbance potential. This effect of a topological screening can, in principle, be tested in an experiment with a mz interferometer, filling in the quoting rate of xmath407. Next, we consider the effect of topological screening on qh systems with a long-range disorder. If the filling factor is slightly different from xmath3, but the qh system is still at the corresponding plateau of the hall conductivity, then there are several unoccupied localized states in the quartile. Therefore, the ab phase is proportional only to the total area of the incompressible qh liquid in the interferometer, Xmath408, and not to the geometrical area . We briefly reviewed these papers in the introduction, and more in detail in the appendix c of our earlier paper. This paper suggests the most appropriate theory of ab oscillations for quasi-particles. This theory is based on the Byers-yang theorem, which states that the steady state current through the interferometer oscillates with the electronic period @ xmath0 as a function of the singular magnetic flux @ xmath8 passing through the loop. We recall that the main objection to the observation of ab oscillations with a quasi-particle-long period is based on the Byers-yang theorem, which states that the steady-state current through the interferometer oscillates with the electronic period @ xmath0 by the singular magnetic flux @ xmath8 which passes through the interferometer spool. We proceed by projecting the micro-hamiltonian to the subspace of these excitations and arrive at the low-energy theory of the interferometer in the presence of a singular magnetic flux, or at the modulation of the voltage. We return to the inhomogeneous hamiltonian and compute the force-effective theory of the interferometer in the presence of a singular magnetic flux or on the basis of the modulation of the magnetic field. We recall that the main argument against observability of ab oscillations of longer quasi-particle periods is based on the Byers-yang theorem, which is that the steady state current through the interferometer oscillates with the electronic period at xmath0 through the singular magnetic flux through the loop. However, the arguments based solely on the effective theory of the theory are too weak qh system, in general, and an electronic mz interferometer in particular, respond to the insertion of the singular flux in the form of periodic oscillations of the average constant current. These oscillations result from the redistribution of charge between edge states, and from the quantization of charge. The effect is global, topological, because it does not depend on the choice of the gauge. On the other hand, we predict that, when the total magnetic flux is increased by the interference of a modulation gate on the interferometer s loop, the average current will be distorted by this flux with the quasi-particle period of xmath2. this effect has a global topological character, because it does not depend on the choice of gauge. Thus, our theory conforms to the byers-yang paradox. In a qh system, and especially an electronic mz interferometer, it will respond to the input of the singular flux by periodic oscillations in the average steady-state current. these oscillations are associated with the coulomb blockade effect, must have an electronic period @ xmath0 and vanish from the thermodynamic limit, where the mz interferometer may be considered an open quantum system. Nevertheless, the qh system, in general, and especially the electronic mz interferometer, will respond to the input of the singular flux in the form of periodic oscillations in the average steady-state current. In our theory, we introduce the byers-yang theorem. Thus, we firmly define the byers-yang theorem. And, if this is the case, one can observe the effect of topological screening even at a fractional filling factor, that is, at a density of xmath400. In addition, we shall discuss the properties of the semi-particle operators and of the tunneling hamiltonians. We will say first that we make quasi-particle operators by projecting quasi-particle excitations of the laughlin function into the low-energy subspace. Then we show that the operator is not exactly subject to free particle excitations, but produces a 278Statistical Phase-Tape. Further, we predict that in strongly disordered QH systems, as a result of topological screening, the period of ab oscillations should be linearly proportional to the magnetic field crossing the solid wall. Thus, taken at two spatial points, they generally are not generally compatible, except for a fabry-prot interferometer, as some have shown. Moreover, by doing this, we may observe the effect of topological screening even at integer filling factors, e.g., at xmath400 . We further predict that in strongly disordered qh systems, the period of ab oscillations will linearly depend on the magnetic field across the plateau of the hall conductivity. our additional remarks concern the properties of the quasi-particle operators and of the tunneling hamiltonians. First, we note that we directly construct quasi-particle operators by projecting quasi-particle excitations of the kinetics of the laughinglin wave function into the low energy subspace . . . . then we demonstrate that these operators have an achromatic commutation, and It is interesting to examine the effects of the quasi-particles and statistics. In view of the new results on the nature of the quasi-particle interference, it is very interesting to investigate the effects of the quasi-particles on statistics. we thank c . w . j . beenakker, v. cheianov, and a. koroliuk for valuable discussions. We have received a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation. Here we consider the commutation relations for the quasi-particle operators and for the tunneling operators (hi). We examine the commutation relations for the quasi-particle operator (hi). We consider the inverse relation, in other words, of the inverse in terms of the inverse in terms of the ratio xmath415; so the resulting quasi-particle operators create local excitations with the charge xmath414. Note that the operator (hi) has zero charge, that is, it creates local excitations with the charge xmath414 and the homogeneous density along the edge with total charge xmath414 . thus, after the low-energy excitation, we multiplied the quasi-particle operators by the factor xmath415, to cancel the contribution of homogeneous density . so, the resulting operators (hi) create local excitations with the charge xmath7 . It follows that in the microscopical limit of the thermodynamic limit, which is xmath422, a rectangular interferometer is put in place, and this gives the simpler expression: xmath423 in the thermodynamic limit, xmath422; this corresponds to an open mz interferometer, which leads to the simpler expression: xmath423 where the statistical phase takes the topological value. Interesting to note is that the operators of the two sides do not commute: xmath420, in other words, the quasi-polygon on the outer edge feels the presence of another quasi-polygon on the inner side. This is because the creation of a quasi-polygon on the inner side shifts quantum numbers, xmath424 and xmath425, and this is because the change of this number is a 'topological' effect which leads to the reconstruction of the wave function and the change of the chern-simmons field. Next, we are going to take a look at the commutation relations of the quasi-polygon operators. Many years ago we reported unexpected values of quasi-particle charges, determined by resonant noise measurements, in m. dolev, y. gross, y. c. chung, m. heiblum, v. umansky, and d. mahalu, arxiv: 0911 - 3023. Especially bad is the use of the word "frictionalization" in this respect: the corresponding process is completely classical. That is, in fact, quite similar to the current in electrical circuits. j. a. simmons, s. w. hwang, d. c. tsui, h . p. wei, l. w. engel, and m. shayegan, phys.
