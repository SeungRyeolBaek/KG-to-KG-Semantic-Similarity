During the last few years the application of gauge and gravity duality to hadronic physics attracted great attention, and several holographic dual models of qcd have been proposed (see e.g. , e.g. , e.g. , e.g. ) were discussed in the literature (see e.g. , e.g. , e.g. ) , these models have in their formulation such essential properties of qcd as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, and also many of the static static hadronic observables (dew, atoms, masses) with values of very close to experimental values. In this paper we will deal with the hard wall adducts / qcd model, where the confinement is derived by cutting off the ads space along the extra fifth dimension at a wall located at some finite distance , the adducts are drawn in a certain direction. In this manner, it is possible to find the form factors and the wave functions of vector mesons (the ref. @ xcite). a special class of dual models is called “bottom-up” (the so-called bottom-up approach) (see, e.g., @ xcite) and the aim of which is to reproduce the known properties of qcd by selecting the appropriate theory in the five-dimensional (55d) ads lot . However, we propose that, as in the case of the radius of the pion, it would be a bit to smooth the ir wall to make the pion less elastic. Our analysis involves the emplacement of two types of holographic wave functions, namely Xmath9 and Xmath10, which are conjugate to each other and almost like the analogous objects that we have studied in our paper Xcite, where we have studied vector mesons. Moreover, we will test the feasibility of expressing the form factor of the pion in terms of the two chiasms, and in particular the determination of the electric radius in various regions of the holographic parameters space. In this paper we will use the model described in xcite (hard-wall model) to obtain the form factor and the wave functions (and also the density function) of the pion. In ref. xcite the solution of the pion wave function was explicitly made for the @xmath6 limit. in ref. xcite, the solution of the pion wave function was explicitly written for the @xmath6 limit. In our analysis, we introduce and systematically utilize two kinds of holographic wave functions, xmath9 and xmath10, which are conjugate to each other and basically similar to the analogous objects of our study ref. xcite, where we have studied vector mesons. So we have the physics of the spheres of the vector and the pseudoscalar. At the end we have the physics of the pion-form factor in a large momentum transfer. The standard prescription of the holographic model is that the linear and radial currents are bound to the vector-gap sector of the h-model; the longitudinal component of the vector-gap sector is unphysical, and the only radial component is linked to the physical elements of the field. In this background the vector-gap modes correspond to the radial modes of the vector-gap field. However, since the gauge symmetry of the vector-gap sector is not broken, the longitudinal component of the vector-gap field is unphysical, and only the longitudinal component corresponds to physical mesons; a similar thing is true of the axial-gap mesons, which are the modes of the axial-gap field. therefore, it is necessary to take into account this, if we want to treat the pion in a standardized manner. In the holographic model of hadrons, the qcd resonances correspond to the kink-kaluza-ko (kk) excitations in the sliced ads. At the end of this projection, xmath20 corresponds to the pion field. The physics of the axial-gap and pseudoscalar sectors is described by the action of @ xmath22  ,  ,   end  ,  ] where @ xmath21 corresponds to the pion field. This higgs-like mechanism breaks the axial-vector gauge symmetry by bringing a mass term @ xmath32 dependent on the part of the lagrangian . . . in the context of the model of ref. Xcite, it is possible to derive the relation - Gell - M. renner, which gives massless pions in the Xmath6 limit. It satisfies eq.

(As for @ xmath117 we may define @ xmath119 as the fourier transform of the 4 dimensional field and @ xmath120 as the means of propagating from the boundary to the perimeter, satisfying the equation - xmath121 with b. c. @ xmath122 and @ xmath123. Further, there is only one particle in the expansion of bound states, namely the massless pion. Thus, we have @ xmath138 and, therefore, @ xmath139. , in the factor-inducing part of the equation (proj0)—then we have . . . . ____________________________________________________________________________________________ in the model of the derivatives of the figure.

You can easily see that @________. The pion-wave function @ xmath184 is a direct analog of the pion-wave function @ xmath184. It is written in terms of the @ xmath184 function, but if we adopt eq. (phiz) we can rewrite it also in terms of @ xmath181 in the sense of @ xmath180. Thus the @ xmath179 at the origin is proportional to the @ xmath180 decay constant @ xmath178, in experimental stipulations, namely, @ xmath180. It is to be noted that only the first term in square brackets is the same as our result @ xcite for the @ xmath181 and @ xcite for the radial distribution density of @ xmath181 to the conclusion of the fundamental equation of motion. [ ] It is necessary to achieve the proper normalization of the form factor in @ xmath183. This formula, combined with eq. (psi0) , establishes the relation, namely, with regard to @ xmath192, to @ xmath192, to @ xmath192, to the condensed parameter, namely,  xmath191     left ( frac   alpha  4   2   right)      left ( alpha  3  right)      left ( alpha  3  right)          left ( alpha  3  right)        left ( alpha  3  right) - fpi2 (or -     - 3 - 0    0  d    - zeta  cal j  cal j  cal j  (q , zeta , z 0 ) ,  rho (  zeta, z 0 )  ,  rho ( zeta , z 0 )   ,  end  em- i] ,    - aligned    ,  end  em- em- i ,  i , i - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - - 2 - a ,  end - aligned                  - He observed that the density of Xmath239 was more than two times greater than that of Xmath241; and, in that case, this result corresponds to the hard-wall model, that is, Xmath239 was essentially larger than Xmath219. This result was very close to the value of Xmath251 for Xmath252. These densities were quite close for Xmath239, but strongly different for Xmath240. Specifically, the density of Xmath239 was more than two times greater for Xmath241; which corresponds to the amorphous elasticity of the hard-wall model which resulted in a larger number of pions than xmath219. This result was very close to the value of Xmath253 for xmath239. According to Xmath243 and Xmath244, we obtain for the charge radius:  xmath249 ,  rho (zeta, a) =        ,    end    ] and explicit form of the density   end   ] At xmath260, the radius of a pion is 1.1 . 4 times larger than the radius of a pion, determined by xmath261 . This difference isn’t very large in terms of its linear size, for example, if you assume a 0.4 xmath214 — the corresponding value is 0.4 xmath266 — if we take a 0.4 xmath214 — then a 0.4 xmath268 — it becomes 0.5 xmath266 — in linear units, the difference isn’t very great, but just a minus 0 . . . , if we take a 0.5 xmath269, then the 0.5 xmath263 — thou wilt not look at the 0.5 xmath263 — in other words, for example, the difference between xmath263 and xmath270 was about a quarter of an inch bigger than the 0.5 xmath261 radius. . . . that is, for the case of xmath260, the radius of the pion is about one and four times larger than that of xmath260 — which is just 30.5 fm, in fact, but isn’t a fraction of a degree smaller than that of the hard-wall. But, furthermore, there may be some expectation that in a more realistic case of confinement the size of the pion will be larger. Such an expectation is confirmed by our soft-wall model of the electric radius, for which we got 2math260 - and that will be solved for in accordance with the experiment. - xmath278 and -  end  aligned  ] by using eq . - [fpiinfty] and then - - in the same way - in the Xmath286 area - the fixed term - xmath287 - - , that is to say - - xcite, that is, the infinite radius of the massless pion and the infrared - finite piece - xcite , that is, the infinite radius of the pion. In the case of ours, the logarithmic term for - xmath289 is about equal to - xmath284 , so that it almost doubles the result for - xmath228 . It is thus , if xmath269 is taken in the 'xmath269' region, we can express the coefficient in front of the square bracket in terms of - xmath199: - xmath282 in the 'xmath298' region is composed of two properties: a fixed term - xmath287 , and a logarithmically increasing term with -xmath195 , and - xmath289 - we can, more precisely, write - xmath269, the chiral logarithm term produces the extra 0 . It is the basic scale of the pion wave function in the local quark-horror duality model, the Q   pion interval. Note, however, that the contribution of xmath298 is quite visible in the experimentally interesting region xmath302: it is responsible for more than xmath303 of the form factor value in this region (and moreover, at xmath183 the xmath299 term contributes about 40 % to the normalization of the form factor) . _xmath305, the density 399 equals xmath306 at the origin, , if we assume that the density 399 equals 398 at the origin, then the asymptotic value is 399 at xmath310, and our hardline formula 395 is required. - The main contribution is the xmath298 term of the form factor integral (ff 2 ), while the xmath299 term contributes 300 as it is accompanied by extra  xmath301 . Note that the combination 397 often occurs in pion studies . It was given in our paper Xcite by the value of the mass of the reson mass of xmath317. it was shown in our paper Xcite that the form factor integral (calf00) is the lowest-bound state wave function, and @ xmath315  end-to-end propagating function of this oscillator-type model, is exactly equal to the magnitude of the oscillator-scale scale . . . , however, the relevant wave function (calf00) has the expected regularization, but the slope @ xmath325 of @ xmath326 at xmath245 is greater than that of the experimental jlab values @ xcite measured at xmath331 and 2 . . . . . . . , moreover, if we take xmath320 both for xmath321 and xmath322, the integral (calf00) gives @ xmath327 . . . and so exceeding by more than 25 % the experimental jlab values @ xcite measured for xmath328 and xmath328 . We will, however, discuss the results of the calculation of the equations of the two models in more detail. In this case, if the equations of the two models are incompatible with the large--@xmath245 data, it is possible that this is only an indication that the model is over-fitting. For this reason, the equations of the pion wave function are quite different from the one of the pion model at xcite. Unfortunately, the procedure of incorporating the chiral symmetry-breaking effects that were necessary for the hard-wall model of ref. xcite, will not work properly when applied to the ads/qcd model at xcite, which is the soft-wall model. As we have already seen in ref. xcite, the solution of the equation for the chiral condensate of the field in the pion model need to be proportional to each other and the mass parameter xmath8 must be proportional to each other, so that chiral condensate cannot be varied independently of xmath8 . This difficulty can be avoided by implementing the latest techniques (cf. cf. cf. cf. cf. cf. ). however, this question is not in the scope of the present paper. - consider a simple ansatz (see fig. [rhomod]) @ xmath341  ,  end  aligned  ] for @ xmath346 . - The slope of @ xmath348 at @ xmath183 is given by   end  aligned  ] with  xmath349 . @ xmath347 has the desired value for @ xmath347 and satisfying the normalization condition @ xmath345 . - To the estimated value of @ xmath348, the density of @ xmath348 is reduced, that is, by the simple homogeneous monopole of the density of @ xmath347, and therefore is in better agreement with the data . . . , he was about 10 % and 20 % more, respectively. There is a general reason. It is interesting to note that the density of the model which is providing this value has an enhancement for higher values of xmath32 (see fig. ( rhomod)) just as the density of the hard wall model (see fig. ( rhomod)) (see fig. ( rhomod)) is used, which is to say the density of the hard wall model (see fig. ( rhomod)) " Xcite explains the pion as a physical field or current, without specifying whether it is a combination of spin-1/2 fields, or scalar fields, etc. , for Xmath245 above 1gev Xmath328, the pion's atomic structure can be verified by an electromagnetic probe (which is a widely accepted belief) and may be necessary to describe the pion as a whole - if we do not express the pion as a whole. - We found an analytic expression for the decay constant of the pion. In this way we proposed a formalism which enables us to study the pion form factor in the framework of a holographic dual model of qcd. Our aim was to draw the pion's form factor in the framework of the holographic dual model of qcd. we, after adding a second (sturm-liouville) conjugate wave function (#xmath9, #xmath10) which describes the structure of the pion along the 5 * xmath357 dimension coordinate. These two terms are required for normalization of the form factor in Xmath361 . I will add that in the case of the hard wall, the pion's charge radius is basically calculated by @xmath370, i.e., as you may imagine, the pion's size is entirely determined by the confinement radius. In other words, the radius of the pion is directly proportional to the ratio of @xmath370. Nevertheless, for small @xmath370 the radius of the pion is calculated by @xmath370, which increases with every increment of @xmath195. unfortunately, there are not any barriers to the direct application of chiral symmetry to the d'qcd models. In the hyperbolic domain @xmath366 the pion decay constant is determined chiefly by @xmath362 and with negligible corrections due to the value of @xmath195 . However, for small @xmath 367 the radius of the pion is roughly calculated by @xmath370, which gradually increases with each increment of @xmath368. We have also discovered that the pion's charge radius @xmath374 is smaller than the experimental range. We are assuming that if the hard wall is pounded (it is always the case that the pion's mass is bigger) the pion's size can be increased by an amount sufficient to satisfy the data. - wall model as cited in ref. - xcite. - in ref. xcite we demonstrated that this ansatz was capable of providing an experimental value of the pion charge radius. - it was closely followed by data in the xmath375gev @ xmath328 region, but it is much too close to the xmath375gev @ xmath328 region , for this reason we argued that the xmath375gev @ xmath328 region is beyond the reach of the Advert and Quantity Models. The basic cause of this contradiction is very general: the asymptotic AD and QCD prediction for the pion form factor is @ xmath377, and if one takes the experimental value for @ xmath193 , then one obtains @ xmath378gev @ xmath328 , which is much larger than the 0 . 4 gev @ xmath328 value given by @ xmath376gev @ xmath328 jlab data.
