the shape memory effect is related to a reversible martensitic (darkness) phase transformation. This has been shown to be triggered by applied fields, temperatures, or both, and the mechanical properties of the materials can be controlled in accordance with their properties. many systems, including those studied in this article, are prone to form superelasticity, mainly because they can be used in stents and spectacle frames. in a first-principles model, the individual atoms are given explicit consideration and their interaction is given by an interatomic potential, which is empirically determined by the first-principles diffusion-functionality theory, or by a combination of the two. the individual-species model, the individual atoms are considered explicit and the interaction is defined by an interatomic potential, which can be obtained empirically from the diffusion-functionality theory, or by a combination of the two. The crystal symmetry and defect energies are derived from this method, which gives microstructures with natural lengths (from defect energies) and time scales (because the atoms have definite newtonian forces and masses). Nevertheless, the electronic degrees of freedom are not explicitly revealed. First-principles diffusion methods are so computationally intensive that direct studies of microstructures are impossible, but they are valuable for obtaining quantitative information on energy, forces, and stresses from the atoms, without the assumption of any experimental input, and for determining the electronic origin of the phenomenon. The symmetry of the phonons determines the symmetry of the low-temperature structure. In previous studies of pdti and ptti, we have shown that the electronic and elastic properties of the pdti and ptti structures are well reflected by density functional theory calculations, and if the pdti is, if the structure was experimentally determined, the pdti-formula consists of simple cubic xmath2 structures (in space Xmath3 structures) while the ambient temperature   martensitic  , ,  martensitic 2 structure is described as orthorhombic  xmath2 structure  xmath0 structures  xcite (space :                 2 structure   2 >    - martensitic   220 , 1 it is reported as orthorhombic  2   2 structure     1> structure      , et i. in this paper we investigate the structural entropy of pdti and pti, with first principles calculations of phonon frequencies and total energies. . . . for the example, with the Vienna ab initio simulation package @ xcite, with the perdew- zunger and the local density approximation (lda) . the electronic wave functions were represented in a plane-wave basis with a kinetic energy of 278 ev. the brillouin zone (bz) integrations were performed by the hermite-gaussian smearing technique @ xcite, using a smearing parameter of 0 . 1 . the brillouin zone (bz) integrations were carried out by the hermite-gaussian smearing technique @ xcite, with the smearing parameter of 0 . 1 . . the brillouin zone (bz) bz () was calculated using a deuterium-sparing bz (mp) @ xmath7 point mesh for the simple cubic cell, 88 @ xmath10 points in the @ xmath12 irreducible bz of the orthorhombic cell, and 576 @ xmath13 irreducible bz of the monoclinic cell. . the smearing of the brillouin zone (bz) was calculated by the hermite-gaussian smearing technique @ xcite, with the smearing parameter 0 . 1ev. The hypersensitive pseudopotentials of pd, pt, and ti were obtained according to a modified rappe-rabe-kaxiras-joannopoulos (rrkj) scheme, with three bessel functions of xcite. these parameters produce phonon frequencies that are converged within five microseconds. The brillouin zone (bz) integrations were carried out by the hermite gaussian smearing technique of xcite, based on a 56-k point mesh (corresponding to the regular divisions of the @xmath15, @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes) in the @xmath11 irreducible wedge. In a whole phonon-dispersion relation the proportions of phonon frequencies were converged in 5 xmath19 . , a second-order voltage was fixed at xcite. VAP is a highly efficient method for calculating the total energy, forces and stresses, and relaxing to the minimum energy structure, but does not have the density-functional perturbation theory capabilities of pwscf/phonon. The choice of two different first-principles codes was based on the strengths of each. the kinetic coefficient was 408 ev . The imaginary values of the unstable claddings are plotted in negative. The results are in excellent agreement with flapw results of 3 . 113 (pdti) and 3 . 127 (pdti) and in good agreement with experimental values of 3 . 18 and 3 . 17. phonon cladding relations along the high symmetry lines, calculated at the theoretical lattice parameters, are shown in Fig. [v] - phonon cladding relations along the high symmetry lines, determined at the theoretical lattice parameters, are shown in Fig. [v] - phonon cladding relations for pdti and pti (upper) in the structure at lda@xcite calculated at the equilibrium parameters of 3 . 112 and 3 . 125, respectively. The negative slope of the acoustic curve corresponds to an elastic instability (at xmath23) . The imaginary frequencies of the unstable forms are calculated as negative values . . . It must be noted that the phonon frequency at xcite is not the reciprocal of the period of oscillation of this mode (as measured by molecular dynamics) nor the energy difference between adjacent quantum levels (as measured by neutron scattering experiments) . These three quantities are equal only for a stable harmonic crystal. The eigenmodes of the force-constant matrix describe the potential energy landscape, and a negative eigenvalue indicates static instability in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector. While the actual normalized displacements of these eigenmodes are in general somewhat different, they carry the same symmetry labels as the eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix. however, the general normalizations of these eigenmodes are in general slightly different, they bear the same symmetry labels as those of the dynamical matrix. phonon dispersion relations shown in figure [phonons] illustrate phonon instability, similar to and even stronger than niti @xcite. The calculated phonon dispersion resembles and even surpasses the apparent phonon instability of pdti and ptti, both of which are dynamically stabilized by anharmonic phonons, and should be characterized by large local distortions. In the soft mode approach, we search for local energy minima by choosing an unstable mode, freeze in a distortion with varying amplitude, and relax the structure. These choices are normally suitable for a calculation of atomic displacements, and the calculation of the equations based on chemical hcp will be further strengthened below. The structure of phonons, as shown in Figure ; phonons, shows an instability of the structure of the structures of the form @xmath2 as compared to and even stronger than the one with the niti counterpart. In the present case, the undistorted doubled cell contains two equal and opposite xmath30 planes, each of which is unstable to strain-dependently clumping at all xmath24 points. In the simplest form of this eigenmode of the doubly degenerate phonon in the xmath2 structure, the simplest mode of the xmath2 structure is Xmath31, which decreases the symmetry to monoclinic Xmath32; in the resulting xmath1 structure, three additional free parameters are obtained, the monoclinic angle of Xmath33, and two internal parameters of Xmath34 and xmath35, . . . the fact that, in the chemically ordered analog pd/pt, the observed phase transition is to Xmath0 rather than xmath27, thereby shows the importance of the anharmonic effects and strain coupling in the energy of these materials. The soft mode approach has no guarantee that the energy (reducing ice) of a single unstable mode will affect the other unstable modes of the high-symmetry structure. , the present case shows two rows of (110) @ xmath28 planes, each of which is unstable to the strain-resolved shuffling at all q- points . . . The relative energy of the relaxed structures is given in table [Table 9] . we consider one more structure: in the special @xmath1 values @xmath39 and @xmath40, orthorhombic symmetry is restored. , the side of the conventional cell of this body-centered orthorhombic (bco) structure (space group @xmath41) structure is doubled in the b-shape, though the primitive cell contains four atoms. This is why in the earlier calculation for the @xmath0 energy, the @xmath0 energy was reported as the minimum energy structure. The proportions of the different refractory structures are given in table (Table: Structure). The relative energies of the various tissues are given in Table [Table: Structure] . a simple, compact xmath36 figure is given, which suggests a difference of 108k (pdti) and 1755 (pti) for pdti and pti, respectively. The low computed difference between @xmath1 and @xmath1 is at an angle of 001 and has a lower energy, but it is found that @xmath1 has slightly higher energy than xmath0. In keeping with the timescale separation between bulk strain and atomic motion, we define intermediate configurations by relaxing the atoms to the minimum energy configuration consistent with the symmetry and the strain on the cell. For the @xmath2 structure, we minimize the energy assuming the @xmath0 space group, and thus allow a smooth evolution of the structure along the pathway. In view of the analogy with the nw mechanism for the bcc-hcp transition, we can think of the transition as a shuffling of (110) @xmath30 planes ... bco ... from figure pdti ... it is clear that there is no absolute energy barrier along the @xmath2 - @xmath0 - @xmath1 path, and that the boundary between @xmath0 martensitic atoms ... - from figure pdti - pti - pti ... d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - pti - and d - pti - pti , the ti - d - d - d - d - d - d - pti - The free electron like Similarly to niti - xcite, the whole branch of phonons is unstable . . . in our study, we proposed that the structure of pdti and ptti was pdti xmath1 , with the (observed) pdti and ptti phases to be (pdti) xmath1; the oscillation to xmath1 corresponds to a more exact deformation, which leads to a phonon of the xmath0 phase . The atom movement of these instabilities indicates that they are both related to the shears of the alternate pdti phases, and therefore that the transition is the binary equivalent of the nishiyama-wassermann bcc-hcp mechanism . Moreover, we thank r. d. james, i. i . naumov, and k. bhattacharya for their valuable discussions. In contrast to niti-pdti, the entire pdti branch is unstable. We show that the structure of pdti-xmath1 is obtained by a freezing of the phonons of the xmath2 structure, corresponding to the shear associated with the elastic constant of the xmath48 elastic constant, but that no dynamical matrix or force-constant-matrices eigenvector leads to the low-symmetry phase. — flapw calculations were performed with a 120 k mesh in the irreducible wedge . . . no shape approximations were made to the density or potential . . . no estimations of the volume or potential . . . the muffin-tin radii were chosen to be 1 . 343 and 1 . 278 , coincidentally . . . the tetrahedron method was used in the brillouin zone integrations.
