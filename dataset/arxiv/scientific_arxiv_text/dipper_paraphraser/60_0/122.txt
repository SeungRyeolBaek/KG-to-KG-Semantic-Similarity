There has recently been an idea on the possible application of topological superconductors to quantum information processing. Moreover, a unified quantum information device, qubit, is formed and propagated by means of majorana (as shown, for example, by the tunneling current of the topological superconductor s-to-normal metal n-to-s junction, and the interval of the jest current in s-to-n-to-s junctions . . . in which the symmetry of the two majoranas , formed between two superconductor axs and a metal axs, separated by a barrier, a majorana, in the junction between two majoranas, formed between two topological axs or one-dimensional superconducting nanowires separated by a barrier, is compelled to be shortened by the concentration of the minoranas at the two sides of the junction . Recently, based on recent investigations, one can thereby identify the various detection mechanisms of such a majorana: the presence of a central peak in the tunneling current between the topological ax (s) and normal metal ax junction, and the fractional period of the josephson current in s-n-s junctions. According to this concept, the qubit can be formed and propagated by means of majorana (see, e.g., ref. ). This effect was predicted by kitaev et al. , for an ideal model of an 1d p-wave superconductor . Now it has been demonstrated that the effect of the josephson current may be realized in the edge of a quantum spin hall insulator. recently published research has shown that a topological insulator bonded to a s-wave superconductor exhibits a superconductivity-mirror duality with a superconducting polarity, and it is possible to show the fractional polarity not only with the superconducting phase, but also with the orientation of the zeeman magnetic field. The integration of the josephson current, which is carried by electrons, is carried by electrons rather than by cooperating pairs. The effect has also been extended to other systems . In addition, it has been shown that a fractional polarity mediated by with the @xmath14 periodicity has been shown at the edge of a quantum spin-ring insulator . those recent studies have shown that a topological insulator based on proximity to a superconducting s-wave superconductor exhibits a superconductivity-magnetism duality in which the superconducting phase is dominated, and the fractional polarity in response to the different magnetic fields in a topological insulator . However, the role of the spin- orbital coupling and external connections is much less well understood. The josephson effect in this case is constituted of a topological insulator whose junction is s-n-s and normal n-s. These works also show a signature of majorana bound states at the s-n-n edges, producing a fractional polarity with x-mat so-tse, dso-tse , dso-tse, so-tse , ns-tse-tse - a general method of investigation on junctions with zeeman magnetic fields and spin-to-oss coupling . - to junctions with zeeman magnetic fields and the spin-to-oss coupling of spin -seo-tse. In sec. . sec. , we describe the model and present a form of hamiltonian hamiltonian hamiltonian hamiltonian . - In sec. . sec. , we describe the model and present a clear form of hamiltonian hamiltonian . - to sec. . sec., a few asymptotic expressions for the energy of the andreev in the relative tonalities and on the magnitude of the soi., . - for instance, in the absence of the magnetic fields, the energy gap between these bound states decreases with increasing rashba soi constant, and eventually reached level crossing, and in the absence of the soi, it exhibits a resonant phase with an angle of @ xmath15 . , - . in the presence of soi (for @ xmath8) and external radiation, we show that the size of the resulting shapiro steps in such a system can be enlarged by the varying of the xmath2 . Then we assume the reversal is induced by two proximate s-wave superconductors, which is responsible for producing pairs of potentials x-math17 and x-math17 in the two wires. ' The hamiltonian is given by 'X-math19,' where 'x-math' is the hamiltonian of the nanowire in the presence of external magnetic fields, 'x-math' is the rashba soi.

In the following section, we will obtain the andreykov bound states for the junction of two nanowires described by eq. (h-sc) . Here the third subscript of the annihilation operator (which we shall name henceforth as @ xmath41) identifies the right-moving and the left-moving quasiparticles, respectively, while the index . . . denotes either right-moving or left-moving superconductor . It is known that a magneto-Josephson effect in a topological insulator is known to have occurred in the presence of the additional quadratic kinetic energy of the electrons. note that the hamiltonians acquire a duality of magnetism and superconductivity at xmath54 without kinetic energy, implying that it is unalterable under the transformation xmath55. But we will observe that in the case of the system we study the magneto-Josephson effect has occurred even in the presence of the additional quadratic kinetic energy of the electrons. The energy spectrum of quasi-particles in a bulk superconductor in the presence of soi and external magnetic fields, and its expression in different asymptotics, is calculated in Appendix [APP] . note that in our case all energies are measured by the fermi energy; and thus, the condition for a topological superconducting phase with effective @ xmath56 + wave pairing is @ xmath57 + . . . , the boundary conditions @ xmath63 are met by @ xmath63 and the transmission coefficient @ xmath64 is expressed by @ xmath65 as @ xmath66 . , the bogolyubov-de-Gennes equations for the superconductors in the right and left parts of the barrier are written as @ xmath59, where @ xmath60 is the bdg-wave function . The external magnetic field splits electrons into spin-up and spin-down (eqs. (e011 and k011)), and the amplitudes of the electron wavefunction are distributed across four fermi points, which leads to the superposition of the right and the left moving particles. Hence, the bdg wavefunction @ xmath60 can be written as a linear superposition of its right and left moving components, around each fermi momentum, and with two different spins. For the following, the equations of the wave functions, namely, bc, are obtained. Assuming the a-rly curves of bdg (h ) with h2 , are formed, the following, the value of xmath (n a) and xmath (n a) . . . which is represented by the inverse of xmath, a-rly, and -rly, in terms of the h-b-b-b-c, to a– -79, and - o-b-c with - o-b-c (c) for arithmetic, and in terms of a-rly, a-rly, a-rly, a-rly, a-rly, a-rly, a-rly, a-rly, and a-rly-needs to - the energy of the andreyev, and then @ -mm1 for clarity, the-energy of the andreyev bound state is derived from @ -mm2 for clarity. , in accordance with the equations xmath91 and xmath92, one chose four equations that correspond to an electron-hole pair with opposite spins.                                                                                                                           non-umber ( 1  d)     non-umber ( 1  d)  left [ It is clear that the condition to determine the andreev energy in this region, where @xmath82 comprises two @xmath94 blocks, is given by equating @xmath103 with equation to zero. . . . note that the other four equations yield the same expression, with only the addition of sputter and a change of direction leading to @xmath103. . . . Note that, in eq. (f . . . f . ) we calculate all possible ratios @ xmath106, xmath107, and xmath108, xmath109. It is easy to see that the condition for the determination of the andreev energy in this limit, where xmath82 contains two xmath94 blocks, is given by equating the energy of the equation to zero . . . (f . ) Here we note from eq. . . . . , (f . ) that the dependence of these equations on xmath30 and xmath33 are completely eliminated by transforming the wave function to xmath112 , in this transformed form, the ratios, which are indicated on the left-hand side of the equation, are a thousand and a half, and the same of each other, the ratios - dagup - up That is, since the ratios entered the expressions of xmath116, they also represent andreev and normal reflection processes, with electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles in the opposite (@ xmath117) and same (@ xmath118) spin sector. The ratios of eq. (wa-up-down) are determined from eq.

This result is Xmath132, and all other ratios disappear. Our formalism reproduces the earlier result in the literature in this limit. Compared with the tunneling channel of the main tunnel, an electron-like quasiparticle with a given spin is andreev reflected to a hole-like quasiparticle state with the same spin. Note that @ xmath137 is given by @ xmath137, where the upper (lower) signs correspond to @ xmath143, the ratio for xmath142 is calculated from eqs. - (feqss) and - (energy0). These ratios can be used to get @ xmath145 as @ xmath145 , and thus our formalism reproduces the earlier result in the literature. The main channel in the absence of the magnetic field is an electron-like quasiparticle with a given spin polarization being andreev reflected to a hole-like quasiparticle state with the same spin . —— ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— Assuming the sum of e011 and e011 (against e011), a thermoelectric spectrum and momentum in this region, given by @xmath158, are of the following order: first, the curve for @xmath165 decreases with the increase of the magnetic field.

Hence, we note that the particle-like and the hole-like branches touch at zero energy; in order to investigate the possibility of a zero energy mode, which may create a 'square wave' component of the josephson current in the landau-zenner sense, we introduce a dimensionless magnetic field - xmath219, whose solutions read @ xmath201 - where ==213 . But as we have already mentioned, these two features could have their effect on the ratio of xmath232 and xmath232, as if the potential of the coupled and charged particles were with the same wavelength, and therefore the amplitude of the energy oscillations would increase with xmath232, and, on the other hand, the character of the dependence on xmath232 is changed. In fig. . . . - where the dependence of the spin energy branch on xmath33 at different xmath232, we see that the modulation of the amplitude of the energy oscillation increases with xmath33, and likewise the character of the dependence around xmath237 is changed.

The step width is expressed in terms of @ xmath305, as @ xmath305                                   ( As you can see, the results of approximations ([swidthso]] and [swidthso] show that the shapiro step width is increased with @ xmath2 in comparison with swidthso . The accumulated dependence of the shapiro step width on the spin-oscillation coupling can be used for experimental measurements of its value. Description = fig: ", height = 188], at xmath206, without radiation (Curtain, A), at xmath206 without radiation (Curtain, B), height = xmath206 [4] to investigate the effect of soi on the amplitude dependence of the shapiro step width, we have calculated the i-v curve of the junction of the circumference with equation Acjos1 . , we can see that the difference disappears at the limit of xmath312. . . . As a result of the analysis of the effect of soi on the amplitude dependence of the shapiro step width, we have calculated the i-v curve for the junction under external radiation, and the result is Fig. . . . The parameter i has a significant effect on the width of the step, and its dependence on the amplitude of external radiation. . . . . to distinguish and explain the effect of a soi, we have calculated the dependence of a soi on @xmath215 and the dependence of a soi on @xmath318, @xmath313, _xmath314, height = 226] the transparency coefficient @xmath64 is also responsible for the critical current value. In our study, we have developed a theoretical method to study the side effects of a soi and a zeeman field. In this manner, we conclude that our study is based on the relationship of a soi and a zeeman field. The presence of the soi and a zeeman field produces four distinct fermi points in each superconductor. The existence of the soi and the zeeman field, therefore, reveals four distinct fermi points in each superconductor. This observation may be used to compare the results of a further experimental study. To test the validity of our work, we would need experiments on junctions in one-dimensional nanowires, analogous to those studied in ref. - . We predict that a variation in the angle of the in-plane magnetic field @ xmath30 would lead to a spin-joyson current, as shown in fig. - . furthermore, the ac-joyson effect measured in these junctions, analogous to those observed in ref. , should reveal a quadratic dependence of the shapiro step width as a function of @ xmath2 in a small @ xmath319, as shown in fig. . . . , we intend to pursue these issues in future work. - In the course of our work, we have studied the josephson effect in a junction between two 1d nanowires, in the presence of soi and zeeman fields . . . we predict that the variation of the angle @ xmath30 of the in-plane magnetic field @ xmath5 leads to the spin-joyson current, as shown in fig. . . . second, the formalism we developed here may be extended to the regime of strong @ xmath2 where the presence of majorana bound states shapes the characteristics of the bound state energies . third, the formalism may be extended to cases where the superconducting pair- potential is unconventional (for example, p-wave); indeed, the interplay of such unconventional pair- potentials and so coupling may lead to additional interesting characteristics in the josephson current . . . and we intend to In the second place we are considering a new limit for our study: ‘Peakhees’ (Ibid.) – id.
