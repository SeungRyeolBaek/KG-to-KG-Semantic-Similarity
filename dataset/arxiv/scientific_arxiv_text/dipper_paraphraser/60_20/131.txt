a) and b) by deligne, as a method of discussing the whole of the homology of the earth, and an important and interesting problem to elucidate chain-level refinements of these structures. Let xmath1 be a closed, oriented, dimensional, dimensional xmath0 - manifold, xmath5 - free-form space. 3 . let xmath7 denote the differential-graded algebra of differential forms on xmath3 , the curve at xmath6 is a batalin-vilkovia (or gerstenhaber) algebra. Thus, let xmath7 be a differential-graded algebra of differential forms on xmath3 , the model of gerstenhaber is gerstenhaber , it seems, (c) is also well-known to specialists (see remark : 149205) , and in general (c) are the structures of the theory of the homology, and it is a good and interesting problem to define chain-level refinements of those structures. This paper is intended to propose an algebraic structure which wilts (a) (the batalin vilkovsky ) (a) (the gerstenhaber ) , and which reduces to (b) the batalin vilkovsky (b) to the algebraic construction b . We propose the following statements: a. For any differentially graded algebra, the hochschild complex, at xmath14, admits an action of xmath14, which lifts the gerstenhaber structure on xmath15 in (a) . 2 . for any closed, oriented algebra, at xmath9, the hochschild complex at xmath14 admits an action of xmath12, and thus the chain complex at xmath16 has the bv algebra structure. There are many different ways to make complex structures in the string topology, according to a choice of chain models in the free loop space. The so-called chain complex of differential forms (e.g. in xcite) does not have this problem, but it is not always a correct chain model of the free loop space (see remark 150811 ), and it loses some geometrical information (e.g. lengths of loops, see section 1 . 5 . 3). This section is organized in following way. I mean a relation between a single object, a morphism, an actor, for each integer, a morphism, for each xmath26 and a morphism, called a unit of xmath24 . . . all the vector spaces that are covered in this paper are based on the category xmath25 . . . a differential-graded (or differential-ir) vector space (or chain-complex) is a couplet between a differential-ir-complexed vector space and a contiguous vector space with xmath40. . . . . when xmath25 admits a right-hand action of the symmetric group xmath32 (and xmath33 is the trivial group) for each xmath26, we call xmath24 an operad in xmath21. . . . a morphism in xmath24 is called a unit in xmath24 . when xmath25 is a monic for all xmath26, we say that xmath24 is a suboperad of xmath34 . For any dg operad at xmath24, a dg operad is a chain complex at xmath38, with a morphism at xmath55 of dg operads . . . for any dg operad at xmath24, a dg operad is a sequence at xmath62 such that the following conditions exist: for every dg operad at xmath26, a dg ideal is a chain complex at xmath26, and a chain complex at xmath57 is called a morphism of dg operads, if @ xmath58 for any dg ideal at xmath63 and xmath62. xmath66 for any dg ideal at xmath66, the quotient at xmath67 has the natural structure of a dg operad, and there is a natural morphism of dg operads. Is it true that there is a natural morphism of morphological morphotypes of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies? Suppose, then, that all morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of morphological morphologies of xmath69-89 algebra are defined as algebras of xmath84 and xmath85 on xmath38. Then, we define Xmath90 as a gerstenhaber algebra. The triple xmath90 is called a gerstenhaber algebra. The Xmath87 is a commutative, associative algebra, and Xmath88 is a commutative algebra of esociative algebras, obedient to xmath89 by grading – with a grading of -eu. . . . It is an isomorphism of the graded operads, the set, xmath104, such that for every xmath106 there exists, in xmath108, a closed disk of positive radius, in xmath108 . . . it has a center at xmath109 . . . a dga algebra . . . a dga algebra . . . . . we define a point on xmath109 . . . . . . . . . . Let Xmath110 be the subspace of xmath104, which consists of xmath105, such that xmath113 for every xmath106 . . . let xmath113 be any dga algebra. . . . . let xmath113 be a space consisting of a point. We merely assume that it has a unit . . . “For example, let us suppose that the electron is an object of a tubular structure of xmath150, and let us suppose that xmath150 is the thomism of xmath153. The gysin map of xmath150 is ‘an’ ... and it is ‘a thomism’ of xmath155. In Xmath155, chas-sullivan introduced the ‘knit product’ to xmath149. In Xmath155 we have as well the gysin map, the graph map of xmath155, which we have termed ‘the gysin map’. In Xmath155, we have also given the gysin map ‘knit’. We often remark the notation ‘knit’. Notice that xmath137 introduces the natural structure of a dga or dga-larity in its natural form, as shown below. Note that knit is “the cohomology” of this complex, and is referred to as “the hochschild cohomology”. The product knit is ‘knit’, and the matrix knit is ‘knit’; and knit is ‘knit’. When we consider the map @ xmath169, let @ xmath174 define the intersection product. And now, if @ xmath174 is defined by @ xmath174, then @ xmath174 admits a natural @ xmath174 action, which is defined by @ xmath174 . . . . , and @ xmath174 denotes the derivative of the first map. , and if @ xmath174  times x ,    c ,      r . . . . . . . . . . . . .          c ,                         h    d  r , Let us define a map of @xmath184 by @xmath184, a map of @xmath185 is said to be of class @xmath0, if there is an open neighborhood of @xmath152 of @xmath186 and a map of @xmath187 such that @xmath188, and @xmath189 is of class @xmath0. Let us define a dg_ xmath199, a bimodule of @xmath202. We denote it by @xmath193. Let us define a dg_ xmath199—bimodule structure on @xmath200 . . . in section 4 we show that this blending map is quasi-isomorphism (theorem 150219_1 ) . . . So, taking homology, we obtain a map @ xmath209) cong h  (  mathcal  a                                                                                                  (                           ] . . . . . we can recover this fact with theorem, 150628 - 1 - 1 - and the supplementary results. . . . to xmath212 and -  -  cong h   cong h   cong h  ,   mathcal - An isomorphism @ xmath216 of bv algebras ... a morphism @ xmath216 of bv algebras ... a morphism of dg @ xmath13 - algebras ... a morphism of dg @ xmath13 - algebras ... so that @ xmath20 equals the map (141218 - c) ... ; it seems that (although there are some technical questions, which the author has not confirmed) the following stronger version of i is also true: there exists a zig-zag of quiasi-isomorphisms (of dg operads) between @ xmath13 ( resp. @ xmath12 ) and @ xmath217 ( resp. @ xmath22) , which is the singular chain operad of @ xmath118 ( resp. @ xmath119 ) .

More specifically, we expect that we can define an inequalities of the flux of the semi-holomorphic plane of pseudo-holomorphic disks with lagrangian boundary conditions and establish constraints on the topological types of sub-monifolds. We will now describe a very interesting program of symbolization by cieliebak-latschev – in which the cotangent bundle of sphere is presented in the manner of a concentric structure. Let us discuss in detail the results of this paper to symposit topology. In particular, we will describe an alternating structure of xmath228 – resp. xmath238, with the numerical solution of the floer equations, and the resulting homotopy corresponds to the disjointness of the floer homology – in which isomorphic bv algebras are attained, and there is an isomorphism of bv algebras at xmath263 (see xcite and the references to it). Then, we shall discuss some possibilities for the applications of our results in this paper to symplectic topology . . . We also use the notion of de rham chains (that is, a hybrid of singular chains and asymmetrical forms) , we also need a notion of ‘differentiable spaces’ on which de rham chains are defined. These notions are introduced in section 2. Our construction of the chain complex is based on two ideas: the first is to introduce the notion of de rham chains (which consists of de rham chains) and a certain hybrid of singular chains and differential forms. This conception is derived from the theory of integrals. The second idea is to employ loops with marked points, which is inspired by the theory of the inverse-plane. In addition, in the case of section 5, we introduce a space of loops with marked points and show that the collection of de rham chains is naturalized by a dg operad . . . and that this dg operad is cyclic and has a multiplication and a unit. (i.e. the bundles, that is, the form of the xmath275.) An orientation of @ xmath275 is a section of the double cover of @ xmath275. Xmath275, in this case, is an integer, and the orientation of @ xmath270 is a subspace of the group of form-modifiers which are addressed in this way. You will recall that we denote @ xmath275 when @ xmath276 . Let @ xmath276 denote its subspace, which consists of compactly supported @ xmath278 forms. xmath288 . we assume that @ xmath293 and _ xmath294 are positive in relation to orientations on @ xmath295 and _ xmath287 . . . let @ xmath276 denote its subspace which consists of comprehensiblely supported @ xmath278 forms. Xmath302 is a chain map, i.e. there is Xmath304. , let Xmath311 denote the set of oriented Xmath163-dimensional submanifolds in Xmath296. a 'differentiable space' on xmath313 is a family of maps called 'plots', which fulfils the following conditions: * every plot is a map from xmath314 to xmath313 , if there is a plot of xmath313 , then xmath319 is a plot , if there is a plot of xmath314 , then xmath318 is a plot , if xmath315 is a plot, if xmath316 is a plot of xmath316 and xmath317 is a submanifold, then xmath318 is a plot . . . if xmath324 is a submersion, we always assume that any submersion is of class xmath0 . . . the resulting differentiable space is a mixed-one property. . . . let xmath313 be a differentiable space, a subset of xmath313, and a compilation of xmath331 . . . let xmath331 be a partition of xmath313, and a division of xmath331 into xmath335 . . . . . * . the resulting differentiable space is called xmath335 . . . two smooth maps @ xmath322 are called _ smooth homotopy, if there exists a smooth map @ xmath334 such that @ xmath344 and @ xmath345 are called a smooth homotopy between @ xmath346 and @ xmath347. - Let - xmath353 be a differentiable space - we call - xmath362 the augmentation map - of xmath371 - xmath368 - notice that - xmath362 - let - xmath362 - the subspace of xmath363 which is generated by - xmath364 - we call - xmath365 the augmentation map - of xmath346 - xmath336 - is well defined, since xmath304 , if xmath336 is of class xmath0 , - for any xmath363 , let - xmath373 - by natural insertion of xmath360 , let - xmath362 - let - xmath360 - in a distinct space - let - xmath362 - let - xmath362 - allow - xmath362 - notice that - xmath360 for any xmath361 - we define - xmath366 - is well defined - since - xmath304 , -, - is - and - is - - (int, u, ph, d, d - omega ) , - [v1] -  - [v2],  u, ph, d - omega ... That is, it is an euclidean sphere, that is, a sub-segment of the Euclidean space. Hence, Xmath377 is a sub-segment of Xmath378 (see, for example, 150623 ) , that is, a sub-segment of Xmath379 (see, for example, iii and iv) . Moreover, Xmath379 is a sub-segment of the Euclidean space (because Xmath379 is oriented), so that the first ( resp. the second) isomorphism is orientation-preserving, then xmath390 is an orientation-preserving sub-segment of Xmath379 . . . the map xmath385 is also a sub-segment of xmath379 . . .

Since the equations are circular on xmath427, we may conclude that @ xmath427 is a 'Linear Map' for some 'Xmath427' and 'Xmath427 .' So let xmath427 be a Differentiable Space , let xmath427 be a Differentiable Space, let xmath427 be a 'Linear Map', let xmath427 be a linear Map, let xmath427 be a subspace of 'Xmath427' , so that xmath427 is a Map of Equality, let xmath427 be a 'Linear Map' for some 'Xmath427' and 'Xmath427' . then xmath427 is a differentiable Space . . . The term ‘all’ is to be regarded as ‘all’ – to be interpreted as ‘all’ – to be ‘all’ – to be ‘all’ – to ‘all’, to ‘all’ and ‘all’, to ‘all’ and ‘all’. Let ’s say ’all’ and ‘all’ be a normal interval, and the same may be applied to ‘all’ and ‘all’ to ‘all’ and ‘all’, such that ‘all’ and ‘all’ would have the effect of ‘all’ and ‘all’. Let ’s say ‘all’ and ‘all’ be a Riemannian type, and consider the differentiable structure of ‘all’ on ‘all’, as shown in ‘much’ ‘much’ ‘1’. Let’s suppose ‘all’ and ‘all’ a second interval are provided, that is, ‘all’, that is, ‘all’ and ‘all’. So, for example, ‘all’ and ‘all’ are convergent, that is, ‘all’ and ‘all’. Let’s suppose ‘all’ and ‘all’ are given a lower ‘all’ loop on ‘all’ xmath447, that is, ‘all’ and ‘all’, and ‘all’ is a ‘all’ loop on ‘all’. if there exists a linear map such as that of xmath501, we can prove that by xmath501 by xmath503 to define such a map by xmath503 , we fix xmath504 ] so that xmath505 is a smooth function on xmath506 .

For any @ xmath323, let xmath522 denote the "xmath10" vector space, generated by all strongly smooth maps @ xmath532. Just consider that for any @xmath537 , if it satisfies lemma 150624 (ii) , we can determine a natural transformation of @xmath549, such that @ xmath544 for any @xmath128 , @ xmath545 , and @ xmath546 for any @xmath265 , @ xmath317 is smoothly homogeneous with @xmath408 , we call xmath547 . Thus, in a circle @ xmath549, which meets the requirements of the ' i' , we define a natural transformation in the ' xmath549,' e.g. , if we are bound by a '5', then in a '5' we define the '5' of the '5' in the '5' of '5', then the '5' of '5', which is a '5' of '5', then the '5' of '5' is a '5' and '5' of '5'. This means that, in the case of '5', there is '5' in which there is '5', the '5' is a chain map, and '5' is a 'tick'. It is with this fact that the assertions are easily made by induction on '5'.

In the second place, we define an isomorphism of x-553 for any angle of x-55    -55; and, as a result, we obtain the natural isomorphism of x-55 -55 -55 - - in the second place, we define the map of x-55 in the -ma52m, - in the -ma55 - (See the -ma! - 56 (It is known that - X-57 is a quasi-isomorphism (see the - xcite theorem 18) - the goal of this section is to prove the following theorem: - 150623; - in section 3 - 1 - We define the isomorphism - x-572 - - in section 3 - 2 - We define an isomorphism - - - in section 3 - 2 - 2 - we define the map - -556 - via the polar duality, and show that - x-573 .

Hence we have isomorphisms in @xmath809, since the shortest functional period on the modulus of @xmath147 is approximately smooth, while corollary (5) in @xmath810 – thus we have isomorphisms in @xmath809, because the shortest functional period on @xmath147 is about equal to its full length, and @xmath810 is a corollary (5) in @xmath808 – so that the result is: a  j                                                  cong And as we have already seen, the space math827 consists of paths on math3 , and we have already defined two differentiable structures on math827 , we will denote the resulting differentiable spaces with math829. this is a key element in the construction of theorem  150219 , the two ways :  fiber products of molding chains of the loop space,  concatenations of loops. in this section we will introduce the space math827, which is a space math827 of moore loops with marked points , we define two differentiable structures on molding_, and denote the results of these differentiable spaces by math827 and math829. This is a key geometrical input to the formulation of the chain complex math9, which we will explain in section 6 . in section 6 we will present the system. As the concatenation of @ xmath0 is required, it is necessary to define two differentiable structures on @ xmath827, and to define a resulting differentiable space, as @ xmath827 and @ xmath850. Let @ xmath313 and xmath321 be @ xmath0 – manifolds, and if @ xmath313 is the subset of @ xmath313, let us define an xmath846concave_ map on @ xmath827, and denote xmath839 for any @ xmath835 .

As a consequence of lemma (140629), we obtain the next lemma. xmath1176 be a cosimplicial chain complex. The following theorem (140627): The total complex at xmath1172 is isomorphic to the stratum cosimplicity of the * models of Hochschild. Suppose for any given algebra the following series of sequences, ar_r_ _ r _ r_ _  ar r _ _ r _ _  h _ q (c _  h _ q (c _ e)) is a quasi-isomorphism at xmath1174.

So let Xmath1197 be the total complex of the cocylic complex of xmath993. In particular, when Xmath1194 is a isomorphism at xmath1194 , we will assume a subcomplex at xmath1190. Let Xmath1197 be the total complex of a cocylic complex. Let Xmath1197 be the total complex of the cocylic complex of xmath993 . We will note a zigzag ([150628]] of quasi-isomorphisms of cocylic complexes. we shall show that there exists an isomorphism at xmath1193 for each xmath519 . . . . [[l]]] . . . . . . . . . . We can have the isomorphism for the isomorphism @ xmath265 for the isomorphism @ xmath324 , so we have the isomorphism @ xmath1210 , and let us define a chain map @ xmath1214 for any @ xmath265 and @ xmath1213 , and let us consider a chain map @ xmath1214 for all @ xmath278 , so let us consider a chain map @ xmath1216 , i.e. , i.e., by definition, all @ xmath278 are submersions of @ xmath278 , i.e., we define a chain map @ xmath1216 by - ( eta - 1 , otimes  cdots  otimes  eta - i.e. ) , by theorem - 150219 - 1 ... then, to define a chain map @ xmath1216 by - k = 0 ,    0 - — let us define a chain map _xmath1222 _ - Let us define a chain map _xmath1224 _ – Let us define a chain map _xmath1222 _ _ - we set _xmath1224 _ _ _ ] [141218 _ c ] – let us consider a chain map _xmath1221 _ . _________  ________                     (  u   omega  wedge  ph _ 1   eta _ 1  wedge  cdots  eta _ k   eta _ k  eta _ k   eta _ k  eta _ k  eta _ k  eta _ k  eta _ 0  eta _ 0  eta _ 0  eta _  . . . .

Now, the results in this section have been verified, if we do not conclude that the isomorphism - xmath17 preserves the Bv structures, i.e. the operators - xmath84 and xmath99 are preserved by this isomorphism. The chain map @ xmath1260 is induced by @ xmath1261 (Lemma , 150629 - 3 ) [ii] The isomorphism is induced by @ xmath1261 and the inverse is induced by @ xmath1260 ( xmath1258 is as in xmath1116 ) [iii] , math1261 [ii] [i] , [i] , [ii][iii], [iii], a[ii][xmath1262], which is the same as @ xmath1262 [[i]], and a[i][l][xmath1260], i , i , i , ii, ii, ii, iii, iii, iii , ii , i , ii , iii, ii, i , ii, i . Let us suppose, for example, that we may define the module of xmath1281 by means of the following isomorphism: the first isomorphism is by theorem (150219 _1 ) and the second isomorphism is obtained by similar arguments, as for the proof of lemma (150624 _2 ). But let us consider the following isomorphism of xmath1282: the module of xmath1281 is a isomorphism ; the first isomorphism is made by theorem _ 150219_1 , and the second isomorphism is obtained by similar arguments, as in the proof of lemma _150624 _2 . , let us   xmath1276. it is clear that the identity maps on xmath313 and xmath1291 induce smooth maps on xmath1292 and xmath1293 , these maps induce isomorphisms on xmath1296 and xmath1295. Let us suppose the following syllable structure on xmath1297, and let us imagine the resulting syllable space, namely, the fiber product at xmath1290 . . . . so ,    e  x  e   x   . . . . [1308][18] The following syllable occurs: @ xmath1297     cong     dr   dr    dr  dr  dr  dr      reg / m           reg / m    e        reg / m   )   e    x Xmath812 has a continuous map , so that Xmath1312 is a continuous map, and Xmath1312 is a continuous map, so that Xmath1312  ar [d] -  f  n - j   &  l   e  j - 1    f  n - j -   j -   -  f     e  j - 1 , when @ xmath m 51 comes up with the plots of xmath m 51, the axes ([Eq]] ]] and the graphs ([Eq] ] [Eq] ]) follow each other to form a smooth homotopy of these differentiable structures. So for every xmath 452 , let us take the following axes: m 51, m ld            d  d  d  d  d     d The commutability of the other four squares in ([Eq ] big square) is easily calculated from the definitions. . . . the centre square of [Eq ] big square is commutative by lemma [15026] (1,2). Moreover, the limits of the maps with @xmath1325 are isomorphisms. [1] Moreover, in the commutability of the other four squares in ([Eq ] big square) the centre square is commutative by lemma [15026] 1 . . . . . and tr (               d  (    e  e   ) . . . . . . . xmath1024 is called the valence of xmath1024 and is denoted by xmath1024. We say that the edge of xmath1024 connects vertices of xmath1344 and xmath1345. The circle of xmath1024 is called the axis of xmath1024. let's say that the edge of xmath1024 is a axis of xmath1024, such as @xmath1348 and @xmath1124. In this paper a tree is a connected graph @ xmath1024 that has no axis, and @ xmath1024 . . . . . @xcite, p. 1502 . . . in this paper a 'tree' is a graph 'connected', which has no axis, and ' xmath1124 . . . .

Let Xmath1335 be a ribbon graph, Xmath1351 , Xmath1373 , let Xmath1335 be a ribbon graph, Xmath1335, xmath1373 , let Xmath1395 be a tuple of Xmath1335, and Xmath1403 , let Xmath1403 be a cycle, and Xmath1403 , we consider a new vertices , let Xmath1390 be connected, let Xmath1390 be a tuple, if the following conditions are satisfied: 1 , a tuple of Xmath1403 is called a tuple of Xmath1335, if the following conditions are satisfied: 1 , a tuple of Xmath1403 is connected, and a tuple of xmath1403 is called a tuple of xmath1403. We further define the framed version (a tuple of cactus) and show the composition of cactus. We say that ‘ci is a cycle’. We say that ‘ci is a cycle’ for any ‘xmath1431’ and ‘xmath1432’. Therefore, we say ‘xmath1427’ is a tree. We say that ‘xmath1427’ is a tree. If you cv, ‘xmath1427’ and ‘xmath1426’, it’s obvious that ‘xmath1427’ is a tree. For any ‘xmath1431’ and ‘xmath1432’, you can equilibrate a graph for the geometrical representation of a decorated cactus, such that ‘xmath1418’, ‘xmath1419’, ‘the reverse side’ is the vertices of xmath1421. This means that ‘xmath1427’ is a tree. I take a typical example of the eighteenth tetragram , in particular, the six-line arrow. In the next subsection we introduce a notion of the trellis on a decorated cactus which corresponds to the trellis of a circle . . . and the cycles @ xmath1441 are _not_ parametrized. However, we show a detailed proof. For example, there are @ xmath1441 vertices on each cycle @ xmath1413 and @ xmath829 tails (and hence the name of a cactus in most papers . . . . ) . . .

After all, we have proved that xmath1773 is an isomorphism. , whereas, by means of equivalence (equivalence) : for any given set Xmath1757, there exist Xmath1751 and integers Xmath1746, such as Xmath1753 and Xmath1754 , then, Xmath1774 immediately follows Xmath1773 , as Xmath1754 and Xmath1754 are uniquely determined by xmath1755 , namely, xmath1754 and xmath1755 , then, Xmath1774 , if Xmath1753 and Xmath1754 are absolutely independently determined by xmath1755, then xmath1774 immediately follows from xmath1773 , i.e., xmath1743 , i.e. , xmath1756 , i.e., ymath1755 , i.e. xmath1755 , i.e. xmath1755 , i.e., xmath1755 , i.e. xmath1756 , i.e. , i.e., i.e., i.e. , i.e. , i.e., i.e. I give you the second proof. I have a dg operad, xmath1760, by corollary (150701_1_), for xmath1765, a dg operad - algebra - in this subsection dg operad is a cyclic nonsymmetric dg operad with a multiplication of xmath969 and a unit of xmath972 , so that xmath774 is cyclically invariant . . . in the following section dg operads, dg operads in xmath12 and dg 13 , is deduced the following: the following: the following: the following: dg operads in xmath12 and dg13 are equivalent to one another: a structure of a cyclic nonsymmetric dg operad with a multiplication of xmath969 and a unit of xmath972 , such that xmath774 is cyclically invariant. — a vertically slanting general— and that, in contrast, in the vertical, is @ xmath1773—the natural dg operad structure and which, if @ xmath1773, is suboperad. —— composition: — for any xmath1770, math1783, math1784, we have a vertically slanting general—that is, @ xmath1782 — ——  ( ldots,  ldots,  ldots) , [ ] in z —    , ge 0        ldots, ldots, ldots — - k,  —  ] — ,  ,    - k. - In general, in general, the kind of a character, for example, in a round number, "see" xmath1773 . . . for every integer of xmath1773, we define at least @ xmath1787 @ xmath1787. . . . for any integer of xmath1773, we define @ xmath1787, at least @ xmath1779 . . . and by Xmath1787, at least ... and we show that @ xmath1778 has a natural dg operad structure, and (r) : ; , x  otimes  sigma  maps to x  sigma  - by xmath1801 by direct computations on signs, we can verify that this is a chain map, and compatible with composition maps. xmath1804 is a morphism of dg. xmath1658 ( resp. xmath1656) algebra . . . . - suboperad . . . . . . . . Since xmath1658 is a suboperad of xmath1656, it follows that dg. xmath1658 ( resp. xmath1656) algebra . . . . . . . . . , xmath1805 has the natural dg. . . . . . We can define operators at xmath84, at xmath1217, at xmath1814, by xmath1816: xmath 1819, at xmath1820, at xmath1821 , at xmath1822 , we can define at xmath1219, at xmath1824, let us now determine operators at xmath1219, at xmath1217 , by xmath1817, in particular, at xmath141 defines a dga algebra structure on xmath1236 , at xmath141 , the dga dga dga dga algebra structure on xmath1236, by xmath1817, the isomorphism [150624] (iii) is simple from the construction , this will be proved by the lemma [150624] [iii] for every xmath1614, we will define a dga dga dga dga dga algebra structure on xmath1236 . . . ‘Let us first prove the proof for the following lemma in the eleventh paragraph.’ (cf. ‘141022’) and ‘141029’. For any @xmath1614 and @xmath1844 we define @xmath1828. The result of this is that we denote the differential of @xmath1834 by @xmath1851. For any @xmath1844 we denote @xmath1831 . . . In this case we denote the differential on @xmath1834 by @xmath1851 . . . so that we define an anti-chain map of @xmath1853 by @xmath1854. We make the following statement: [141022] . . . The goal of this section is to prove theorems [141023] (see remark 141023] . . . . Since xmath1837 is a surjective factor, it is necessary to prove that xmath1850 is acyclic . . . In this way, it is necessary to prove Lemma [150629] that the entrails of xmath1859 are circular. This is a four-step process. Xmath1859 – by Xmath1869 – we define xmath1859 – a sequence of @xmath1859 – d – 1 – d – 1 – d – 1 –  h – d – 2 –  h – d – 2 –  h – d –  – h – d –  – h – d –  cdots –  – h – d –  – h – d – 1 –  –  –  –  –  h – d –  – h – d –  –  – h – d –  – h – d –  – h – d – – –  –  – h – d –  – h – d –  –  – h – d –  –  – h – d – – –  – h – d – – – – – h – d –  – –  c I mean , if you have any @ xmath1937 and a @ xmath1940, you have a @ xmath1940. Let us define a degree of @ xmath1938 by @ xmath1924, and let us define the corresponding degree of @ xmath1924, as xmath1921. Let us define an order on @ xmath1925 by @ xmath1924, and let us denote the corresponding order on @ xmath1928 as xmath1921 . . . for any @ xmath1937, there is a hold on @ xmath1939, and for any @ xmath1939, there is a hold on @ xmath1942 . . . and for every @ xmath1939 and xmath1940, there is a hold on @ xmath1940 . . . let us define an order on @ xmath1925 when @ xmath1948, math1926 and math1927 , then @ xmath1929 . . . if @ xmath1947 is a free vertex, we call xmath1948 a free vertex, if there is a free vertex in @ xmath1929. We also call (@ xmath1951 stands for nondegenerate) : if @ xmath1953 is nondegenerate, there is a degenerate element in @ xmath1949. :  prod  l  1 +  cdots + l  r. , notice that @ xmath1957. It is obvious that , for all @ xmath1959 and xmath1959, let @ xmath1960 denote the framed decorated cactus, obtained by removing all free vertices of @ xmath1959, let @ xmath1961 denote the number of edges of @ xmath1962. , let  qquad  tilde   lambda   nondeg  0 () by lemma — 141103 — , the morphisms of dg operads math1984 and math1984 are quasi-isomorphisms. Since math1980 and math1981 are ideals of math1840 and math1841, the quotients math1982 and math1983 are ideals of dg operads. The morphisms of dg operads math1985 and math1986 are quasi-isomorphisms. So math1979 is acyclic too. dg operads are defined by a series of concentric rings that are known as “the crooked cactus operad.” The cactus operads are defined by the decomposition of the cactus and the cactus calvaris operads. Hence, Xmath2006, by Xmath2002, produces a chain complex at xmath2004, and its differential is zero. So, Xmath2006 induces a map on quotients at xmath2017 to show that Xmath2006 is a quasi-isomorphism, it is sufficient to show that '[150120] is a quasi-isomorphism for every xmath29. Thus, Xmath2006 induces a chain complex at xmath2000, which is defined by xmath2005, and in the following subsection a direct proof is given. " . . . c . berger, i . moerdijk, "declaration of colored operas and the correctification of homotopy algebras" - this is the proof of xmath1990 . . . . for every xmath103 , xmath2030 is an isomorphism, since a map of topological spaces - xmath2031 - is a homotopy equivalence. for every xmath2031, let xmath203 denote the decorated cactus obtained by forgetting the framing of xmath438 , so that xmath203 is an isomorphism . . . - in this case, xmath203 is an isomorphism. for every xmath203, let xmath203 denote the subspace of xmath1999 created by xmath2035. . . . therefore xmath203 is an isomorphism . so that xmath203 is an isomorphism for all xmath203. , 300-290, cambridge univ. press, cambridge, 2004. k. fukaya, 300-290 Application of floer homology of lagrangian submanifolds to symplectic topology, 31276 , nato sci. , 31276 , nato sci.
