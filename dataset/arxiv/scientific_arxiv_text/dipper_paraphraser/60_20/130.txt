In the same way that mayor et al. (1997) survey of 107 gk dwarfs, he found no companions that were Xmath9 = -80 m @ Xmath6 - xmath10 (marcy & butler 1998) - the magnitude of the semimajor axes was less than a hundred, the least being a hundred, the most common being a hundred, he thought, the yellow dwarf. So this 'floating-receptor' of planets surrounded by their host stars, seems to be a real effect, but it is supported by the selection effect, which favors the detection of small orbits - so that in a gaseous protoplanetary disks the jupiter mass of planets is brought closer (lin et al. 1995, artymowicz 1997, levison et al. 1998). Thus, the lark-brown dwarf' companions occur with a frequency less than xmath111 %, in xmath111 % (marcy et al. 1998) - with greater frequency than xmath111 % (marcy et al. 1998). this lark-brown dwarf' companions occur with a frequency of less than xmath111 % within 5 .2 - 866.

Pâtism statistics of photons dominate the velocity errors for this relatively faint (v = 10 . 1), star. The lick and keck orbital periods have a ratio of 0 and 0 d, and the eccentricity is 0 . . . 33 @ xmath19.11 The joint orbital period is xmath19.03 d, and the eccentricity is xmath2 = 0 . . . and the minimum mass is xmath19. A general estimate of the velocity error in the two observational periods is given in the following table, from the combined data set. the independent keplerian fits were obtained from the lick and keck data sets, and the resulting curves and orbits are shown in Figures 1 and 2. the Xmath19-1 and Xmath19-5 time zones were made by combining the two observations and adjusting the distance in the keplerian fit (see 3), yielding a minimum in the xmath19 statistic. In addition, the doppler measurements of gliese 876 at haute provence (delfosse et al. 1999) also showed an amplitude and periodicity that are in agreement with those observed here, and hence produce immediate confirmation. The error bars of all points represent the uncertainty in the mean of the velocities (at xmath19) in the many small slices into which the spectrum was divided. is a similar point to a keplerian circle. Two points of the keplerian circle deviate from the keplerian curve by 2 km @ xmath10s @ xmath16, and the star is photometrically stable to within xmath110. - the friend of gliese 876, with @ xmath9 = 2 . 1 . , which has a mass of 2 m @ xmath6, would be about 2 m @ xmath6. As a result, spots on the spherical star can cause artifical movements. We have not examined for the presence of stellar pulses, but the stability of these spectra makes it impossible to identify any pulses. Further, acoustic oscillations and g modes of a 0 . 3 m @ xmath6 dwarf have timescales of minutes and hours, which are not present in the usual 60 day period. 02 irconazomy and astrometry (i.e., keck, lbt, sim, vlti) . In a similar way astrometric detection is advantageous, because of: a planetary proximity to the sun, a large planet, a small star, a small orbital period, allowing many cycles to be studied in a single season. Glyse 876 seems to be the first m dwarf with a known planetary companion. In a simple way astrometry is favored, because of: a close proximity to the sun, a large planet, a small star, 4 a short orbital period, which permits the monitoring of many cycles in a season. lin et al. 1995, trilling et al. 1998) and lissauer, 1995. However, it is not clear what causes the planet around gliese 876 to stop moving at 0 - 2 . this is, however, not clear what could cause the planet around gliese 876 to stop moving at 0 - 2 . This small orbital semi-major axis of xmath4 = 0 - 2  and the eccentricity of xmath2 = 0 - 2 are puzzles to be reposed. They all orbit around the star, whereas the star has no star. Clearly, migration has not acted in such a way as to produce circular orbits. But this does not explain the apparent paucity of the jupiter orbits from 0 – 3 – from their star . . . . meanwhile, the latter, if common, does not explain the apparent paucity of the jupiter orbits from 0 – 3 – from the star. These objects that orbit slanting inwards, as it were, from 0 – 3 – from their star . . . well, the eccentricity of the planetary companion orbits around gliese 876. . . . Perhaps some physical mechanism has been found to cause these eccentricities, in contrast to the inexplicably low eccentricities of the giant planets of our solar system. A thick gas cloud in a protoplanetary disk may lead to circular orbits. Other systems that are in a state of instability can suffer large eccentricities, leading to eccentric orbits at a number of supermajor axes. The temperature at optical depth Unity of the atmosphere of the planet around gliese 876 is estimated to be - 70 c, too cold for liquid water (Saumon 1998) . this temperature would be higher at the lower layers of the atmosphere . . . – S/S – ?494 – !226 – !10serum –  – ast95 – 20443 – gwm – and nsf grant ast95 – 9619418, and nasa grant nag5 – 4445 – and sun microsystems – – thank you to the nasa and uc Observatory Boards for enlarging the time of the astronomy –  – we thank the nasa and uc Observatory Boards for the allocation of telescope time to the astronomy. 15 – the length of periastron @ xmath24 (deg) – & – 24 – 6 – periastron date @ xmath25 (July) –
