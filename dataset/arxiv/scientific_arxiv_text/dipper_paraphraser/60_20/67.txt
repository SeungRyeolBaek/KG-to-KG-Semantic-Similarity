the natural shape of an isolated self-gravitational fluid is axially symmetrical . . . so that, for this reason, exact solutions of the exact equation of Einstein are very suitable for general relativity. In the last decade, several exact solutions were investigated as possible galactic models. The stationary disks were investigated in electric fields, magnetic fields, and both electric and magnetic fields . . . xcite, xcite, xcite, xcite. , in addition to the radial pressure and the radial tension, were examined by xcite and xcite . . . self-similar static disks were examined by xcite and xcite. In the past years, precise solutions were obtained for thin disks made of individual and composite halos of matter , charged dust and energized fluid , xcite . The axial symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations are therefore suitable for general relativity. Besides, a relativistic counter-rotating disk, which is source of the stifling metric, were obtained by xcite. xcite also found a vast number of new relativistic static solutions that correspond to the classical Galactic disk potentials of kuzmin , uchre , uchre , uchre , and mestel & kalnajs xcite. For an overview of relativistic gravitational disks, see xcite and xcite. It is also useful to study the stability of thin disks in general relativity. In this way it is possible to make the stabilization of the poles, for example, by a criterion rayleigh . . . The criterion xcite is applied to the stability of axes around black holes surrounded by disks, rings, and multipolar fields. The stability of axes in fixed axisymmetric space was analyzed by xcite and xcite . Besides, the stability of thin disks in axisymmetric space was studied by xcite and xcite . , a certain density of a black hole and a flat ring was analyzed by xcite and xcite . also, a few thin disks were obtained from the axes of the schwarzschild, and thin disks of single and composite halos. Lastly, the stability of thin disks, the shortest disks in the world, without radial or angular pressure, was studied by xcite and xcite. In general, the stability of disks in the newtonian theory is dealt with two ways. One is to study the stability of the particles on geodesics. Today, two different extensions of the Miyamoto-nagai potential have appeared in the literature: a triaxial generalization [xcite] which has the original axially symmetric model, and a relativistic version [xcite] which has the same newtonian limit. miyamoto and nagai have a number of important thick-disk models, especially the shape of the flux of the mass, qualitatively similar to the light-disk of disk galaxies.

F . . . the results of the energy-kinetic tensor are, in our words, diagonal, and all elements are different from zero. in the other hand, in the third section, we present the general relativistic miyamoto-nagai disk , the form of its energy density and the pressures and, in particular, the limits that the thermodynamic quantities must meet to satisfy the strong, weak, and dominant energy conditions. Thus, in this manuscript the kinetic energy is regarded as a test, and thus it does not modify the metric obtained from the solution of the equations of the Einstein equations. , we are, moreover, describing the restless fluid kinetic energy tensor, the fluid kinetic energy density, which is diagonal, with components (--) and -, where - is the total energy density, and -12 is the radial, azimuth and axial pressures or tensions, respectively. , it is a case of the general static, axially symmetric metric -0 where -1 is the total energy density, and -12 is the radial, azimuth and axial pressures, respectively. Moreover, we describe the perturbations that will be considered in detail in the following sections of this work. Moreover, the quantities in the energy momentum tensor and the coefficients of the perturbed conservation equations are all functions of the coordinates (at xmath4). Let us take a general perturbation @xmath20 of a quantity @xmath21, of the form @xmath21, where @xmath22 is the unperturbed quantity and @xmath24 is the perturbation.  non-umber   &    &  delta u  ta (i k  ta (i k  ta,  rho u  t) + xi  p  p  z z z z z  z ]  non-umber  &   delta u  ta [i k  ta [i k  ta] y  ta ] ] ,             xi    3   f (t, z, p z z z z  z)     3   f (t, z, p z z z z  z) besides the four equations which make up the energy momentum conservation equations, xmath37, besides the four equations of continuity, xmath37, xmath38, where xmath39 is the proper number density of particles, xmath39, and the total energy density - xmath11 - which explains , xmath40, where xmath41 is the constant mean baryon mass and xmath42 the internal energy density. - cg  - - y   d y  d d y  d d d tt ) , - cg   d g  z , z, z, z, z, z, z, z z  z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z the thermodynamic properties of the system can be derived from observation or theoretically, e.g. from the fokker-planck equation, which yields the particle distribution function of the disk. for example, if we perturb the axial component of the velocity, then we must perturb @xmath50. Thus, at this point the number of unknowns is greater than the number of equations. Here the fourth equation, (t)-(z) , contains seven independent unknowns, and whose function is to be found in our thick disk model. 836 a static general relativistic version of the Miyamoto-nagai disk was constructed by 836. For instance, if we perturb the axial component of the velocity, @xmath49, we must perturb @xmath50 . . . for this purpose the system of equations is reduced to a second order partial differential equation. This article deals with a static general relativistic version of the miyamoto-nagai disk, which has (in circular) a correspondence between the general isotropic line in cylindrical dimensions and the miyamoto-nagai model in cylindrical dimensions. In the same way, we perform the perturbation @xmath51, which is subordinated to the other condition (see below) . In addition, we perform the perturbation @xmath51 with the extra condition . . . This is not the only condition that the level curves are physical acceptable. In the next section we take the omitting perturbations of sec. 2 [a r . . ; a + a xi . . ] and examine their stability. , :-) . . . without losing generality, we make eqs. . . . rho, rho, rho, pz . . .           ,      ,               ,                 , The above criteria and the parameters in the article lead to a radial cutoff of xmath68 and a radial cutoff of xmath69. Moreover, the equation of xmath73 is independent of the function of xmath83, but xmath83 must be different from zero to obtain this form. in the outer radius of the disk we set xmath86 as a value of the perturbation at xmath75. we start by adjusting the four velocity, xmath74, xmath75, in its components at xmath74 and xmath75. , see the appendix fmna . The second order equation  (edo2mna) is numerically solved with two boundary conditions, one at xmath84 and the other at  xmath79 . The differential equation for xmath73 is independent of xmath83, but xmath83 has to be different from zero to be reached. In this particular case, we have xmath81 . note that in eq. ( ) the coordinate at xmath82 is only entered as a parameter . Note also that the coordinate at xmath82 only takes the form of a parameter . At first sight, the perturbation @ xmath73 seems to be stable for all @ xmath75, but to make a complete analysis, we have to compare the values of the perturbations at each radius with the values of the radial pressure. - note that our four velocity, @ xmath14, has only components in the temporal part, so we do not have any values of xmath100 and xmath101 to compare with the perturbed values @ xmath102 and xmath99. Note that our four velocity, @ xmath14, has only components in the temporal part, so that we do not have values of xmath100 and xmath101, so that we can compare these values with the radial pressure. As we can see, the perturbation of xmath73 for the relative value of xmath92 is always lower, or at least, of the same order of magnitude, than these values. This is why we included in the same graph the profile of the 10 % value of @ xmath77 . . . Note that our four velocity values ([tetrad]] consist of only a temporal part and so we have no values of @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 to compare with the perturbed values @ xmath102 and @ xmath99 . . . Let us assume, then, that the general relativistic diffusive disk shows some not-so-stable modes for a very flat disk, e.g. (@xmath94). So, if we consider the outside radius of the disk as a perturbation, then we consider the same thing as the perturbation @xmath110, where @xmath111 is @xmath112, and if we use this parameter, then the perturbation is stable. We can say that the general diffusive disk of the normal logarithmic nmamoto - nagai, shows that there are not stable modes for very flat galaxies, e.g. (@xmath94). We have the known relation @xmath105 ,  see see . . . In this respect, the elasticity of the disk is also the same . . . and if we set the frequency @xmath113, we obtain the same equation for the phantom - that is, - edo 2mna . In this case, the real part of the general phantom diverges with time, and the phantom - is not stable. " "Edo 2mnb" is the differential equation for the perturbation of xmath50 given by xmath115, where @ xmath79 is functions of ( @ xmath80) , see Appendix F. " the equation of xmath125, which is called the differential equation '2mnb', is numerically calculated and is formulated with two boundary conditions, one in xmath115 and the other in xmath117. note that the modulation of xmath125 is independent of the modulation of xmath83, but for that form one must have a different value of xmath75. Note that in eq. ' edo2mnb' the coordinate '75' is only a parameter , note that in eq. ' edo2mnb' is independent of the parameter 'xmath83', but to obtain that form we must have different values of  xmath83 from zero . note that for (mme-89) some modes of the axial pressure are above the 10 %. The data of the equations (T), t2 (T3), are given in appendix fmnc. This is what we mean by the four-dimensional radial component of the four velocity ranges, the radial pressure and the energy density of the fluid. We have considered the same issues as the previous one, but the qualitative results are the same. The radial component of the four velocity ranges, the radial pressure and the energy density of the fluid, is considered in this subsection. Basically, the perturbations at xmath12 and 132 do not depend on the parameter at xmath83, but on the parameters at xmath133 and 132. In this case, the coordinate at xmath82 is entered only as a parameter. In this case, the coordinate at xmath82 only enters as a parameter. Note, in the velocity perturbation graphs, the mode at xmath122 is not stable. In this case, the coordinate at xmath82 does not change. Note that in the pressure perturbation graphs, the mode at xmath122 is also not stable. Moreover, in the case of a flat galaxy, some modes like @xmath126 become unstable . From these results it is known that the general linear perturbation applied is extremely stable and, therefore, the perturbations do not form more complex structures. . . . i. In this subsection we perturb the axial part of the four velocity, the axial part of the pressure and the energy density of the fluid. Note that, like in the preceding equation, the coordinates @xmath75 only exist as a parameter. . . . a certain proportion of the axial pressure perturbation, or the physical part of the pressure, is always of the order of some order of magnitude lower than the 10 % profile . . . in the present case we are not taking into account the azimuth perturbations and therefore the quantities involved are not dependent on the corresponding parameter . . . in this case, we are not considering azimuth perturbations and therefore the quantities involved do not depend on the corresponding parameter . . . . This section considers the angle of the four velocity, the angle of the axes, and the radial pressure, and the axial pressure. The two upper bounds are the radial pressure, the axial pressure, and the axial pressure. For the first half of the phase, the radial pressure is not stable, and the high ones are more stable. - obliquely we measure the radial pressure, the axial pressure, and the axial pressure, and we determine the value of the ratio [1, oblique] with the rule of half (none) of the variables. This proves that the equilibrium between radial and axial pressures is quite constant. It is also true that the disturbance of energy density is very much like the harmonic stress (f=mn) of the atmosphere. - Thus the matrix of equations (t) - t (z) is reduced to a second order partial differential equation of the pressure of @xmath129, where - xmath131 is a function of - xmath132 , i.e. the radial pressure . . . [26] (25] . . . So it is a two-thirds approximation to the stability problem of gravity. The stability of the recent relativistic Mikamoto- Nagai model, which was introduced recently, was examined by applying a general first-order perturbation. The pressure perturbation curve shows that the perturbation is rapidly falling to values near zero when we move away from the center of the disk. For lower values of Mikao- Nagai , the axial velocity is positive, and for higher ones it is negative. - There is a little phenomenon in the velocity profile, and it is clearer in the flatter ones. - note that in the lower domain of the disk (-5 = 5 = 0) the axial velocity is positive, and in the upper domain (0 = 0) the axial velocity is negative. - This is a second approximation to the stability problem, in which the emission of gravitational radiation is considered. in this paper, we examined the stability of the newly proposed general relativistic miyamoto-nagai disk [ - xcite] by applying a general first-order perturbation. the measured stability of the disk is more complete than the stableness of particles on geodesics, because we have taken into account the collective behavior of the particles . this is a second approximation to the stability problem in which the emission of gravitational radiation is considered.
