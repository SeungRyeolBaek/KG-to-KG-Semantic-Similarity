The Q-sequence equation, called the schwinger-dyon, is one of the most popular equations to explore non-trivial features of quantum theory. Since yang-mills theory relies on the dual superconductivity, the calculations of the schwinger-dyon equation are well known. In this paper, we will present the schwinger-dyon equation for yang-mills theory in the maximal abelian (ma) gauge, and then we will solve it analytically in the infrared (ir) region. The numerical behavior of the gluon propagators in the ma gauge is also described. In the ma gauge, in contrast to the ordinary lorentz gauge, we must explicitly distinguish the diagonal components of the fields from the off- diagonal components. This is so even in the perturbative analysis of the uv region. At first, we extract the sd equations from the action of ma in the ma gauge (at x-400) , (at x-400) (at x-400) , (at x-400) , 1700 , 0100 , 1700 , 1400 , 1700 , 1500 , 1600 , 1600 , 1400 , 1500 , 1600 , 1500 , 1700 , 2000 , 400 - 0 - 1400 - 1650 - 1670 - 230 - 2200 - 1670 - 2400 - 1670 - 2400 - 1670 - 2070 - 2270 - 2270 - 2270 - 2270 - 2370 - 2270 - 2270 - 2270 - 2200 - 1670 - 1670 - 1670 - 1670 - 1770 - 2200 - 1670 - 2400 - 1670 - 1670 - 1870 - 2200 - 160 - (240 - 160 ) (240 - 160 - 240 - 400 - 500 - 500 - 500 - 500 - 800 - 500 - 500 - 500 - 800 - 500 - 500 - 500 - 600 - 400 - 500 - 600 - 200 - 800 - 500 - 600 - 400 - 400 - 500 - 600 - 400 - 600 - 400 - 600 - 400 - 500 - 400 - 600 - 400 - 500 - 400 - 450 - 300 - 400 - 450 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 450 - 300 - 400 - 500 - 600 - 400 - 600 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 450 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 600 - 400 - 400 - 400 - 600 . . . and the inverted version of eq. , then , the inverted version of eq., and the inverted version of eq., which we have just mentioned, we now take the ansatz for the form factors in the ir region: g (p  2) = b (p  2) = v + cdots,   rm t   rm t  (p  2)  w  cdots. In the pulse of gravity, we use the higashijima-miransky approximation , as if in the st domain, we use the Higashijima-miransky - miransky approximation , at xcite , it is a . . . [21]] with the form factors (that is, @xmath27) and the ansatz (@xmath27) for the vertex functions in the sd equations ([236] and [236] for the  (25] of the st identities [236] and [236][24] of the st identities ([236]] and [236] ) at the limit of @xmath25. So, as to the next principle, the form factor of xmath6 is 215> math40, math40, math41, math43 math40, math42, math43, math45 math43 math39, math39, math39 math39, the result is summarized in Table 215> not feynman gauge, math38, math40, math40, math43, math38, math40 ,math40, math43 math38 math38 math40, math40, math38, math40, in this case, even if math39, there is no cancelling, as in the two cases 2c and 2d, there is no cancelling, as in the two cases 2c and 2d. , so, in the case of math32 , math35 , math40 , the result is in table : math43 .
