That is, the Lep experiments at the resonance of the xmath1 boson had tested the standard model (sm) at the quantum level, proving the xmath1 decay into fermions to a precision of one part in ten thousand . The good coordination of the Lep data with the sm predictions severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the xmath1 pole. The gigaz option of the International Linear Collider (ilc) @ xcite - which is a proposed electron-positron collider, with the polarized beams in its first phase and the gigaz option of the main beam by adding a bypass to its main beam line. Considering these achievements, it is possible that the physics of xmath1 will again play the central role in the frontier of particle physics, if the next generation of xmath1 physics can come to life, with the physics of xmath1 - pole coming up with events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the lep. Besides the fc processes, the 'fi', the 'fi' in the 'fi' is rare and usually weak; but, according to the calculations, the number of new physics, the 'fi', the 'devil', the 'devil's decay,' the 'fi', the 'Fairness', 'fi', and 'fi' in the 'fi', can be effected from 'xmath16' of the 'gi', and from 'gi' to 'gi' of 'gi', which means that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of 'xmath1' can be enhanced from 'xmath17' of the 'gi' to 'xmath19 of 'gi' in the 'gi'. Besides 'gi',' some instances of 'gi' would have been seen in the Ning Xiang dispersal. ' . . . and, in consequence of this, many instances of "gi" (which are generally considered sensitive to new physics) should be investigated thoroughly to evaluate their potential to probe new physics. – a certain process involving a particle whose particle 0 denotes a light-higgs boson. The decay at xmath21 (@xmath21) with the particle 0 denoting a light-higgs boson was studied in xcite, the decay at xmath23 was studied in the doublet model of the sm-supersymmetric ms-supersymmetric ( nm-supersymmetric) model of xcite, and the decay at xmath4 was studied in a model independent of xcite, in the ms-supersymmetric model of xcite and in ms-supersymmetric @ xcite. Besides these studies, we have been engaged in some recent studies of the singlet model of the ms-supersymmetric model ( nm-supersymmetric) at xcite, at xcite and at xcite, and at xcite we are inspired by some recent studies of the singlet-supersymmetrical model (nm-supersymmetric) and the near-supersymmetric model (nm-supersymmetric). So, it is worthwhile recalling the previous studies. In addition, in the latest experiments, the properties of the light-colored nmssm have become more stringently restricted than in the past. In the sm, it must be heavier than xmath26 gev, which is obtained by the invalid observation of the nmssm by the lep experiments. This is because the interactions between the light-colored nmssm and the light-colored nmssm are more complex and recent, and it is necessary to adapt the previous work. In the sm, the light-colored nmssm is a light-colored nmssm, with a singlet-colongee component, which may result in the spontaneous breakup of some approximate symmetry, like xmath24 or a peccei-quuin symmetry. The new study is, therefore, necessary. The very light cp- odd higgs and light z decay is enlarged with one or more z decays. , which we have analyzed with careful consideration. In this study we have analyzed rare z decays @ xmath1 , , , , , , , , , , , xmath11, , , , , , xmath22, , , , , , , nmssm and nmssm . A new physics model contains two xmath32 doublet higgs fields, xmath33 and xmath34, and with the assumption of cp-conserving, the scalar potential can be parameterized as @ xcite: @ xmath35 ,  end  aligned [26] , where @ xmath36 (@ xmath36) is free dimensionless parameters, and @ xmath38 (@ xmath38) is the parameters with mass dimension . in new physics the higgs sector is usually extended by adding the higgs doublet and / or singlets, and consequently more physical higgs bosons are predicted, and more free parameters are involved in . . . . . a new physics models . . . , at last a conclusion is given in sec. , in sec. v, we give the numerical results for the branching ratios of the rare xmath1 decays in different models . . . That is, for example, the pair of non-Tettany-Ottany-Ottany-Ottany-Ottany-Ottany-Ottany Bosons =, b2i, the fifth form of the cp-Ottany-Ottany-Ottany, whereupon we set up the dual form cp-Ottany-Ottany-Other, which is to be said to have the internal mtat(), and, since the jsH+NiAnlxT –C++[8] and their space-time, the jsxin, the jsn. In the cp-Ottany, whereupon there is one doublet of T in the kind iii 2hm and the other of T to produce the masses of up-type quarks and charged leptons; while /t> in the type ii 2hdm there is only the one doublet, @T33, which generates the masses of up-type quarks and charged leptons. One has a quill-shaped doublet, @xmath33, married only to leptons, and the other twin-folded @xmath34 is married only to quarks. Therefore the yukawa interactions of @xmath0 with fermions in the two models are given by @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 indicating the generation index. The structures of the nmssm and the nmssm are described by their superpotentials and their soft-break terms, where @xmath57 is the superpotential of the mssm, without the @xmath25 term, and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are higgs doublets and singlet superfields, with @xmath60 and @xmath61 being their scalar component, - xmath62 , - xmath6 - And if the precipices are super-potential and the soft-breaking parameters, then the precipices of the nmssm and the nmssm will predict three. so, both nmssm and nmsm predict three - s. - , @ xmath70, where the fields on the right hand of the equations are component fields of @ xmath71, @ xmath72 and @ xmath61, defined by @ xmath73, @ xmath74 and xmath75 are respectively the cp-even and cp-non-aligning neutral Higgs Bosons, @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 are goldstone fermions taken by @ xmath1 and _ xmath78, and @ xmath79 is the charged Higgs Boson. “For these model, the lighter singlet field in the given model is a mixture of the singlet field Xmath80 and the doublet field combination Xmath81, i.e. Xmath82 and its couplings to the down-type quarks are proportional to xmath83. In general, the lighter quark field in the given model is the mixture of the singlet field Xmath80 and the doublet field Xmath81, i.e. @ Xmath82 and its couplings to down-type quarks are proportional to xmath83 . As a comparison, the interactions of @ xmath0 with the squarks are given by @ xcite , i.e. the interaction does not vanish when @ xmath86 reaches zero . The first point is that the nmssm is a true nmssm and not a nmssm with @xmath92 @xcite, because the initial terms math95 and math96 in the nmssm do not produce any interaction, except for the tree-level, higgs boson masses and the minimization conditions . . . about the nmssm and nmsm, three points should be noted. The first is that the nmssm is actually the same as the nmssm with xmath94 xcite, because the tadpole terms math95 and math96 in the nmssm have no effect, except for the tree-level, high-level and minimized masses. The second is that the nmssm has its own peculiarity, which is that of the neutralino sector . We can read the mass from the neutrality of xmath107, with the following forms: xcite, xmath107, xmath107, xmath107, xmath106 , xmath107 , xmath105, xmath106 , after a diagonal of this matrix, we can read the mass eigenstate of the lightest neutralino, xmath107. For xmath107, the mass 1 is lighter than xmath109 gev, for xmath110 (from lower bound on the mass) and xmath111 (increasing). , so the relic density of xmath107 plays a decisive role in the selection of the model parameters. As a general supersymmetric model, xmath107 acts as the dark matter in the universe, but because of its singlino-dominated nature, it is difficult to exterminate sufficiently to get the correct density in the current universe. scribbled a small or big mass, and thus the effect of scribbled a large mass, scribbled a little, or else scribbled a light scribbler xmath0 with a mass that fits the relation xmath114 to xmath115. The phenomenology of the scribbler is also rather peculiar, and it was detailed in scribbler xphal. For scribbler xphalon, the quantities of the lightest scribbler xmath0, the masses and the interactions, are even tighter than the higher ones, because xmath0 is an important role in scribbler Xphalon. The low density of scribbler Xphalon is also very special, and this was elaborated on in scribbler xphalon . . . Xmath118 , xmath42 and xmath43 are figured in fig. . . fig. , fig. , fig. , fig. , fig. , fig. , fig. , fig. , fig. , fig. , and fig. , respectively . . . on the decays of xmath118 ( xmath22) and xmath43 ( xmath42 and xmath43 in iii 2hdm and l2hdm), xmath41 and xmath120 in nmssm and nmssm . . . so that Fig. 1 describes the intermediate state math119 and he has well computed all the decays of xmath119 and included the saturation effect of its propagator. and in most cases the rate is much lower than the other two. On the other hand, the process is only influenced by loops mediated by quarks / leptons of the type ii 2hdm and l2hdm, and likewise by sparticles in the nmssm and nmssm. However, as one may suppose, in certain cases of the type ii 2hdm and l2hdm — and in other words, by cp-invariance, loops mediated by squarks / sleptons make no contribution to the decay at xcite. In this case, it is worth mentioning that, for the most part, it should be much smaller than the other two. In the simplest case, the decay proceeds from the diagram shown in fig. [3] [3], and one may suppose that it is enough to consider only the contributions of fig. [3] [3] . , because of the cancelation of the contributions from different Xmath119 – fig. [Fig. 3] – and also because of the potential largeness of Xmath124 couplings (i.e. larger than the electroweak scale – xmath125) the radiative correction from the higgs- and quark- & lepton-mediated loops may dominate over the tree-level contribution even when the tree-level prediction of the rate, Xmath126, is exceeding xmath20 – besides the correction from the higgs- and quark- & lepton-mediated loops, there are also loops involving sparticles such as squarks, charginos and neutralinos – . . . and found that they can be overlooked too. Since considering all the radiative corrections will make our numerical calculation somewhat slow, we have only included the most important corrections, the Higgs-mediated loops, in the results of the four models. first of all, let us look at the contribution of the squark to @ xmath 11 as induced by the @ xmath129 interaction (by @ xmath130, the squark in chirality state), and the contribution of the squark to @ xmath131. Because the @ xmath132 interaction conserves the chirality of the squarks, while the @ xmath133 interaction violates the chirality, in order to obtain non-zero contribution to @ xmath11 from the squark loops, there are four chiral flippings required, three of them being provided by the @ xmath131 interaction, and the rest by the left-right mixing of the squarks. After that we consider the contributions of chargino and neutralino. Let's continue with the chargino / neutralino contributions. Since for a light the doublet component, the parameterized by xmath84 in eq. [[mattering]], is small, the couplings of xmath0 with the spherical particles are never very large . . . so chargino / neutralino contributions are not of any importance either. For the types - iii2hdm and l2hdm, we consider the following constraints: * theoretical constraints on xmath136, from perturbativity, unitarity, and requirements that the scalar potential is tuned to large field values and contains no straight lines , indicating that xmath137 - the constraints from the lep search for neutral higgs - xmath140, xcite, and from the associated production of xmath140, xcite, and compare them with the corresponding lep data that we have inserted into our code. These constraints limit the quantities, such as math146  times br (h _ i    bar  b) on the xmath147 plane, with the subscript math148 denoting the coupling coefficient of the math148 interaction. - These constraints impose a model dependent lower bound on math150, e.g. , math150 for the type ii 2hdm (from our results) , math152 for the l2hdm @ xcite, math153 for the nmssm @ xcite, It is well known that the unique constraint on a cp-aligning ion is somewhat lower than the sm, that is, @ xmath154. This is because in new physics models unconventional epochs such as @ xmath155 are introduced . . . These constraints can limit the xmath-alignment to xmath-155. . . . as for the nmssm, there is another special reason for allowing a cp-aligning ion in the yukawa structure, so that the ion is in an elliptic form . . . , hexagrams are fewer. . . . , but their weight is very high. In these constraints, it is possible to restrict the weight of Xmath-158 by a constraint of the constant Clawi and the latest Cebry limits on the Xmath-160 coupling. * about the constraints (5) and (6). We adopt the formula in . . . as the higgs can provide a considerable number of higher order corrections for . . . Xmath165 couplings, we calculate them to the loop level, and we require the corrected . . . xmath165 couplings to be in the range of . . . xcite . . . i.e. the constraint of . . . the constraint of . . . the constraint of . . . , leptonic decay . . . We use the formula . . . in our calculation . . . about the constraints of . . . the constraint of . . . . we calculate the equation in . . . - In the physics observables and physics observables, as well as the decays (P. 5), the yukawa couplings of the higgs to xmath171 lepton are all strengthened by xmath54, and the corrections of xmath171 lepton are both enhanced by xmath54. In general, the lighter xmath0 is, the tighter xmath54 is. In l2hdm, the yukawa couplings of the higgs to xmath171 lepton are both increased by xmath54, but for the l2hdm, because only the yukawa coupling is yukawa-diminished by xmath54 . In the other hand, in the type-iii 2hdm, iii 2hdm, iii 2hdm, iii 2hdm, b-physics, physics observables, as well as xmath178 decays discussed above, can be less elastic than the constraints (of 5) and (of 6), because the yukawa couplings of xmath171 lepton and xmath179 quark are simultaneously increased by xmath54 ... but for l2hdm, because only yukawa coupling . . . The xmath186 we enumerate is, in our code, the xmath185 for electroweak observables, such as xmath180, xmath181 and xmath190, or their combinations, xmath183, . . . we have to enumerate new physics predictions of xmath186, which is within the xmath185 range of the experimental value . . . At the same time, in view of the unified volume of these quantities, we can conclude that, in the case of a light @xmath0 and @xmath196, these quantities rely on the spectrum of the state of the higest, like @xmath197, which means that a light @xmath0 can still survive the constraints of the precision electroweak observables, as long as the splitting between @xmath150 and @xmath198 is moderate. As there is no @xmath194 coupling or @xmath195 coupling, @xmath0 must be in the band of the other higest observables to contribute to the self-energy. . . . we require the theoretical interpretation of these observables to agree with the experimental evidence . . . so, by the uv convergence of these quantities, we can infer that, for a light like xmath0 and xmath196, these quantities are dependent on the spectrum of the higest sector in a way like xmath197, which means that a light like xmath0 can still withstand the constraints of the precision electroweaks, since the separation between xmath150 and xmath198 is moderate, “in the l2hdm we can only deal with the charge of the charged higgs boson and the quarks, so it follows that the effect of xmath198 versus xmath54 will be limited . . . and so we consider the results of fig. 11 of xcite to be insignificant, although xmath198 is not the value of xmath205. In this work we employ the results of fig. 11 of xcite to exclude the unfavored points. as for the charge of the charged higgs boson, b physics does not really have any constraints on xcite, for in this model the charges of the charged higgs boson are proportional to xmath206 and in the case of the very large xmath54 that we are interested in, they are suppressed. - and - the elastic moments of the muon anomalous magnetic moment - xmath208. This way, as the theoretical predictions and the experimental measured values of xmath208 have reached a remarkable precision, but a significant deviation still exists: xmath208. If the higgs bosons are much heavier than xmath25 lepton mass, the contributions of the barr-zee diagrams are more important, and to reduce the discrepancy of xmath208, it is necessary to introduce a light xmath0, and to elongate its couplings to xmath25 lepton, and also to heavy fermions, such as the bottom quark and the xmath171 lepton, to influence the effects of the barr-zee diagram. ‘The Cp- all higgs bosons are usually preferring to be heavy, as their contributions to @ xmath208 are negative. – In the case of the type ii 2hdm, because @ xmath54 is strongly constrained by the process of @ xcite and by the decay of @ xmath178 at xcite, the Barr-Zee diagram’s contribution is not sufficiently high to raise the theoretical prediction of @ xmath208 at xcite . – Therefore we require the type ii 2hdm to explain @ xmath208 at the level of @ xmath 211 . – In this l2hdm the constraint of @ xmath54 is much less restrictive than the type ii 2hdm, and the barr-Zee diagram of @ xmath171 – loop can amplify the theoretical prediction of @ xmath208 at xcite . - because this paper concentrates on a light xmath0, the decay xmath212 is open to a possibility of a large decay width . . . so it is not very easy to understand some of the constraints intuitively. In supersymmetric models besides charged physics there are chargino loops, gluino loops as well . . . – since on the one hand it needs a large xmath54 to boost the Barr - Zee contribution, but on the other hand too large xmath54 will result in an unacceptably large xmath208 . . . In the case of the nmssm and nmssm, the above constraints become more complicated because not only more cations are involved in these models but also spherical particles. . . . take the case of the process - xmath199 . . . as this paper is focused on the light xmath0 , the decay - xmath212 is open up with a possible large decay . It is interesting to see that in the nmssm and in the nmssm the nmssm depends on the contribution of higgs and neutralino / chargino . . . in the nmssm and in the nmssm, the xmath208 contributes to the process and the neutralino / chargino . . . Because the nucleus contribution is as light as the iii 2 hdm , the nucleus contribution is too light as @ xmath215 . . . Since the xmath208 20 is not quite like that of 215 , the nucleus contribution is more light, that of xmath220 . As the nucleus contribution is also an inhibitor of the process, but the nucleus . . . “Related Article ”, p. 91, p. 208, p. 1213, p. 121, p. 121. “This can be done by adding two further conditions: directness of sparticle masses from the lep1 , lep2 and tevatron experiments. The lep1 bound on invisible z decay at xmath223; the lep2 bound on neutralino production at xmath224 and xmath225 ... wmap relic density ... Note, among the above conditions, the constraint (b) on higgs and (c) on neutralino are very important. This is because in the supersymmetric models, the sm-like higgs is the upper bound of the tree, with an extra parameter of about xmath227 at xmath227 However, since the nmssm is actually the same as the nmssm, we need not reconstruct the effective Higgs potential to determine precisely the annihilation channel @ xmath230, and the xmath61 signifies the value of any Higgs-related g>--at the xmath229 level and by about xmath228 at the loop level, and that the density of the relic restricts the annihilation cross-section in a certain narrow range. for our analysis of the nmssm, we calculated the constraints (3) and (5-(7), and used the nmssmtools (at xcite) to implement the rest of the constraints. , we extend nmssmtools to the nmssm to make the constraints . . . we solved this problem by noting the following facts: . As we have already said, the nmsm is exactly the same as the nmssm, with the trilinear term set to zero . . . and that relic density is restricted to a narrow range . . . (It is a given that the elements of the nmssm and nmssm differs little from the nmssm), and that the soft mass parameters in the squark and the slepton sectors are degenerate. As these parameters do not affect the properties of @ xmath0, we fix them so as to reduce the number of parameters that are not free in our scan. In performing these scans, we note that the nmssm and nmssm depend also on the gaugino masses and the soft mass parameters in the squark sector and the squark sector. As these parameters do not affect the properties of @ xmath0 very much, we set them so as to reduce the number of free parameters in our scan. For the sleepy sector we assume all the soft breaking masses and the trilinear parameters to be 100 gev . Finally, we assume the grand unification relation @xmath240 for the gaugino masses, with @xmath241 being the fine structure constants of the different gauge groups. Finally, we assume the grand unification relation @xmath240 for the gaugino masses, with @xmath241 being the fine structure constants of the different gauge classes. analyzing the properties of @xmath0 reveals that for most of the surviving points in the nmssm and nmssm it is the singlet field (Figure 6). For heavy sleptons, we assume Xmath237 and Xcite . As we have already indicated, the main decay products of @ xmath0 are @ xmath247 for the l2hdm @ xcite, @ xmath247 (dominant) and @ xmath247 (subdominant) for the type ii 2hdm, nmssm and nmssm, and in certain cases - neutralino pairs in the nmssm @ xcite . in Fig. , Fig. 4 , we project the surviving samples on the @ xmath249 plane. This figure shows that the allowed range of @ xmath54 is from @ xmath250 to @ xmath251 in the type ii 2hdm, and from @ xmath251 to @ xmath253 in the type ii 2hdm . just as we introduced before, the lower bound of @ xmath254 is due to the necessity of the models to explain the muon anomalous moment, and the upper bound is due to the constraint of the lep process. , it is limited by the smaller side of the @xmath256 coupling for the light @xmath61 @xcite (for the dependence of the @xmath256 coupling on @ xmath54, see sec. ii)), but for the nmssm, this is because we chose a light slept mass so that the large side of @xmath54 amplify @xmath208 too much to be experimentally unacceptable. Fig. [Second] and fig. [Epi] show the branching ratios of @xmath260 and @xmath259 respectively. Fig. [Epi] , we can see, among the four models, that type ii 2hdm predicts . . . . . . . then the rate of two decays will be compared by the rates of the two decays . . . Fig. - 6. [f] shows that the l2hdm predicts the largest rate for @ xmath264, reaching xmath5 in the ideal case, and for the other three models the ratio of @ xmath261 is at least one order smaller than that of @ xmath266. we emphasize that if nature prefers a light @ xmath0, then the relationship between @ xmath260 and / or @ xmath269 will be observable at the gigaz. There is a numbing relation to xmath and xmath. This figure shows the degree of xmath as a function of xmath270. In Fig. 7 we can see that the ratio of xmath and xmath can reach xmath270. Xmath270 is the optimal rate of xmath in the optimal cases of xmath, l2hdm, nmssm and nmssm, which means that if a study has been selected by nature, the decay a is not noticeable at the gigaz. The reason for the low rate of xmath is, as we have explained previously, that the decay a - Xmath proceeds only at the loop level. (a) may be, on the contrary, on a shell . . . , in fig. . in fig. . [emb] it will be in the intermediate state of fig. . . , which is on the shell . . . and here we consider the decay in xmath11, which, unlike the above decay, is dependent on the interactions between the yukawa couplings. In the supersymmetrical models the big singlet component of light, Xmath0, is to stop the couplings of yukawa, and xmath0 in nmssm has more singlet component than that in nmssm . . . in some cases, the intermediate state, xmath119, is in the shell. So in this case, @ xmath0 is axion—as we saw in Fig. Fig. Fig. c) may be on a shell (corresponding to the points with large @ xmath278), while in Fig. c it is impossible to do so. So we conclude that decaying @ xmath11 can serve as an alternative to new physics, especially to distinguish a nmssm from a nmssm if the supersymmetry is found at the lhc, and the decaying @ xmath11 is observed at the gigaz with high frequency. Fig. c. d. (a) and @ xmath109 in fig. a. so in this case, @ xmath0 is an axion, as we have shown in Fig. f. And as there are numerous tests for different methods of decaying objects, the study of these tests may enlighten us a little by the measurement of these rare decays. In this study, we investigated the rare xmath1 decays @ xmath2 (@ xmath7 ) , @ xmath282 and @ xmath4 in the type ii 2hdm, lepton-specific 2hdm, nmssm and nmssm, which indicate a light cp - odd bisons @ xmath0. The branching ratio for these experimentations can be as large as @ xmath5 for @ xmath118, @ xmath8 for @ xmath3 and @ xmath9 for @ xmath4, which means that the decays @ xmath2 and @ xmath283 may be reached at gigaz.
