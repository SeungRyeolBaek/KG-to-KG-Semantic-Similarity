One of the special applications of gauge/gravity duality for qcd was the formulation of holographic dual models of qcd, which are known to be suitable for reproducing the known properties of qcd by choosing an appropriate theory in the 5d ads, e.g., xcite. In the last few years the application of gauge/gravity duality to physics has gained much attention. In the literature many holographic dual models of qcd have been developed, e.g., Xcite. In this paper we shall discuss the hard wall ads / qcd model, where the confinement is modeled by cutting off the ads space along the extra fifth dimension at a wall located at some fixed distance @xmath0 . in this hard wall model form factors and wave functions of vector mesons can be calculated (ref. @xcite) . In general the vector sector is less sensitive to infrared (ir) effects, since the symmetry of qcd is not broken in qcd. In general the vector sector is less sensitive to the infrared (ir) effects, since this symmetry is not broken in qcd. In the present study we shall deal with the hard wall ads / qcd model, where the confined space is cut off from the outer fourth dimension at a fixed point Xmath1 . . . in the framework of this hard wall model, form factors and wave functions are calculated (see, e. g., @xcite) . At the time, we recollected the basics of the hard wall model and the results obtained from ref. xcite . Since the X-treme fits of ref. xcite give a very small value for the explicit chiral symmetry-breaking parameter @ x-treme, we only consider the chiral limit of the hard-wall holographic dual model of two- flavours qcd . in our analysis, we systematically used two holographic wave functions @ x-treme and @ x-treme , which are conjugate to each other and basically analogous to the analogous objects introduced in our previous papers, where we studied vector mesons. However, we suggest that, as for the radius of the pion radius, a smoothing of the wall may increase the radius of the pion. , we then apply the pion form factor in terms of the pion form factor to analyse the electric radius in different regions of the holographic parameters space. In this paper, working within the framework of the model proposed by ref. xcite (hard-wall model) , we will describe a formula to calculate the form factor and the wave functions of the pion, in particular the density function of the pion. However, since the gauge symmetry in the vector sector of the h-model is not broken, the longitudinal component of the vector field is unphysical, and only the longitudinal component is real. Therefore, the vector mesons are the modes of the transverse part of the axial-vector field. This is a crucial point, because in the holographic model of Hadrons, qcd resonances correspond to the karluvé-le- klein (kk) excitations in the sliced ads @xmath11 , in particular, the vector mesons correspond to the kliuvé-veli modes of the transverse-vector field. , this must be taken into account if we want to treat the pion in a consistent way. In general, we can write the axis at xmath17, where xmath17 and xmath18 are the transverse and longitudinal components of the axis. , whereas the axis at xmath20 is physical and connected with the goldstone boson, pion in this case. The physics of the axial-vector and pseudoscalar sectors is described by the action @xmath22 , end >    end  [encamped, aligned, ] , where xmath21 corresponds to the pion field. At xmath37, in the domain of ref. xcite, one may derive the gell-mann-renner relation , which is based on the relation , [26][25], producing the massless pion in the xmath6 limit. Hence a variation of action with respect to the transverse part of the axial-vec field, of the fourthier image, from xmath36, will give us the following equation of motion, of xmath36. in this case, a variation of the longitudinal component of the axial-vec field, given by eq. . (-vec) and the boundary conditions (b-c .) in xmath36 and xmath41. This higgs-like mechanism is broken by the relation xmath37 . [Axvec] that introduces the kinetics of the axial-vec-strata. The longitudinal component of the axial-vector gauge field is represented by the series: xmath62, where the polarization tensor of the triad of xmath63 is given by xmath63; and the eq. ( (phieq) can be written in the form of Xmath74, where the second term on the rhs is explicitly transverse to Xmath67, and therefore, for large spaces like xmath68, eq. (phieq) gives the same solution as in vector mesons, and the same asymptotic logarithmic behavior, as one expects from qcd. so, the two-point function for the axial-vec currents is a form: Xmath63, where the meson polarization tensor is given by xmath63, and the corresponding equation . (pioneq) coincides with the 'pioneq' equation for xmath79 . Moreover, eq. (pioneq) coincides with the 'pioneq' version of the equation - axvec' for xmath79. – In our symmetries, we can enumerate the internal em’s current at xmath92 as the derivative of xmath86: – In order to obtain the pion’s form factor from the three-point function, we have to consider three-point correlation functions. Here, the first term is longitudinal, with respect to xmath100, and the second term is longitudinal, and the pion’s electromagnetic form factor is ‘xmath102’, ‘xmath103’ (antennately normalized by xmath104), and the other term consists of ‘the contributions to the pion’s electromagnetic form factor’, ‘xmath103’. The pion form factor is obtained by a process of three-point correlation, using a pioneq. Moreover, in obtaining the pion’s electromagnetic form factor, we must take into account the action of the third order in the fields . . . note that by implementing eq. (pioneq) we can express ‘xmath90’ as an analogous analogy of ‘xmath86’. In eq. (pioneq) we can express ‘xmath90’ as a derivative of ‘xmath86’. At xmath90, the first term, longitudinal both with respect to ‘xmath100’ and ‘xmath101’, contains the pion emmitted force @xmath102 @ xmath103 (normalized by @xmath104) while the second term contains the emmitted force involving axial vector mesons and is transverse either with respect to ‘xmath100’ or . . . ; if he takes a gauge of xmath114, he can read a whole function of the three-point function of xmath115. (See 406 and 406). This is the sum of xmath124, which contains all the bound states of the xmath125 channel, and xmath126 is the mass of the xmath127th bound state, and xmath128 its wave function, as determined by the fundamental equation of motion in the vector sector. Using the Xmath113 gauge, we are able to calculate the part of the action which contributes to the 3 point function. This is as follows: Xmath115 + a    mu  nu  [v            , a      ] . Besides, there is only one particle in the expansion of the bound state, which is the massless pion. ‘end  aligned                                                      in eq. , i. . . . . . . . . . (see that the second term in eq. (xnia) disappears for axial - vector fields). Adding all the factors and adjusting the projection of eq. ([ proj0]) we get the following three-point function: math148, integrating by parts, and using the equations of motion both for math158 and math159, we get math158 . . .  end  aligned  ] , we need to add the math107 contribution from the math107 term of the ads activity (  ) 2    z  0  dz  z  cal j   (q  z  cal j    cal j  cal j  cal j  cal j   cal j  cal j  ,  rho (z  z   )   end  aligned   ] - Note that   z -  0  f  -    x - -  -   - and do the form -= equation @ x -  in eq - phi - by eq - ( phi - -) :  -  -  -  - ,  -  ,  = - ,   -> -  - -   -  - *  - This formula, combined with eq. psi0 ([Psi]) , establishes the relation of @ xmath192 with the condensate parameter @ xmath192 and the spline radius of @ xmath195.

In a very large value of the radius, Xmath203, the value of Xmath197 is determined by the value of Xmath198. And for this, in a much larger extent, @ xmath198, the value of Xmath198 is close to xmath198, and, therefore, we may expect that, even if we were to use the exact formula ( fpi2) for Xmath210, the value of Xmath198 would not change much . . . .  end  aligned , it is given by   gamma [1 / 3]  ,  frac  i  2 / 3    – 2 / 3      – 2 / 3   – 2 / 3  a  –  - 2 / 3  (a)  - 2 / 3   - 2 / 3  (a)   end  aligned      end  aligned Hence, for the fixed @xmath195 and for the small @xmath219, the pion radius is basically determined by the compacting range @xmath195 . . . in particular, the density @ xmath195 for the small @xmath240 is much larger than the density @ xmath240 . Thus, we take a pion-rho (a zeta, a) and calculate the density @ xmath249 (in particular, the density @ xmath249 is substantially larger than the density @ xmath239). , in particular, the density @ xmath235 is more than two times greater than the hard-wall model for @ xmath235. Thus, when @ xmath250 is fixed, and for @ xmath219 is small, the pion radius is basically determined by the square-root system of @ xmath195 . After all, if we take xmath210 as the bound of the hard-wall model of the xmath1-meson mass, and the value of xmath194 is the experimental value of xmath193 (note that there is no further number for xmath193), the pion radius is small, i.e., a radius of a thousand times greater than that determined by xmath261 . . . , if we take xmath265, then xmath266. If Xmath271 would increase by the same amount, it would be very close to the experimental value. The agreement of Xmath265 to xmath263, is in the mode of the simplest model. It is also possible to suppose that if the softer model is more realistic, the size of the pion will be larger. This possibility is backed up by our soft-wall, electric radius of Xmath261 for which we have obtained @ xmath266. (See Fig. 1 ) if we take @ xmath265, then @ xmath266. – (eq. fpiinfty) and in -nano we can express the coefficient in the square bracket in terms of -nano: -nano consists of two componens: a fixed term -nano  – and a logarithmically increasing term -nano . * in the nano 285 – 285 – we have, above all, the logarithm  –instructions and a sum -nano (the bond of massless pions, and the infrared -nano-contiguous piece  – -nano-, -nano; and the chiral logarithm -nano produced the extra 0 – a minimum of inaccuracy in our experiment. Thus, the coefficient in the radius at the level of x-ma2 consists of two constituents: the fixed term at x-ma283 and the logarithmic term decreasing with x-ma195, that is, in the region of x-ma277, a term with a fixed term @ x-ma283 , a term logarithmically increasing with x-ma289, which gives a value of X-ma289, the result of which is -ma277, to the best of our understanding. . . . it is the basic scale of the pion wave function in the local quark–dark duality model of xcite, where the interval corresponds to the  pion-dark interval . . . Note, however, that it is quite visible in the experimentally interesting region Xmath302: it is responsible for more than xmath303 of the form factor value in this region (in fact, at xmath183 the xmath299 term contributes about 40 % to the normalization of the form factor) . For the pion form factor, the simplest and most simple method is provided by the monopole formula Xmath308 while for xmath183 the form factor is normalized to one, so basically the different models would differ in how they interpolate between these two limits. – Note that this combination – xmath297 often occurs in the pion analyses. – Note that it is quite visible in the experimentally interesting region – xmath303: it accounts for more than xmath303 of the form factor value in this region (moreover, at xmath183 the term – xmath299 is an extra 40 % contributor to the normalization of the form factor) . The most basic contribution to the asymptote of the form factor is the value of xmath305 at the origin – namely, the value of xmath303, which is equal to the pion-duality interval – Moreover, the above waveform @ xmath320 tends towards the number @ xmath327 + xmath330+, in increments of @ xmath315 + xmath330+ , and thus exceeding by more than 25 % the experimental jlab values @ xcite obtained for @ xmath331 and @ xmath345 – which is less than the experimental Jlab values @ xcite measured for @ xmath331 and 2 . . . . that is, the proportional component @ xmath325 + xmath325 + xmath325 + xmath325 – as a result, the form factor @ xcite had the characteristic @ xmath1 - dominance behaviour @ xcite . the authors of the ref. xcite suggested the use of eqs. , calf00 , caljo, to determine the pion form factor, - in that case the relevant function, the integral, calf00, is the lowest - state function, and the end - ascending    [2] [3] [4] [5] is the mass-to-element propagation of this oscillator-type model, exactly equal to the magnitude of the radius squared corresponding to the squared , - and this proportion of the oscillator-scale at xmath317 is not at all equal to the experimental pion form factor, and as a result, the form factor in xmath318 was @ xmath1 dominating behavior , - I am afraid that the calculations for the form factor for the density of the pion are quite different from the ones for the hard-wall model of ref. xcite. There are certain, however, problems in the interpretation of the model parameters of pions. To understand the pion, the method for introducing the chiral symmetry-breaking effects which were applied to the hard-wall model of ref. xcite posed an obstacle in the form of the ads and qcd model of ref. xcite, as we have shown in ref. xcite, the relation between the chiral condensate of the equation of the field xmath28 and the mass parameter xmath8 must be proportional to each other, so that if xmath28 is varied independently from xmath8, then the condensate of the equation will vanish as well. The solution of this equation for the field xmath335 is very different from the equations in ref. xcite, with the chiral condensate generating a dynamical system. We can prevent this problem by using more advanced models (such as ref. xcite) in which the condensate is generated dynamically. However, such a point of view is quite outside the scope of this paper. Below, we will describe an example of a density xmath337. As we have seen in the hard wall model, to accurately describe the pion, we need to take into account the chiral symmetry-breaking effects that are absent from the vector channel . It is interesting to note that the density which gives this value has a general enhancement for larger values of xmath32 (see fig. [279]), like the densities of pions in the hard-wall model (see fig. [279]) , just as the densities of the hard-wall model (see fig. [279]) . the slope of xmath348 at xmath183 is given by xmath349 ,  end  aligned   ] with xmath348 . the predicate dyad of the asymptotics / qcds is , for the experimental value of xmath348 it falls between the values of jlab  xmath347 and the experimental value of 0 . . . This discrepancy has a general reason . . . the asymptotic ad / qcd prediction is that of  xmath355gev  xmath328, that is, the asymptotic value of xmath348, is not the same as the asymptotic value of   ,   ,   ,  end  aligned  ] On the premise that pions are forms, they are formed as by a conjunction, a force, in the form of an integral, defined by the function xmath337 that is the charge density inside a pion. However, as opposed to the xmath359 form, when the density was simply given by xmath359, the density has an additional term proportional to xmath360 and, thereby, has a dependent coefficient, indicative of the symmetry breaking mechanism. We therefore established two wave functions, sturm-liouville, scalar and scalar, which describe the pion in terms of an effective field or a current, without specifying whether the current is of spin- 1 or 2 fields, or of scalar fields, etc. These wave functions provide a very convenient framework for the study of pion-physical physics. As a result, we described a formalism which allows to recover the pion form factor within the framework of a holographic dual-type qcd. , it is believed, that if the wall is softened, a larger pion is possible. We tested it by applying the hard-wall model ref. xcite to the hard-wall model. In this model, the pion decay constant was mostly determined by @xmath362; this was relatively small, and the correction by @xmath195 was negligible. However, in the extremely important domain of @xmath366, the pion decay constant was determined chiefly by @xmath370, and there were hardly any significant corrections in the value of @xmath195 by @xmath372. Besides, for small @xmath369, the radius of the pion was given by @xmath370, i.e., the size of the pion was absolutely determined by the boundary, so we argued that if the boundary is softened, the size of the pion may be increased by a sufficient amount to accommodate the data. Nevertheless, when xmath373f was fixed, the pion's size was xmath373fm. the letter was submitted to a web-site, and we learned that the letter addressing the same problem had been posted to the arxive. In the course of the research and writing of this paper, we have learned that the same paper was published in a peer-reviewed journal, i.e., no. Xcite, in which the same subject is dealt with. We showed that the wall model was able to fit the experimental value of the pion-charged radius. h.g. would like to thank a . . . Thomas for valuable comments and support in the jefferson laboratory, and j. p. draayer for support at the louisiana university. This fundamental reason for the discrepancy is a very general one: the asymptotic prediction of the pion form factor is at xmath377, and if we take the experimental value of xmath193 into account, we obtain an at xmath378                                                        m s ve   n  theor      ! » . . . h. b. . . filho and n. r. f. braga, jhep 03.05 . . . ; eur . . . jhep 03.05 . . . . t. sakai and n. r. f. braga, jhep 03.05 . . . l. da rold and a. pomarol, nucl. b. . . . , a . . . e. . . e. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
