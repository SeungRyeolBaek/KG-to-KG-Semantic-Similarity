The laser cooling method, applied to atoms and ions, is a very successful technique for cooling atoms in the ground state of a harmonic potential. laser cooling is used for this purpose by combining two stable, metastable internal levels, which we call xmath0 and xmath1, connected by dipole transitions to a common excited state xmath2 . In the oblique regime, in which xmath9 is negligible, the probability of changing the motion state is negligible, and thus, on average, the system is cooled at a rate of one phonon of energy per cycle. with a modulated pulse, the atom is coherently transferred from xmath0 to xmath1 by a raman pulse, followed by a re-spattering pulse, in which the atom is irrevocably re-spread into xmath0 by means of a laser which resonant with xmath3. this procedure usually involves alternating pulses, a coherent pulse, in which the atom is coherently transferred from xmath0 to xmath1 by a well-conceived raman pulse, and a re-spattering pulse, in which the atom is incoherently re-spread into xmath0 by means of a laser resonant with xmath3. This is the most important of all the methodological and logical conditions for the cooling of atoms and atoms. However, there is no single system of studies that excludes branching ratios in their treatment. This is the case with the so-called “dawn-radiant” region. In this respect we develop a system of calculations, in which we set out to quantify the effect of branching ratios on the cooling of a particular arbitrary domain, with the assumption that we can quantify the average coefficient of variation for the effective transition of two levels. In this case, we take the three-level atom Fig.1 (i.e., Fig.2), which has an internal state of a ground state, stable, metastable, and excited state of a radiative width of xmath17; Xmath17, Xmath17 are dipole transitions with the respective probability of decay @xmath19, xmath20. Spectacles are resonantly driving the transition @xmath18 with rabi frequency @xmath22. in this case, we infer the average coefficient of the double photon scattering at an arbitrary ratio  xmath4 @xcite. You have at last found the relaxation super operator, in the form of @xmath37, where @xmath37 is the dipole pattern of the spontaneous emission, which we take at xmath37. In writing - 1 coherent1 -      ,    - -(emb - mb - right,    rhoe - left [   rhoe - right] , nc> transition, which we take to be zero, and  =  3 - -  - entanglement and 1 - definition. math50> and math51> jump operators, defined as: where math50 and math51 the solution of the hamiltonian math47, and where math51 jumps : where math50 and math51 the solution of math51, the hamiltonian math51, the jump operators, defined as: where math50 and math51 the effective hamiltonian math47, the jump operators defined as: where math50 and math51 the effective hamiltonian math51, math48 jump : where math50 and math51 the solution of math50 and math51 the hamiltonian math47 math50. It is also possible to equrate the variation and the variance of the energy distribution of the atom at the end of the pulse, and that is, for example, by using 'xmath' . That is, if the atom was scattered into 'xmath' at the end of the pulse . . . in a pulse of duration of xmath62, we can replace 'xmath' by 'xmath' and assume that the atom was scattered into 'xmath' at the end of the pulse . . . Now each term of 'xmath' corresponds to the trajectory of a certain number of scattered events into 'xmath1' before the atom is scattered into 'xmath0' . Now we can estimate the shift and the variance of the energy distribution at the end of the repumping pulse, which is defined as: 'xmath', where 'xmath' and 'l' are the initial motional energies of the atom. , ' (extends) in ' xmath82' we see that ' xmath82' is the probability of the atom being found in the state @ xmath80 at @ xmath59, given the first state @ xmath81 at @ xmath82 . * By substituting ' explicit' into 'eqs' (expended), 'revi', 'rev' , 'rev', 'rev' (rev'd') , 'rev' is the reverberation of the wave by the double-level transition @ xmath90 . . . to which the second term in rhs of eqs.

(Shark =Wright =Hall 28] where xmath83 is the Lamb-Drew =6 [detail ] . . . . by substituting the explicit form (tilde) of @ xmath69 in the (Deli) form of @ xmath79, we find the form @ xmath80, where we have used the relation @ xmath84, with the form of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator . . . the reduction of the pressure of the atom to , and so for @ xmath101, the system is still in the lamb-grain regime when it is finally scattered into @ xmath0 . Besides, the coarse grained dynamics of the system can be described by a rate equation for the motion of the state @ xmath103 projected onto @ xmath0, where the rate of cooling (heating) is the real part of the sum of two terms: one corresponding to the component of the dipole force at the frequency of @ xmath6 (@ xmath104), and the other to the diffusion coefficient from spontaneous emission of the 'unc' state. In this way, it is a certain determination of the coefficient of cooling. From the well-known solution of the rate equation @ xcite, the diffusion coefficient affects the average resonant number @ xmath106, which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient. from the well-known solution of the rate equation @ xcite, the diffusion coefficient affects the steady state average vibrational number @ xmath106, which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient. The first term of rhs of eq. (Eta-eta-eq.) is compared with the complete expression for @ xmath97 for different values of the lamb-grain parameter and as a function of xmath20. So, to counteract the average rise of the energy from xmath111, it is necessary to consider the following: xmath112, where xmath113 is the projection on xmath30 of the two-photon wave vector of a coherent pulse. In this manner, the master equation acquires the form xmath125. Here, the diffusion is larger, and the efficiency of cooling is decreased greatly as xmath20 increases. So, we can also take the level of fig. 3, where we have added a 'interface' fig. 3 (a) to the fig. a laser resonantly drives the transition from xmath123 to xmath124 with the rabi frequency of xmath124. in this limit the master equation assumes the form xmath125. Thus, the volume of the beam, the frequency of the decay, is increased, and the cooling efficiency increases as xmath120 increases. Then the eq. ' ' is taken into account, for the order xmath110, and the eq. ' . . . It follows that for low saturation eq. (Mastermany) a fourth laser is used to drive the transition of xmath138, which is cyclic, aligned to xmath137 (yellow arrow in fig. 3 (b)). In this case the solution of eqs. (Center1), [width1] is the same as for the second state Xmath134, where a second excited state Xmath134 is coupled to xmath13 via the same recycled laser tuned to the transition xmath13. thus, the total heating is minimum for xmath146, which can be obtained by mixing the laser intensity with the repumping lasers, or by removing any degeneracy. (Although the result of the calculations at xmath13 is not a calculation, it shows that the heat is minimum for xmath146, which can be obtained by reducing the laser intensity of the repumping lasers, or simply by removing degeneracy. Thus, in a similar way, we have assessed these quantities for other schemes, such as those shown in Fig. 3 (b), where a second excited state – xmath134 is coupled to a second excited state – xmath13 via the same laser tuned on the transition – xmath136 (blue arrow in fig. 3 (b)) . the authors acknowledge many stimulating discussions with s. khler and v. ludsteck . . . g. m. thanks to j. i. cirac, j. eschner, and p. lambropoulos for their stimulating discussions.
