The new scalar particle with mass of xmath10, atlas xmath11 gev (atlas xcite) @ xcite, @ xmath12 gev (mss) @ xcite, has properties consistent with the long-awaited higgs boson of the standard model (sm) @ xcite , whose properties are confirmed by the presence of a gravity pole – see ref. - ref. - and the calculations for the theoretical measurement of this sm are all very complicated. The most economical model, which can account for neutrino masses, oscillations, and the formation of dark matter in the universe, is the neutrino minimal standard model ( @ xmath14msm) @ xcite , the most efficient model, that is, the one that is, liable to account for neutrino masses, oscillations, and dark matter, is the neutrino minimal standard model (@ xmath14msm) @ xcite . this discovery implies that the proton pole in the higgs self-action is well above the quantum gravity scale (atlas ) @ xcite . , e. g. ref. The presence of these neutral particles produces a fine-tuned problem for the Higgs mass. The large mass of the Higgs results in a fine-tuned problem for the Higgs mass. The theory of i seesaws (for a review see ref. @ xcite) consists in the assumption of a possible solution to the hierarchy of dark matter on the electroweak scale (see e.g. e.) , title = “fig : ” , 0%] , 01% , 01%, 01% , 10%, (89) , title = “fig : ” , 10%, 0%, 00" , 10@ xcite>, 4«««, 10«, 10« all fermions have both left- and right-handed components and masses below the fermi-seq-seq , title =    ; 2| « « , title =  «, width= 48 They also have the property of allowing the sm-gap to form a baryon-asymmetry of the universe and of supplying dark matter. The phenomenology of gev-gaps has already been studied in refs. * * the gev-gaps of subclass (three) are capable of solving all the major problems of the sm-gap, and the search for such particles is the guiding goal of the present work. The gev-gaps of subclass (39) are capable of solving all the major problems of the sm-gap, and the present aim is to search for such particles. The most general renormalisable of all sm-gaps, and the trio of doublets (for the gauge group)) fermions, is @ xmath24, where @ xmath24, , , , where @ xmath28 is the superscript, where  xmath28 is the sm-gap doublet, and @ xmath30 are the relevant yukawa couplings. The last term is the majorana mass term, which is permitted since the sm-gap charges of @ xmath1 are not gauge charges. The dark matter candidate Xmitry hnl does not contribute to the number of relativistic neutrino species detected recently by the Planck satellite Xcite. At the same time, a very large number of cp-violating phases leads to a number of parameters which have the effect of making the baryon asymmetry in the universe, a perfect storm , the most interesting of which is the type @xmath_14msm. in this model the lightest singlet, xmath_32, has a weak cp-violence with the other leptons and plays no role in active neutrino mass generation. The weight of these parameters, the corresponding number of mixing angles between the active neutrino and the two mass differences, has been determined by low-energy neutrino experiments @xcite. For the main part, hnls with the specified mass and the two mass differences have been measured by low-energy neutrino experiments at xcite. Having known this model, we can find the lightest fermion fermion, @xmath32, which has a very weak fusion with other leptons, and thus does not play any role in active neutrino mass production. This particle is detected by searching for a narrow line in the x-ray spectrum, resulting from radiative decays @xmath33 (see ref. ). ; a small mixing between neutral leptons and active neutrinos would enable hnls to produce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe, and would explain why this was not observed in experiments yet . . . a small mixing between neutral leptons and active neutrinos would enable hnls to produce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe and would explain why the particles have not yet been observed in experiments. . . . Figure taken from ref. — , width = 75. - In the early universe, a large number of neutrino particles would have brought the hnls and active neutrinos to equilibrium, above the high temperature of electroweakness, and therefore would eliminate any baryon asymmetry in the universe. . . . the permitted mixing angles are small and the hnls are much longer-lived (by a factor of about a factor of about xmath47) than sm particles of the same mass (see fig. [ sm]). The limits of the direct experiments are indicated in fig. [ exp.] [shows the boundaries from direct experiments, fig. [Experimental], fig. For the following plots the regions of the lifetime – mass plane are shown in fig. [Abstract] the figure presents the region of the length of the lifetime – mass plane consistent with the cosmological constraints. In this case the figure shows the permitted region of the lifetime – mass plane, consistent with the constraints of particle physics. The final state of hnl – to active neutrino mixing is called – hnl – (dist] in a laboratory experiment. The branching fractions of hnl – to active neutrino mixing are always below 2 %. For the four decays, the most promising in the search are – hnl – to active neutrino mixing, the hnl, which is always below 2 %. The final state of hnl – to active neutrino mixing, with branching fractions of xmath61 and a factor of xmath63, would need more than xmath64 and xmath49 mesons to fully explore the parameters of the hnl – and for that reason the studies will proceed. As a result of the considerations of the cosmological influences, the limits of hnls have been extended. The results of experiments on experimental design are given in ref. sent> . the proposed experiment will rely on a proton beam with a fixed target and produce a great many ko ko ko. . . . the average ko ko ko ko is a very large polar angle with respect to the direction of the beam, as shown in fig. . . pth ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko for the entire time , hno-ko. . . . to maximise the geometrical tolerance for the intercostal size of the detector, the detector’s volume must be placed so close that the transverse size of the detector is at the same time close as possible to the transverse diameter of the detector, which therefore has to be placed in the right, where the the size of the detector is as small as the smoky ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko can be removed, and in the ko in the ko ko ko ko can be increased by a slight increase of the angle of the light ko ko ko ko ko ko is affected by a ko ko in the koiko (supposing a large magnetis The object is therefore to balance the competing requirements of placing the detector as near as possible to the target, and of allowing the detector to accommodate a sufficiently long muon shield downstream of the target, to reduce the background background of the muon. . . . The detector must be capable of reconstructing the final state of the particles after the decay of xmath71, i.e., it is required to identify muons, to determine the flux and the direction of their flight in enough detail to reject backgrounds. It is necessary to minimize the background neutrino and background background of the muons at the source. The background neutrino and the background background of the muons in the detector constitute essential parameters in the design of the experiment. The interactions of neutrinos and muons in the material near the detector, can generate long-lived xmath77 mesons, such as neutral kaons, which decay in the detector and mimic the signal. In addition to this, the muon shield must be sufficiently long to suppress the background of the muons at the downstream end of the shield, and the concentration of muons in the radial compartment must be limited to a depth equivalent to or smaller than that which is lower than the maximum level of the radial compartment. the experimental results have been taken from the cern neutrinos to gran sasso (cngs) programme, over a nominal year, with 200 days of operation, 55 % of machine availability, and 60 % of the supercycle of the sps. This simulated decay produced @xmath78 protons per year. This experiment uses the same fraction of the beam time as cngs and the current sps performance. The technical apparatus proposed for the experiment assumes the same fraction of the beam time as cngs and the current performance of the sps. The experiments described here assume the same fraction of the beam time as cngs and the current performance of the sps. It should be noted that the experimental conditions for this experiment are similar to cngs, and the operation of the pilot programs is compatible with the operation of the lhc and the north area fixed target programs as they are now implemented. In particular, the preliminary investigation of the operational mode is minimal, makes the use of existing transfer lines, and is compatible with the operation of the lhc and the north area fixed target programmes as they are currently carried out. a tungsten target would be sufficient for a one-meter long target. With lifetimes of about xmath86s, the predominant fraction of xmath49 mesons decaying in flight is reduced by the use of a thin target material. As the neutrinos generated in charm decays, which can mix with hnls, have, therefore, a relatively high transverse momentum (as fig. [pthnl]) , it is necessary to have a small spot. So, the deposition of the energy deposition described above can be obtained by allowing the length of the beam to increase in a dedicated section of the main beam, and by using a combination of orthogonally deflecting magnets to generate a lissajous sweep across the target, like the lhc beam. the power density, however, must be reduced, in order to avoid thermal shocks in the target and to allow for effective heat extraction. As the charm decays, which mix with hnls, have a fairly high transverse momentum (see fig. pthnl) , there is no need for a small beam spot. the first two methods do not require as much power as the first two methods . . . for the same reason, the experiment does not impose any technical limitations on the optical parameters of the extracted beam. . . . for the present study, the accelerometer was mounted on a pair of proton beams from pythia, with an inertia of 400 mJ, and with a fixed target. After the accelerometer, a concrete wall sat between the target bunker and the portal of the corresponding thermo-mechanical study. The physical dimensions of the accelerometer were driven by the radiological requirements of the accelerometer (see section ssec: aerosols) . the accelerometer was also able to absorb the residual non-interacting protons (@xmath91 of the incident proton flux) and the electromagnetic radiation generated in the target. Then the second, tertiary or higher order decays of the pion and the kaon decays gave a more softer momentum spectrum that was more easily attenuated than the high-energy primary pion and the kaon decays that increased the requirements for the helmet. The impediment of the accelerometer was estimated from a sample of events by Pythia with a proton beam energy of 400 gy, a fixed proton target. For example, when one sees python beams containing 400 grams of a proton, one sees a blank, a locked proton target (see text for details). The resulting flux of the muons at a given momentum is shown in Fig. Fig. . . [39] The exponent of the exponent’s decay is the hadron decay, and if the rays were cast into the air to disperse the muons below 350 grams of a proton, this would reduce the flux of the hadron by about seven orders of magnitude, to o (one) muon per protons on target . . . ” . . . [41] The exponent’s droshge of the cursed flux is only a negligible fraction of the total flux of the excitation rays. The above Fig. 1 indicates that if a shield were placed against the motion of muons below 350 meters, the flux would be reduced by seven orders of magnitude to o(1] muon per protons on target. [43] The resulting flux of the excitation rays is shown in Figure 18. The main building of the experiment must be of such a height that it does not interfere with the running of the lab. This construction should be completed within the confines of the cern. Both the development and operation of the loop and the detector can be such that the interference of the construction and operation of the lab and the system is reduced. Then the exchange of beams and the detector must be built in such a way that they will not interfere with the working of the laboratory. The testing should take place within the confines of the cern. The vertical beam is cut away to a length of @xmath107 m, a shielding wall for amplification of air and radiation, and a uranium or tungsten absorber enclosed in iron and concrete. The location of the proposed target bunker near the tcc2 target area hints that it may be possible to take advantage of the general improvements which have already been announced for the current target area in the form of an oxidation water and air removal. a 60 m trench after the target bunker would allow for the installation of the muon shield, and an area at relatively low elevation just before the north-east hall would allow for the construction of the surface detector. soil tests will be needed to find out the exact location. The Site of the experiment must be in a position that allows for the use of existing facilities, and especially with the equipment for both air and water activation to be managed with minimal interference from the operating facilities. rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rs rs r lt; wr hr r i, a vacuum chamber with five meters diameter, of which a 10-meter radiiac cavity is formed. . . . and an additional radiiac cavity at the beginning of the radiiac cavity . . . The current two-dimensional detector, each of which has two almost identical detector elements, is shown in fig. Fig. , and in that place the double detector element is of a cylindrical vacuum chamber of five meters diameter, of which the first 10 meters is the decay volume, and the second ten meters are for the magnetic spectrometer. The pair of detector elements therefore consists of a cylindrical vacuum chamber of five meters diameter, in which is the radiiac cavity, the first 10 meters are the radiation volume, and the second 10 meters are for the magnetic spectrometer. The combined radiiac and detector for the muon detector are of two types, and are shown in fig. . . . and they are both circular and circular, of five metres long, of a length of about 5 meters in diameter. The depth of the vacuum chamber is 1m, and the thickness and resolution are also matched, to give a similar contribution to the overall resolution (see fig. . . . ) . therefore, the proposed detector will be composed of two almost identical detectors, as depicted in fig. . . . . . , scaled by 8 %. a progress report on a dipole magnet, like the lhcb magnet at xcite, with a free aperture of almost 16m at xcite, and a field integral of 9-9 tm. in the left and right panels there are represented the moments of the decay products, with the magnitudes of the smallest ones. a hnl with a mass of 1 g is assumed. a momentum window is indicated for the measured momenta, and it is necessary for the harder of the two decay products. For the dipole magnet of the lhcb magnet, as shown in Figure 9 (fig. 9), with an outer dimension of @xmath120m @xmath120m, and two al-99 .7 coils, the proposed magnet has a peak field of @xmath123tm, and an axocore of @xmath123tm over a length of @xmath124m . the bg magnet mentioned above contains @xmath125 more iron in its yoke, and emits three times more power. The programmer, according to a test plan, is very well established. The data of the lhcb-shashlik thermometer has obtained energy of @ xmath129, which is in the same energy range as the magnetic spectrometer, in the range of 10 to 20 ms. a low-energy measuring-system with a modest energy resolution will therefore significantly improve the potential of the proposed experiment. the data from this spectrometer will be transferred to a reader in the pc-factory to be processed in the event-building. a recording-system based on the type envisaged by lhcb @ xcite will suffice for the proposed experiment. The reading system will be placed on to read-out boards, and the data will be transferred to a pc-factory to perform the events. to determine the ratio of charged current to charged current in the downstream muon-protection channel. This correlation will be accomplished on line, and the storage of data is negligible. the energy-resolved micrometer demonstrates a resolution of  xmath115, comparable to that of the proposed magnetic spectrometer of the 10 to 20 gyr energy range. a dead-time, irreproachable monitor, such as that proposed by lhcb to upgrade xcite, would suffice for the proposed experiment. Using the geant to simulate the spectrum of neutrino effects produced by a 400-gauge proton beam on a cu target, the result is four times greater than the estimate from the charm. This rate is roughly equivalent to the range of neutrino impacts which the geant graph shows in a w target. In the first five m of the decay space two - pron poles are the principal source of protons, whereas in the remaining 35 m of the decay space - a ratio of two pron poles is formed by protons on the target. This ratio is compatible with the measures taken by nomad @xcite. The projection of the neutrino interactions in the atom barrier, which is filled with air, results in a rate of @xmath134 neutrino poles per xmath131 protons on the target. An increase of atmospheric pressure in the atom barrier is sufficient to reduce this rate to a negligible degree. This rate is conservatively calculated and is conservatively used to judge the background. Two prongs are most likely to be detected on the cu target, and in the second mile of the atom the second mile the second mile, two-prong vertices are chiefly of xmath135 and xmath137 decays, and in the remaining 35 m of the atom, a rate of xmath138 is occurring. , there is a number of candidates for Xmath141. The ip of a candidate is also used to reject possible background produced by neutrino interactions in the surrounding material, for example, by the vacuum tank or the floor, and by cosmic rays. If the candidate is shown to be advantageous, the last interaction lengths of both the muon shield and the muon filter could be instrumented to detect the products of neutrino interactions. The precision of the proposed experiment depends on the final states used to reconstruct the decay of the signal, and on the sequence of couplings between neutrino generations and hnls. The relationship between @ xmath142 and dts, as shown in ref. xcite, the strongest limits of @ xmath142 come from the charm experiment at xcite and are in the @ xmath41 level for a mass of 0 .5 g and a few times @ xmath147 . the theoretical allowed region for @ xmath146 is between @ xmath41 and @ xmath147 . The theoretically allowed region for @ xmath146 is between @ xmath41 and @ xmath147 . The probability of decay is estimated with simulated events for different values of xmath142 and the efficiencies are assumed to be 100 %. The mnemonic can be described as the product of the probability that the hnls decay in the fiducial volume, and the trigger and reconstruction efficiency . . . in the final state of the hnls, e.g. xmath75, can be investigated, where the xmath165 is increased, thereby doubling the yield of the signal . This results in a definite correlation between the mnemonic number and the quality of the mnemonics, e.g. xmath167. The electromagnetic calorimeter allows the reconstruction of decay in a state with a neutral pion, such as xmath75, which resembles xmath165, which in the final state is reconstructed, e.g. Xmath165, and , assuming a point in the highly favored region with xmath161 , xmath162 and xmath163 of the air, a total of xmath160 events will be observed, four orders of magnitudes larger than the number expected in the charm experiment. The electromagnetic calorimeter allows to recover the decay modes with neutral pions in the final state, such as xmath75, where the xmath165 is included, allowing the signal to be multiplied. The possibility of decay is estimated by simulation with different values of xmath142 and efficiencies are assumed to be 100 %. At the intersection of the beams, the beams of the 800- and 120-mn fnal beams, protons of the target and protons of the target, respectively, and the beam of the kek-atom beam with protons of the target and protons of the target , and of the kek-atom beams of the target, if necessary, ten points lower than in the proposed sps experiment, whereas the kek-atom beam has a factor of ten points lower than in the proposed sps experiment, but this result is highly uncertain because of the poor understanding of the magnet cross section at low energies. , but also a considerably longer muon filter is necessary in this regard, for it would be much more difficult, leading to an extremely large loss of acceptability. Hence, for the experiment of colliding beams at the lhc, assuming a luminosity of 1000 lb@xmath174 and a strength of 14tev, as a result of three or four years of the high luminosity upgrade. in a colliding beam experiment, the sensitivity of the colliding beams is estimated as follows: if a luminosity of 1000 lb @xmath174 and an energy of 14tev, as is to be expected in three or four years, if the high luminosity is to be upgraded. The beams to be investigated are the beams of the 800 and 120-meter fnal beams, with a protons in target and a protons in target, respectively; and the kek-30-meter beam with a protons in target . If we're to enter the 'Curtain's Cross section for a first, we must be offended at the level of a charm! The cross section for beauty mesons, in a first class sense, means that the limits that could be derived from a dedicated experiment at the lhc would be four orders of magnitude lower than those calculated for the theory of baryon asymmetry. the significance of a discovery of a 'Curtain's Cross' in a first class sense would be difficult to overstate. The proposals are being discussed actively with experts in particle physics. We thank s. gninenko and a. flegel for their helpful suggestions and for their contributions to the design of the magnet. w . rademakers for providing the three-dimensional diagram of the experiment. The ethereal picture is very complex and needs much experimentation. The sps at cern is therefore an ideal location for the proposed experiment to search for hnls. In general, the design of the beam line is a very difficult task, especially the extraction and the target of the beam, and the radiological aspects are also an important topic for further research. In addition, the results of this experiment, together with cosmological and astrophysical data, could be important to determine the nature of dark matter. Besides, the results of this experiment, together with the cosmological and astronomical data, could be very important to determine the nature of dark matter. j . ellis et al. , phys. ch / record / 1542387. b 679 (2009) 369, arxiv: hep- ex / 1207 . d. gorbunov and m. shaposhnikov, jhep- ex / 1205 . f. bezrukov, m. y. kalmykov, b. a. kniehl and m. shaposhnikov, jhep- ex / 1207 . f.
