And he wished to confirm this, but not just because he did not fit the model. For the conjuction of a dijet he would be the resonance of a non-identity atom of mass 150 tev, which decays principally into two jets of hadron. The calculations have been made by the cdf and a paper was collected at the tevatron, with a center of mass of 1 . 96 tev and an integrated luminosity of 4 . 3 fb . the dijet system is found to be an invariant resonance with a mass of 150 tev, which in the majority decays into two jets of hadron. This implies that a new particle has been discovered in the space of a certain distance . . . On the theoretical side, our understanding of the parton distributions and related matter has room to improve to make sure that this surplus represents genuine new physics beyond xcite . . . the excess has to be further confirmed . . . Some hypothetic particles of the pendulum supernumerary over-weakness, called the leptophobic model, a jet vector, a scalar, a scalar, a quasi-inert higgs-bolts-bosons-cdd, and the other possibilities at xcite. Although the couplings of quarks and gluons are the same as the quark couplings of qcd, at the tevatron and at the lhc the color triplet diquark is excluded, at the tevatron, and at the tevatron and at the lhc. the mass difference, at xmath10 gev, at xmath11 gev, at xmath11 ... of these scalars is also found in the present work. Here, here is the scalar which is colored and couples directly to quarks. Such scalars are those scalars which are colored and connect directly to quarks. . . . In this work we conduct a systematic study of the possibility of colored scalars of xmath19, in that a new particle explains the excess of xmath19 in two ray jets. . . . if the coupling between quarks and gluon is smaller than the coupling between quarks and gluon, the constraints are weaker. . . . the color sextet diquarks with electric charge, , , , , , , , , , are excluded from lhc @ xcite , whereas lhc data is limited to xcite . . . some aspects of colored scalars with relation to the cdf @ xcite . . . Two quarks (or an antiquark and a quark) . . . a complete list of over-sm scalars which can couple to sm fermions at the tree level. Some potential scenarios are excluded from this data, such as the ones from the taste-changing neutral current (fcnc) processes. We have found that, without forcing the yukawa couplings to be of special forms, most of the scalars, except the @ xmath5, are in a bad way suited to fcnc data. However, we have found that some cases may be overcome in consistency with all the data by adjusting their couplings, providing a possible explanation for the excess of cdf. And, besides, we have found that, with this information, some other cases may be found that are in keeping with all the data, that is, in the case of flavor changing neutral current (fcnc) processes. Moreover, the color scalars have a fascinating signature at the relativistic heavy ion collider (rhic) and the large hadron collider (lhc) which can be used to distinguish between different /sent> . The papers are organized as follows: in section cs , we study possible colored scalars that can be coupled to two quarks (or to a pair of quarks and an antiquark) and calculate their yukawa couplings by requiring that the colored scalar with a mass of 150 gev should explain the excesses of the cdf # xmath_dijet excess data . . . In section cs , we consider the constraints of cs data on colored scalar couplings. We also consider the implications of cs , cs and cs. The paper is divided into sections: in sections: cs . . . . and cs . . . and the color scalar scalar scalar scalars which can be paired to two quarks or to a pair of quarks and anti-quarks can easily be found by examining the biproducts of two quarks, or with the output of two quarks, or a pair of quarks and an anti-quark. When the rays of light meet on the right side, he will not generate a big amount of light. When the rays meet on the left side, it will only produce a small amount of light because it is not directly forming a strong connection with the rays of light. To get the greatest possible result of the rays of light from the rays, we will consider the following rays which are capable of bonding to left side quarks, where  and  are the rays of light. a solid, wavy, dashed line indicates the quark or antiquark, Xmath50 and Xmath18, respectively. - xmath46, and - xmath47 process in Xmath49 production . - , the component of physics in Xmath46 production, as shown in fig. - , the physics is divided into the ratios of @xmath47 and - xmath47. - , it's necessary to know how the colored scalars couple with the quarks and the xmath1 particle . A thin-film tangent is provided by @xmath59, where @xmath618 is the ckm-quad mixing matrix, and @xmath60 ( @xmath618 @ xmath62 , 63 ) , 63 , 33 , 33 ) , math26 are the differential converging moduli in flavor space. The electroweak moduli of colored scalars are obtained from the following: @xmath72, where @xmath73 is the sine of the fauna angle, @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , which is based on the second color indices, which are suppressed and which are found in interaction with sented> . As interactions and masses of colored scalars are fixed, the only unknown parameters—the yukawa couplings—are known, and the only unknown parameters—for a colored scalar is to explain the color data for the cdf @xmath1dijet_. . . . in order to avoid the contribution of xmath82 to the xmath82 parameter, we assume that all the components have the same masses. For example, if xmath51 and xmath52 are color-octet and xmath52, xmath77 diquarks are the predominant contributors to the production of xmath19. Because the yukawa-coupling matrix is anti-symmetric in the generation space, the dominant contribution would be from xmath79 (which contains xmath80 and xmath81 quarks suppressed by cabibbo mixing) . the simulation result for the case of color octet scalars @xmath51 with @xmath84 aconi. in fig. xmath49 the cross-sectional part at the tevatron is estimated to be two pb (without multiplying by @xmath85 a cosine) . . . we take the same kinematical cuts as the ones denoted in ref. we use the same kinematical cuts as those denoted in ref. jets are defined in cone algorithm with @xmath83 aconi., pythia aconi and pythia @xcite for the particle-level event generation, and pgs aconi444 for the fast detector simulation . . . and for other cases , we have obtained similar distributions. They are mostly due to being a tetrahedral or a tetrahedral assymetrical as Xmath90. For color octet scalars, the large yukawa-cables are due to the fact that the tevatron is a collider at Xmath91, therefore the diquark must take one of the sea-quarks whose distribution function is suppressed. In the first place, the decay-width of these scalars is less than one gev for color-octet scalars, but much closer to xmath90 for diquarks. – Two comments are to be made on the large scales of color-octet yukawa couplings, which may be at a loss for the total decay width and constraints due to the direct search for such scalers, such as those conducted at the ua2@xcite. These decay widths are such that it is reasonable to view the width of the dijet resonance as the result of the resolution of the jet momentum measurement. The diquark-like production of the scalars which couple to quarks is constrained by the two-jet invariant mass spectrum which is measured in the ua2 experiment. For a certain number of Gev. X——, we know that the cross section for x——98 in p—— is the cross section for x—— _________________, as for a certain number of Gev. _______________._____________ and a few or several gev for a few more to several Gev. x———, the cross section for x——— ___________ in p——. from the above values, we can see that the couplings in eq. ____________________________________________ cannot be excluded by the ua2-weighted measurement . It was about -106 pb, which is about 23 % of xmath104 in the sm estimation. It was about -110 pb, which is 23 % of xmath102 in the leading-order analysis. - We now consider the constraints from new fcnc interactions by colored scalars, which might be capable of large meson-antymijections. - Now we study the constraint of meson-antymijection by colored scalars. This constraint can be induced by a large sm component  xmath103. This fraction is similar to  xmath103. The phenomenological studies of the doublet scalar can be found in  xcite. So, although the statistics of dibosion in the xmath104 phase have not been statistically significant yet, it is still a matter of study whether these large yukawa couplings are consistent with the results . . . if @ xmath109 is not diagonal, the exchange of @ xmath110 is also the subject of fcnc interaction, which may cause too great an exchange of @ xmath114 with @ xmath115, and the exchange of @ xmath115 with @ xmath117. @ xmath115, which is caused by @ xmath110, is mixed. This is a kind of scalar propagation. * As the chain is a first yukawa branch, it has @ xmath111 + @ xmath107, and we have: @ xmath113 + @ xmath115. Xmath114-xmath115 mixing-organism by @xmath114 is induced by @xmath1-xmath18 and Xmath18-xmath18 , we define the following quantities: @xmath123, where @xmath124 is the mass of @xmath18bcc, and @xmath127 . . . [p. 260] The following equations: @ xmath121 where @ xmath124 is the mass of @xmath184bcccccc, and @ xmath127 . . . [ fcnc] [p. . .] [p. . . [p. . . ]. Xmath135 and Xmath136 terms are from the xmath1 - xmath18 box diagram, and Xmath137 terms are from the xmath1 - xmath18 box diagram. xmath138 and xmath139 terms are from the xmath1 - xmath18 box diagram. The short distance contribution has its doubts, which are mainly attributed to the mass of the quark and the qcd correction . We show the ratio of the leading order @ xmath138 in eq . (Curtain - value) . under the current assumption, @ xmath140 , we find that the term @ xmath139 contributes more than the contribution from the charm mass and qcd correction. They assume a relative reduction of the scalar coefficient of a given axis of rotation. And so they assume a reduction of the arithmetic coefficient of a given axis of rotation, and, consequently, consistent with the experimental result of the kaon difference. The proportion of this proportion is less than 2 %, and therefore, in accordance with experimental experiments, smath145 . . . the imaginary proportion of the mixing amplitude produces an indirect cp anomaly in xmath114 - xmath115. The equations of xmath145 - xmath146 can be computed by replacing xmath147, xmath132, xmath133, and xmath134 as before, and they are found to be less than 1 % of the standard model prediction as well as the experimental result. At the same time, as in the previous case, in order to avoid the possibility of large yukawa couplings, we construct the illustration of the form (xmath151) with xmath151 . the contribution is very small (xmath159%) from the experimental value for the yukawa coupling, which is chosen from the excess of @xmath17 . . . and the mixture amplitude of xmath151 must be diagonal . . . , the ratio of @xmath151 to @xmath150 is too small (xmath150% of the experimental value) for the value of yukawa coupling chosen from the excess of @xmath17 . . . In this case, the contribution of xmath17 is at xmath15 , where xmath155 and xmath158 operators are the bag parameters from the matrix elements of the operators, xmath157 and xmath158, respectively, between xmath85 msons, and @xcite . xmath111-xmath112 mixing is little more than xmath166 in the xmath165-xmath165 model, but the short distance sm contribution of xmath111-xmath112 is very small compared to the short distance sm contribution , it is believed that xmath168 will allow the xmath112 to make a long distance contribution to the sm. But, however, the short distance sm contribution of xmath111-xmath112 mixing is very small compared to the experimental result; meanwhile, a large xmath1 - xmath18 box contribution (corresponding to the xmath135 term) is received by the xmath112 amplitude , which is comparable to the short distance sm one . But the amplitude of @xmath174 ( @xmath174) must be small, resulting in the amplitude of one of the @xmath176 squabbles much smaller than the other . . . we conclude that the pairs with @xmath49 are neither Xmath49 nor Xmath47. These types may be forbidding one of the xmath177 pairs by a discrete xmath178 symmetry, such as xmath179 and xmath180, and xmath181 to make up for xmath180 . . . but this yields a large contribution to the amplitude of Xmath172 ( xmath174) amplitude proportional to xmath174 (xmath174) . . . we conclude that the cases with xmath51 couples to either xmath174 or xmath176. _Xmath,_12 of _xmath_185 . . . Its upper limit is _xmath_185 , and _xmath_190 is a degree of dividualisation with a dimension of _xmath_184. It is possible to reduce these contributions by removing @ xmath190, by selecting @ xmath191 , where @ xmath192 is a degree of cabibbo mixing ,_xmath_189. The phenomenological study of color sextets and triplets can be found in the xcite . The sextet diquark @ xmath52 with yukawa couplings required to explain the excess of cdf @ xmath0dijets, will lead to too great mixing in xmath111-xmath114 and xmath114-xmath115 in conflict with the data . I believe that, though this seems somewhat unnatural and difficult to explain to the reader, compared to the octet case, it is not ruled out yet from a purely phenomenological point of view. however, the contributions to the tree-level meson-antimeson mixture are too large. And thus the contribution to the tree-level contributions to the loops is too great . . . for the diquark @ xmath198 is an extra-factor of @ xmath198 and @ xmath197 is a small percentage of the contributions to @ xmath198, while the contributions to @ xmath198 are proportional to @ xmath198, and the amplitude of the contributions to @ xmath197 are by @ xmath199 for the xmath200 and the xmath if we take the form of @xmath83 we consider a similar analysis as in the preceding section by assuming that @xmath53 is incorporated into the @xmath197 basis. For @xmath103 we take the form of @xmath203; it interferes with the standard model amplitude of 40 % (notwithstanding the color suppression of the process), for @xmath207 and @xmath208 gev, which counters the experimental result of the branching ratio of @xcite: br (@xmath209. In the case of @xmath53, the same analysis can be applied as in the previous section by introducing @xmath103 and @xmath204 as appropriate couplings to right-handed quarks. [8] and vice versa. What's more, in the case of @xmath76 diquark, the diquark's coupling is a symmetric matrix, and the @xmath176 the @xmath176 box contribution is also vanished by the color anti-symmetricity. @xmath216 for @xmath215 and @xmath216 gev, chosen from the excess of @xmath0dijet, the box contribution is the same size as the short-range sm contribution. While these quantities are permissible in the presence of certain Hasronic uncertainty, they nevertheless draw this scenario to the allowed boundary. Besides, xmath223 is a symmetric matrix, so one can select the values of xmath224 and xmath225 as zero to avoid a spice decay. In this case, the yukawa values are the same as those of fcnc. We have shown that the color triplets, Xmath76 and Xmath53, can also have a leptoquark coupling, xmath227 in general, and it is very difficult to induce too rapid nucleon decay. We will continue to present the results in Table 1 of the Colored Scalars, and their fcnc constraints. We conclude that xmath22 is asymmetric matrix, and thus one can choose xmath224 and xmath225 to be zero, so that the colored sm is consistent with experiments. "Leaf," 'Leaf', 'Leaf', 'Leaf', 'Lot', 'seize,' (I shall take it that they would follow a common natural law) . . . There are other situations which conform to fcnc calculations. , and the theoretical basis for them is . . . (as a matter of fact, some of the preliminaries are shown in fig.) , but it is also shown that the cross section will change in the case of the right-hand quark . . . . . as we have referred to 'the 'the 'clear 'atmosphere'. By this cleave-hooping and intersection of a right-hand quark with the right-hand quark, the cross section is always the same. For the cross section at xmath76, the correct -hoop is the same . . . . . . The ratio of the right-hand quarks to the right-hand quarks can also be examined at the rhic level. By a transition of the proton beam into the beam of xcite, it is possible to test the chiral structure of the diquarks to quarks. Xmath194 production cross-section has no dependency on the couplings to the right-hand quarks, but Xmath105 production cross-section has little dependence on the couplings to the right-hand quarks, for xmath234 couplings are smaller than xmath235 couplings. Note that @ Xmath49 production cross-section has no dependence on the couplings to the right-hand quarks, but _xmath105 production cross-section has small dependence on the couplings to the right-hand quarks, because @ xmath234 couplings are smaller than the @ xmath235 couplings . - xmath240 pb, - xmath6 of the integrated luminosity is assumed. - xmath240 and - xmath240 gev . . .

The predicted major background are the same as those of the tevatron: @xmath245 and @xmath246 , and these are the colors: oct. , and for the color oct , the studies in ref. xcite are also listed in ref. xcite , for example . The theoretical precision of the subject is 265, as is visible in ref. xmath245 and xmath246 respectively, with the ratio of signal-to- background @xmath248 for the events with the background of  math249 . . . detailed studies of signal-to- background at the lhc are described in ref. xcite. Following the study in ref. Xcite , in taking into account the background of qcd @ xmath1 jets, the signal-to- background ratio of @ xmath248 in the case of events with math249 [Gev] [Zev]. We have been analyzing the possibility of explaining the flux - @xmath-dijet excess by introducing colored scalars of the kind that have two quarks. These are colored scalars which, in passing through the power of two quarks, will naturally decay into dijet, which is the key property of the xmath-dijet excess. Since the Xmath-dijet excess requires a sizable coupling between the first generation of quarks, compared to the danglings of higgs, the sizable couplings must also be consistent with other experimental data. Among the scalars, the signal-to-to-frozen ratio is estimated to be xmath-dijet. However, all the scalars, especially the scalars, have no way of overcoming this Xmath-dijet excess. We analyzed fcnc constraints from the radiance of meson - antimeson data. It turns out that not all scalars can be successfully attributed to the xmath-dijet excess. When analyzing the phenomenological implications of the colours of the scalar, we noticed that a concrete realization of the chemistry of these coloured particles is difficult. The following scenario is just such as could be calibrated for a concrete realization. In addition to detecting the influence of a flavor symmetry on certain entries of the yukawa matrices, for example, the off-axis entries of the xmath109 for the octet, it is often the case that they are induced at loop level. In this sense all the scenarios we have just discussed should be treated as tinkering to achieve a concrete realization. Similarly, we have calculated some predictions for the diquark signal at the xmath263 colliders, the rhic and the lhc. , they did not find much excess in their analysis of xcite. They did not find any excess in their analysis of xcite. although d0 had examined the same excess, the method differed in some respects, which may be an important factor for a difference. The results are unaffected by the new cdf data. p. chiappetta, j. layssac, f. m. renard, and c. verzegnassi, phys. D1 and a second collaboration reported their results of analysis of xcite, with an integrated luminosity of 7 . 3 fb. Xmath6. they found no similar excess. Although d1 was interested in similar excesses, it is necessary to distinguish in a certain way some criterion which may be of importance to the difference in the analysis.
