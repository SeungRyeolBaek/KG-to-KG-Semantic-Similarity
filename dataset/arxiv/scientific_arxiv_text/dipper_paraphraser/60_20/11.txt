For example, in the previous model of the swarming desert locust, schistocerca gregaria, the dynamics of which was governed by the interaction between individuals, between other people, and with the environment, biological aggregations, such as fish schools, bird flocks, bacterial colonies, insect swarms have characteristic morphologies governed by the interactions of the members of the group with each other and with the environment. Generally speaking, we can describe this relationship as the combination of the the external and the internal forces, i.e. the internal and the external forces, and the equilibrium situation for them is in the present study. in some of the parameters of our study, which we have been discussing, locusts self-assemble into swarms, with a peculiar morphology, which is a bubble-like structure containing a dense group of locusts on the ground and a flying group of locusts on the air, as shown in Figure 1 (fig 1 ). locusts on the ground, when overtaken by the flying group, fly to the ground and join the flying group. locusts at the top of the swarm take flight and land on the ground. At the head, the swarm, when overtaken by the flying swarm, take off and land on the ground. (b) The first term on the right-hand side of (q: locusts) consists of the endogenous forces, [q: locusts], which measures the force that locust @xmath8 exerts on locust @xmath9, [q: locusts] , it is the first term of the first term q: locusts, the second term is repellent and operates more fiercely and on a shorter length scale, in order to prevent collisions , the second term is repellent, which is more powerful and over a shorter length scale, to prevent collisions . the static locusts rest and feed while they are rooted, so their motion in this state is negligible compared to their movement in the air. since locusts rest and feed while they are rooted, their motion in this state is negligible compared with their movement in the air. This so-called kinematic assumption is common in swarming models, and we will discuss it further in a moment. the first term on the right-hand side of ([eq] locusts] is a force that is contained in a certain space, [eq]; time and space are scaled so that the violent strength and the length scale are equal. The last term is a force that repels locusts, which are moved by gravity and exerts a disproportionately large force on locusts, [eq] locusts whose vertical velocity is computed to be negative under [eq] locusts remain stationary. The advantages of this method are that the simulation of discrete systems is straightforward, requiring only the integration of ordinary differential equations. Thus, the models for discrete systems are easy to deal with, and only require the integration of ordinary differential equations. in a one-dimensional domain, collapse is possible, provided the force is finite and attractive at short distances., and the analogous condition in the higher dimensions also leads to the asymmetry of the force. Many studies have sought conditions under which a population concentrates to a single mass. Here we have obtained the condition of the social interaction force xmath19. These conditions map out a phase diagram, dividing the space into regions of each behaviour, which is similar to that of the dynamic particle model xcite and its continuum analogy xcite. The general model xcite consists of at least three solutions, as shown in xcite . the density xmath19 obeys a conservation equation, whereas the velocity xmath19 is the velocity field, determined by convolution with the antisymmetrically induced, pairwise, antisymmetric force xmath19 , a one-dimensional analog of a social force like that in [eq] locusts . many studies have examined conditions in which a population consists to a fixed mass . For the most purely attractive (expressive) results, the only classical steady states are constant in space, as shown by a variational formulation of the steady-state problem @xcite. Many of the results examined above were obtained by exploiting the underlying gradient-flow structure of [eq: introeq2] . However, these solutions are not biological, for they contain infinite mass. there exists an energy function, at xmath,= frac  1  2      int  mathbb  r  r  f (x)  r  rho (x)  , dx, dx,  [] which is reduced by the dynamics. Many of the results discussed above were obtained by exploiting the underlying gradient flow of (eq : introeq ) . . . for the most purely attractive @ xmath19, the only classical states are constant in space, as shown by the variational formulation of the steady state problem @ xcite . . . however, these solutions are not biological, as they are infinite in mass. the rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section (s) formulation, we set up the mathematical framework for our study and derive the conditions necessary for a particular density to be an equilibrium solution and to be stable under various perturbations. We consider a bounded domain with no exogenous forces, a half-line with gravitational forces, and an unbounded domain with a quadratic potential, modeling the attraction of a light, a chemical, or a nutrient to the bounded domain. In the first two cases, we see an equilibrium, classical in the interior of the domain, but contains at the boundary @ xmath0 functions. for the third case, the equilibrium is compactly supported, and the density drops steadily to zero at the edge of the support. In all three cases, we compare analytical solutions of the continuum to equilibria obtained by numerical simulation of the underlying system. In the second section, titled 'receptive', we are concerned with purely receptive receptive interactions. We consider a bounded domain without exogenous forces, a half-circuit of gravitational influences, and an unbounded domain subject to a quadratic receptive potential, in which a light, a chemical, or a nutrient source are desired. for the third case, the equilibrium is compactly supported, the density dropping to zero at the edge of the support. For all three situations, we compare analytical solutions from the continuum framework to receptive solutions from numerical simulation of the underlying system. We assume that motion is governed by newton's law, so that the velocity is proportional to the sum of the drag and motive forces. This assumption is suitable for the case when the drag forces dominate the momentum, commonly known in fluid dynamics as the low reynolds number or stokes flow regime. The governing equations are of the form [eq. kinematics] . we will now consider the governing equations for a continuum limit of the discrete problem. The governing equations are of the form [eq. kinematics] [eq. kinematics have been used in numerous studies of the collective behavior, including q. ] . , in the swarming literature, the resulting models, which are first-order in time, are known as kinematics (as in the case of the locust (see q. )] ). In this sent the same interacting particles (the swarm members) are, in a spatial dimension, with points. In this sent, a and a and a  are, on the whole, the same. This is in keeping with the recommendation made in "Atoms", which has been repeatedly acknowledged in the literature as satisfying this requirement. (Even though the latter does not speak of all the mutual forces, gravity and common forms of chemotaxis have been explained in the literature, but they are all satisfied by this principle. In order to confine the problem to a particular domain, we may use the artifice of making the exogenous potential equivex on the complement of equim.) in order to constrain the problem to a particular domain, one may use the artifice of allowing the exogenous potential equima to tend to infinity on the complement of equima. a liquid model, such as (eq: discrete system) is advantageous for the analysis and simulation, but it is difficult to study. we will consider a continuum analog of eq: discrete system. As we have already noted in this regard, most of the particular models for mutual interaction forces in literature, for example, are based on this assumption. In this sense, we take the simplest form (Eq: discrete system) and construct a process of decreasing density, as we say @xmath15, equal to a sum of @xmath0 functions. These @xmath0 functions have force in xmath24 and are located at the positions of the particles: @xmath24. ) “My prepositions are: a theoretical energy that [1] is devoid of flux.

We call this support of @ xmath63 @ xmath62 . . . since the density is nonnegative, that restriction causes the perturbation of @ xmath63 to be nonnegative on @ xmath64, the complement of @ xmath62. We then analyze these variations in order to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a candidate solution of @ xmath63 to be a minimizer of @ xmath48. . . . so we have in mind @ xmath61 inspired by biological observations of swarms, we study equilibria finite in scale, and we take the support of @ xmath64 to be a finite subset of the domain of @ xmath35. . . . This the first class of perturbations which are derived from the xmath62. Now, as the perturbation of xmath63 is arbitrary and of zero mass, in order for the first variation @ xmath66 to vanish, it must be true that @ xmath72 can be given by the lagrange multiplier argument, including the constant mass as a constraint. > the multiplier at xmath73 has a physical interpretation; it is the energy per unit mass which an additional mass would feel from the exogenous potential and from the interaction with @ xmath72 . . . . as the perturbation @ xmath63 is an arbitrary and of zero mass, in order for the first variation @ xmath66 to vanish, it must be true that @ xmath72 also follows from this lagrange multiplier, by a constraint on the constant mass. . . . . -  int     omega For the first class of perturbations, we can observe that Xmath78 is a sufficient and sufficient condition for Xmath68 (assuming a nontrivial perturbation) . note that ([Eq. 2] Second Variation] can be written as Xmath80, because Xmath82 is a constant function, defined over all of Xmath35. ... note that _ eq. 2]] , may be written as  xmath80, where the angle brackets denote the usual xmath81 inner product of xmath62. if the eigenvalues of the integral operator xmath79 are positive, then _ xmath82 , assuming no perturbation . . . but the first class of perturbations has support in xmath39 and positive in xmath64 . . . so that, as we have seen, the condition for xmath78 is equivalent to that for linear stability of a constant density state in the absence of external forces. if we wish to have xmath59 be a minimizer with respect to the second class of perturbations, it suffices for xmath68 (for example, by having xmath78) . . . however, this is not necessary . . . if xmath66 is a local and global minimizer with respect to the first class of perturbations (the kind supported by xmath62) if xmath67 is positive. - In a case of greater generality (quantum) for the perturbation, if xmath66 is positive. - the solution xmath66 is a local and global minimizer with respect to the second class of perturbations (the more general zero-mass) if xmath66 is positive . if in addition xmath67 is positive for these perturbations, then xmath66 is a global minimizer. In practice, we solve the integral equation ([eq] fie] to find suitable solutions . In this section we discuss the minimization problem, formulated in section [Second ] . and we say that a swarm equilibrium is a swarm minimizer if xmath59 for some neighborhood of each component Xmath96 of the swarm . It is important to note that even if a solution of xmath59 is a global minimizer, still other multi-component swarm minimizers may exist. . . . and here we have a swarm minimizer if xmath97 for some neighborhood of each component Xmath96 of the swarm . . . but now Xmath95 in Xmath96 we can say a swarm minimizer. It may be called a lagrangian minimizer, in the sense that the equilibrium is a minimizer of infinitesimal lagrangian deformations of the distribution. This may be called a lagrangian minimizer, in that the equilibrium is a minimizer of infinitesimal lagrangian deformations of the distribution. . . . in the present case a swarm is a energy reducer for infinitesimal redistributions of mass in the vicinity of each component. He tried to solve the problem primarily, he had a set of compact support within the domain that enabled him to achieve solutions which were continuous in the support and may have jump discontinuities at the boundary of the support. However, when the support in question coincided with the boundary of the domain, the classical solution would break down, and it was necessary to include a distributional component in the solution. He thus described these three examples in detail in this section. For the case of laplace potential, we shall attempt to solve the problem purely in the conventional way; when the solution has a compact support within the domain we obtain solutions that are continuous within the support and may contain jump discontinuities at the boundary of the support. However, when the domain is infinite, e.g. , e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g., the swarm will spread without bounds. we will discuss these three examples later in this section. Now recall that in order for a solution to be a local minimizer, it must satisfy the integral equation (eq. fie) and the mass constraint (eq. mass1), This is because swarm minimization is a necessary condition for global minimization, and thus we now limit our attention to the single component solutions. Note that @xmath82 is a convex component of @xmath104, and that @xmath108 is a convex derivative of @xmath103 in @xmath64 . thus, @xmath113 is convex in the gap between the two components, and so on. This breaks the condition of swarm minimization, and therefore, the solution is not a swarm minimizer. to see this, we take an swarm minimizer with two disjoint components, and therefore, @ xmath82 in the gap, whereas, @ xmath113 in the gap . . . . lambda    2 " if Xmath33 and Xmath32 are bounded from below, so that xmath48 is bounded from below. In our case, the more biologically relevant case, when there is short-range attraction, mass can concentrate in a 'xmath0' function. If we assume a density containing a 'xmath0' function, then we can see that (with sufficient assumptions) a 'xmath0' function cannot occur in the interior of xmath62. The difficulty with this calculation is that we are expecting on physical grounds that for every mass Xmath26 and interval Xmath128 there will be a minimization. The problem is that we expect, on physical grounds, that for every mass Xmath26 and interval Xmath128 there will be a minimization. At the time when a mass is bounded at the ground, the energy Xmath124 is bounded from below , as if from below, so that the solutions of the minimization problem exist in the space of measured values of xcite . Let's say that, at a point Xmath51 in the interior of Xmath39, 'the exogenous potential Xmath104 is twice -differentiable in a neighborhood of xmath51, 'the exogenous potential Xmath104 is twice -differentiable for xmath131, 'the inertia has nonzero repulsion at small distances, that is, if xmath114 is nonzero repulsion, that is, if xmath114 has non And, in the vicinity of xmath138,     bar  rho   0 + m  delta (x-x - x - 0) , note that near xmath138,   ,      , dy  non-umber   &  mbox    &  mbox   & &  mbox   &  mbox     mbox   + mbox    &  mbox   & & mbox   + mbox   + mbox   &  mbox   & mbox    & mbox         end  arranged   ]   nonumber  end  aligned      ] note that close to xmath138, xmath141 and xmath143, there is only the first term of (eq: nodeltas)—(eq: nodeltas)—and the first term of math143 corresponds to nonzero repulsion at short distances, xmath146, indicating that the energy is reduced by replacing the xmath0-function with a narrow a  delta (y-Alpha) + b  delta (y-Alpha)  right     , dy-, We omit the factor that would give us the result    mathcal  d  -    lambda - ,    [1 -,   ,   ] , which is exactly the same as the result    Mathcal  d  d     [  mathcal  d d d d    ,   [ xmath167] in [xmath160] . We then apply the differential operator           ,   ,  , .  : all the conditions for a method - xmath152 . if xmath158 does not coincide with the end of xmath39, we then consider the region xmath165, which is on the left of the support xmath62 . a similar argument, which is near xmath164, yields the value of xmath149 . , if xmath158 = , mathcal  d d d -  [  lambda], , ,  , So, if the relation of xmath126 and xmath127 is strictly in xmath39, then (the relation of xmath127) is sufficient to constitute sufficient conditions for the extremal solution of xmath59 to be a global minimizer (recalling that xmath68) . A little algebra shows that this is equivalent to eqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq is equal to the eqqqqqq mincon [58] [57] . As for xmath-126 and xmath-127, eqqqqq, will be the equal of eqqqq . . . as for xmath-107, if xmath-127 is strictly outside xmath-39, then (eqq - mincon) will be sufficient to cause the extremal solution @ xmath-59 to be a global minimization (as in the case of xmath-68) to be global minimization (recalling that xmath-68) . I begin with the simplest case, namely, no exogenous potential, xmath178, and a finite domain, which we take to be the symmetrical interval, xmath179 . We will see that the minimizing solution has an imbalance between the 0 - functions at the boundaries of the domain, and a constant solution in the interior, as shown in Figure (Fig) (Fig) . . . and that the solution . . . , is the global minimizer. The solution for xmath101 is shown in Figure (Fig) repulsion _ eccentrics (a) . . . so the solution is a global minimizer. from ' eq ' fie - sol', we find that @ xmath180 the nonclassical solution is @ xmath183 eq . . . It is well known that the minimization of mass is connected to a single support, i.e., one of the fundamental components, and that if we cross it outwardly, the exogenous energy decreases, while the endogenous energy remains unchanged. As for xmath12, we know from eq: fie-sol-sol (eq) that the minimization has a complete and coherent support, i.e., a single component, and the support must be xmath197, and possibly xmath198 . meanwhile, in order to form the constant value of xmath12, we can see the good and the bad of the equilateral solutions. so , we can show that we have two possible solutions, depending on xmath12. For very strong values of xmath12, xmath127 is equal to zero, and the mass accumulates on the ground, as shown in figure xmath140 , as shown schematically in figure xmath199 , as shown in figure xmath199 , the semi-excise interval .. After we’ve been looking at the equations, we can see that the inequality is @ xmath203. Let’s suppose we take xmath204 and xmath213 and just a little to the left, as a connecting line between the points @ xmath216 and @ xmath217. Since the equation @ xmath127 cannot be negative, the least complex solution is an @ xmath0 function at the root, as in this case @ xmath225, as we see in figure  repulsion  (d) . Recalling that @ xmath221 we have a slope of a chord connecting the points @ xmath216 and @ xmath217 . . . the inequality is @ xmath215, the inequality becomes @ xmath215 . . . To show that this equation is at least equal to @ xmath211, let us take @ xmath212 and @ xmath213 (so @ xmath214 ). In order to see that this equation is equal to @ xmath209, we must take into account the condition ( eq: minconb) . We equate this as  xmath230 with a global stabilizing reducer, consisting of an  xmath0 function at the origin, which is the left-hand end of a compactly supported classical swarm. we equate this with  xmath 190 swarm members for the numerical simulation. We equate this with a   lollipop [10] [14], which represents a superposition of  xmath233 swarm members in the numerical simulation, having total mass @ xmath233, and simultaneously an  xmath0 - function of mass @ xmath235 in the analytical solution. This argument is taken to represent a universal minimum, as might happen from a chemoattractant, a food source, or a light source. [14] As the support of the solution is at xmath113, we take it as follows. , the vertical of the structure is composed of quadratic exogenous potential wells, shown in figure [16] - b. - this choice of quadratic wells represents a generic minimum, as if a chemoattractant, a food source, or a light source. and the minimization of the potential is proportional to its center. We now define xmath59 . . . By the same argumentation used for the right endpoint in Section 170, we have as it were the right endpoint of Section 170, which directly follows from algebra. We also have to prove that the candidate of Section 170 is a global minimization, which is demonstrated by demonstrating (eq. mincon) . . . thus the minimization of Section 170 is a global minimization. We now have to prove that the candidate of Section 170 is a global minimization, which is done by showing (eq. mform). We know that from the second half of Section 170 we know that from the second half of Section 170, we know that @ xmath246 equating these two expressions for Section 170 yields that @ xmath278 increases monotonically with increasing Section 170. These parameters are (« eq«: mass*) and – eq*** («ct) with – eq****. in this case the energy per particle is unbounded, as @ xmath260, and the particles group together more and more closely, as if they were a continuous aggregate of smaller, smaller particles. Here the distance between particles is the same as the distance between organisms, where the closeness of the particles is the same, with the exception of edge effects. The particles form a crystal lattice, where the relative proximity of all the particles is approximately equal for all (noting edge effects), and the spatial space of the particles is larger. The morse potential has been studied extensively, and is a canonical model for attracting - repelling interactions . . . In this case, the energy per particle is unbounded, and the particles bundle more and more closely together as they cling to each other. Here, xmath5 is the distance between the particles, xmath255 is the characteristic length scale of attraction, and xmath256 is the characteristic velocity induced by attraction . I will now see the minima of the morse type interactions, and I will see qualitatively different solutions to the catastrophic and the stable cases. In the catastrophic case, @xmath264 was intuitively apparent, in the catastrophic case the constant density was unstable to the long waves. The system was oriented to states which were larger than the length of the instability. We then follow the method described in the section "Second-Minimal Interactions": we first find the classical solution at the bottom of @xmath263, and then we permit the @xmath0 functions at the boundaries. @xmath268 is sufficient for all @xmath263, and from section "Second-Minimal Interactions" this is sufficient, or equivalent, for the linear stability of constant density states. In the catastrophic case, we intuitively recognize that the constant density state is unstable to long-wave perturbations.  Xmath62 is enclosed in xmath39 . . . - after Xmath92, we can determine when xmath88 is in xmath35 and when xmath68, which constitute necessary and sufficient conditions for xmath59 to be a global minimiser . . . taylor, since xmath82 is known near xmath297, can determine when xmath82 is at least close to xmath92 . . . however, since xmath84 for xmath85, xmath293 . . . . the integral term and the terms arising from the xmath0 functions disappear . . . the solution is . . . . . , the two constants . . . from xmath278 (the eq: morseintegraleq) , the equation is . . . . . . “If we assume a critical analysis at xmath102, we will find that xmath326 is the case with respect to the domain of xmath103. Suppose that the domain of xmath103 is defined by relations ([eq] morse]] and [eq] mass2] , then xmath303 for xmath5 in a neighbourhood outside xmath102. Hence, if xmath326 is to be defined in the domain of xmath103, we have the domain of xmath103 determined by relations [eq] morse (], and [eq] mass2], which, when xmath264 is reached, become the [eq] bcs ____ xmath326 @ xmath305. In the following subsections we will consider the solution of the continuum system (eq: fie) and [eq: mass1] with no external potential, Xmath99. The solution to (eq: morse) is, in general, a swarm minimizer, that is, stable with infinitely fewer redistribution of mass. , this will give the constants of , if the number is xmath167, if the number is xmath73, and if the number is xmath174, then the measurement of the constants of xmath169, if the number of the dimensions is xmath177 and xmath73 will give the two equations of xmath167 and xmath73 which will be made to xmath177, if the number is a double frac ( And the solution is also a local minimisation. Figure (Fig. 1-1) - gives a summary of the analysis of numerical and analytical results for an example case with a mass of xmath187 and interactions of potential parameters xmath323 and xmath324 . To prove that xmath232 is a global minimisation one would have to examine the quantity xmath322; but we leave this analysis to the fore. For xmath330 we can see that, in a catastrophic case, xmath321 has mixed signs, and therefore xmath67 is not indeterminate. This, of course, we assume that xcite, the asymptotic behaviour of pde (definition) in the h-stability case is the same solution as that in the well-known barenblatt solution of the porous medium equation . . . as we have observed in Xcite, the asymptotic behavior of (eq: pde) for the h-stability case is a complex self-similar solution, and has the same feature as the well-known barenblatt solution of the porous medium equation. The matrix consists of the spheres spanned by spheres spanning spheres spanning spheres spanning spheres. spheres spanning spheres is represented by spheres spanning spheres spanned by spheres , spheres spanning spheres, spheres spanning spheres , spheres spanning spheres . . . and spheres spanning spheres . . . ; this produces two homogeneous, linear equations for spheres spanned by spheres spanning spheres spanned by spheres . . . , spheres spanned by spheres , spheres spanning spheres , spheres spanning spheres . . . . . the solution is [eq. hstablesoln], and [eq. hstablesoln] for spheres spanning spheres . . . [x_l_] ( 1 +   tilde  tilde  mu   ) [1   tilde  mu    ]    tilde  mu Similarly, in the following 299-298-12 209; and we now turn to the locust swarm model, which was also discussed in section  297-110; and to elaborate it, we consider the corresponding 1295-1150 equation of the discrete system of the swarm, the nominal size of 2690 and the associated 2690 equation. In order to simplify the model, we consider the vertical integration of the swarm with the 2890 m 200339 angle, 200202>. To obtain a better understanding of the structure of the swarm, we consider the continuum equation. 1334 note that the proportion of total mass @ xmath187 is inversely proportional to the vertical density of @ xmath190, and that the swarm has a very uniform degree of constant density at the boundary of @ xmath189. The 323 and 324 points to the equilibrium of the discrete system with @ xmath190 swarm members. We add, for example, total mass @ xmath187 and the half-width of the domain is to be @ xmath189. Moreover, this property is reproduced in the model ([eq.: locusts]): see Figure (c) , here also the vertical expression of the bubble is obtained. Thus the bubble is present even when the wind is turned off, and only unavoidable, inward interactions and gravity are present. I have already explained that the one-dimensional model is exactly that which we considered in section : the grav . we take the one-dimensional model of the locust on the ground, and a group of individuals above the ground, but we cannot separate the earthly and the airborne groups. We will show in a later phase that the quasi-two-dimensional model is not suitable, and indeed, some minimizers have a gap between the two groups. The one-dimensional model, as mentioned, is used for one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional repulsion. We take the one-dimensional model, and the quasi-two-dimensional model is chosen to represent either one-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional repulsion. As we have seen, the one-dimensional model can reproduce locust concentrations on the ground and a group of individuals above the ground, but there is no separation between the seated and the airborne groups. We will show that in the quasi-two-dimensional model the repulsion - only case, in order to seek the minimal mechanism responsible for the appearance of the gap. In our numerical study, it is necessary to have a method of obtaining values of @ xmath360. [a] The dynamical equations are simply (a) - cont - velocity - and (b) - but with intrinsic force at xmath350. [b] Laplace potential (a) (eq - laplace) is a quasi-two-dimensional potential - @ xmath360, where - [a] -q2db - is from symmetry, - (b) - is from letting @ xmath353 , - q2dd - is from letting @ xmath354 , - q2dde - is from trigonometric substitution @ xmath360 , - q2d - is from trigonometric substitution @ xmath355 , the positive slope @ xmath360 is monotonically decreasing @ xmath360. It follows from that that for a one-dimensional model, @xmath367 is a minimiser for a certain number of @xmath26, corresponding to all members of the swarm pinned to the ground by gravity. We take this solution as a candidate minimizer for a quasi-two-dimensional problem. Note, however, that if the condition @xmath375 is sufficient for @xmath59 to be a global minimizer, it is not necessary. Moreover, since @xmath368 is, as has been shown, strictly increasing, @xmath384 for @xmath136. Note, in addition, since @xmath375, as we have seen already, is strictly increasing, @xmath39 is a global minimizer. So we have seen, in this case, that @xmath371 is actually a minimizer for any mass @xmath26 . We simulated the discrete system from beginning to end, and we have measured two basic properties of the solution. The horizontal blue line indicates (diagramically) that for xmath390 the equilibrium consists of the mass concentrated at the origin, as we have said before, and that the mass concentrated at the origin is the global minimizer and (we believe) the global attractor. we see that a little quantity of mass added to the local minimum of xmath82 satisfies xmath390, and now xmath386 is near the minimum . a small amount of mass added to the local minimum of xmath82 satisfies xmath386 and . . . there is a continuum of swarm minimizers. we have studied a variety of simulations for different @xmath levels and have measured two basic properties of the solutions. , there is a local minimum of xmath82 at xmath 82, satisfies xmath 390 and Xmath 390 , then the local minimum of xmath82, which is at xmath 387, satisfies xmath 393 and xmath 394 . As the mass increases in @xmath levels, the equilibrium is a swarm minimizer, consisting of a classical swarm in the air separated from the origin, and some mass concentrated on the ground . We concluded that dimension is the crucial factor in the formation of a bubble-like shape of real locus. We concluded that dimensionality is the essential element in the formation of the bubble-like form of real locus. In view of the one-dimensional system of Section . . . Gravity, in which there is no gap, these gaps appear to be the universal configuration for large mass in the quasi-two-dimensional system. The figure [fig] lambda2 shows two such minimizers for @xmath388 and @xmath393 in the presence of the underlying zero and the associated values of @xmath82 (for the instance of each of the previous zeros). In the following figure, in the cd format, @xmath396 of the mass is contained in the anchored portion. In this case, @xmath398 is the energy to be reduced by transferring the swarm members from the air to the air. It will be noted that in the case of a swarm-minimizing mechanism, each connected component of the swarm is constant, we define @xmath394 for the swarm-forming component and @xmath395 for the airborne component. Therefore, we conclude that the size of the mass is a key element in the formation of a bubble like a real locus. So, in the case of the social force, which is in the catastrophic statistical mechanical regime, we found a compactly supported solution, independent of the total population mass. in the case of an exogenous repulsion modeled by the laplace potential, we calculated three examples. for the case of an exogenous repulsion modeled by the laplace potential, we computed three examples of equilibria. We recall that in the model of locusts (see figure — locust) a concentration of locusts occurs on the ground, with a seemingly classical component above, separated by a gap. Moreover, when the boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the domain, a minimization contains a concentration there. In the case of an exogenous repulsion modeled by the laplace potential, we computed three examples of equilibria. In the case of an h-stabilized social force, there is no equilibrium solution on an infinite domain. On a bounded domain, the minimization is a constant density profile with a constant xmath0 function at each end. In free space with an exogenous gravitational potential, the minimization is a linear density profile with an xmath0 function at the origin . . . in a vertical domain, the mass is partitioned between a classical solution in the interior and an xmath0 concentration at the boundary. . . cmt thanks the nsf for its support of dms-0740484 and dms-1009633. . . . . cmt thanks the support of the nsf through grants dms-0740484 and dms-1009633 . . . ajb gratefully acknowledges the support of the nsf through grants dms-0740484 and dms-0730630 and the hospitality of robert kohn and the library of the universite of mathematics . . .
