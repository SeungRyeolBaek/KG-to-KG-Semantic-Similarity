However, the work is studied at the x-math5-math8 level, and is of particular interest to the analyses of the decays at the x-math5 level. There are many other reasons for the study of charm decays: firstly, it is possible to observe, through the sm window, new physics in more detail, since the effect of cp violation by sm processes is highly suppressed, thereby making the contribution of new physics more easily seen than in the x-math5 decays, which are typically very big . In addition, charm studies may teach us a great deal about strong interactions, particularly about decay constants and final state interactions. More interesting is the approximate branching of absolute branches, the intertwined substructures in multi-body decays, the phases of DAS structures, etc. . . . On top of that, heavier objects, such as top quarks, may be decaying into @x-math8 quarks, and higgs particles may decay with greater frequency to @x-math10, making charm studies very important. The count of the quark is about 14 nb. . . . the underlying light-quadrilling structure of the horizon is about 14 nb. The detection of the quark at the threshold is somewhat different from other experiments. The cross-section of the quark is relatively large, with large branching ratios and sufficient luminosity, so that experiments can recreate one quark at xmath19. . . . Since the charge and flavour of the quark is then unique, then the rest of the event can be examined for the characteristics of the known "particle. . . . The experiment at xmath12 has been performed at 4170 mev, where the cross-section of the quark is 3 . . . . 09 nb for xmath15 production and 2 . . . 09 nb for xmath16 production . . . That is to say, for example, at the xmath12, the same event is completely reconstructed, as well as the tag. For example, to measure the absolute branching of the numbers, for example, at the xmath12, the remaining event is completely reconstructed, as well as the tag. (b) The distribution of candidates for candidates from either the xmath24 or the xmath25    . The distribution of candidates from the xmath24 and the xmath25 modes is presented in the figure. These single tags "show a large signal and a very small background . . . [1] The xmath23 distribution for candidates from the xmath24 or the xmath25 mode is . . . I should also add that, since I have an artificial oblique boundary between two points, I would like to call it a uniform space. The oblique and uniform distributions for candidates from the oblique and eccentric, respectively, are referred to as 'the circle of t', as 'the circle of t'. These circle of t', the X-ray of my eye, 'the circle of t', are the slices of my eye. These are the squares of the ones derived from the sine of my eye, 'the thin boundary', 'the lines of my eye,' etc. The solid lines of my eye are bound to the signals plus the backgrounds, as indicated by the circles of my eye. " . . . " The timing of my observations is, as usual, between the average and the last, but the first and the second pass, will usually determine the ranges of the other two, which in turn are calculated from it, if any, which are measured from it . . . " The weights of the pointers are directed at the signals and to the background, as indicated by the circles of my eye. A classification of modes, for example, a pair of modes either alone or in combination, of which all combinations can be taken. The one who did it is called “straight lining” because it is an aggregate of modes which is to be expressed in a series of parallel reconstructions, and which consists of an ensemble of modes both single and double lining, and where all these forms are represented in the same table [tab: dbr] @ xcite , is in fact a further definition. The study of the X-wave equations has recently been based on a data set of 281 pb222812245, which is approximately five times larger than the data set used for their previous publication. The derivation of these equations is as follows: x-wave equations are expressed in terms of single-female and double-female indices, where x-wave is the ratio of the single-female and double-female indices of each mode . . . The different ways in which the aggregate of the modes is distinguished are discussed in x-wave equations and give a result based on the new data, which are shown in the following table: x-wave equations. The absolute branching fractions for charm mesons have been measured with unprecedented accuracy. In this table, when two errors are repeated, the first error is statistical, the second is systematic; this will be true for all results quoted in this paper, except where indicated. For example, if a charm is added to the number of quarks produced in each @xmath49 decay at the resonance of @xmath49, i find that @xmath49_cleo_c does not quote a branching ratio for the @xmath43_ mode because of disturbances on the dalitz plot. ... (in this table, when two errors follow a number, the first is statistical and the second is systematic; this will be true for all results quoted in this paper, unless clearly arranged.) As the most of the @xmath46 decays are ratios to the @xmath47 resonance, i find that @xmath48_cleo_c does not quote the branching ratio for the @xmath_49_ mode due to interference on the dalitz plot. What a precise test for mixing at xmath52. That work was supported by the national foundation for science under grant No. 0553004 , where the greatest error is the roundness of the curve at xmath52. Belle found that there was no mixing at 3 . 9 % c . l. and Babar found that there was no mixing at 4 . 5 % c . l. in wrong-marking @xmath30, and Babar found that there was no mixing at 4 . 5 % c . l. in wrong-marking @xmath56 decays, which makes the further searches more interesting. The best limits yet are _______% and _______________ both at 95 % c . l., and the limit on _______________ of about eight % is already beginning to make an interesting point. . . . bl . . aip cpr-de-cr-rg , de los heros, and j. rathsman, world scientific , singapore ,2006 , . . , s . malvezzi , p . p . de los heros, and j. rathsman, world science, singapore, 2002 . . . . , charm . . . within the standard model and beyond, ” - in . proc. of the xxii ii-ii csymp. on m. . . on lepton and photon interactions at high energies, ed. r. brenner, c. p. de los heros, and j. rathsman, world scientific, singapore (2006 ) - s. malvezzi , xmath57 - meson dalitz in focus, c. petrov, physics of the flavour, in ecp-fraction.
