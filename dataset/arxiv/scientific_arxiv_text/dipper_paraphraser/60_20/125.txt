Even at the higher power (32 xmath46), a mollow triplet appears in xcite . . . .  v 2d) is presented a direct comparison of the spectral linewidth of the emitted electrons of a single qd (qd2) neutral exciton in different cw- laser excitation methods. Figure  math3s2(a) and    1m) show the spectrum of a single qd (qd2) neutral exciton in different laser excitation methods . . . at a moderate power (beyond saturation), the spectra of cw photoluminescence excitation arising from above-band gap and p-shell excitation yields a linewidth of  xmath52 . Figure     a-c shows the series of cw rf spectra at different laser powers . . . at the high power (>33  xmath46 ) , where a mollow triplet arises @ xcite . ICT result a height of ten or fifteen peaks in a row, with intervals of ten or fifteen ns. clusters of five peaking peaks are characterized by a reduced intensity of rf peaks, and a deceleration period of ten or fifteen ns. Figure Xmath3s4a and b illustrate the data of full histogram derived from qd2. Considering the residual two-photon flux observable in this qd2, xmath54, and the optical imperfections of our interferometric trig method (as shown in the main text) , we obtain the correct degrees of indistinguishability to 0 . 956 (58) , 0 . 966 (59) and 0 . 989 (41) for the xmath0 pulse, and 0 . 41 pulses, respectively . . .
