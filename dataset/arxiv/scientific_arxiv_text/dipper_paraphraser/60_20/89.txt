He has been a very rich source of interests in a certain area of the topological and correlation effects in condensed matter. The qh effect is observed in two-dimensional electron gases, which are made up of a strong magnetic field parallel to the plane of the gas. At the edge of a qh liquid, it exists, however, in the form of a single, quiescent, chiral series which are the morphological analogue of classical skipping orbits. At the edge of a qh liquid, with a filling factor of xmath3, where xmath4 is an odd integer, laughter-immortals have an electric charge, which is xmath5 the elementary charge, where xmath5 is the elementary charge. Moreover, it has been experimentally proved that the fractional charge of the chiral quasi-particles has been experimentally confirmed by means of experimental measurements of the noise of weak backscatterings. This effect was found in two-dimensional electron gases , in this case two-dimensional in their surface, pumped in a strong magnetic field parallel to the plane of the gas. These quarrels, however, exhibit, at the edge of a qh liquid, gaps in the chiral mode are the quantum analog of classical skipping orbits. The qh effect was given a precise and universal definition of the hall current. I’ll show you a gedanken experiment. The theoretical basis for this effect is that the matter of charge in a non-chiral system is a collective mode, and has nothing to do with the existence of the oddly charged quasi-particles. This is a property of collective modes and does not concern itself with the existence of pseudo-particles . . . and it is also a property of the aharonov- bohm (abbr) effect. In a chiral system the magnetic field through the argon is changed by changing the strength of the magnetic field, or by deforming the edge of the argon with the help of a gate. In the argon experiment, we consider the gedanken interference experiment, which is shown in the upper panel of fig. [18] . . . quasi-particles of charge [21] pass between two gratings and follow a peculiar magnetic flux in a corresponding electric current. The relative phase of the two amplitudes shifted by an amount of [21] ; thus, the ab oscillations in the current from the source to the drain are more than one, because the time of the electron is increased by a great change in the magnetic flux. It was not in the experiments, see ref. , that the magnetic field directly affected the infinity of particles. There were three main difficulties to be solved by using a qh interferometer of a different type, the electronic analog of an optical compass, d.e., (m.e., m.s) a thermoelectric interferometer of the same type as a d.e. d.e. . , a thermoelectric interferometer of a different type, which was based on the chiral edge of a liquid, which were shown by dashed lines, which were used as optical excitation devices. d.e. the interferometer is so confined to a region of the plane that is not accessible to quasi-particles, which is not the case in the experiments, see ref. . . . , the quasi-particles are directly affected by the magnetic field. Besides, the gedanken formulation of ab, which we have discussed in this chapter, is the paradox of ab in a electronic system, and even fractional qh systems, ab is therefore necessary to have an electronic period, which is the elasticity of the device. sent em> - simplify. Although thouless and gefen have made an important first step toward understanding the ab effect in qh interferometers, their analysis is rather qualitative, and some of their statements about the tunneling rates and currents are not quite well supported. The result of their work is that the current of a quasi-particle is periodically proportioned to the inner and outer edge of the corbino disk, and therefore the qh state, as a result of weak converging quasi-particles, is an aeonical function of the magnetic flux and the electronic period, as a function of the electric period, [in] xmath, - hexmath - and , moreover, it is difficult to interpret the results of their work. " And there are several theoretical attempts to resolve this paradox. Earlier, thouless and gefen have studied the energy spectrum of a liquid in the corbinosphere, which is weakly connected to ohmic contacts; they have found that the energy spectrum, and consequently the thermodynamic quantity, "is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with the electronic period, - hexmath - in the thermodynamic limit, the sum of the quasi-particle currents is said to be equal to the electronic period. When we examine a q-wave in situ, we are shown to indicate that the abs are quite subdued and therefore cannot be observable in a steady-state current through an q-wave in situ , in which we do not affirm that the abs are actually subdued. It is thus that we have proposed to use the effect of this effect to test a certain scale of the dimensions of quasi-particles in a renormalized group. We derived the resulting theoretical explanation in three parts: the first is that we assume a microscopic function for the ground state of the q-wave in situ, derived an effective theory from it, and a simple model of the amplification of the amplification to a stationary state. For our own purposes we have introduced the results of these studies. They resolve the Byers-yang paradox by stating that the ab oscillations with quasi-particle periods cannot be observed in a steady state current through an q-wave in situ. Our results agree with this conclusion. This effect is suggested to be a spectroscopic device for studying the size of quasi-particles at different filling-factors. Our results contradict that conclusion. . . . In the present paper we introduce the theoretical basis of this effect. In our previous work we have shown that a quasi-particle ab oscillation with quasi-particle periods can be observed by varying the magnetic flux by deforming the edge of the q-wave in a way that reduces the strength of the homogeneous magnetic field. Moreover, in correlated systems, such as qh interferometers, the single-particle description is in general not applicable. Moreover, the naive (gedanken) formulation of the ab effect may lead to serious misconceptions and problems, one of which is the Byers-yang paradox. (See also the discussion in sec. 7.) Therefore, we propose to investigate several-particle converging amplitudes. as a result, a microscopic model of an qh interferometer schematically shown in fig. b. c. a qh liquid at a boundary of mass @ xmath3 is confined to a region between two circles @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , by converging the centres of the two circles, we deliberately elongate the axial symmetry in order to avoid any specific geometry and exhibit the general character of our result. a qh liquid of arbitrary shape is described by a chiral-type wave function, see eqs. ( laugh) and ( w-mute) , we generalize this chiral-type function to take into account the deformation of the qh edge caused by the modulation, eq. w-modg. - Here we see the ab phase in the current is canceled, in fact, by the physical deformation of the wave function by the equator, according to the unique flux. Note that this phenomenon is not violating the Byers-yang theorem . - This phenomenon is quasi-particle ab effect, in its original form, xcite . , here we arrive at the rather remarkable result that the ab ab effect, in its original form, does not exist in xcite interferometers. In the presence of a singular magnetic flux, the smilel function (w-magn) contains a flux-dependent factor, which depends only on the distance between electrons and the groove. in the sense of this, the wave function and, consequently, the amplitude of the tunneling amplitudes acquire a relative phase proportional to the total change in the homogeneous magnetic flux through the qh liquid enclosing the interferometer, and thus the ab phase is of the relative direction, and this is proportional to the total change in the homogeneous magnetic flux in the fluid enclosed by the interferometer. , therefore, we are able to examine the low-energy effective theory of the qh effect , we are using the principle of eq. eq. eq. (w-mi) , the wave function and, consequently, the tunneling amplitudes are of a relative phase proportional to the flux of the fluid through the interferometer. A projected Hamiltonian ([1] contains the oscillator with a linear spectrum and the charging energy of a charged atom is based on the number of quasi-particles, [2] and the number of electrons in the qh system. Besides, contrary to previous suggestions, the tunneling hamiltonians in different parts of space do not connect with each other (see appendix[2] comm] . Besides, the Tunneling Hamiltonians in different points of space do not meet (see Appendix[3] ) . At the level of the effective theory, the three contributions of the overall phase shift of the current oscillations, the dynamical, kinematic, and ab phases, mentioned above, are interpreted as follows: . . . [2] and — arises as a boundary contribution to a topological chern-simons theory describing the bulk of 2deg. [3] , with canonical commutation relations ( commutation[4]] [6]. the projected hamiltonians, which are of the form of vertex operators ( h-tube) . Moreover, contrary to previous ideas, the tunneling hamiltonians at different places in space do not adjoin one another (see appendix [6] ] ). interestingly, we do not observe any klein-proportions at all in the tunneling amplitudes . . . . The atoms in the atoms are also produced in the atoms by the liquid Qh. , and we call this effect topological screening in order to emphasize the independence of the sample geometry. the atom dynamics of the atoms in a low-energy system is described by a master equation for the probability of finding the atoms in a state corresponding to given values of xmath29. In the last equation, we find the current through the atoms of the atoms by the atoms of the atoms. we add the atoms of the atoms of the atoms of the atoms to a certain amount, called the master equation : rho - eq . in the last equation, we find the density of the atoms in the atoms of the atoms, which corresponds to the proportion of xmath28. He also concludes that, if the entanglement device were used, the periodicity of the current, as a function of the homogeneous magnetic field, will not change, contrary to a naive assumption that the period depends on the entire area of the entanglement device. The last point comes to another important point: in a strongly disordered system which is stuck at a Q-strength, the effect of topological screening is linear and linear and the ab phase is proportional to the area of the entanglement device. So, we conclude that the effect of topological screening will not change in a weak system with a Q-strength at the x-strength level, contrary to the naive assumption that the period depends on the area of the interferometer. Thus, we conclude that, after the voltage of the entanglement, the periodicity of the current is not changed, contrary to the naive expectation that the period depends on the whole area of the interferometer. and in the final section, in appendix, i.e., we discuss the commutation relations between the quasi-particle operators and tunnelling operators, which are very important to our theory. In the first place, we give the most important results first, then we prove them, in sec. i.e., using the classical X-ray analogy. We next introduce, in the second place, a macroscopic number, @ xmath21, of the skepticism-function (I w-i-r-r-cr-cr) in which we add to the state of skepticism, @ xmath41, an equal volume of macricism of some sort, by one, of q-elements at constant density @ xmath40. @ xmath40. In this paper we will describe, as a matter of fact, the mathematical system of physics. To explain the low energy physics we will use the mathematical system of xcite (q=sa), where the function xcite__ langle  underbar  z= , n, m+ rangle,  label  wave - 1 ] , where the function xcite__ z=  , n, m+ rangle,  label  wave - 1  ] where the function xcite___  langle  underbar  , n, m+ rangle,  label  wave - 1   ] which is analytic in the corbino disk (shown in Fig. mrserserserserserserserserser -  n, mr rser rsersersersersersersernrser  rserserserserdser> with a function  (rser -ir ) in the chaos, in the corbino disk (Fig. mz), and x- flagrant - m rangle,  label nlserln r In a large-scale limit, the interpretation of the partition function to be achieved reduces to a two-dimensional electrostatic problem. This representation shows that the partition function (Z1) describes a gas of charged particles which are confined by the external potential. Xmath59 introduces the microscopic density operator xmath60, where the first term of eq. (extphi) denotes the minimum of normality and the first term on the right-hand side of eq. (ener) in order to remove the self-representation contribution. This representation also illustrates the fact that the partition function (Z1) describes a gas of charged particles that are confined by the external potential Xmath63. Here we apply this analogy to the qh state (‘ya’). Using the macro-density operator @ xcite, we can write @ xcite formally where the inverse temperature of the yaw is @ xmas5 and the energy is given by the expression: ‘+6–9′ at e –8–end  gathered Since the vapour is always covered by the vapour, the apparent density is not fully depleted, xmath72. Thus, the average density is given by the solver of the saddle-point equation, xmath70, which reads xmath72. This proves that the incompressible deformation of the vapour was inspired by the wave function ( [w - ring]] , for the electrostatical material is a dappled metal, which is perfect for screening the external potential . . . this confirms the concept of the wave function ([ w - ring]) that is incompressible. For, for the effective mass, the plasma is a perfect metal that does not extinguish the internal potential - xmath70. in particular, the wave function ([w-ring]) is a straight-line function of an interferometer mz; Fig. a. As the diffusion of the two-dimensional coulomb plasma was perfected, one could easily determine the shape of the deformed disk by the number of points (see Figure. 2. ‘ The dissipation of the area under the converging means’ was quite obvious, and taking into account that the integral of the unformed corbino disk, the interval at xmath81, is deviating from the first two terms of eq. ‘1’ (from extphi), we arrive at the following result, the deformation described by the wave function ‘w’ (‘w’) ‘. In the final part, we enumerate the effects of the balancing device and the singular magnetic force, as illustrated in Fig. ‘mod’. This result is perfectly suited to the operation of the balancing mechanism, as we have illustrated in Fig. ‘Mod’. To look at this result, we derived from the equation ‘s’ – d ‘f’ in polar coordinates (see Fig. ‘d’), that the deformed disk’s boundaries may be parameterised as ‘x’83, where x’84 and ‘x’85 are the density of the 1d charge density that has formed at the inner and outer edges of the disk, as a result of the modulation. The result is shown by the fourier series: ‘sol’ – def – d ‘f’. This result is very precisely suited to the effects of the modulation: the local depletion of the 2deg at the point @xmath91 and the homogeneous expansion of the qh liquid because of its incompressibility. The first thing is to introduce zero-mode operators, changing the number of electrons @ xmath24 and the number of quasi-particles @ xmath21 in the system at xmath96, which operate from the right as [ak][defa]@ xmath99, which act from the right as [ak][defa]@ xmath99, the states [wave] are coherent states, under the action of these operators. We will give, for example, the norm of a wave function, which is given by the square root of the partition function of the coulomb plasma, ((Z1]) and —(Z2] . . . . . . and —[9] - . - cl.[9] . . . having obtained the set of states (wave 1), describing the incompressible deformations of a liquid qh, we shall continue to create the subspace of such low-energy states when they are applied to the unstretched ground state and find their commutation. . . . ‘– 0  k – c – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k – k –  rm –  rm – c – c –  -  rm c –  rm –      -    -   -  -   –  -  –  –    defa –   free - en    end  gathered              -   –   –       –  –  ,         –  rm c  ,   rm c c    ,             ,   free en   end The projection of the microscopic hamiltonian into the subspace of incompressible deformations in question is given by the expression @xmath123, where @xmath124 is the potential of the screened 3d coulomb interaction, and @xmath125 is the confining potential which forces electrons to form the interferometer. the projection of these operators is defined by @xmath119, where the orthogonal projection of @xmath119 is written as @xmath121, where the norm @xmath122 is the integral integral (z2 ) . Note that we have not included the kinetic energy operator, for it acts at the lowest level, @xmath126, where @xmath127 is the cyclotron frequency. Next we consider diagonal elements in a matrix, @xmath132, in sec. a. [m.] in sec. a. [m.] d. – eqx to eqx (the energy of a linear system confined to an undeformed corbino disk, and the last two terms are from the deformation of eqx to eqx (the energy of a qh system bound to an undeformed corbino disk, and the last two terms are from eqx to eqx. – ‘see’ the equation (eqx) expands the integral (eqx) of the small deformation of eqx (see eqx) and evaluates the correction (eqx): ‘see’ eqx(13) where eq , in eqx(14) we add the energy of eqx(14) – which is defined by the two-body interaction and by the constrained potential: eqx(14) @ eq145. In the lower limit, i.e. for eqx(14) – that is, at eqx(14) for eqx(14) – the deformation in (eqx)(14) is linear as a function of the mode number: eqsp.; and the constants eqsp. are the group velocity velocities of the edge. It is therefore defined by the following wave function: @xmath155 , where @xmath155 and @xmath155 are quasi-particle operators. , [27] by the use of the classical electrostatic picture. [27] the tunneling hamiltonian for an mz interferometer may be expressed in terms of the projection of the tunneling operator, @xmath159, by putting together a complete set of intermediate states, @xmath159. These matrix elements are in the form of a complete set of intermediate states, @xmath164, where we have omitted a combinatorial factor, for it can be absorbed into the electric field amplitudes. [27] the electron operator is defined by @xmath164, which leads to the following wave function: @xmath165, where we have omitted the combinatorial factor, because it can be absorbed into the electric field amplitudes . . . , the analogous operation, @xmath164, is defined by a wave function called 'Q' def,' that is, by a wave function at the point 'xmath20' and a wave function defined by 'q' def, which is expressed by 'q' def, which is similar to the definition of laughlin ' q' def. , taking into account the fact that @ xmath174 and @ xmath174 are derivatives, we can write out the expression (@ xmath174) in the following form:   times  int  prod  2z     (z  - i - z   0)  exp  left  -    k (z   -  -  -    left   -   right   langle n , m ,  r   langle n , m ,  under   langle n, m ,  under    langle n, m ,  under                                               right      langle n, m ,  underbar  t For the logarithm of the norm at xmath180 and for the definition (ak), we can write the projection of the tunneling operator ([ti-mi-n]) in terms of deformation operators as follows: “The first case is the case when the flux is modulated by a modulation of the gate voltage. Then, we consider the situation in which the flux is varied by the application of modulation voltage to the interferometer. The wave function of the interferometer is given by eq. (w- modg) and the density of the corresponding edge is given by eq. (def - g) . in that case, one can test that the operator (elec - u) and (elec - d) creates a unit charge at the corresponding edge. In the second place, we consider the case in which a magnetic flux is threaded through the interferometer. We proceed to the study of the hamiltonian and the tunneling operators in the case where a magnetic flux is threading through the interferometer . [16] . . . and the resulting low-energy theory agrees well with the effective theory of refs. . . . . . As a result, we find that the density of the edge in the state (w-def-g) corresponds with the result (w-def-g), but with the @xmath201 replaced by @xmath199. We show that, following the voltage of the gate, the tunneling operators @xmath203 at the left qpc and @xmath204 at the right qpc acquire a relative phase @xmath205, which corresponds to the fluxes @xmath204 in the region of 2deg in the zone of the modulation gate. Therefore, only the modulation gate’s effect on the hamiltonian was given by: @xmath200: , , ,  , ,  , ,  ,  , , ,  , , , , , , , , ,  , , , , ,  ,  , , ,  , , ,    , , , , ,  , ,  , - to account for the shift of the edges - is a function of the standard transient which, according to xmath212, is not a function of the specific transient (Xmath212) of the interferometer. In this way we show that the theory of the low-energy effective theory, derived from the specific transient (Xmath212), can be expressed in a universal, gauge-invariant form. - We conclude that in contrast to the state where the modulation gate is introduced, the tunneling operators of different qpcs acquire no relative phases of the conduction due to the singular flux. in this section we show that the high-energy effective theory, taken from the last section, which is derived from the specific transient (Xmath212), can be expressed in a universal gauge-invariant form. then we prove that the gauge-invariant edge of the hamiltonian coincides with the one derived from microscopic theory, see eq. (h-eq), and the amplitudes of the transverse oscillations correspond to those calculated by eq. (h-eq) . so the tunneling operator can be found with the same calculations as in sec. s-transfer, which produces an expression that is different from that of eq. (h-eq) only by a real prefactor:  xmath213  label  h- tun  f   end  gathered The current is invariant under the gauge transformations @ xmath220. So the gauge invariant action for the potential @ xmath220, as a function of the length of the dimensions, is illustrated by the term: frac  1  2  pi   int d  3r  mu j   mu. This word has no dimension, but all other words have no dimension, i.e., they are insignificant at large distances and low energies. Moreover, the mash forming the term, frac  1  2  pi   int d  3r  mu j  mu [ ] has zero dimension, and all the other terms have _lower_ dimensions, i.e., they are not _significant_ at large distances and at low energies . . . -               nonumber  gathered                      non-umber                                    [8] , it is not gauge invariant. The physical cause of the gauge invariant is that in a liquid confined to a finite region the bulk current (as per j) is not conserved. Hence the electric charge may accumulate at the base of the “Gada”——” ” [17]  frac  1  4  pi   int [17],  d  d  3r  epsilon                                                                            ,                   [quote]                (a  ) and a    [quote] And the statistical phase of two excitations of the type (op-former) is encapsulated in the corresponding Wilson lines. In the instance of an incompressible qh liquid, we proceed to the spectrum of local excitations. Having constructed a gauge-invariant low-energy action for an incompressible qh liquid, we proceed to consider the spectrum of local excitations. In the course of a topological field theory, excitations are described by wilson lines. However, the exact form of the hamiltonian density octa- ra-d eq octa-d is not fixed by the effective theory. Moreover, the most common possible expression octa-d eq is justified in the case of small deformations and leads to chiral edge dynamics with a linear dispersion law . - fe frac  2  pi i  m   delta (x-y) . . . . - acju-de-sy , the result reads: - xmath248 , where xmath250 is a constant. . . . e  , e   , e    , e  - particle (see Fig. e-b ) , where the 1d and 2d coordinates are related by the expression  math260 for the outer edge and  math260 for the inner edge of the mz interferometer. ; (see fig. e-b ) . an operator that creates a laughlin quasi- particle at the point math20 and a laughlin quasi- hole at the point math155 has the form of a wilson line between these points: math258 note, however, that this operator is not gauge invariant. to compare the tunneling operator ( tun-ef ) with the microscopic one, eq. (h- tunnel) , we first note that, assuming the tunnel is tunneled, there is an invariant tunnel between two axes, described by the fields @ xmath259 and @ xmath260 correspondingly, @ xcite can be written as @ xmath262 In the case of a disc, the field is normally asymmetrical. The elements @ Xmath98 and @ Xmath269 obey the canonical commutation relations (‘commut - mic’). so that the commutation relationship is satisfied, if zero modes are added. In this way the fields @ Xmath266 naturally contain zero-mode contributions. Here the operators @ Xmath98 and @ Xmath269 obey the canonical commutation relations (‘commute – mic’). this guarantees that the commutation relation (‘commute – eff’) is satisfied when zero modes are added. As a result, the boundary-chamber @ Xmath266, which has the name of the particle 1x , is derived from the microscopically derived boundary-chamber (‘commute – edge’) . The boundary-chamber hamiltonian @ Xmath270, -labelled h-edge – rho – [a][b] [c] [h-edge]], is calculated by taking into account the change in the background charge @ Xmath42 caused by the variation of the quantum numbers math21 and math24. To this end, the boundary-chamber of the hamiltonian @ xmath270, which represents the homogeneous distribution of the liquid qh in the interferometer, and thus satisfies the equation @ xmath268. The zero mode's contribution to the edge is strongly affected by the specific geometry of an mz interferometer. In this section, we will re-examine the effect of a singular flux and a modulation gate found in sec. [245] - the effective theory is equivalent to a gauge-invariant low-energy effective theory. We will begin by assuming that the modulation gate is actuated to deform the outer edge of a mz interferometer. We will first discuss the system of action, the modulation gate, in order to deform the outer edge of a mz interferometer, and then proceed to the cyclical expression of the elements (phi - a) at xmath279, and then the relationship (phi - edge) between the density and the edge, to arrive at the following expression: phi - a ; h - tunnel ; if you resolutely set xmath265 , the phase of the tunneling amplitude, which caused the amplitude to be shifted by the zero mode at xmath21 is not constant along the elongated radii, provided, at xmath45, the hamiltonian of the elongated edge is expressed by the expression: Then we will examine the effect of the modulation gate on the operator (tun): v. - ef. ; v. - ef. Consequently, the operator, hamiltonian, is determined by the product of two such operators taken at two qpcs. (RH-ef-ef-ef) - in the end we redefine the density of charge on the outer edge by subtracting the vacuum contribution (tun): v. - v. - v. - v. - v. - ? and so the density of the edge hamiltonian (Ventonian, v. v. v. ) acquires an additional term: v. v. . . . . f> - : y[26]    ng,  in t. - xmath290 . . . next, we will see that the hamiltonian (v. v. v. v. v. ) at qpcs has only a physical meaning: i.e. - dy, v. v. . . . .  .  - v . v. ] . We draw on Maxwell’s equations and provide physical units for this study. To that end we minimize the effect (’s – edge1’) with respect to the density of the axis in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Thus, we conclude that, after the adiabatic insertion of the singular flux, the quantum number @ xmath21 is shifted by @ xmath307 . . . hence the effective hamiltonian (‘h – edge’) is obtained, and the vacuum energy for @ xmath139 given by eq. (‘e0’) in accordance with the microscopic theory. In consequence, by dividing eq. (‘eom-rho’) over the coordinate @ xmath303 and subtracting the equation for the inner edge (@ xmath304) from the equation for the outer edge (@ xmath305), we obtain the following equation: math398, where math84, and math299 the component of the electric field along the edge of the sample. Lastly, we can make up a hamiltonian, namely: math398  2  non-umber  [ ] ] – a distance of 1m is equal to the distance of 2m – the charge of the interferometer along the arms of the interferometer. Physically, this means that the phase change of an edge excitation on a closed contour – caused by the variation of the vector potential – is screened by the phase change caused by the reconstruction of the qh liquid – this topological slit is the reflection on the effective theory level of the fact that, after the injection of the single flux, the microscopic wave function – [w-mm-d] undergoes a deformation to preserve its single-valuedness. Here we have demonstrated that the charge current between ohmic contacts arises from a quark, in accordance with the Byers-yang theorem . . . in our example we show that it oscillates with the electric period @ xmath1 by the electronic period @ xmath0, in agreement with the byers-yang theorem . . . that is to say, it does not pass the thermodynamic limit of xcite, but only in the boundary of the strong ohmic contact. We have demonstrated in the previous section that ab-effect, as its original formulation, does not exist in qh interferometers, because the tunneling operators do not depend on the singular magnetic flux threading the corbino disk . . . and this effect, however, does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This effect of coulomb-blockade-effect is of the same kind, and therefore vanishes in the thermodynamic limit and the limit of strong coupling to ohmic contacts . . The strength of the coupling to the ohmic contact is that, after every event of quasi-particle tunneling, the edge states relax to the equilibrium state, defined by the probability distribution function @ xmath318. @ xmath319 is the inverse temperature, @ xmath320 is the electrochemical potential of the ohmic contact, and @ xmath320 is the partition function. in this section, we derive the master equation that describes the weakest quasi-particle tunneling, and we find the tunneling rates by applying the effective theory. not to lose generality, we consider the zero modes to be classical variables, and we derive the master equation for the probability distribution functions. formally, these oscillations are the result of the independency of the two quasi-particle tunneling amplitudes at the left and right qpc , and formally, these oscillations derive from the inverse temperature, __________ ohmic contact, and ________________________________________________. Furthermore, there is no need to define the precise form of coupling with the ohmic contact, since the only role of this coupling is to balance the ohmic state. The probability @ xmath323 is proportional to the number @ xmath27 of quasi-particles, given by eq. - ( ener-0 ) . A very simple calculation based on the golden rule of fermi gives the following expression: @xmath332, and a similar expression for @xmath333 . We shall examine the tunneling rate of @xmath333 to a leading order in the tunneling hamiltonian, @xmath340, where @xmath341 . these rates are given by the expression: @xmath332 where @xmath333 are the transitions between two states with certain numbers of electrons, @xmath332 and @xmath329 . Note that the detailed balance equation @xmath339 is satisfied only if @xmath339 is satisfied . . . . a brief, following the golden rule, gives the following expression: @xmath332 where @xmath344 projects onto the states with given numbers of electrons, @xmath332 and @xmath346 the equilibrium density matrix of the oscillators. . . . a simple calculation, based on the golden rule, gives the following expression: @xmath332 where @xmath333 is the rate of quasi-particle tunneling between two states with fixed numbers of electrons, @xmath332 and @xmath333. Thus the interferometer in the unperfect equilibrium regime is an interesting example of a system with a broken detailed balance. . . . ) it can be used to calculate the energy difference between the final and the initial states. . . . ” – A set of incoherent and coherent partages, respectively, are: - here – Ax217, the number of electrons in the corbino disk, and – ax317, the 2d coordinates of the qpcs . . . note that the magnetic flux enters the tunneling rates (T - Rates- 2 –  E0) in this case, because of the tunneling operators @ xmath357 and @ xmath358 on the left and right qpcs, which acquire a relative phase @ xmath359, which we have for the convenience of rewriting here: T - Rates- 2                                                      - 500          -    - For instance, the energy of zero modes is reduced by the factor @xmath364, where @xmath364 . . . compared with the energy of the heat-pipe: @xmath364 . . . secondly, the energy difference becomes independent of the number @xmath27 and of the flux. Then, for eq. ( curr-d), the current equals @xmath373 , which is compatible with the expression . . . “and so we do not measure the integral in (tun - rates - 3 ), and refer the reader to . . . where the current has been thoroughly analyzed in the linear and non-linear regimes. So, we do not consider the integral in (tun - rates - 3), and refer to [Tun - rates - 3] and to [2] , where the current has been analyzed in the linear and non-linear modes. Here we show that, in the case where the flux in the interferometer is varied by inserting a single flux tube, the electronic periodicity of the current is restored. Here we show that the magnetic flux enters the tunneling rates (= tun - rates - 2); whereas in the case where the flux is varied with the flux - xmath376 - the energy difference between the states with quasi-particles is summed up by xmath377 - . This is because the magnetic flux enters the tunneling rates (= tun - rates - 2), only via the energy of the zero modes, @xmath139, in contrast to the situation in which the flux is varied with the flux - the potentials at xmath378 and at xmath377 are then measured at this gate. This situation has been successfully demonstrated in several recent experiments, e.g., in ref. . . . and the second metallic gate plays the role of a third electrode, which in turn controls the number of electrons in the system. this resembles the invariance of the gauge invariance. however, we must admit that the degree of screening depends on the details of the experiment. Having given our forms, we have omitted the unnecessary constants, and @ xmath330 are the tunneling rates ([2] tun - rates - 2]. We stress that after the change of the variables above, the tunneling rates of xmath330 are seen not to depend on the number of xmath27 and the flux of xmath8. Using this identity and re-dividing the variables @ xmath380 into two, we obtain the following expression for the transitions: @ xmath380, where we have omitted unnecessary constants, and @ xmath333 are the tunneling rates ([1]). We then take the curved line from xmath388 into account and have a written circle of red criss-crossing, which is shown in fig. [2] . , by dividing the circle of blue at the top of the curve by this dotted line, which is shown in fig. pol. Taking the saddle of @ xmath388 as the starting point, we have located the saddle point far from the real axis: @ xmath388. This second rounded line is where the vexatue is located far from the real axis: @ xmath386, because @ xmath387 . this allows the expansion of the cotangent in the thermodynamic limit. When we add eq. (cv) and cv, cv for cv, we have the above eq. (cv) in which the probability satisfied eqs. (cv) with the constraint of cv. cv. All these equations are periodic in cv in cv, with period equal to cv, and invariant with the interval at cv xmath395 . It is possible to assume that the tunneling rates (cv) contain oscillatory contributions in cv xmath8 that are exponentially suppressed at the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, the quasi- particle periodicity with respect to a single flux may in principle be observed in principle, for example, from the current noise measurements at cv . a change of the flux at cv 1 by a change in the quantum 1 can be compensated by the change in cv 1. At last, it is noticed that the flux enters the transition rates (cv  4) solely through xmath392 . Then, implementing the Landauer-Bttiker formula, we easily find that the average current in the flow is skewed by the flux of the single particle and that the diffusion coefficient of the wave is almost exactly the same as a constant for the duration of xmath0. This last fact is what distinguishes qh interferometers from many other electronic interferometers, in which the ab effect is often regarded as an elementary textbook physics. It is precisely this last fact that makes qh interferometers stand out from the many electronic interferometers in which the ab effect is regarded as a simple textbook physics. analyzing this issue, we will first reaffirm that qh is a topological phenomenon, and therefore the naive open systems approach may not be suitable for qh interferometers, and ii) topological screening is derived from the cooperative action of many electrons, so that the single-particle picture may not accurately describe the effect of insertion of the singular flux. Finally, we will take an example of a liquid qh in the state of xmath400 with xmath400 in its range. As shown below, the single-particle picture is in keeping with the microscopic description of the xmath400 state, particularly the many-particle laughlin wave function (quote) . In a simple case, we will now consider a liquid qh at filling factor of xmath400 in the state of xmath400. But if you consider that the plane of the corbino is asymmetric, you will find that the eigenstates of the non-interacting hamiltonian are not eigenstates of a non-interacting hamiltonian, they are very different from the eigenstates of the non-interacting hamiltonian. The eigenstates of the non-interacting hamiltonian are those orbits drifting along the equipotential lines, as pictured in fig. . . . in a qh system, the eigenstates of the non-interacting hamiltonian are the single-particle orbits drifting along the equipotential lines, as illustrated in fig. . . thus we conclude that the single-particle picture, based on the eigenstates of a non-interacting hamiltonian, is not accurate in describing the insertion of the singular flux, because it leads to compressible deformations in the bulk of the 2deg. Therefore, in a ground state all the single-particle orbits inside the corbino disk are filled. On the other hand, the orbits that belong to the other two groups surround the flux, and therefore, they have to be shifted inwards or outwards, to keep the same quality. We may note that, even in this case, the total magnetic flux through the hole in the mz interferometer is screened, and does not contribute to the ab phase, because the homogeneous flux is a distributed singular flux. Thus, the ab phase is proportional only to the total area of the incompressible qh liquid in the interferometer, @xmath408, and not to the geometrical area of the interferometer. Moreover, in a sample with a long range of disorder, so that the cyclotron gap exceeds the cyclotron gap, such a phenomenon should be present in a range of magnetic fields, in which the high voltages are applied. , and thus the ab phase is proportional only to the total area of the incompressible qh liquid in the interferometer, @xmath408, and not to the geometrical area @xmath409. so the ab phase is proportional only to the total area of the incompressible qh liquid in the interferometer, @xmath409, and not to the geometrical area @xmath409. the boundary between the two points is dotted. Here we are referring to the generic analysis of the buoyant periodicity of the qh states at fractional filling factors of xmath . We have briefly reviewed these works in the introduction and in more detail in the appendix c of our earlier paper [135] . We consider the mironite variational wave function of the qh states at fractional filling factors of xmath . In this study we consider the invariable aspect of the finite periodicity of the qh states at xmath8 , which is known to have an extremely large overlap with the exact wave function, and we find the space of the gapless incompressible deformation of the qh liquid of the mz interferometer. But all these models are based on the effective theory. We return to the simplified system, which is based on the hamiltonian hamiltonian. Then we work on the principle of the low-energy theory of the interferometer in the presence of a singular magnetic flux, or on the application of a modulating gate voltage. In our earlier paper we criticized these works and argued that the average current, in response to the modulation gate voltage, can oscillate with the quasi-particle period of xmath2 , which is in no way contradicted by the Byers-yang theorem (see Appendix C of our earlier paper). in this, in our earlier paper, we criticized those works and argued that the average current oscillates with the quasi-particle period of xmath2 in response to the modulation gate voltage, and yet this behavior does not violate the Byers-yang theorem (see App . . . then it must be taken into account that this phenomenon is crucial for the solution of the byers-yang paradox. On the microscopic level, this phenomenon is natural because it is a consequence of the single-valued laughlin function, while on the effective level, it is the cancellation of the vector potential associated with the magnetic flux and the chern-simons field induced by the reconstruction of the wave function after insertion of the flux tube. Thus, our theory is conforming to the byers-yang paradox. On the other hand, we predict that, when the total magnetic flux in the circuit is regulated by a modulating gate attached to the loop of the interferometer, the average current will oscillate with the quasi-particle period in xmath2 . Therefore, this effect has a global, topological character, because it does not depend on the gauge. on the surface, it naturally follows from the single-valued of the laughlin wave function, and the phase shift caused by the physical displacement of the wave function. But the oscillations are associated with the coulomb blockade effect, must have an electronic period in xmath0 and vanish at the thermodynamic limit, where the mz interferometer is considered an open quantum system. As a result of topological screening, the duration of ab oscillations is linearly proportional to the magnetic field across the plateau of the hall conductivity. Our next remarks concern the properties of the quasi-particle operators and the hamiltonians. We first note that we generate quasi-particle operators by projecting quasi-particle excitations of the laughlin wave function onto the low energy subspace. We then show that the construction of such operators has anyonic cohesion, and that local excitations of the charge at xmath7 are produced. . . . but, as we know, these excitations are formed not from free particles, which may propagate from one ohmic contact to another and carry a statistical phase-tube. we conclude that in strongly disordered qh systems the period of ab oscillations is linearly dependent on the magnetic field across the base of the hall conductivity . . . therefore, as an intermediate step, we propose to directly measure the effect of topological screening by measuring the intensity of their magnetic field by specific measurements, as shown in Sec. 1, fig. 1 . . . and, besides, by these measurements one may observe the effect of topological screening even at integer filling-in-portions, e.g., at xmath400. In the end, we see no evidence of klein factors in the tunneling operators. - here, we discuss the commutation relations for quasi-particle operators and for tunneling operators (h- tunnel). - First, we show that the microscopic theory of the theory in sec. s. project is based on the typical analogue commutation relations @ xcite for the quasi-particle operators. - then, after the low-energy projection, we multiplied the quasi-particle operators by the factor @ xmath415 to eliminate the contribution of the homogeneous density. Here we discuss commutation relations for the quasi-particle operators and for tunneling operators ([h- tunnel]. This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Note that the operator [p-p-p-p] has zero charge, i.e. it creates local excitement with the charge @ xmath414, with the total charge @ xmath414 . then, the resulting operators (p-p-p-p-p-p-p) actually generate local excitement with the charge @ xmath7. Therefore, after the low energy projection, we multiplied the quasi-particle operators by the factor @ xmath415 in order to cancel the contribution of the homogeneous density . we can see that the resulting operators (p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p- One would think that at the microscopical level two tunneling operators could not exist without polynomials, but, as they are arranged in the low-energy subspace, they would not need to be distributed in two directions, if taken at different spatial points. Next, we shall be focusing on the relations between operators of quasi-particle tunneling. The first thing is that at the microscopical level two tunneling operators could exist without commutation, for they are simply polynomials, but being projected into low-energy subspace, they would not need to travel in this direction, if taken at different spatial points. In fact, the direct calculation of the operators (h- Tunnel) with the help of eqs ([no modecom ]] and [no modecom] [f], leads to the following result:  Mathcal  a    a  ( xi  l] [   ] [] in the thermodynamic limit, xmath425 (as an open mz interferometer), that leads to a simpler expression:  xmath423, where the statistical phase takes the topological value. [ b ] I will present the possibility that the tunneling operators of the incompressible qh liquid do not require the transportation of bulk atoms because the incompressible qh liquid makes them nonlocal. More recently unexpected results of quasi-particle charges have been reported in m. dolev, y. gross, y. c. chung, m. heiblum, v. umansky, and d. mahalu, arxiv: 0911, 3023. These results may indicate that the fano factor of a weak backscattering current is not entirely determined by the quasi-particle charge. Moreover, the use of the word “female charge reduction” in this context is somewhat unfortunate, for in contrast to the semi-female charge reduction, the process is entirely classical. In fact, it is very similar to the current in electric circuits . . . p. 79, 245324 (2009); p. roulleau, f. portier, d. c. glattli, p. roche, a . cavanna, g. faini, u. gennser, and d. mailly, phys. c. 76 * , 161309 (r) ( 2007); p. roulleau, f. portier, d. c. glattli, p. roche, a . cavanna, g. faini, u. gennser, and d. mailly, phys. c. - 3 - 534 (2007); e . bieri, m. weiss, o. goktas, m. hauser, c. schonenberger, and s. oberholzer, phys. rev. b. 78 *, 245324 (2009); p. roulleau, f. portier, d . c. glattli, p . roche, a . cavanna, g. faini, u. gennser, and d. mailly, phys. rev. b. 76 *, 161309 (r) ( 2007); e. bieri, m. weiss, o. goktas, c. h. von Haesenberger, and s. oberholzer, phys The one thing that is to be said for the thermodynamic limit for a mz interferometer is a certain explanation. In fact, the mz interferometers of the qh liquid are usually considered open quantum systems, as shown in the upper panel of the fig.
