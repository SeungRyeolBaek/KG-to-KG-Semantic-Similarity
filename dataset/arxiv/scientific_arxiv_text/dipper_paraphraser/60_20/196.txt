– in the case of balancing at xmath12, and at resonance at xmath13 the fermi gas is unitary and scale invariant. The unitary fermi gas is a fundamental many-body problem which describes strongly interacting fermions, from ultracold atoms near a feshbach resonance, to dilute neutron matter . whereas the conventional qcps separate two phases of finite density, in our case the density itself is the order parameter, vanishes for xmath10 and assumes a finite value for xmath11 . . . in the spin balanced case and at resonance xmath13, the fermi gas is unitary and scale invariant. . . . in the case of spin balanced, and at resonance xmath13 the fermi gas is unitary and scale invariant . . . . in terms of the thermal length @ xmath20, the density equation of state @ xmath19 is a universal function which has been experimentally measured at xcite . . . although there is no small factor, it is a great challenge to compute the critical properties. I believe that a temperature independent ratio of xmath4 has been found in certain string theories xcite and is thought to hold a lower bound in other theories xcite . . . Strongly interacting quantum fluids that saturate this bound are called perfect fluids . . . in the kinetic theory, xmath26 the viscosity at xmath27 is equal to the pressure, xmath30, and the viscosity to entropy ratio (at xmath23) is a universal number , independent of temperature . . . thus the tan contact density at xmath18 assumes a universal value at xmath18 . the entropy density at xmath29 is precisely proportional to the pressure, , and the viscosity to entropy ratio (at xmath23) is a universal number , independent of temperature . The advantage of perturbation theory is that it is used in large interactions, while in contrast to quantum monte carlo it works directly in the thermodynamic limit and needs no scaling.

Nevertheless, the knowledge of the trap averaged contact does not permit us to reconstruct the corresponding value for the homogeneous system, so we don’t consult direct comparisons. The excellent agreement between the experiment and the cdmc makes a definite reference to check the accuracy of other methods. , for the finite constant at short distances (uv), and the detonation at a sharp flux at xmath63 is fixed at xmath63. , and the dilute, or the dilute , is the physical condition of the two-component fermi gas; and this condition is physical, for a liquid and near a broad resonance feshbach resonance, as in xmath63li . . . - this condition is physical, for a gas with a large feshbach resonance, as in xmath63li feshbach resonance xmath57li xcite . - the inverse temperature xmath49 is the chemical potential of a species xmath51, but we will only consider the spin - balanced case - . . . . a finite inversion of the contact interaction, at a distance of (uv) , and for a sharper detonation - . . . in xmath53 dimensions the amplitude of the velocities for small relative momenta xmath54 can be written in the form xcite - xmath55, where the length xmath55 can be varied experimentally by an applied magnetic field, and the effective range xmath57 depends on the details of the interatomic potential . asymmetry between the small and the large fermions forms a bec of fermions; a larger fermions come to an attractive fixed point @ xmath74 of the free fermi gas (bcs limit). The phase transition line @ xmath78 , @ xcite is universal and strictly linear, in contrast to the phase diagram for a dilute bose gas xcite . the zero temperature phase diagram exhibits a quantum critical point at the feshbach resonance, zero chemical potential @ xmath18 and zero spin imbalance @ xmath12, where the   magnetic field @ xmath9 is related to the difference in chemical potential  @ xmath76. at the feshbach resonance fixed point the detonation @ xmath8 is a necessary perturbation with scaling dimension d – 2 . . . . in this work we concentrate on the spin-neutral gas at xmath12 at unitarity @ xmath13; the phase diagram for finite @ xmath8 and @ xcite is given in Fig. . the action has the same critical effect as the two-channel atom-molecule model at its zero-density fixed point @ xcite. The action has all the sub-fields of a form such as the form eq. and is independent of xmath88 (for xmath70) . this action has sub-fields of any even number @ xmath84 of fields, which are given by a bare fermion loop with the @ xmath84 insertions . . . and is independent of xmath88 (for xmath70) . and, in contrast to the distasteful fermion, where these sub-fields are irrelevant in the rg sense, for the unitary fermion, these sub-fields are marginal in the rg sense. A key parameter is to suppress these higher loop diagrams, and they are a priori equally important in the infrared (ir) . . . ottak, and sigma  ln g  0 The elements of the equation which constitute the probability of the near-average is derived by the powers of xmath113.

In the vacuum limit, the center of mass scattering depends only on the relative momentum at xmath54, @ xmath171, but at finite density there is an additional dependence on the relative momentum at xmath172 in the medium at xmath173 . The non-occupied states give the probability that the incoming states are filled with the outgoing. This is a system of operations based on a theory of full fermionic propagators. The viscosity then is given by @xcite @ xmath183 in the high-temperature quantum critical regime @xmath17 , the collision integral has to be computed for the full medium of @xmath184 @xmath184, which is done numerically, and yields @xmath184 and, along with the pressure of a leading order in @xmath22, @xmath186, we obtain in the quantum critical regime @xmath186, the value of @xmath194 is about @xmath198 for @xmath18 at xmath195 @xcite, somewhat larger than our value at xmath23.

The luttinger-ward theory then prescribes that the self-energy of the fermionic self-energies is obtained by scattering the quantum fluctuations, described by the full xmath0 matrix, @ xmath202 and analogously for xmath203.
