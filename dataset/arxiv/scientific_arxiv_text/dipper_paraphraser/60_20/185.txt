And the research of quasinormal mode (qnms) of a black hole (bh) has a long history. The study of quirks (qnms) has been known for a long time. The reason for this interest is that qnms are a direct method for studying the fundamentals of the physics of compact and massive objects, without the complications of the full, general relativistic physics. To find quirks one needs to solve the second-order linear differential equations describing the linear perturbations of the metric: the regge-wheeler equation (rwe) and the zerilli equation for the Schwarzschild metric, or the tre – tre equation for the kerr metric, and to impose on the boundary conditions such as those referred to as the black hole boundary conditions (waves going simultaneously into the horizon and into the infinity) . . . the study of quirks in a black hole (bh) has long been known . . . for example, by comparing the theoretical gravitational quirks with the frequencies of gravitational waves, one can confirm or disprove the nature of many astrophysical engines, because these quirks differ for the various types of objects , black holes, superspinars (bare singularities) , neutron stars, black hole mimickers etc. And so the problem is related to two problems, a frequency @ xmath2 and a separation constant @ xmath3 (real for a non-rotating bh, and @ xmath5 the angular momentum of the perturbation) .. For this work, see chandrasekhar & detweiler & teukolsky & press xcite. By imposing the boundary conditions to these solutions – see @ xcite – you get a system of spectral equations and a series of confluent heun functions, which can be numerically solved. Previously, the indirect methods for continuous fractions, such as the continuometric method, have certain limitations and are not directly related to the physics of the problem . The results are compared with the ones that have already been published, and they correspond with at least eight digits for the rwe and six digits for the tre. The angular equation for both cases is the solution of the teuk ... the first time we give a direct analysis of the rwe and the tre in a schwarzschild measure, i.e., we solve the rwe and the tre analytically, with confluent heun functions, and we use a new method (the two-dimensional generalization of the method described in the internal technical report - Xcite) to solve the system of two transcendental equations with two complicated variables ... then we examine the stability of the solution with small variations in the phase condition . The first time, the so-called algebraically special, the xmath0, is evaluated with precision of more than six digits, and it shows a nonzero real part , which strongly refutes the hypothetical relation of this - the xmath1 is firmly rejected , this firmly denies the theoretical relation of this - to the algebraically special , epsilon is used to study the stability of the solution in a small phase condition . - of course, there is an infinity that should be the same as the height of the black hole – the results of the calculations for qnms are independent of the choice of xmath10 in the spectral conditions – the results of the numerical experiment – are based on xmath11 – the angular equation, if there is no rotation (xmath7): xmath8 where xmath8 is the angle. – of the general form of the radial equations is obtained from the solutions of the rwe and the tre, written in the form of confluent heun functions according to @xcite, which the black hole boundary conditions impose. The values of the parameters, if the mass of the bh is xmath15, and if we choose xmath16, which turns out to be large enough to approximate numerically the infinity, are (@xcite): There are functions of the teukolsky radial equation and the teukolsky radial equation, which are obviously different from those of the teukolsky radial equation. For the radial equations of the kind of general type, the confluent heun function xmath22 has branched points in the complex z plane at the singular points xmath23 and xmath24. for radial equations of the general type, the confluent heun function xmath22 has branching points in the complex z plane at the singular points xmath23 and xmath24 , so that, when changing the phase of the complex variable xmath26, it is possible to move to another sheet of the multivalued function. The correction of a branching form, a tree, and a tree, is done by a branching form, as a block of maple, so that the semi-infinite interval of xmath25 is chosen, as a cut in the real axis. Thus, it is necessary to check whether the two methods have the same precision, and with what precision if you solve the problem as a two-dimensional system with 15 digits of precision (and 32 software floating-point digits) you get the same result, @ xmath31, with the first digit different from the ninth digit being the 17th digit . The numerical results of the frequency finding are summed up in table [17], in which, in the first place, the first digit is used to find the qnms of the black hole in the rectangle . . . . For more information on the epsilon method and numerical methods, see xcite . . . from the angle equation, it is clear that it can be explicitly solved without solving the system, and the values of @ xmath5 are known: @ xmath29 . . . if one solves the problem as a two-dimensional system, 15 digits of precision (and 32 software floating-point digits) , then one will get as expected: @ xmath31, the first digit different from that of digit 9 is the 17th . the first five frequencies (@xmath36) were also obtained by fiziev in @xcite using exact solutions of rwe in the heun functions [cols = , , , , , ], where we see that the frequencies of the two equations coincide with at least six digits. Two important results are derived from this study. First, as can be seen from the table [8] for rwe and tre, the number 8 has a small but nonzero real part. According to the intuition of the evaluators, this method should be equal to xmath36 xcite, with an exactly zero real part, if it is to correspond to the so-called special mode. There are two important results from this study. The first is that, as can be seen from the table, in both the rwe and the tre, the number 8 has a small but nonzero real part. In qnm studies these special (as) modes have a special place in the studies of Qnm , as the Andersson method is not applicable to them and they are not included in his studies. the theoretical 9th mode (@ xmath0) is purely imaginary and has value @ xmath39, if it really corresponds to the as case. The second important result is the dependence of frequencies on @ xmath1 . berti, cardoso and starinets (@ xcite) have a review of the results so far concerning these modes. - This mode clearly contradicts the hypothesis for the as mode, which is to be expected since the as mode is a different boundary condition than those of the so-called totally-transmission modes (@ xcite) . the slope of the longest descent is supposed to be the optimal slope in which the solutions satisfy the black hole boundary conditions on infinity in the first term approximation of asymptotic series So the radial equations are to be found by the shortest method in the simplest form and the weakest method for this, however, remains an open problem. The values of xmath41 are to be found for the positive and negative values of xmath1 in a certain interval, as follows: for xmath43, , xmath45, , xmath46, xmath47, xmath48 , the first sign corresponds to the frequencies with a positive real part, and the second sign to the frequencies with a negative real part. For the heun functions , n , the imaginary parts of each mode n , the results of rwe and tre correspond, as expected, to one another. The validity of the radial descent method in its simplest form, however, under variations in this condition, is, however, still an open problem, which was examined here for the first time. For instance, @xmath0 , the mode has a different behavior with respect to @xmath1 than with respect to @xmath1 for example , one finds a mode with an 'equal-positive' real part and vice versa: - xmath53 . the relation @xmath53 is now to be examined . it was suggested that there are two modes which are symmetrical to the imaginary axis and perhaps relate with the branch cut in the asymptotic asymptotic of the rwe potential, which @xmath2 is purely imaginary. so that the use of the confluent heun functions and the @xmath1 method has a similar (to some extent) property. . . . directly to examine the solutions and properties in the complex r-plane, which cannot be obtained through the continued fractions method, generally used for the qnms.

But in Fig. 1 it was shown that, though the frequency that was found to be stable was at least six digits in order to . . . . , there was a subtler recurrence in the mechanism, and it would be necessary to study its origin carefully. . . . eps             subfigure    includegraphics  height = 120px, width = 110px  fig1d . . . eps          subfigure   includegraphics  height = 120px, width = 110px  fig1d . This work is based on the foundations of the theoretical and computational physics and astrophysics, of which this article is based, and was supported by the foundations of physics and physics and astronomy. For the first time, the qnms of tre were obtained directly from the spectral condition on the exact analytical solutions of rwe and tre, and found to have a nonzero real part, which proves that this mode is not a special one. For the first time, the mode @ xmath0 was obtained directly from the spectral condition of the rwe and tre and was found to have a nonzero real part, which demonstrates that it is not the special bhs algebraically. These results showed the strength of using confluent heun functions to find non-rotating bhs, and encourage the work in finding rotating bhs. The results also show that there are small variations in the phase condition (the @ xmath1 method) which need to be investigated further.
