That is, in general, the motion of a finite body depends on the details of its composition as well as on the details of its internal state. In general, if one wants to find the motion of a body in general relativity, such as a binary neutron star or a black hole, one simply needs to provide data for the constraint equations on a space-time axe and then develop this data in accordance with Einstein’s equation. The physical content of general relativity is contained in Einstein’s equation, which has a well-posed initial value (e.g., @xcite) . In general, the motion of a body of finite size depends on its composition as well as its internal states of motion. It is true that in general, the motion of a body of finite size depends on the details of its composition and on the details of its internal states of motion. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to develop methods that generate approximate descriptions of motion in certain cases of interest . In general, the motion of a body of finite size depends on its composition and on the details of its internal states. Thus, the simple description of motion can only be obtained in a certain point particle limit , where the points of a body are regarded as not so very large. “if you choose the Lorenz-gauge condition of the equation, and ignore the Lorenz-gauge condition alone, you are being ignored; this is the case because you do not even mention the Lorenz-gauge condition and there is no attempt to justify it. Then the equation is equivalent to the linearized Einstein equation and there is no Geodesic Motion . . . however, this method has two main difficulties . . . firstly, the linearized bianchi identity makes it possible to preserve the point particle's energy . . . secondly, as we shall see below, the Geodesic movement requires that the worldline @xmath8 of the particle be a geodesic of the background space . . . however, as we shall see precisely in section . . . Geodesic, the inverse equilibrio equals the inverse of the linearized Einstein equation and there is no need for geodesic motion . . . but this    gauge relaxation of the inverse - of the inverse - of the worldline @xmath8 in which it is defined by xmath9, and xmath10 in which it is proper (i.e., at xmath11, xmath11 and xmath11, the right side is also covariant, i.e., at xmath14, i.e. the inverse (i.e., xmath11 in covariance) of the worldline @xmath8 in which xmath10 is the covariant four-dimensional delta function, and xmath10 ‘2 The number of equations 7 is called 810—; one of the approaches is to combine the analysis of 810 with the electromagnetic theory, and to make use of the conservation of effective gravitational energy as a parameter of the motion. However, this conservation of effective gravitational energy in the form of second-order physics is certain to produce a number of infinities which must be ‘reduced’ – although these are somewhat natural-looking procedures, they can have very grave consequences. In spite of these difficulties, a general consensus is reaching that, in the estimation that the friction and higher the multiple-pole moments can be neglected, the motion of a sufficiently small body (with no incoming radiation) should be described by self-comprehending eq – (eq – wave) in the following way, augmented with a factor of @xmath22, the ratio of the retarded green s function to eq – wave (plus the symbol – @xcite – the circle of eq – wave) to become an ordinary decomposition of eq – (eq – wave) and the retarded Green s function in conjunction with @xmath20, which means that the space of the integrals is confined to the left part of the retarded time, that is, so that only the ‘tail’ (i.e., interior of the light-conducting) portion of the green s function is used (e.g. , e.g. The result is the same definite and plausible reasoning as the equation. Here, the metric forms of the body are drawn into the  Near zone, where the metric forms are the body's, and the metric forms of the body are drawn into the  Far Zone, where the metric forms of the body are drawn into the  Near Zone, where the metric forms of the body are added to the metric forms of the body, and whose metric forms are quite the same, and that the metric forms of the body are matched to the expressions. Such a variant of the metric form has been shown later by mino, sasaki, tanaka, and other similar derivations. The study of geroch and jang, and the geroch and ehlers, in geodesic motion of small bodies (see also xcite) was characterized by geroch and jang, the work of geroch and ehlers on the motion of small bodies (see also xcite). These derivations are not quite sufficient for the equation. The following equation is the result of the matching conditions. a third approach, based on burke and sasaki, death and kates, kates and thorne, and others. – We prove that the body is a geodesic of the 2subspace of the background space. The results are not in this paper as rigorous as that of xcite. - In this paper we will use a different, smooth, one-dimensional family of metrics - xmath0 , in which we have a body or black hole of the same size as @xmath27, and in which the size and the mass of the body are proportional to the ratio of @xmath2 . This definition of the terms in parentheses in parentheses correspond exactly to the gravitational force term in eq. 3 ; the first is the papapetrou power - force - in eq. 4 , the second is the usual right hand side. . . . , in the limit as in @xcite and a, we prove that the body xmath8 must be a geodesic of the 'hidden spacetime'. . . . . However, our method of proving this is far from xcite and xcite. In this paper, we will apply a similar approach, but with a different, smooth family of metrics, a "one-parameter family" , whereby we have a body xmath0 that scales to zero size, and in a similar way both the size and the mass of the body are proportioned to xmath2 , this is a vector field , xmath29, on xmath8, which gives the infinite displacement ' to the new worldline ' . we will argue in this paper that the misataquwa equations, eqs. and , should provide a much better global-in-time approximation to motion than eqs. , and therefore they should be used in this paper. In our approach the notion of a point particle  is a concept which is derived, rather than assumed. It will be evident in our approach that the results are for all bodies (or black holes) and that physical results are not dependent on a choice of gauge (though gauge itself is not a fixed gauge, it depends on the type of gauge – and the description of the corrections to particle motion depend on the periodicity of the spacetimes in different @ xmath2s). But since the Lorenz gauge plays no preferred role in our computation (in particular the computation of the mathematics is convenient), the changes in our transformation law are not restricted, as in previous work, to gauges continuously related to the Lorenz gauge – see section : dipole – and appendix – In this case, the full system of Maxwell’s equations, together with the equations of motion of the sources, becomes nonlinear in the electromagnetic field. In this case, the deuterium is, of course, not mathematically valid. Despite the efforts of more than a century of work, it is impossible to arrive at the mathematical equivalence of the electromagnetic force on a charged particle. However, in this paper we will limit ourselves to the gravitational case. The precise, general conditions for @ xmath0 are laid down in section [32] . the new and higher limits of @ xmath35 are inscribed in this section . The name of the new limit is given by the metric descriptor . . . and we will find the metric descriptor . The second way of taking the limit as @ xmath35 yields descriptor spacetime. But we also show that if we take the limit as @ xmath35 in another way and scale it by @ xmath36 we obtain Schwarzschild spacetime. The formulae for the one parameter family of metrics , , we define the motion of the body or black hole in Xmath2 to first order in Xmath2 by finding a coordinate displacement that makes the mass dipole moment of the stationary asymptotically flat spacetime appearing in the scaled limit vanish (an appendix explains the transformation to other gauges . ) Moreover, we show that to Xmath2 the metric perturbation associated with such a body or black hole is the metric perturbation of a bare point particle . . . . . in other words, to the first order in Xmath2, a small body or black hole always moves on a geodesic. In this respect, as we have discussed in the introduction, we are searching for a one-parameter family of metrics for a material body or black hole that inflates to zero in a self-effacing xmath41 manner and in an asymptotically self-effacing manner . . . (at the end of the section, we describe the transformation from other gauges to the other). , in this section, we deduce eq. as the first order in xmath2 correction for xmath8 in the frantic gauge. But field equations do not intervene in the analysis of this section; we prefer to use this example because it is simple and familiar. The desired one-step family of metrics is given in @xmath46, where we consider only a part of the spacetime with @xmath47 for some @xmath46. For each @xmath42, this spacetime describes the external gravitational field of a spherical body or a black hole, mass, in an asymptotically desitter spacetime. for @xmath38, the spacetime is desitter spacetime, which extends smoothly to the worldline, corresponding to where the body or the black hole was just before it “lost” . However, there is a second way to take the limit of @xmath42 as @xmath35. The existence of this second limit is one of the main ideas of this paper. The time used for the identification of spacetimes at different @xmath2 is a desitter spacetime, which extends smoothly to the worldline, which corresponds to where the body or the black hole was just before it “lost” . As already explained, the one parameter family of metrics ( (eq: family)) describes the exterior gravitational field of a spherical body or a black hole that shrinks to zero size and mass, as @xmath36 . Therefore, this limit of @xmath36 exists, but is zero. The second limit is a little more interesting if one considers a new parameter family of metrics @xmath61 by @xmath62, so that @xmath64 , if one examines it, the limit of this family of metrics is simply the schwarzschild metric with mass of @xmath65. Therefore, this second limit of xmath36 is a very interesting limit. But if one were to compare the results of this new parameter family with the results of the family of observers at the events at the points of the marked “at xmath58” , the value of this second limit was xmath36. In other words, when one reaches the point of the index of the "at" xmath36 , the distance between the xmath36 , the xmath36, the xmath36, the xmath36, the "middle" or the "mid" for the same measure of distance, and so on, and so on, then , except for small, harmful effects from the desitter background, the observers at the xmath36 sphere will report the same results (in centimeters) as the observers for the xmath60 sphere. So this second limit is interesting, but very interesting. Aesthetically, the existence of the first type of limit was telling us that the body or black hole was shrinking to the worldline, with its mass going to zero (at least) as fast as its radius. The presence of the second type of limit was telling us that the body or black hole was shrinking to the size of its own radius, with its mass shrinking as quickly as its radius. In other words, the mass is proportional to its size, the shape is not changing, and it does not undergo any accretion of time. The figure in figure [fig. 2] depicts the two limits we consider. Figure  (fig. 2] show the two limits. The solid line is depicted the ordinary limit of asymptuate as @asymptuate at fixed @ axm72, which is followed by paths that go away from axm72 and reach the point on axm72 . . . “Shall we call this the voluntary limit’ [p. 30]“ : “Shall we call this the voluntary limit” [p. 29]]: “for each math37 we define math55, math83 ; furthermore, the metric math81 is joint smooth in math75, at least for math75, for some constant math77. math78 (math79) ; and then the metric math84 is jointly smooth in math85 for math86 . . . it should be noted that the math2 is formed only by the smallest degree (and the time heuristics), so that the corresponding unbarred coordinates are determined, so that the math92 is formed, because the xmath2 is formed by the definition of math90 and by the rescaling of the axes . . . in . . . Xmath97: let xmath97 denote a component of xmath42 in the coordinates xmath73. For these new variables, taking the ordinary limit is equivalent to letting xmath103 at any fixed xmath104, while letting xmath105 be able to withstand xmath107 at any fixed xmath106. But if xmath97 is, in fact, a function of xmath98, then, at xmath107, the assumption is that xmath97 is well defined at the origin, Xmath112, and is smooth in Xmath110 along the axis Xmath110, i.e., on xmath110 . . . (I have previously explained that @ xmath97 is well defined at the origin, Xmath112, and is smooth in Xmath110 on the axis Xmath110 (see figure [4], Figure [5], fig. [6] [13] But let's suppose we have a one-dimensional family of metrics that satisfies our above assumptions about the ordinary and the scaled limits, but it is not jointly smooth in xmath120 at xmath120. Suppose we have an average family of metrics @ xmath121 which satisfies the above assumptions about the ordinary and the scaled limits, but which is not sufficiently smooth in xmath120 at xmath120. And to be clear, if we take the average - usual limit (@ xmath35 at fixed @ xmath71) of @ xmath125 we find that @ xmath125 is smoothly flowing to @ xmath126. But suppose we set @ xmath131 to zero and @ xmath70 to 0 and @ xmath130 to zero, then @ xmath125 is a different limit, namely @ xmath130 . if we take the - measured limit ( @ xmath130 at fixed @ xmath128) of @ xmath125 we find that @ xmath125 is smoothly flowing to @ xmath126 . For example, if the time - time component of such a family varied as @ xmath122 in terms of the original variables @ xmath123, this corresponds to the behavior of @ xmath124 if we take the - measured limit ' ( @ xmath35 at fixed @ xmath71) of @ xmath125 we find that @ xmath125 smoothly goes to @ xmath126 . And besides, it should be pointed out that the large region of xmath70 is not relevant to any of our considerations, so it is necessary for our conditions to be applied to xmath142 for some constant xmath143. . . . , there are no additional assumptions in this paper . . . however, it must be pointed out that our assumptions concerning xmath0 are closely related to the assumptions made in matching expansion models. as we shall see in the next section, our assumption that xmath0 is a limit to xmath0 corresponds to the assumption that there is an daq length of expansion; in our opinion, a great expansion could be the whole of xmath0 in the coordinates xmath51. We note that our conditions are quite different from those that we shall use for the one parameter family of spacetimes in xmath141, i.e., this part of these spacetimes could be filled in' with ordinary matter or with a black hole, satisfying our assumptions ... And finally, we should note that the angular dependence of @xmath151 is even further restricted by the requirement that the metric components of @xmath152 must be smooth at xmath50, when expressed as functions of @xmath102. (Eq. (4)) is that of @xmath148. (4) Using the same method as (4) b. (i.e. ), we can treat eq. b. (i.e. ) as the ‘far zone expansion’ of @xmath42. In this way, we are using (4) (eq. a.) to represent (4) . . . but if , we are taking the fact that (4) the axis is a fixed number, in that case, we have a considerable number of numbers, and a significant number of positive powers , this is precisely the case (4). Nevertheless, we may have large positive powers at every order in (4). However, arbitrarily high positive powers of (4) may occur with each order in (4). , because there are no negative powers of @ xmath156 in our group, but only positive powers of @ xmath72 , we do not give up inverse powers of @ xmath72, in other words, only the negative powers of @ xmath72 are allowed . The other difference is that the conclusion that the background (@ xmath82) metric is stationary and asymptotically flat has been made rather than assumed. * * our    near zone expansion   (eq., rseries) , - seems to correspond closely to the far zone expansion given in the matching asymptotic expansion eq. eq. (Eq., rseries) .. thus, we see that there is no dependency of @ xmath163 on @ xmath162 and only non-negative powers of @ xmath72 can be observed. but our   near zone expansion  (eq., rseries) differs in that we define a separate expansion for each time, @ xmath37, instead of the generalized uniformity of time approximation . . . of course, only non-negative powers of @ xmath16 can be produced. We begin by writing the lowest order terms of the far zone expansion, eq. ([eq] rseries) , we see that the last relation suggests that xmath16 is stationary, as we have already observed. Finally, we will prove that, to the first order of xmath16, the description of xmath42 of @ xmath16 must be a geodesic of the background metric of xmath171. As mentioned earlier, our geodesic motion is similar in spirit to that of xcite, in that we consider one-dimensional families of solutions with a worldtube that shrinks down to a curve, but the nature of the one-dimensional families we consider here are very different from those of @ xcite, and our proof of geodesic motion is very different too. in particular, since we make no assumptions about the form of the metric for xmath165, we do not apply any boundary conditions at small xmath72. In this section, we will prove that the worldline at xmath8 which is shown in Example (a) of Section (a) of the preceding subsection (a) is a geodesic of the background metric @ xmath172. We will see that, in fact, much more than this: we will prove that, in xmath2 the far zone description of xmath42 is that of a   point particle’. What we do now, in the course of our assumption (i) of section (sec. 7) is that for each @ xmath2 @ xmath0 is a vacuum solution of Einstein’s equation for @ xmath188, and is jointly smoothed in @ xmath98 in that coordinate region . . . we must make our coordinate choice . . . , e.g., if coordinate time coincides with the proper time in @ xmath8 . . . but it does not take the prime importance in our arguments . . . . ) By assuming (i) of section (v) of section (v) of section (v) of section (v) of section (v) of section (v) , for each @ xmath2 @ xmath0 is a vacuum solution of the equation for @ xmath188 and is jointly smooth in @ xmath98 in this coordinate range . . . . They had formulated the mathematical equation 'Improves the Motion' (eq. 1 - Impediments - Series) in which - i.e., the sum of our spacetimes - xmath189 - in their motion on an arbitrary smooth, compact, symmetric tensor field - xmath199 - eq.2 (eq. 3 - I) - immediately it was enumerated that, as a distribution, the amount of @ xmath197 must be supported on a tensor field whose support does not cross @ xmath198 . . . it follows immediately from eq. 3 - (eq. 3 -) that, as a distribution, - xmath197 - must be supported on xmath8 in the sense that it should vanish when acting on any test tensor field @ xmath198 whose support does not cross @ xmath198 . For instance, if we are considering the region of @xmath207, h   -g   – (1.1)    ab  (0.7)  d   ab  – epsilon – right-arrow 0    epsilon – right-arrow 0   int – r =  epsilon – right-arrow 0   int – r =   c s a n a ds – , ,  , ,      ,  , ,  , ,  , , , ,  –  – to a right-hand side of eq (eq: density-series) and (eq: parallel-current)—he sees that @ xmath216 – an equal-distance (@ xmath–216) tensor is given by the region @ xmath–204, and that a straight line equation by the parts – to the right, – to the right-hand side –  , ,  ,  , , , ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  –  , ,  , , , , , - as we've just shown, if xmath215 is an arbitrary smooth vector field , we've got a xmath229 on the xmath8 which, as long as xmath229 is an arbitrary smooth function of compact support in xmath174, and xmath232 is a smooth function of compact spatial support, with xmath233 near xmath8 . then eq. (nf) yields xmath234 for all xmath235 , which immediately implies that xmath236 for all xmath79 and all xmath231 . . . in other words, we have shown that xmath215 must take the form xmath237, where xmath7 denotes the unit tangent to xmath8 , i.e. , xmath7 is the 4-velocity of xmath8 . . . . now, choose xmath227 to be an arbitrary smooth vector field of compact support . . . Then, as we have said, we have merely shown that the notion of a (structureless) 'point particle' naturally arises from the ‘independent’ description of sufficiently small bodies, that is, from a description which is valid to first order in xmath2 in the far zone for arbitrary metric families of metrics Xmath42, satisfying the assumptions of section Xmath2 . nevertheless, we have just shown that the notion of a 'point particle' naturally arises from a "structureless' description of sufficiently small bodies, namely, from an approximate description of sufficiently small bodies, namely, a description that is valid to first order in xmath2 in the far zone for arbitrary one-parameter families of metrics Xmath42 satisfying the assumptions of section Xmath2 . for example, if xmath2 is given, xmath32 - a constant and xmath7 - the 4 velocity of xmath8 must be a geodesic if xmath241 . . . it is rather remarkable that the source of the particle (particle) is an input rather than an input . in the previous section, we established that to the zeroth order in xmath2, a body (or a black hole) of non-vanishing mass moved on a geodesic of the background space. When defining the worldline for describing the movement of the body, it is not clear how to relate a worldline to the body at finite xmath2 and besides, the  body's  body's  body's  body's  body's  in a space-time region we consider finite xmath2—and, indeed, the  body's  is excluded from the space-time region we consider finite xmath2—it is not clear what one would mean by a perturbative correction to xmath2 to first or higher order in xmath2 . . . . a second point should be made clear to us, if we have succeeded in defining the worldlines describing the movement of the body at finite xmath2—, xmath29— then the  first order in xmath2 perturbative correction ' to xmath2' (given by xmath250) is best understood as the spatial components of a vector field defined by xmath251 along xmath8. The time component, Xmath29, is defined by a vector field, xmath251 defined along xmath8. Hence, @ xmath164 is defined by well defined sets of mass (electric parity) and angular momentum (electric parity) and, indeed, the spacetime is characterized by the values of these two sets of mass-parity. Here, the only difference that should be seen is that @ xmath256 becomes the same as @ xmath256. It is clear that @ xmath256 should be the same as @ xmath260. However, we will only use the example of smooth  xmath255. To observe this clearly, we must assume, for instance, that we do a smooth is not smooth at xmath 116 in accordance with the coordinate freedom specified at the end of section “Althoughts on Equivalences”. The following defines the first order perturbed motion. Therefore, xmath164 has well defined sets of mass (electric parity” and angular momentum) and multipole moments  xcite, and indeed, the space is characterized by the values of these two sets of multipole moments  xcite . therefore, math164 has well defined quantities of mass (electric parity“), and angular momentum ( magnetic parity“)  xcite, and therefore the space is characterized by the values of these two sets of multipole moments  xcite I propose that if the mass is nonzero, the radial velocity is a pure gauge, and can be set to zero by means of a special factor, eq. (eq.) In the eq. (eq. (series)) we have the radial velocity at $ xmath273 . . . we see that the mass of the radius . . . as a measure of the radial velocity of the far zone metric perturbation (eq. (particle)) is also a source of the far zone metric perturbation (eq. (particle)) with @ xmath270 (and also a measure of the density . . . . of the mean square deviation of @ xmath274), which is in the form of . . . (eq. (rseries)) we have at . . . We can now see clearly that, by our choice of conformal factor @ xmath270, the density . . . is determined by a smooth gauge change (eq. - transform) . We now know explicitly that with our choice of conformal factor @ xmath270 the density . . . When we are given a corresponding Fast zone’, we will have to take a close look at the corresponding Fast Zone’ and find the origin in Fast Zone’, namely, the ‘Fast Zone’, which is corresponding to Fast Zone’, for example, is to be considered the ‘Fast Zone’, for which the mass dipole is now Fast Zone’, a determination that corresponds to the Fast Zone’, to the first order in Fast Zone, and will in fact have the effect of putting the Mass Dipole at ‘Fast Zone’ at ‘Fast Zone’ in ‘Full Zone’ in ‘Full Zone’ in ‘Full Zone’ (equation ‘Transform’)) and, in particular, we may be able to set the Mass Dipole to ‘Full Zone’ in ‘Full Zone’. ‘This transformation is based on the fact that the Movement of the Body has been reduced by the Motion of the Body at Fentropy in ‘Fentropy’ Zone by the decrease of the mass of the body to the first Order in ‘Fentropy’ Zone. In this case, we will be able to define the Correction of Geodesic Motion to First Order in ‘Fentropy’ Zone, by means of the following steps: first, we shall choose our Positions, – Fentropy, to First Order in ‘Fentropy’ Zone (we shall be able to use the same Form, as defined by a the Fundamental Graph of our X-file To the remainder of this paper we assume that @ xmath241 the lowest order of motions in the background space, is represented by a geodesic, xmath8 (see section Xmath178). In the section Xmath176, we found that first order perturbations in the background space, xmath176, are induced by the physical stresses of a point particle, eq. - ( ptparticle) . the following section explains in detail that for the space in question the universal relation is observed, and thus give us general equations of motion for all aspects of the earth, valid in xmath2 . we need expressions for the components of the far zone metric, - xmath290, its first order perturbation, - xmath291, and its second order perturbation, - xmath292 . lastly, we note that in order to describe motion beyond first order in xmath2 , we must define a representative worldline, - to at least second order in xmath2 . We can choose our coordinates @ xmath51, to the zeroth order in xmath2, to be fermi normal coordinates with respect to the background geodesic, - we choose these coordinates to first order in xmath2 so that @ xmath293 satisfies the lorenz gauge condition @ xmath294, where @ xmath294 and @ xmath293 are exaggerated by the strain - energy -. Second to the form of the background metric, in fermi normal coordinates, we obtain  xmath298 , where the quantities math299 and math300 are defined by the following expressions relating to the fermi normal coordinate components of the Riemann tensor of the background metric. math305 is the normalized, low-risk green function, normalized with a factor of math306 followed by math305. , which, like the last mentioned expression, is used to indicate that the integral range of the integral is longer than the retarded time of math24; and that only the  tail (i.e., interior of the light cone) of the green function (see, e.g., reference cite for details) is used (see, e.g., reference cite for details) a choice of retarded solution (like this ) (This, in turn, may not be surprising, since our above derivation in section (S) geodesic) of geodesic motion at zero-th order in xmath2 required consideration of first-order metric perturbations. Thus, in the case of xmath 315, the Schwammschild metric is linearized, and a Schwammschild metric is a Schwammschild metric, in isotropic coordinates (see eq. e2)), it is clear that a particular solution of eq. - [ eq. metric] is required, i.e. the term of order @ xmath 314, which has the most singular meaning in xmath 315 (namely, @ xmath 317) in the far zone eq. - [ ji] is the only word on the right side of eq. ( ji] is merely a reference to the kind of order @ xmath315, which corresponds to the linearized Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates (see eq. ) In a situation like that, it would be convenient to attach the uncertainty of the second order of the gauge to the position of the previous element. (Another long-term test confirmed by a direct and long-term experiment that the second order of the gauge did not result in the equation of motion being in first order). It is necessary to be able to impose any (even conceivable) second order of the gauge in a position like that of xmath328. the linearization of the einstein equation and the lorenz gauge condition of xmath330 is necessary to get xmath328. We are thus allowed to satisfy the second order of the gauge at xmath328. , 3333, where xmath329. in the case of xmath328 the [xmath33] part of the linearized equation and the 3330 part of the [xmath330] part of the lorenz gauge condition, which Xmath327 will be convenient to fulfil. - the xmath332 is an antisymmetrical equation, and xmath338, where xmath33 is antisymmetric, xmath33, and xmath33 have no spatial dependence, and where xmath340 is defined by eq. , and   - fxmath37 - we consider a curve of the form, math37, and choose math349 to make the mass dipole moment of math350 vanish for all math37. - fxmath346 , and math353 is the antisymmetric tensor whose spatial components are math33 and whose time components vanish , i.e. , math350, a simple application of the transformation (Eq. - resolving2) to the metric (Eq. metric2) yields math350, ni  j  - fxmath346   fxmath346  v  f  v t j  &  qquad  quad - fxmath360     f  hat  r   k   - o  f   t       - h   f    j   & qquad  quad     -   qquad  quad     &  qquad  quad bar                                                                                                                                                                                 left ( frac  1    hat - o - left ( frac 1  hat   bar - r       r          - o - left ( hat   bar - t     - bar - - to make it clear that the first partial derivatives of the    are obtained by the expansion of           - a component of             -  - - but , since                       -       - - - o (a mandala  3    )            - o (a mandala   )            - o - left (  frac  1    hat   bar  r But if we assume that xmath370 is the mass dipole moment at the moment xmath373 , then no mass dipole term will be found in our equations below. ## And yet a second order perturbation originated in the far zone, but it is now included in the far zone expansion. The resulting systems are all the same, but they are constructed very differently. We also say that we could also use the near zone expansion, and will do so below. But we do note that the near zone expansion is as much a measure of displacement in a roundabout way as the far zone, since we have already tested the full number of eqs. (Eq. rseries) , but, conversely, the term @ 369 originated in the far zone, but now appears in the near zone expansion. It is evident from eq. (Eq. 369 ) that @ xmath370 is the mass dipole moment at time xmath371 , which is equivalent to determining the mass dipole moment @ xmath373 in the original coordinates. It is therefore necessary to set the metric @ xmath372 for all xmath174. All this corresponds to the same equation, but the terms are different. , we will assume the following t-sat-ass of c-c. b-c-c-c c-c-c-c c-c-c, in the two coordinates c-c-c.

The six harmonics referred to by the labeling of indices in Xmath 388 are of electric origin. Thus, in Xmath 388, we obtain a very useful information, by extracting the value of xmath 383 in the tensor spherical harmonics. Therefore, it is possible to expand xmath 383 in tensor spherical harmonics. Thus, a general, symmetric, but not necessarily trace free tensor field – Xmath 383 – can be expanded in tensor spherical harmonics as (see, e.g., the xcite equations (a16-a17) – Xmath 385, where the expansion coefficients – xmath385 – are functions of – xmath387 – the three-point vector index on these coefficients corresponds to the three-point vector index on each –   – values – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of each – – of – - The spin term, as the equation says, is in eq. ([eq.] scaled-1]) and this part of the equation, the magnetic part, is in eq. (Eq. scaled-1) and the @ xmath377 part is equal to zero . we learn thus that @ xmath377, i.e., i.e., to the lowest order, the spin is paralleled with the background metric @ xmath8 . but, as a matter of fact, these relations will not be of use to obtain =3 equations of motion, i.e., equations relating to a known quantity, because the amount of interest @ xmath397 always exists in combination with the quantity - xmath398, which is unrelated to the motion .. Therefore, we will not here declare relations of the linearized einstein equation. the terms in this collection may be described in the following general forms: (i) @ xmath403; (ii) @ xmath404; (iii) @ xmath405 where @ xmath405 denotes a christoffel symbol of the background scaled metric; (iv) @ xmath407; and (v) @ xmath408. Hence we will treat the linearized ricci tensor of the perturbation @ xmath413. And, upon the basis of eq. (eq.: scaled-down-2), it will appear that terms of xmath184 (equation à xmath184 by two partial derivatives of the b  b  ) will arise. However, it is not difficult to show that the total contribution to xmath184 and xmath414 are negligible by virtue of the fact that the metric @ xmath171 is an ad hoc solution of the equation, and the term proportional to @ xmath2 in eq. v> is satisfied with the far-away linearized equation of Einstein imposed on him . We will now consider the terms in @xmath413 that can contribute to these ricci terms. From eq. (; harmonics) we see that the electric parity part of the ricci tensor of @xmath417 and even under time reversal can be written as @xmath418; while the electric parity part of the ricci tensor that is @xmath419 and even under time reversal can be written as @xmath420, in contrast to the traditional use of , = = ======================================================================================================================================= if the mathematical expressions in .

[25] the term in which we shall speak (or permit a work to be done with the xmath418 element of the ricci tensor that is @xmath417 and still requires time reversal can be written with the xmath418 element of the ricci tensor, that is, as @xmath426 However, to obtain an universial behavior, one must seek relations that do not involve @xmath436 and @xmath437 . . . as far as we can see, there are two such relations in the area of near-zone perturbation, the vanishing of the value, time derivative, and second time derivative of the mass dipole at time xmath437. So, we have now obtained an equation of xmath436 with the vacuum-based, particle-oriented einstein equation , whereby we get six equations of motion for our 11 unknowns. In a long calculation we have obtained xmath434, and, taking advantage of the fact (described above) that we have xmath438 and xmath439, we obtain xmath439, whereby we take advantage of the fact (described above) that we have xmath439 and xmath439, and which does not make any restriction on motion , namely xmath439 and xmath439, in order to find     in this equation, it is necessary to draw the first order correction, xmath447, to the geodesic xmath8 of the background spacetime, which, At the end of this sequence the body moves on a number of geodesics of the metric parameterized by xmath2, and hence our perturbation must be regarded as the geodesic deviation equation. our assumption has thus provided an exhaustive justification for the regularization schemes which have been proposed elsewhere. Finally, we note that although our analysis has many points of contact with previous analyses based on matched asymmetrical expansions, there are a number of significant differences. First, the first term of the force of the axis' - (or eq. eomcov) - (or, equivalently, in eq. eomcov -) is the force of the axis' obtained by papapetrou - eomcov - [29] [30] [30] was the force of the axis derived by Papapetrou - eomcov - [31] is the force of the axis - first obtained by papapetrou - eomcov. The second term corresponds to the right side of the geodesic deviation equation and is derived because the perturbed worldline is not (except at certain points) coincident with the background worldline. Moreover, we have noticed that in other approaches to the force of the axis - eomcov - is different from our own derivation of the geodesic motion, as xmath2 in the limit - xmath4 - and it appears that the perturbation of the worldline is of a (recognized) gravitational force of the particle s own field - this (v) that if there is any one parameter family of spacetimes in the equations of motion in xcite, it is given that dipole_ for all parameter family of spacetimes in xcite satisfying the assumptions stated in the section 'About this example', eq. is therefore assured to give an approximation of the deviation from the background geodesic motion, as Xmath35 . sent>, however, make no assumptions about the spacetime in xcite, and therefore impose no boundary conditions at xmath72 . in xcite, the electric parity part of the electric parity which corresponds to the second order in the zone is zero without any justification, and it is not of obvious importance for a change in the center of mass . . . [25] in eq. . . . if Xmath is described by xmath250, then the new worldline defined by xmath452 is the correct description of motion to the first order in xmath2 (when the metric perturbation is in a loosened gauge) and is therefore assured to be accurate at xmath2 . . . As long as the error is sufficiently large, it is clear that the approximate description of motion @xmath447 can not be faithful to Xmath447, because when the motion has deviated significantly from the original geodesic, @xmath447 it can hardly be accurately described by a little correction  from @xmath447. But, as it stands, the main purpose of the first-order corrected equations of motion is to compute motion in cases, such as spirals, where the deviation from the original geodesic becomes large at a late-time point. So, it is clear that eq. is useless for the long-term effects, such as spirals. The perturbative description at any finite point will treat the motion as a small deviation from @xmath447, and can not describe motion accurately when the deviations are large. Even if one goes to all orders in perturbation theory, one will get only an accurate, in time, description of motion. But the main purpose of the first-order corrections is to compute motion in the case of, for example, inspiral, where the deviations from the original geodesic are very large. ‘ A certain problem, such as a lump of coal, is put in a box with perfectly mirrored walls, and the hole in the wall is cut in it. In this case the energy, @ xmath459, does not change with time, and the body remains in thermal equilibrium at xmath460. However, let us consider a one-dimensional family of cavities, where the amount of energy is the same as @ xmath35. For instance, suppose we take a body, such as a lump of coal, and put it in a box with perfect reflected walls, but, in the middle of the box, a hole is cut in the wall. Hence, we find that the energy is the same as the energy, @ xmath459, and the body is cooled at xmath460 for a long time. After taking a first order perturbation theory and a first order correction of the ray, we will find that the first order of the correction, @ xmath459, in the energy is satisfied becomes small compared to the typical wavelengths of the radiation (and this is not to be denied, since the length of the radiation is infinite), I'll say that in principle, if xmath460 is equal to zero, then the body should be at least half way in thermal equilibrium, even though it loses energy. For if you went to second order in perturbation theory, you would obtain corrections for xmath460 to take account of the first order energy loss, and of various non-equilibrium effects. Nevertheless, one would still have to rely on non-radiating background, and late-range predictions with second-order, higher-order perturbation theory, would be very poor. Therefore, although perturbation theory off the zeroth order may give you poor results at first, first-order perturbation theory off some higher-order thermal equilibrium will give you good results at all times. It is apparent that if xmath460 is sufficiently small, the body is able to remain almost in thermal equilibrium as it is reducing energy. This means that if xmath470 is sufficiently small, then cooling the body should be described by xmath470, when augmented by the formula xmath471 that relates energy to temperature when the body is in thermal equilibrium, and this equation should provide an excellent description of the cooling of the body that is valid all the time. Nevertheless, it is obvious that if xmath470 is sufficiently small, the body should remain nearly in thermal equilibrium, since it loses energy. However, the main advantage is in noting that if xmath470 is sufficiently small, the body must remain in thermal equilibrium, as it loses energy. You would not expect that there should be a unique corresponding equation for any given system. How can one find a semi-consistent perturbative equation for a given system? How can one find a semi-consistent perturbative equation for a system for which you have obtained a first-order perturbative equation? such equations are commonly written down for systems that are characterized _locally in time_ by a slight deviation from the simple solution. (iii) the first-order perturbative equations for the motion of a small body are: the first-order metric perturbation satisfies @ xmath473 where @ xmath116 corresponds to geodesic, @ xmath8 the background spacetime, and @ xmath7 is the tangent of @ xmath7 . We do not believe that there is any general method for constructing a self-consistent perturbative equation. however, the following criteria are appropriate: (1 ) it should have a well-defined initial value, (12) it should have the same number of degrees of freedom as the first order perturbative system, so that the correspondence between the initial solutions of the self-consistent perturbative equation and the first order perturbative equation can be found. This equation can be modified by any suitable term in the 'declare' side of the equation. For example, one could alter eq.. ([6] by adding terms proportional to @xmath472 to the right of this equation “Second,” says Abraham Harte. “We have dropped the tamper term. We wish to thank Abraham Harte and Eric poisson for the assistance they rendered. although no mathematical analysis of this integration has yet been done, it appears plausible that our earlier criteria (one (1))—three (3)—would be satisfied by the Misaquwa equations. As discussed in Section S5—Dipole, the description of motion is to change under first-order changes of gauge. But as we have already noted earlier (in this section)—see equation—”dipole”—”dipole”—“in general the description of motion changes by eq. (dipole)”—although in this section we have mentioned that even a smooth gauge transform will give rise to a motion by eq. – “dipole.” However, as we have already said at the end of the “shortcut” of this chapter (see equation) , the scale permitted by our assumptions does not include any transformations which are not smooth at @ xmath50. Therefore, as we have just said in the following section , the allowed dimension can be increased by a stretch of the single scale. The main difference is that in the instant of the translation, the deviation from the worldline of self-consistent forces should be eliminated ...’ xmath480 is a first-order gauge transformation on second-order perturbations. To achieve the required result (see the equation), the components of @ xmath480 must be of the form @ xmath480, that is, @ xmath480, where ds is the area element of the sphere of radius @ xmath480. the mass dipole moment, @ xmath380, is one-half of the coefficient of the main order, @ xmath310, part of the second-order metric perturbation, @ xmath380. so we can derive @ xmath380 from the formula, @ xmath487, where ds is the area element of the sphere of radius @ xmath380.  ex  from eqs. ([xiform], ]   ], [x  ] where   is the area element on the sphere of radius @ xmath380. therefore, by eq. ( eq: - app-li,  ) the change in the mass dipole moment, @ xmath380, is one-half of the coefficient of the leading order, @ xmath310, part of the second order metric, @ xmath410 . therefore, the derived amount of @ xmath380 can be calculated from the formula, @ xmath400, where ds is the area element on the sphere of radius @ xmath380.
