The composition of the background field formalism in the harmonic superspace of x-cite (@x-cite) is an open problem, and there are a few very subtleties in this construction, and the analysis is based on them. However, the subject of this paper is a case of constructing the background field formalism in the harmonic superspace of x-cite without requiring knowledge of the connections in an explicit way in the terms of x-cite. And it is true that the same chiral, but background-real representation has been described in the n-subject of x-cite. . . . such a representation is desired in any (non-supersymmetric) supersymmetric theory because it makes the calculations more straightforward and even to the intermediate steps respecting gauge covariance. In this study, we argue that background-field formalism in x-subjects has a very simple construction; though the formulation has its particular features, it has been refined in several studies and in numerical work, and in particular, it is derived from the classical research of R. Fyodorovich. Here we consider the close relationship between the harmonic supersphere and n-subject (X-subject) — that is, the tropical hyperfield, for all practical purposes, whose nature is the sym multiplet, x-subject . It is reminiscent of the quantum chiral, but background-real representation of n-subject — which is the hyperfield of n-subject — of n-subject. Such a representation is crucial for any (non-supersymmetric) supersymmetric theory as it simplifies (circuit) calculations and even at first steps respects the covariance of This is in contrast to the n = 1 sym, but very similar to the harmonic treatment of n = 2 theory. We are more or less building up the ordinary projective superspace of sym described in the xcite. we summarize it briefly here for the sake of continuity. we are also devoted to the irrational superspace construction of sym, as shown in Xcite. Besides the expected faddeev-popov and the nielsen-kallosh (quasonic @ xmath12), we also need two extra ghosts, namely real quasonic @ xmath13 and complex quasonic @ xmath14 . also, we need two extra ghosts, namely, real quasonic @ xmath14 and complex fermionic @ xmath14 . This is in contrast to n = 1 sym but very similar to the harmonic treatment of n = 2 sym. The major point of this section is that of the ordinary projective superspace construction described in xcite . this section is mainly built on the ordinary projective superspace construction of sym which is shown in xcite . however, in xcite sym we do not meet such striking similarities . only, these divergences are similar, leading to the cancellation of the vector hyperfield’s contribution and the contribution of the extra ghosts. The algebra of the covariant derivatives will be described in the following section, but we should note here that in the real  representation (called  reflective  in @xcite, and we have taken extensive advantage of in this work), the @xmath24s are вxmath24dependent. The super-covariant derivatives corresponding to these extra math20s create a projective hyperfield (math21) governed by the constraint вxmath21. so, the projective measure simply reads: @xmath26, suppressing the usual factor of @xmath27. —     w  a We have a multiplicative action for @xmath40: ‘ xmath37’; ‘xmath37’ is an unconstrained complex hyperfield; and we can solve the commutation relation for @xmath35 by writing @xmath37, where @xmath37 is a complex hyperfield, as @xmath39 is the background covariant derivative. Then we have the opportunity to choose a new real  representation for the background derivatives, such as @xmath40. We now have the option of selecting the quantum part of the covariant derivatives in the real  representation, such as @xmath40, or math40. Then we can then choose the quasi-reflective – analytic – constraint on hyperfields, @xmath45; then we can now define the quasi-reflective – constraint on hyperfields as a background, as a background covariant derivative, such as a background covariant derivative . we know from @xcite that this action should be applied to xmath7 and therefore the quasi-reflective – constraint on hyperfields is a perfectly acquittal choice. “Here the quantization of the curves is done in the background gauge, and this formalism will remain unchanged, as will the rest of the kinetic operators in the equations of motion. The calculus in the background gauge is as follows: the ordinary derivatives are replaced by the covariant derivatives of Xmath56, and Xmath55 is replaced by the subscript “ xmath54” on Xmath55. The kinetic operator appearing in the equations of motion is @ xmath59, @ xmath42, @ xmath60. , – 4 4 4  right] – – 2   4   , – end  gathered  ]  -  - End  gathered   ] . . . the normal derivatives are now - covariant derivatives, and @ xmath54 becomes replaced by @ xmath56 (or @ xmath55) everywhere. The quantization procedure in the xcite foreground proceeds in the same way as before: @ xmath52 and @ xmath62. This is the basic principle of the scalar hypermultiplet and will be considered in the future. The modulus of the fp ghosts is similar to that of the scalar hypermultiplet and will be discussed later. _  1  4  non-umber  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  , _ _ _ 2  _ _ , _ _ 2   left (-             right)   right) _ _ _   _     y _ _    y _ _   y _  12   left (-              y _  12       y _  12     left    left     left      left ” ” That is to say, there is the equation of motion for @ xmath1: xmath72 and demands that it satisfy ([eomf]) that it is correct, for now, as the equation of motion for @ xmath71 is written, it reads: xmath72, because xmath72  left [1 + frac ]    2   2  dx , dx  4    2  dx , dx , dx , dx , dx , dx   dx , dx  , dx  dx , dx    dx , dx  dx  , dx  , dx   , dx  , dx                                                  [] []  []]       , dx        dx “Q” is the same as that of the harmonic case Xcite. Taking the harmonic case X, we reconfigure the equation to Xmath85 and introduce nielsen–kallosh—nk—for the production of the resulting jacobian. a procedure in which we consider the effect of Xmath86 directly in the path integral is to introduce a real scalar Xmath14 and a complex fermion Xmath15, which we call ‘Q’, because Q’ = ‘2 xmath’, because Q’ = ‘2’. This operation makes sense for Xmath94 and – a Q’ = ‘2’, which makes sense for the Q’, and which the Q’ is over-subscribed by a ‘Z’, – and a ‘Z’ is a zero-point zero-point – and thus the Q’ for Xmath94 is very similar, and the    is the full quantum action for n = 2 sym – which consists of:  – aq’ – and – aq’ –  (aq’) – aq’ – aq’ – and aq’ –  ‘ ’ (v, v, aq’) – aq’ (v, aq’), aq’ –    – ’  The two other operators of the radii should be extended to @xmath103 (the acoustic component of @xmath56) in order to make the vertices with the vector connection and background fields. The result is that the action diminishes to @xmath101 and leads to the required propagator of the radii [xeom]. xmath105 - Right –      - -  –   -    –  –  –  –  –  –  – the propagator of the fermionic radii has the same expression. Having obtained the general rules of the background field formalism for sym, we may now employ it to calculate the contributions to the effective action coming from different hypermultiplets. The general rules of the background field formalism are like those described in Xcite. However, as is expected in this formalism, the quantum propagators form the internal lines of the loops and the external lines correspond to the background fields . . . so the calculation required for this contribution (as well as the uv-diverse part) is quite straightforward. The first non-vanishing contribution is from the 4  8 point diagram:                                                        left (               left ( w  n        right)    left (        left (           right)   left (         left   left (    na  y   na   na        right)      left ( w  (   n)             right)    left ( w  (n) ... ”(4pdiv) is the complete 4 point effective action.

The essential element was to recognize that different representations of the background and the quantum portions of the hypermultiplets were needed. a few more specific representations, like the arithmetic scheme of feynman and super-feynman, were needed. these extra representations were needed only in the harmonic case, but in the projective case they resolved spurious  harmonic' divergences that come from the vector hypermultiplet in a straightforward way and the resultant infinity pieces were as expected for n = 4. and had also formulated a theoretical formalism of 2-loop elements for the finiteness of n = 2 coupled with matter. It was necessary, however, to recognize that there were different representations of the hypermultiplets in the formalism we developed here. The analytical representation of the background fields allowed us to apply the non-renormalization theorems to the rest of the n-dimensional field. In order to reach this formalism, improvements were made, as are pointed out in @xcite; and it was our hope that such techniques could be applied to the formalism that we developed in this paper. The extra ghosts of the n-dimensional fractions tended to be less than the usual ghosts, fp and nk, but in the projective fractions they completely obliterated the spurious harlequinces coming from vector hypermultiplets, and the resultant indeterminate fractions are as expected for n-dimensional fractions. Moreover, there were more ghosts (other than fp and nk) needed to calculate the effective action of the n-dimensional fraction.
