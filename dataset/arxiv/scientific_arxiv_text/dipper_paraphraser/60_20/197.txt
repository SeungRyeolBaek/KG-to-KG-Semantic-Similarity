The discovery of charge migration in dna molecules has opened new avenues of investigation, starting with the role of dna in oxidative damage and repair, and the application of dna in electronics ... It should be noted that the dna molecule has been subjected to intense research, both theoretically and experimentally. As a result, the two charges are transferred according to the structure and the conditions of the dna molecule, that is, the superexchange charge transfer and the incoherent hopping. However, most of the research has been done on the transfer properties, such as the orbital overlapping , the activation energy for charge movement, i.e. the ip and the reorganization energy , has been conducted on the nucleobases or on the bases. We have been very interested in the dna molecule. From all the studies on charge migration in the dna molecule, it is clear that there are two methods of transfer of charge, depending on the dna structure and the transfer parameters, a superexchange transfer and an incoherent hopping , which is significantly influenced by the motion of the nucleotides and the surrounding environment, which significantly contribute to the dna swarm. From all the studies about charge migration in the dna molecule, it is clear that there are two paths for the transfer of charge depending on the structure of the dna and its structure: a superexchange and a incoherent hopping . the charge swarming leads to the changes in geometry of the nucleotides and the surrounding environment, which significantly contribute to the dna s so that the six-33 @ xmath7 g@ xmath8 basis of the calculation was, in this case, used in the simulation of the electrochemical coupling of the nucleobases within the a-tr3@xmath1 and -g@ xmath1 oligomers. Our synthesis used the law of koopmans to estimate the electronic coupling as half of the adiabatic state splitting between the homo and homo-1 of the closed shell neutral system , which, in a double-looped sphere, was always the same, - so that we applied the Law of rhf - 7—“ xmath7, -“ xmath8,” in a whole series, which were of the cathodic and the pi-branch program. - The parameters for this explanation were: rhf, -31 @ xmath7g, -“ xmath8 . . . . So, if the domain is extended, the electron coupling will diminish. Moreover, according to the Law of Koopmans theorem, the electronic coupling can be estimated in half as much as half the adiabatic transfer of electrons from one to the other to the neutral-surface neutral system.

We will start with the system of two stacked duplexes. We have also tested the application of the hf method and the dft theory to the vertical ionization potential (vip), and found that the hf was pronounced qualitatively and quantitatively in disagreement with experimental data, whereas we have found that the becket approximation is proper for this purpose. For the pyrimidine/pyrimidine and purine/ purine bases stacked in the same strand (a-t / t - a , g-c - c - c) and in the mixed form (a-t - c - c - c - c) in some cases the xmath0 orbitals are delocalized, but the electronic coupling is weak. for the pyrimidine / pyrimidine and purine / purine bases stacked in one strand (a-t - t - a - a - a - a - a - a - a - a) and in the mixed structures (a-t - c - a - c - a - t - a - t) , for some cases the xmath0 orbitals are delocalized for the two strands, and the weak intrastrand and interstrand coupling between them can be observable. The results for the highest base orbital (hobo) are shown in table [ tab : table1] On the contrary, if the base pairs are stacked into the (g-c) @xmath1 and (a-c) @xmath1 oligomers, then the decrease of the adiabatic ip (see fig. 5, fig. 5), and the reorganization energy of the innersphere (see fig. 5), results in a decrease of the vip , which is the sum of the above two components. Then, we consider the electrostatic potential distribution of the (g-c) @xmath1 and a-c@xmath8 oligomers as a single entity, for the following calculations of @xmath14. We have noted that, in a dielectric oligomer, the mixing of base pairs is more like a reduction of the geometry relaxation of each nucleobase and a reduction of the @xmath30.  xcite .. [27] by the strength of the forces of the adiabatic ip (see fig. [28] and the inner sphere reorganization (see fig. [29]) leads to the reduction of the Vp, which is the sum of these two components. ‘ Xmath36’ is calculated as follows: ‘the difference between the internal-sphere reorganization energy of the (a-t) @xmath1 and the (g-c) @xmath1 oligomers is calculated by the ub3p86 – p624 – 311 ‘ xmath37’ and ‘xmath2 = 5’ is calculated by ub3p86 – 6–311 ‘ xmath7’ and ‘xmath8’ – in short, our results agree with the data in ref. – xcite . , in addition to the results of the test, the kinetic behaviour of the oligomers is also compared to the charges accumulating in the oxidized state. Thus, the mass density in the oligomers in the oxidized state leads to the maximal relaxation of the geometry in the centre of the dna chain. There are such results in a good agreement with the theory of polaron formation in the dna molecule, where the maximum dielectricity is formed in the polaron centre. So, the polaron centres in the central nucleobase are the ones most likely to have accumulated charge on the bases, nearest to the center of the oligomer. The sphere charge in the dna molecule is the one that most strongly influences the geometry of the base pair, owing to their location in the oligomer. Hence, the bases in the chain center have greater polarization than in the polaron center. In fact, the number of base pairs in the chain is greater than the number of base pairs near the center.   - c . . . s. , a. . . . and a. . . . a. . . the authors would like to thank dr. e. b. starikov for the informative comments. . . . the authors would like to thank dr. e. . . . for an enlightening discussion. . . . h. sugiyama, i . . saito, d. j. d. wu, x. liu, j. liu, r . . - v . m. apalkov, t . g. h. orlandi, d. j. phys . . . .
