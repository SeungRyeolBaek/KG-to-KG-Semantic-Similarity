It has long been known that owing to the degree of asymmetry and mutual focus, colliding cpw waves produce space-like singularities. , there are a few hundred cpws of which there is a phl ch, a single tch in which a vertical cross-polarization is thrown before collision. This tch formed in the space of cpw was shown by yurtsever to be unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations. cpws were then considered by yurtsever to be unavoidable against plane-symmetric perturbations. ch formed in space of cpws was shown to be fragile against plane-symmetric perturbations [4] and thus had no greater strength than that of a space-like singularity. as the cross-polarization and em field are in fact to be considered in the nature of a resulting singularity, it was necessary to add that these em fields and the em field be considered in parallel in determining the nature of the resulting singularity. a second factor that proved effective in reducing the strength of a singularity in cpw was the electromagnetic field itself. In short, the degree of divergence in the curves of colliding pure gravitational waves has been stronger than that of em field which is coupled to gravity. This method is now entirely used to solve the problem of stability of horizons that have not been built up to this day. The solution given by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos (cx) formed an example of this category, which consists of a cauchy horizon (ch) instead of a space-like There are three kinds of singularities, which can be divided into three categories: quasiregular (qr), scalar curvature (sc), and non-scalar curvature (nsc). in the maximal four dimensions the chin's back-reaction due to a field (whose test stress-energy tensor is @ xmath0) will affect the horizon in one of the following ways: a) if xmath1 , xmath2 and any null aggregation of @ xmath3 are finite, and if the stress-energy tensor @ xmath4 is finite in all parallel measured orthonormal (ppon) frames, then the ch is a non-static ch . b) if xmath1 , xmath2 and any null aggregation of @ xmath3 are finite, and if the stress-energy tensor @ xmath4 in all parallel propagated orthonormal (ppon) frames is finite, then the ch remains non-static. This is the main reason for considering the problem again, in case of untested solutions in cpw. the indentation of the usual null particles into the background cpbs spacetime and the exact solution of the problem is in appendix b. the metric for the collision of em waves with the second polarization was found to be [7] + xmath5 in which our notations are xmath7, in which xmath7 is the constant measuring the second polarization, xmath8 is the constant of energy and xmath9 is the usual null coordinates. and, finally, the paper concludes with a discussion in section vi. We will now test the possibility of a metric ( 1). the metric that describes the collision of em waves with the cross polarization was found to be '7' + xmath5; in this representation the notations are - xmath6, in which the notations are - xmath7, in which xmath7 is the constant of the second polarization, - xmath8 is the constant of energy, and - xmath9 the normal, annular coordinates. We need to check here the possible singularities of metric (1 ) . we will now look at the singularities of metric ( 1) . . . in this metric, the surface of a horizon is prone to extra- sources, this metric can also be shown to be compatible with the cx metric. . . . but this metric is not at all the same as the bs metric . . . We will treat the metric in this region in the form @xmath22. Moreover, the metric in this region is expressed in the form @xmath23. In this region, we take account of the incoming region ii. @xmath27. We observe that for @xmath24, @xmath24 is a bounded positive definite function which implies that no additional singularities are arising except the one which is already present in the bs case, namely at @xmath26. to test whether the qr is stable or not, we consider generic tests of the em- and scalar fields by calculating the stress-energy tensor of local and ppon frames. We will do so in the next section. We are interested in the stability of the qr singularities, which are developed at @xmath28 in region ii and @xmath29 in region iii. In order to test the stability of this singularity, we will develop geodesics and scalar fields by calculating stress-energy tensors in local and ppon frames. For the reason that @xmath27 is a continuous positivedefinite function, we consider that no more singularities exist than the one already existing in bs, that is, at xmath26. y   0    y  0     left [                                                                                            left [    epsilon   4 (                                     left [    epsilon   4 (      1 + q   2 and, if there are scalars of xmath, they will vanish, indicating that qr singularities will not become a scs. As we have explained in section ii, the interior of the interaction region has no scs. Both scalars Xmath45 and Xmath2 vanish, indicating that qr singularity does not become a scs. But, the same scs is not correctly captured in the nature of the singularity. Xmath46 we find that xmath47 is given by xmath49 to xmath49 for xmath50 and xmath51 , otherwise . Let us now consider the stability of the quasiregular singularity, a field of em that is chosen in the same way as in ][9], in which arbitrary functions are chosen at xmath42 and mi[10]. The only nonzero emitted energy- momentum for this field is @ xmath44 [4] in which a prime denotes derivative with respect to xmath37 . This is as follows: the zero tensor of the test wave is given by taking f (v) as a given; f (v) f f f ' (v)  8  pi f   2    non-umber  t _  xy                        t _ _ xy     & _ _  yx  = frac  aq  sin _ _ ____ (a ) ___ _ __  _  xy  & = _ __ _  xy After the previous section, he applied the stability hypothesis to test the stability of qr singularities in the incoming region of cpbs spacetime. This conjecture predicts that the qr singularities of the cross-polarized version of bs spacetime are unstable. Hence, the conjecture predicts that qr singularities of the cross-polarized version of bs spacetime are unstable. So the new solution, xmath70, is obtained from the electrovacuum solution. It follows that the conjecture predicts that the qr singularities of the cross-polarized version of bs spacetime are unstable, i.e., if generic waves are added, the qr singularities are converted to scalar qr singularities. Here xmath71 is the scalar field, and we define the em potential (with a coupling constant @ xmath73), by @ xmath74, where xmath75 and xmath75 are the components in the killing directions. This new solution, to see the validity of the hypothesis, is provided with the following new solution. The lagrangian density of the system is defined by xmath71, and we define the em potential (with a coupling constant @ xmath73), by xmath74, where @ xmath75 and xmath75 are the components in the killing directions. – Penrose spinors for em-plane waves, given as follows – – – – a Nonumber   phi – – - 0 – 0 – - - – a Nonumber  – a phi – 0 –  – -   – u –  –    – u –  – –  – e – – u – – – e –  - u –  – e – u –  –  –  - e – u –  -  – e –  -  –  -  -  – e –  – u –  –  –  – e –  –  –  left - e  – v –   left – isinh  – v –  2 – – sinh –  – w –  2 – – a –  – v –  left – end – a perfect alignment –  –   – right . if we suppose that the dust, being moving in the background, were null, we would have to see the scalar of Xmath98, which was clearly incompatible with the assumption of a stable equilibrium. For simplicity, we consider two different case examples: the Xmath100 and Xmath99 projections of spacetime. The first case, we have taken the coordinates Xmath101, which corresponds to xmath102, where the energy-related tensor of two oppositely moving null dusts can be chosen as Xmath103, where xmath104 and xmath105 are the finite energy densities of the dusts. The following equation is expressed by this proportion, which means that the components of energy-related tensors are finite. It is evident that the tracing of energy-related tensors is not zero, so we must extract information from the scalar of Xmath115 . In the first case Xmath100, which is determined by the coordinates Xmath101, the energy-related tensor for two oppositely moving n-type dusts can be chosen as Xmath103, where xmath104 and xmath105 are the finite energy densities of the n-type dusts. The result is in perfect agreement with the stability conjecture. Henson calculated the mass-vessel tensors and concluded that they all correspond to the expression (45). It is clear that the components of the mass-vessel tensor diverge as the singularity approaches. and the corresponding mass-vessel tensors, with respect to the cpbs, must have a singularity. This metric, called xmath125, with respect to xmath127 positive constants, was considered by wang. The metric of cpbs and colliding shells was based on the metric of xmath130, where xmath130 was replaced by a corresponding value of xmath132. In this case, the mixture of the cpbs and the colliding shells was invariant, or at least multiplied by a corresponding value, for xmath133 is the combination which arises in the scalars. Then we see that, after subtracting one of the shells, we are left with a scalar equation of xmath136, which leads to a scalar equation of xmath136, which yields a sum of scalar numbers @ xmath134 and @ xmath135. this results in a scalar curve that is no longer zero in the case of cpbs, but becomes nonzero as we approach the horizon. In fact, the scalar curvature, which was zero in cpbs, has now been reduced to nonzero and becomes divergent as we approach the horizon. “Sent” waves creates an unstable horizon in the de sitter space which is otherwise regular for both Xmath137 and Xmath138. This is the prediction of the conjecture. In this paper we have examined the stability of qr singularities in the space of the cpbs space. The first thing is that we applied the test em field to the background cpbs space. The em field does not change the old property . we have found the same behaviour for the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarized version of the cross-polarization of the qr singularity, which, like the cross-polarization of the eddy in the exodus of the colliding eddy wave, is a striking-sacrificial horizon, which, as pointed out by hk, was not a theory of the correct nature of the singularity in the transition region . from the analyses, we have seen that the qr singularity in the incoming region becomes unstable according to the conjecture, and it is transformed into an nsc singularity . but the exact reaction solution of the eddy counterpart to the eddy counterpart of the eddy counterpart has not altered the - r  u uyuy - & e  u  v   left ( phi  22  sinhw + ( psi - 4 - right) - e  u   left ( phi  22  sinhw + ( psi - 4 - right) -  frac  i   2  left (w  u  u - u - w  u - v - u - v - u coshw sinhw - right) - -  frac  i     2   left ( w  uu - u u - u - u - m - u - v - u coshw sinhw - right) - e     phi - 22 - sinhw + sinhw + ( i m - psi - 4 - ) - e      left ( w - uu - u - u - uw - u - v - 2 u coshw sinhw - right) - end - aligned   ] ] “ . . . ” “Apsi + theta”; “Atta – sin – theta – sin – theta – theta – right.” “E . . . & . . gamma – left . . . left . . . ” – “E . . ” “It is left . . .  . .  . . , “Let us . . . to that is left, . . . sin – psi – right . . . . ” . . . . - - - theta (u) - theta (v) -       phi          -  left (a  p  p  a  a   phi   - right - - - theta (u) - left (a  p  phi       phi   - u - left (a  pi - a frac  u - left (a  p  p   u - u - u - left ) - u - left - left - (a  beta - b - b - left - left ) - left - left - (a  beta - b - b - tan - b - b ) - right -   -   - - -  -  -  -  - - left - left -  left - - left -  - -  -  - - -  -  -  - -    - -  -  -   - “A, a, b, c ”    , c ”      , c ”                – d "sent>  sin (au - 2bv)      sqrt  1 + q  2  + 1   left ( sqrt  1 + q  2  - 1  right)  sin (  sin - 2  2     sin - 2     sin - 2  (au - bv)  sin - 2 (a - 2bv)      - sin - 2  sin - 2 (a - 2bv) - sin - 2  -   sin - 2 (au - bv)   sin - 2 (a - - ) -  -   sin - 2 (au - bv) -  - sin - 2 (au - bv) -   sin - 2 (au - bv) - sin - 2 (Au - bv) -   -  -  () - - d - 37 - 2121 - 1988 - u yurtsever - phys - rev. - d - 37 - 2694 - (1998) - g . - f . r.
