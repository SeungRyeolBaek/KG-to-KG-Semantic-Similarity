I was very aware of the importance of turbulence and was, for example, to have an enormous influence on star formation, the mixing of gas and the transfer of heat. The more we realize the importance of turbulence, the more significant the changes which are undergone in the understanding of turbulence. For instance, the discovery of the importance of turbulence has brought about sweeping changes in the paradigm of turbulence. turbulence is an essential element in the dynamics of astrophysical fluids, which include the fluids of the inner medium (ism) and the muck of the outer medium (Elmegreen & scalo 2004). The most important measure of turbulence, in particular the turbulence spectrum, has recently become particularly important as a result of the recent advances in the theory of mhd turbulence. For instance, the famous Kolmogorov scale of incompressible turbulence assumes that the difference in velocities at different points in the fluid increases on average with the distance between them, as a cubic root of the separation, i.e. @xmath0. Note that in this paper we call this averaging the data. In this respect the numerical measures of turbulence, especially the turbulence spectrum, have become popular among us, also due to the development of mhd turbulence. as we know, astrophysical fluids are magnetized, so it seems that the correspondence between astrophysical turbulence and mhd turbulence is inextricable (see the discussion in lazarian 1999 and ref. therein). astronomical, interstellar, and deep turbulence, it is expected that observational studies of turbulence spectra will be very useful for the investigation of ism physics . In the case of very simple oceanic turbulence, study of spectra allowed to distinguish meaningful spheres of energy. observations can have both emissivity and opacity, both proportional to the density of the surface, at each velocity along the line of sight. the probability of it being too large for the brute force approach to resolve, for example, ism turbulence. observations can have both -at-xmath5 and -at-xmath8 up to -at-xmath10.223 as well as other large-scale fluctuations of the sphere, e.g., of the turbulence, also of the surface, have provided great insight into the physics of ism physics. there are much in-depth, very high astrophysical -at-xmath5 and its magnetic counterpart, the magnetic equivalent of -at-xmath8 - a great deal of difficulties for numerical simulations which cannot possibly meet astrophysically-motivated numbers. In many cases, the differences of the spectral index from the observational line are much more difficult to obtain. The most cherished spectra are also available through interstellar scincillations, studies of the column density, but the most coveted spectra have been difficult to obtain reliably until very recently. In fact, in the case of the simple oceanic (essentially incompressible) turbulence, the observational study of spectra provided meaningful insights into ism Now there are two new methods for the analysis of turbulence data in position-temporal (ppv) squash-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse-mouse cubes: vca, which uses channel-maps of velocity-spectra, and vcs, which examines fluctuations along the velocity-point of the squash-mouse. vcs is based on the analysis of the channel maps, which are velocity slices of ppv cubes, while vcs studies fluctuations along the velocity-point of the cube. whereas vcs is based on the analysis of the channel-maps, the slices of velocity-position–velocity cubes, whereas vcs analyzes the variations along the velocity-point of the cube. Then the vcs theory was introduced, which is why the observational data of turbulence is so complex, that it even becomes inconsequential, from the very beginning, with the analysis of the dispersion of the beam, its origin, its evolution and dissipation. For instance, the above-mentioned turbulence indexes are very useful, e.g., the one with the kolmogorov-approach of @xmath11 may be indicative of the formation of shocks, while the lower indexes may be indicative of the decreasing amplitude of cascading (see beresnyak et al. 2006). . . . in our earlier publications (lp00, lp04, lp06), attention was concentrated on irradiation lines, especially the radio irradiation lines, e.g. hh and co, irradiation lines, are regarded as the most important advantages, for instance, they are able to test turbulence with a pencil, without the fear of uncertainty in the length of the line. Furthermore, irradiation lines, e.g. mg ii, sii, siii, the measured spectra show irradiation, so that they may be studied with turbulence. By the new theory we are able to account for the fluctuations of the absorption lines and the underlying velocity spectra in saturated epochs. In this case, it is possible to perform turbulence studies if a few lines are available. We have obtained by experiment, chepurnov & lazarian (2006ab) experimentally demonstrated that the acceptable number of absorption lines is sufficient, and it is necessary to ensure the statistical accuracy of the measured spectra. These are the most recent developments in the sensitivity and resolution of spectrophotographs, and which make it possible to investigate turbulent motions in stars. However, in our earlier publications (lp00, lp04, lp06), we mainly concerned emission lines, and in particular roi lines, e.g. ah and co, these absorption lines have, as a rule, distinct advantages: they are able to test turbulence with a pencil, and do not suffer from the uncertainty of the path length. , the depth of the absorbers in the ppv space, which is, xmath30, is calculated from the density of the absorbers in the ppv space, xmath30. The intensity of the absorption line at xmath15 is given as xmath16, where xmath17 is the optical depth. The frequency of the absorption line at xmath15 is xmath17, where xmath17 is the optical depth. In our previous work we have examined the statistical properties of xmath30 in the context of the electrons in the region of xmath30, with the structure function and the power spectrum. The point density of the atoms along the line of sight, at the required velocity, is xmath21. where xmath22 is the thermal distribution centred at all points Xmath23 is the local mean velocity, which is determined by the sum of turbulent and regular flow at that point. So, the ratio of the line with the density of the absorbers in ppv space, xmath30, is calculated. The fractional dimension of the line, in the limit of vanishing intrinsic width of xmath19, is determined solely by the doppler shift of the absorption frequency from moving atoms . . . . so that it acts as a mask over the underlying tumultuousness of the line. . . . In this regime the data is available only over a window of frequencies, confined to high velocities, but not so high as to have a lorentz tail defining the line . . . higher the overall optical depth, the narrower the wings are (following spitzer, the wings are completely dominated by the lorentz factor) . . . in the higher the optical depth, the narrower the wings are (as follows spitzer, the wings are completely dominated by the lorentz factor ) . . . we shall denote this window by the value . . . in the case of a line of sight data given by a small window, we shall call it the window at xmath36, where xmath36 is the velocity the window centered on (describing the frequency of the wing) and xmath38 is the width of the wing. in this case the accumulated data is accumulating over a window of frequencies limited to high speeds so that xmath34 is not as high as if lorentz tailed the line. They are of a large size, of the signal and the data, but the magnitude of aliasing is enormous. In our study the power-law corresponds to the expected one-dimensional spectrum of the density of ppv in a velocity-coupled, tolerable motions, if one uses a turbulent motion dominated by shocks. The one-dimensional representation of the power-law spectra is not even defined for kolmogorov, whereas for turbulent motions dominated by shocks - - this representation is enlarged at xmath49, whereas the other-coupled representation is well defined at xmath51 . this limitation is relieved when one uses the structure function xmath52, which is well defined at xmath53. , but the structure function is local in configuration space and can be measured for not-uniformly sampled data. Besides, it is not local in structure space and is sensitive to specific parameters of the data sampling of the finite window, encoding, which result in an aliasing of power between the one- and the other scales . . . . however, each scale contains a contribution from all scales and mixes physical effects from different scales . . . The present study has focused on a narrow area of data in the wings of the absorption lines, which complicates the direct measurements. The arithmetic of the eq.

The power spectrum, from top to bottom, is drawn for xmath109, that is, the wing width is from the whole line to a tenth of the line width. This power spectrum is corrupted at xmath99, but it still has the data of the Turbulence Factors for xmath100. In the other hand, in the integral representation of our work, the Law of the Window is determined by the linear scales such as xmath101, which translates into xmath102. Therefore, if @ xmath103 in all the scales defining the Power of the Window is xmath103, then there is no significant Power aliasing. The underlying line of the Waterfall is kolmogorov, @ xmath58. The right column shows the power aliasing due to the limited width of the Window. The last expression especially illustrates the effect of the Window, which, in the case of the Cloud, is necessarily bound to be limited by @ xmath98. the cross-section of the line of a good model - as a rule - kolmogorov - , 1moonor7, it should be noted that the gaussian window has one of the best results, because it is limited by the thermal properties of the gas a bluff which is, at a certain value, relatively constant for the absorbers of a given type. 1moonor5) a general mass-masking of the x-ray spectral velocities is neglected. This technique should be taken under the assumption that the gas temperature is relatively constant for the absorbers of a given type. This technique is limited by the assumption that the gas temperature is relatively constant for the absorbers of a particular type. The right panel shows the change of the spectrum due to thermal enlargement, which is taken at the level of x-ray -116. This technique is based on the assumption that the gas temperature is relatively constant for the absorbers of a particular type. The broadening of the dopplers described by x-ray enlargement is a kolmogorov projection. The graph of the ray spectrum for x-ray enlargement is plotted from top to bottom, i.e. the width of the rays is reduced to one-tenth of the line width - . the straight line is the power law of x-ray expected under ideal conditions . Xmath121 is equal to the three-dimensional density-strength function, as compared with xmath121. Xmath121 is the index, xmath121, xmath124. For xmath121 the second order of kinship of elliptical curves is well defined. The first term of the expansion contains information on the underlying field, whereas the power law series contains the effect of the boundary conditions at the clouds. As we see in xmath122 the coefficient, which is one angular separation, is equivalent to the coefficient of frac  bar  rho  2 s  2  d d d z    . ”                                          . :  label d    at the end    a vv. ]   label d:  end   ,  ]   label    end   [5, ]] [[13] at small distances, @ xmath139, the correction of the function by the mean profile is the same as @ xmath139 and is contiguous with xmath139. In the theory of turbulence, structures and power spectrums are interchanged, but the one-dimensional fourier transforms of vcs correspond to the power spectrum of a fluctuation. The structure function in these invariable fields is not directly affected by the noise, but, on the contrary, the corresponding structure function of fluctuation is increased by the noise, thereby increasing the error in the determination of the higher-level structure function. This error is increased also by noise. In turbulence, the structure function is biased by noise, which is contributed to all the separations.  2  right  rangle = d  tau (v) +  langle n  2  rangle  delta (v) ] , but the noise is not biased by noise, only at the zero separating (i.e. if noise is uncorrelated),   2  rangle =  xi  tau (v) +  langle n  2  rangle  delta  ] “First, we assume the radiation is coming from a point source, which is an excellent approximation for the absorption of light from a star or a quasar , then we assume the ratio of the light derived from the source is constant, and, therefore, we have excluded the fluctuation of the polarity in the polarity. Secondly, we assumed that the light was coming from a source that was in contact with it, which is an excellent approximation for the absorption of light from a star or a quasar. we can also apply higher order functions (see the subsection above) to the analysis of absorption. the higher order functions (see the subsection above) are advantageous for practical applications. Our formalism is, naturally, applicable to absorption in the vca technique. In the vca theory, we used a lot of spectral description, but in lp04 we used real space rather than fourier, so that the height of the spectrum was greater than the x-axis, so that the negative slopes of the spectrum were reduced. this assumption is already quite true for optical or uv absorption lines (see spitzer 1979). and the effect of temperature can be combined with the temperature variations to get the effective  density' which is already well quantified. The higher order of the functions (see the subsection above) is advantageous for the practical data handling. We had, however, not yet addressed the effect of temperature variations on the absorption lines. Nevertheless, our present study, as well as the earlier ones, shows that the effects of temperature are limited. We have, however, derived our formalism from the more complex absorption, and the spatial extent of the radiation source. In the previous paper The main disadvantage of this approach is the inability to account for the variations in the syllable of the underlying frequency, for it is not a linear operation that could cause the result to be distorted, should the base syllable not be properly accounted for. . In lp06 we studied the vcs technique in the presence of absorption and formulated the criterion for the variation of syllables in a manner that has the consistency of the fluctuations in a turbulent velocity. In this paper, however, we used logarithms of the intensities and showed that this allowed turbulence investigations outside the limits of the normal regime at which fluctuations of syllables are useful. In our work we have examined the effect of turbulence on the optical depth xmath12, math13 , that is, in the presence of absorption, and we have given the criterion for the variation in intensities, so that the velocities are not unstable, and if we take logarithms of intensities we may be able to study turbulence beyond the normal regime, at which the changes of syllables are useful. This, for instance, may require additional details in the analysis of the velocities, for example, if there are windowed absorption lines. Note that the measurement of turbulence using the modified vcs technique will be suitable for the optical depth of xMM up to xMM, for this range the velocities are measured on the basis of the elasticity of the sphere, the line of which is to be traced will have a component of signal. Nevertheless, the contrast between the strong absorption lines is higher, and thus affords the opportunity to increase the signal to noise ratio for the entire range of @xmath64 ... however, the contrast with the strong absorption lines is higher, which gives a possibility to increase the signal to noise ratio for the whole range of @xmath64 ... and the single dish radio interferometer is appropriate if it is a two-unit radio interferometer. As we have seen in [28] our turbulence, the introduction of windows that are determined by the width of the lines, with the addition of inertial velocities, introduces additional distortions of the power spectrum, which can be treated by means of a bigger factor of the reverberation. In the case of injections of up to 10 km / s, and thermal velocities of up to 1 km / s, gives an order of magnitude of effective  inertial radiance'. At the same time, chepurnov et al. (2006) designed the fitting of models of turbulence on the data. However, the contrast between the strong absorption lines is higher, and this is an opportunity to increase the signal to noise ratio for the range of          . In the latter approach, there is no need to use a power law observation, which is advantageous for the actual data, for which the range of The work we do also uses wavelets, both for analysis of the results of computations (kowal & lazarian 2006a), and for synthetic maps (ossenkopf et al. 2006, esquivel et al. 2007) alongside or in place of fourier transforms or correlation functions. Note, for instance, that in the introduction we referred to a case of erroneous application of velocity centroids to supersonic molecular clouds. Here, too, we have been criticized for the erroneousness of the computations that we have been analyzing. However, closer inspection has revealed that the list is not as impressive as it appears. In the literature, the use of different centroids for the analysis of data is often referred to as different statistical methods for the study of turbulence (gill & henriksen 1990, stutzki et al. 1998, cambresy 1999, khalil et al. 2006) which reflects an excessive wealth of tools and techniques. In fact, while the fourier transforms use harmonics of @ xmath156, the wavelets use a more sophisticated basis function, which may be more appropriate for the subject at hand. Besides, our study demonstrated that certain techniques may yield a confusing if not error-free result, without a theoretical understanding of what they are measuring. The analysis was also complicated by the fact that, in contrast to the conventional centroids and not normalized centroids, which Lazarian and esquivel (2003) et al., there was no significant difference in the results from vca and scf. These provided a special sort of shot noise which was discussed in a number of papers (Lazores et al. 2001, esquivel et al. 2003, Chepurnov et al. 2006) . . . this may also be due to the problem of finding the correlation of the two statistics with limited resolution. The mathematical formulation of scf and scf, however, was modified to remove the coefficients and normalizations in the original formulation, and rendered the technique almost similar to scf in the interpretation of observational data. For instance, slices are -thick', for eddies whose velocity is less than  . . . that is, if the scf is applied empirically, the analytical relations in lazarian & pogosyan (2000) correspond to the scf to the underlying velocity and density statistics. Moreover, we have derived several physical-motives for scf studies. We have even predicted the formulation of several physiological regimes for scf studies. Not so in the case of an empirical comparison of the results of simulations and observations (for the purpose of our discussion). In a word, Padoan et al. (2004) declared that vcs is unique among the statistical tools, and even in the case of the vcs, since vcs requires no spatial resolution , so the analysis of data with the vcs is straightforward. It is necessary to have many sources sampling the object and apply vcs. vcs is a statistical tool that measures the movements of the ppv on the velocity axis of the ppv. (in fact, among all the statistical tools, including the vcs, it is unique, since it does not require spatial resolution ) , so . . . but this requires very long data sets, whereas with the vcs, it is enough to get good statistics from 5 or 10 sources. In the case of the absorption-lines, when good spatial coverage is not possible, we used the vcs. and thus the formulation of the theory (as well as in our earlier papers in the fourier transforms) is very easy, and the analysis of data with the vcs may be advantageous, especially in the case of the window functions. In the paper presented above, we have shown that vcs-based experiments can be studied with vcs-based techniques, if instead of intensity @ xmath17, we have used the logarithm of the absorbed intensity @ xmath162 , which is equivalent to the optical depth @ xmath163 . - ‘Measure’, which leads to a second layer of analysis - eqns.
