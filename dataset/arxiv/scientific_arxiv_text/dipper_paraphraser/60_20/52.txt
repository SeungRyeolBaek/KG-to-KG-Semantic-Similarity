, the entanglement entropy, as a tool for detection and classifying quantum phase transitions, has been played a very important role in the last fifteen years (see xcite and references therein). As a detection and classifying measure of the entanglement entropy in one dimension, where most critical quantum chains are conformal invariant, the entanglement entropy is a powerful tool to detect and calculate the central charge of the underlying cft , in one dimension, where most critical quantum chains are conformal invariant, the entanglement entropy is a powerful tool to determine the phase transitions and the universality class of critical behaviour. Recently, in addition to the main amounts, some interesting measures have been proposed , which, from the numerical point of view, are also very efficient in detecting phase transitions as well as universal general values of critical behaviour, are the shannon and rnyi mutual information , the definition of which is given in the next section , is a parameter xmath5 , and returns the shannon mutual information at the value xmath15 . (For further details see below) a new result has been derived from Xcite , namely that the shannon and rnyi mutual information of the ground state of quantum spin chains, expressed in a special local basis, such as happens with the entanglement and rnyi mutual information , have a logarithmic behaviour with the size of the system whose coefficient is determined by the central charge . . . and the result is that the shannon and rnyi mutual information, when expressed in some special local basis Why did we use this mathematical technique? most of the results about the relationship between the shannon and the rnyi mutual information, except for harmonic chains, are based on numerical analysis, especially in the case of systems with central charges not equal to one. Our motivation was twofold. First, this definition is more appropriate from the point of view of a measure of shared information among parts of a system, since it has the expected properties. In this paper we will use another version of the mutual information, a modified version of klein-gordon field theory, with a parameter of @xmath5 that reduces at @xmath5 to the shannon mutual information. We also considered models with @xmath1 symmetries, the 'state potts' models for 'xmath16' and 'xmath18', the 'slack' ashkin-teller model, and the 'xmath19 parafermionic models with 'xmath19'. With these reasons, we calculate the generalized mutual information for a number of critical, parallel-chain spin chains. We firstly calculated the generalized mutual information for several critical, parallel spin chains (quantitative version of the klein-gordon field), and then for spin chains with xmath4 symmetry like xxz and spin—1 fateev-zamola, the number of fateev-zamola (we will discuss this in the appendix.) In this paper we shall develop another version of the mutual information, and this is also parameterized by a parameter @ xmath5 that reduces @ xmath5 to the shannon mutual information. , that is to say, it must be an entropy above xmath26, where xmath26 is the probability of finding the system in the configuration given by xmath25 , and the limit of xmath26 is the shannon entropy. the reason why xmath26 is a special local basis, such as those which have a part of the hamiltonian side (see xcite), is to interpret the definition ( renyi2) as a logarithmic condition, for arbitrary values of xmath5 . but as we have been thinking of only local basis, it is always possible to consider the configurations as a combination of configurations within and outside the subregions, as a result of xmath28. The renyi entropy is defined by @xmath24, where @xmath24 is the probability of finding the system in the particular configuration given by @xmath24 . Hence, the marginal probabilities are defined by the terms: @xmath30 and Xmath33. Although the definition ( renyi2) has its own uses, it is not the one that is usually used in information sciences. For instance, the fraction @xmath35 is not necessarily a positive function, a property which, naturally, we expect, accompanies the standard mutual information . To find the general information of the ground state of two critical spin chains of a slightly different structure, we shall use the numerical method. The calculations for a set of distinct spin chains are conducted numerically, because to our knowledge, the analytical method is not known to exist. The first part will work out the general information of the ground state of two critical spin chains of a somewhat different structure. In the second part we will work out the general information of the ground state of two critical spin chains of a slightly different structure. We will now investigate the general information of the ground state of two critical spin chains of a somewhat different structure. This definition of the general information is derived from the extension of relative entropy to the rnyi case and measures the distance of the entire distribution from the product of two independent distributions. In the first place, we will calculate the general information of the ground state of two critical spin chains of slightly different structure. This section will discuss the generalized mutual information of two critical spin chains of slightly different structure. In the second part, we will calculate the generalized mutual information of systems with discrete symmetry such as the klein-gordon field theory, the xz model, and the fateev-zamolodchikov model, with different values of their anisotropy. A critical Xmath16 - state potts model is given in a periodic lattice by the hamiltonian xcite Xmath51, where xmath49 and xmath52 are xmath53 matrices satisfying the following xmath1 algebra: Xmath55 = [s i, s j], [s i, s j] = 0 $ ] the model is critical and conformal invariant for xmath65 with central charge xmath66. 0 %] the ashkin-teller model has a q-state symmetry and a hamiltonian given by xcite, where xmath49 and xmath52 are matrices satisfying the following xmath1 algebra: xmath54 = xmath53 = htb = fig2 of the periodic ising quantum chain, as a function of xmath48 . 0 %] our results show that the q-state potts model and the ashkin teller model have the same behaviour . . . . As we have already mentioned, in the actual remark, that in a certain distribution of the parameter xmath5 it was said that for xmath15 the coefficient xmath72 is monotonically nondeclined, consistent with the measure of mutual information (see the appendix). So it was considered that, as a consequence of the discussion in xcite, the coefficient xmath34 was not constant in xmath15, and therefore any remark that the two properties were mutual, should be invalid. This also made the analytical calculations a challenge. And so we derived the coefficient of logarithm in the equation (    ) and the central charge Xmath11 for the potts-potts model, with     and        , with different anisotropies Xmath73 . , the method of the ground-state wave functions on the basis of the ground-state model (     ) at the isotropic point (   ) is equivalent to the potts-potts-potts model .    htb ) and - Fig 3 of the coefficient of logarithm in the equation ([Retii mi potts] ] and the central charge in the matrix (a-t) with different anisotropies. - [htb ] fig 4 are diagonal. * as we can see from these figures, we see that for the subsystem sizes @xmath76, we have the logarithmic behaviour of (( renyi mi potts)) to xmath77 in the @xmath50 basis, and @xmath78 in the @xmath61 basis. We see from the figure, that for the subsystem sizes @xmath77 we have the logarithmic behaviour of (( renyi mi potts)) for large values of xmath5 , a continuous general function independent of the model, as we can see in fig. 3, the scaled-down scale. In general, the relation between the two variables is general ([(the relational relationship of the derived function and the element of the underlying equation) , where the entropy is constant, and [34] is constant, by the central charge, and (29] is consistent with a continuous universal function, as is evident from fig. 3 . . . the ratio of the logarithmic coefficient in (the relational relationship) consists of a monotonically non-discontinuous function of (3 ) and (26) of the inverse proportion, and is derived from (26)> in the xmath50 basis and (6) from the xmath61 basis. In fig. 4 we show the difference between the coefficients of logarithms xmath80 and xmath60 , this also shows that the ashkin-teller model has more deviations in this case than in the xmath50 basis. This translates to the conclusion that all the probabilities in the xmath50 basis are positive, but in the xmath61 basis some are negative. This also shows that the xmath80 basis has more errors than the xmath60 basis, as compared with the results obtained in the xmath60 basis. It is to this effect that the function xmath10 is a continuous function of xmath5 in the xmath15-range. - [htb] , 4 - the data of figs.  34 444 – This is shown in Fig. - to xmath - periodic - and a parafermionic quantum chain of xcite. The model is critical and conformal, and the central charge of xmath is greater than one. We consider the numbers obtained from the data of Fig. – to xmath –47 sites and the ground-state eigenfunction in the xmath50 and xmath61 basis . - As we see, while we are satisfied for xmath49, we have a non-reproachable result for xmath89 . The basis of xmath49 is the angle between the xmath49 matrices (i.e. xmath50) . - the eigenfunction in the xmath50 basis is the eigenfunction of the ground state in the xmath50 and xmath61 basis , htb . , fig . , scalar . - 0 % , htb , fig7 . Here we show a number of values of @xmath16, which are illustrated in fig. 7. in fig. 7 , we show the ratio xmath86 of the logarithmic coefficient of 'Renyi Mi Potts', and the central charge xmath11 for the @xmath64 - parafermionic models, with @xmath74 sites, and with the 'ground state' wavefunction expressed in the 'xmath64' basis. The results of 'The maximum-pitch' measurements were @xmath97 and 'The 'Capital State' to indicate a reasonable, approximate match of the different values of 'Renyi Mi Potts'. These results were very similar to those we have already discussed in this subsection in the case of 'Resource Potts'. All the five properties that we have talked about in this subsection are also valid for the 'Capital State'. Fig. 7 shows the ratio of 'The Ratio' of the Logarithmic coefficient of 'Resistir Mi Potts' to the central charge 'Liquid' in the 'Liquid' basis. 'Liquid', to the effect that 'Liquid' is not the same for all the values of 'Liquidity'. As in our previous section we have considered the generalized mutual information of critical chains with a continuous, xmath4 symmetry. 0 %] in this section we will first consider the generalized mutual information of the ground state of a system of generic coupled harmonic oscillators. We will consider the hamiltonian of xmath6- coupled harmonic oscillators with coordinates xmath101 and conjugated momenta xmath103: the ground state of the above hamiltonian is given in the following form: xmath104, the two point correlators of xmath105 and xmath105 are shown. The lattice size of the models and the subsystems sizes xmath7 used to estimate xmath10 are shown. The last two models are interesting, for they have anisotropy, like the ashkin-teller equation, which gives us a critical line of continuously changing critical exponents, but with a fixed central charge . . . It is required to have the correlators at the end of the region of xmath108 . It is necessary to introduce this quantity for later use. As a basis, one must find the basis. Here we work on the position coordinate basis, but all the results are valid also on the momentum basis. Note that the above quantity is non-based and is considered an usual measure of the entanglement of a coupled harmonic oscillator. To calculate the general information of a coupled harmonic oscillator one first has to fix the basis. We start with the symmetric positive definite matrix @ xmath129, which is already valid for @ xmath130, but for @ xmath130 one needs to check its validity. The following determinants allowing for @ xmath124 allow us to write @ xmath124, where xmath126 there is an important remark that we should mention: in principle eq. ([renyi mi hoc] only makes sense when we are dealing with short-range coupled harmonic oscillators. , the function of @ xmath135 for periodic quantum harmonic chain with @ xmath136 sites. –  –  - p= -. Our numerical analysis indicates that the matrix of xmath127 is symmetric positive definite to just xmath139, however, it can be scaled up by increasing the entanglement length to xmath137. - xmath142 – the coefficient of the logarithm in  rm135 is obtained from the formulation of the model with @ xmath136 sites. - - fig. - p-xu-leo-. . . . When xmath26 is the second term vanishes, and we find the result of xcite, - xmath138. Our numerical analysis shows that for short-range quantum harmonic oscillators the matrix @ xmath127 is symmetric positive, and to only @ xmath139 is not exactly equal to @ xmath140, but by increasing the size of the lattice it approaches the value @ xmath140 . The model is critical and conformal invariant for xmath154, with a constant central charge, xmath66, giving us a good example of the universality of our results with regard to the change of the anisotropy. This behavior seems to be independent of the anisotropy parameter xmath73. a invariant of xmath154 is a cft, with a constant central charge xmath66, described by a compacted trigosphere, whose action is given by Xmath155, where the radius of compactification is proportionally affected by the values of xmath73, namely: Xmath156, as we have seen in fig. 13 , the coefficient of the logarithm in Xmath42 is given again by Xmath80, and it fits exactly to the results of the harmonic chain. Note that in our calculations it is possible to derive spurious big numbers for the generalized mutual information even for xmath158, but all of them must be infinity in the thermodynamic limit. This behavior can be simply understood by observing the results of the chain of harmonic oscillators. The result is that for the lattices @ xmath47 and @ xmath162 it is possible to determine the coefficient of the logarithm, with a function @ xmath66, which is quite similar to that which we have found for the harmonic oscillators and the xyzcyphon. The second symmetric model that we have considered is the Spin - 1 fateev - Zamolodchikov quantum chain, whose hamiltonian is given by @ xcite @ xmath165, where @ xmath164 are Spin - 1 @ xmath165, where @ xmath166 are Spin - 1 @ xmath165, -167, -167 - xmath172, -138. Then we will show the results of our analysis for both critical regimes @ xmath66 and @ xmath172, and for different values of anisotropy. , the results are for the Lattice sizes @ xmath47 and @ xmath162 and give a very nice representation of the difference in size. We also considered the discrete version of the lean-gordon field theory given by a group of coupled harmonic oscillators. Several different integrable quantum spin chains were considered. These chains either had a symmetry like the Potts model with xmath17 and 4 , the Ashkin model with xmath45 and 8 , or a symmetry like the Xmath4 model (e.g. the xmath173 model and the spin-1 fateev-zamolodchikov model) or a symmetry like the xmath4 model (the quantum chain and the spin-1 fateev-zamolodchikov model) or a symmetry like the xmath4 model (the xmath5 model and the spin-1 fateev-zamolodchikov model) . . . . most of our analysis was numerical, because there were no good analytical methods at the moment to deal with this problem. We also considered the discrete version of the Field Theory of the Klein-Gordon Field of Gravity, given by a number of harmonic oscillators. the analytical approach to this kind of problem is usually based on some kind of generalization. It is remarkable that for such questions, it is only necessary to analyze small-scale harmonic oscillators, which can be studied in detail. The same results can be seen for the set of shannon entropy or shannon mutual information (@xmath180) , but only for xmath157, which has an anisotropy of xmath73 , and the dissimilarity of @xmath70 with respect to the quark-resolved one of the basis; whereas the quark-resolved one of the basis is the same, for the same model, on the same basis, as the quark-resolved one of the base-state, and a counter-coupling of @xmath72 in renyi (see renyi new) . in a quadrant-schematic case, for example, we omit to say that the concentric-likely oriented (future) shannon mutual information (@xmath181 or @xmath182 in a new renyi) is a theoretical challenge. It is interesting that in these cases one can understand most of the results by studying only short-range harmonic oscillators with infinity of modes. However, we have observed that the degree of this effect is no longer determinated in the case of the continuum-symmetric models. In the case of the ashkin-teller model, our results indicate that the function @xmath80 is related, for the #xmath185, to the anisotropy #xmath73 of the model . . . But we cite the above definition in order to define the degree of relative entropy (see below) and thereby imply that he is the measure of the relative entropy between the two distributions xmath183 and xmath184, as if from the point of view of the distribution xmath183, i.e., from xmath184 it is a measure of the difference between the two distributions xmath183 and xmath184. . . . comparing ( - relative entropy) with ( - mutual information from relative entropy) with ( - relative entropy from relative entropy) with (relative entropy from relative entropy) with ([xmath195] comparing the following two ( renyi divergence] with ([relative entropy from relative entropy]] and ([relative entropy from relative entropy] comparing ((1,2] - ni-pereira, - pereira and v-paillero), they form ( v-priori) a corresponding entropy between two parts of a system, and a product of the probability distributions of the two parts. ) it tells us how much the two parts are related. d. a. abanin and e. demler, phys. lett. 106 *, 020504 (2012) p. calabrese, j. cardy, j. phys. p. 105 *, 1655 (2012) p. calabrese, j. cardy, j. phys. a 42: 504005 (2009) p. c . alcaraz, m. a. rajabpour, phys. p. f. c . alcaraz, m. a. rajabpour, phys. b * b * c . j . b . . j . c . j . j . stphan, phys. b . . . i. cirac, phys. . . . . . .
