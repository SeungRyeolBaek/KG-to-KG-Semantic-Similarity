In 1985, a paper by Hoare, a couple of novelties in the propositional calculus, was published . . . in this paper the ternary connective @ xmath0 is introduced as the ‘conditional’. The most basic and least defining conditional is the ‘free’ congruence, and it is axiomatized by the axioms in Table . . . in this paper the ternary connective @ xmath0 is introduced as the ‘conditional’. . . . in the first place, and according to the result, either a first or a second (and the other is not) is used, and determines the evaluative value. In this paper the ternary connective @ xmath0 is introduced as the ‘conditional’ . . . in this paper the ternary connective ‘@ xmath0’ is introduced as the ‘conditional’. For instance, the atomic proposition @xmath19 and the conditional statement @xmath20 are not equivalent in the free valuation congruence sense, although they are equivalent in the free valuation congruence sense that characterizes propositional logic. Moreover, free valuation congruence is less than the equivalence defined by hoare’s axioms in @xcite. In Section 112cm0 and 12rp> a valuation congruence that identifies more than free and less than static valuation congruence is called a “repetition – proof valuation congruence”, which has an axiomisation that comprises two (conceptual) axioms, one of which reads “repetition – proof valuation congruence”, and thus expresses that if “repetition – proof valuation congruence” are evaluated in the same way as “repetition – proof” evaluations, then two conditionals are equivalent in terms of “repetition – proof valuation congruence” if they are equal in terms of evaluation trees. In an example, if the atomic proposition “xmath19” and the conditional statement “xmath20” are not equivalent in terms of “free valuation congruence”, although they are equivalent in terms of “staging” valuation congruence, which is the valuation congruence that characterizes propositional logic. The paper concludes with a short short-circuit rebuttal, an example of rebuff-proof valuation congruence, and some remarks on the effects of this. We will describe the general structure of the proofs of these results, all of which are based on normalization of conditional statements. a spin-off of our approach is a 'basic semantics of proposition algebra': for each valuation congruence c that we consider (including the case c = free), two conditional statements are congruent if, and only if, they have equal c-basic forms, which is obtained by syntactic transformation of conditional statements, which is a form of normalization. we give a conditional statement @ xmath6 and a single conditional statement whose main condition is _xmath2_, and a single conditional statement @ xmath27 is the state of a closed term or conditional statement , which is written on the signature xmath28. a subtotal of ... moreover, if there are two or three more successive substitutes of @ xmath41, we observe that the order of the substitutions is irrelevant and we use the convention that we do not list names in brackets, e.g. @ xmath49 ... ” (v) “  sf t    mapsto        mapsto y ... 2 ...            z ... 3 ...             z ... “     sf t       mapsto y ... 1 ...              z ...             z ... —    sf t   — a. The “core” of the equation, defined by –f=–7 was defined by ––80 and ––85, and ––86 – for the set of basic forms over –26 – to the degree of ––7. . . . so that the evaluation of a conditional statement over –26 is a complete path through ––68 (from root to leaf) and contains evaluation values for all atoms. . . . for instance, the evaluation tree for –79 is described by ex. . . . ––f, that is, ––f. . . . Note that this particular evaluation tree contains all possible evaluations of ––83, where –– & – is the connective that prescribes a short circuit conjunction (see the connection in section SECTION – conc) . . . so an evaluation of a conditional statement of ––f is a complete path in ––f in ––f. – ” . . . . Here the following statement is made by structural induction on xmath. . . . By structural induction on xmath, the bases of xmath96 are trivial; and if xmath97 exists by induction, the base cases of xmath98 are trivial; and if xmath98 is defined by induction, such that xmath99 is in accordance with xmath99, then xmath100. . . . . . lemma’s statement is characterized by structural induction on xmath . . . “‘Free valuation congruence’, notation @ xmath . . . ‘‘ Free valuation congruence is a congruence relation . . . ‘ . . ‘   sf t     mapsto se (p) When he hasn’t made up his mind about what to do, he gives up his work and goes on to the next section. In consequence of these results, it follows that for every xmath30 there is a unique basic form in xmath124, which is given in xmath126. And for every basic form, his xmath51 image has exactly the same syntactic structure (simply replacing xmath132 with xmath57, and xmath133 with xmath58) . . .

In this paper, we use the evaluation tree of the very same name as in the study of xcite, and we get a very simple and stand-alone exercise, which makes a semantics much simpler and much simpler than hma - s, which is hma - s, and it is more elegant than the semantical framework of the same name in the study of xcite. in this paper, we elucidate by theorem (theorem): @ xcite coincides with Free valuation as defined in xcite, since both relations are axiomized by Free. , for instance, by a relation of @ xmath297 to xmath269 (as well as by a relation of @ xmath297 to xmath296), in which case, by a relation of @ xmath297, it coincides with a repetition--the calculation of congruence in accordance with the following equation (see (*? * * * * thm . . .) , it is evident that this transformation is 'natural', given the axioms @ xmath645 and that are characteristic of ' xmath173 . . . . . and that is the proof (see (*? * * * * * thm . . . . . . . . ) the proofs, which depend on (*? * * thm . . . . . . . . ) and on the proof of (*? * * thm . . . . . . ) (i.e. , xmath643 and xmath644 are a transformation function on the recurrence of trees . . . The proof that @ xmath547, and hence @ xmath547, is a complement to that of @ xmath547: @ xmath547, where all these inclusions are proper if @ xmath649, and thus @ xmath648 , where all these inclusions are proper if @ xmath649, and thus @ xmath650, and thus @ xmath651 . We therefore conclude that repetition-proof evaluation trees and valuation congruence, and so @ xmath297, provide a full-formed, simple and elegant semantics for @ xmath173, and that this is also the case for contractive evaluation trees and valuation congruence @ xmath396 , and that we are memorizing evaluation trees and valuation congruence @ xmath526. static valuation congruence in some instances of @ xmath528 is in a way compatible with any standard semantics of propositional logic, in the following sense: @ xmath528 where @ xmath656 and @ xmath655 refer to cite : @ xmath655 let @ xmath53 . for this purpose we make use of some @ xmath528 . No, we shall leave short circuit logic to a recurrence of the question Xmath663: it is the question of Xmath663 which we have defined in Xcite (see xcite for a quick introduction) and an example of the use of Xmath173 . In short, the concern of Xmath663 is the question Xmath663: as for free valuation, a partial axiomatization of the short circuited binary propositional connectives is evinced by staudt in Xcite, where Xmath664 and Xmath665 are defined, and Xmath51 is also defined for short circuited disjunction, and the related completeness proof is based on the decomposition properties of such evaluation trees. a first approach to this question is to apply the conditional as an auxiliary operator, as we are using Xcite, and to answer the question by definitions of the binary propositional connectives as above, and axiomatizations for the valuation of the inclination of the interest in propositional algebra (or if  mixed conditional statements are concerned, axiomatizations for the appropriate valuation of inclination) . For the valuation of inclination, the following equational axiomatization is provided by staudt in Xcite, where xmath664 and xmath665 (and math51 is also defined for inclination of short term) and the corresponding completeness proof is based on the decomposition properties of the evaluation trees. We shall then observe that in the case of short-circuit logic, the result of @ xmath671 is (cf. example - rp), and this example - rp2 - relates to the work of Wortel - xcite, where an instance of the propositional dynamic logic - e.g. 6cite - is investigated in an instance of [], where it is possible to make an assignment into a test, and by [] always [] always  [] always [], which is to say that [xmath6] s value is assigned to @ xmath669 . . . and this example, that is, a general axiom of [][][]. ] [, "if []][2] is a initial value 0 or 1, then [], "[2], "", [] not satisfy the law of [1][2], by which this example, by the example, is typical of the repetition-proof characteristic of [2][3]. " As a final example, "all valuation congruences of this paper can be used to study the _ side effects,_ that can be observed upon the evaluation of short-circuits, as in example [2], and we quote from parnas @xcite: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . . . bergstrasse, j . a., and ponse, a.
