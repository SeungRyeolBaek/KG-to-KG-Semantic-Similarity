The so-called 3nucleon-spine crisis' raised by the European Mohon Collaboration (emc) in 1988 is one of the most outstanding discoveries in the field of hadron physics. The evolution of the physics of deep inelastic scatterings is greatly indebted to this epoch-making finding. it was observed that the gpds, which are measured through so-called deep-revised Cherox scatterings (dvcs), or through deep-revised meson productions (dvmp), contain surprisingly rich information than the ordinary parton distributions . - in general, the gpds are generalizations of the ordinary parton distributions and of the elastic form of the nucleon . . . the complex nature of the gpds, that is, the fact that they are formed in such complexes, that is, the complex morphology of the gpds, that is, the complexity of the gpds, which are called the generalized form of the nucleon . the so-called "nucleon" crisis which the European muon collaboration in 1988 raised is one of the most important results in the field of deep inelastic scattering . . . " One of these distributions is a type of beta distribution, and it is very useful to know the total spin of the nucleon in the sphere of xcite.1 This is because the mass of the nucleon is not reduced, and the angular momentum of the sphere is the greatest of all. In the present experiment, Jia Xian, the colleague of the lhpc and the qcdsf team, studied the beta distribution of the nucleon, and gave some interesting predictions, which could be borne out with experiments at once, since the computation of beta distributions, however, is difficult. Since these estimations are in the order of local operators, they can be incorporated into qcds. Moreover, in the qcdsf domain, there are two groups, namely the lhpc collaboration and the qcdsf collaboration, independently investigated the beta distribution of the nucleon and gave several interesting predictions which, if applied to gpds, can be in principle tested by measuring gpds in the near future. Compared with qcdsf, we can see that one of the beta distributions contains useful information about the total angular momentum of the quark fields in the nucleon — xcite — xcite — and that we know that in this region goldstone pion plays a very important role in some intrinsic properties of the nucleon. . . . in sect. ii, we briefly explain how to incorporate the nonzero pion mass into the constrained cqsm by means of the pauli-villars regularization. in sect. iv, we give the theoretical expressions for the generalized form of the nucleon. The main purpose of this study is to examine the generalized form of the nucleon in the context of the cqsm, and to compare its predictions with those of the lattice qcd simulations. Here we will see how the final theoretical predictions will change with the variation of the pion mass. In order to reduce these irregularities, we use the pauli-villars subtraction scheme. As shown in the appendix to the X-Rays, we are able to calculate the effectiveness of the action corresponding to the above lagrangian. s f [u] + s f [u] ,  sp  ,  ln (i  not !  partial—m u   gamma_5] ,   [  eq : energsol   ] with x-rays. , s  f , f     pi   2 , m    pi   2  , mbox  tr  f , [u x    dagger   x  2]     , d  4 x . At xmath30 and xmath31 we find at xmath32 a criterion a a determinant of the values of xmath30 and xmath31. (Since the axis xmath23 consists of the logarithmic divergence of xmath23 —­—, if the subtraction constants satisfy the following two conditions: xmath35 and xmath36. This corresponds to the very normalization of the kinetic term in the effective meson lagrangian and the empirical value of the vacuum quark condensate. ) for the determination of xmath33 and xmath34, we use two conditions: xmath35 and xmath36, which correspond to the correct normalization of the pion kinetic term in the effective meson lagrangian and also to the empirical value of the vacuum quark condensate. The soliton equation of motion is written out as follows: e f  val  + e f  v p   reg  ,   ,  ][17][17]   ,    v p   reg ,  ,    , The equilateral function of Xmath53 (the symbol 'renewal') denotes the summation of all the negative energy eigenstates of Xmath50, i.e. the negative energy dirac continuum. Then, using a conventional soliton profile, Xmath53, we obtain a solution to Xmath53. We may note that Xmath53 and Xmath52 are irregularly proportioned scalar and pseudoscalar quark densityed with Xmath57, while Xmath59 and Xmath60 are the corresponding densityed densityes calculated by Xmath28 and not by the dynamical quark mass xmath11. At first we assume an appropriate, but arbitrary, profile of the soliton of Xmath52, the equator, which is a discrete orbital that is derived from the upper dirac continuum, under the influence of the hedgehog mean field, called the valence level. In cqsm we now have the ability to examine the right-hand side (rhs) of (eq: hetrace) and (eq: emtrace.) Here we are talking only of the general structure of the theoretical expressions for the relevant observables in cqsm. This connection between these two quantities and the relation between the generalized parton distribution functions of cqsm at xmath65 and xmath66 are most conveniently computed in the so-called breit frame. following the notation in xcite, xcite, we introduce the numbers @xmath67 and @xmath68, the isoscalar and isovector combinations correspond to the sum and difference of the quark flavors of xmath69 and xmath70. We are told that the leading order term is applied to the isoscalar combination of xmath79 and to the isovector combination of xmath77. , which corresponds to the sum and difference of the quark flavors @xmath69 and xmath70, respectively. it is known that the leading order term contributes to the isoscalar combination of xmath79 and the isovector combination of xmath77. That is, a double value over the single quantum orbitals as @xmath86, is given. , e  i x m n z  0   nonumber  &  , & hspace  30 mm  a times  , tau  a  ,  gamma  0  gamma  3 , e  i  i  mbox   boldmath $ x . -    eq : eq : eq: gpdheiv  - end  aligned   ] , e        -     -   , e        , e           tau a  , ( 1 +  gamma  0  gamma  3 )  , e - eq_gpdheis - @ xmath96, if we want to use these expressions for the example, let's take the expression: gpdheis - it's the first result of our study on generalized form factors of the nucleon in the cqsm. In the present study, we confine ourselves to the first and second moments, which correspond to the standard electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and to the so-called gravitational form factors. Taking the expression: gpdheis - it's like the base equation of the present study on generalized form factors of the nucleon in the cqsm. In our study, we shall confine ourselves to the first and second moments, which correspond to the standard electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon, and the so-called gravitational form factors. With this expression, we will calculate the generalized form factors of the nucleon from the theoretical expression of corresponding gpds. We will especially interest ourselves in the second one, because it is believed that they contain the necessary information on the spin contents of the nucleon through the angular momentum sum rule, 'xcite, 'xcite'. In the following, we will explain how we can calculate the generalized form factors based on the theoretical expressions of corresponding gpds, with the examples of @ xmath97 and @ xmath96 , we get ____________. Using X-Square’s partial-wave extension of X-Square’s X-Square, we have our ‘x-square’ , that is, the squaring-shrunk xmath111 which can be divided into four parts. For example, let us suppose that we have a ‘x-square’ ( frac-) , a ‘h’ frac-1    sqrt  3      ,                                                                                   end   aligned                  end  aligned                 [   end “Langle l m”  lambda 0 | 00  rangle  , y l ( hat  x)  times (   mbox  boldmath $  alpha)   times  hat   mbox  boldmath $ p$   times  hat   mbox   boldmath $ p $    times  hat            (   lambda)   (0 The table of answers in question is: a-a-a-b, the nucleon matrix elements. In analogy, we may call @xmath96 the gravitoelectric form factor of the nucleon (its quadrupole) because it is related to the matrix elements of the quadrupole portion of the QCD momentum tensor. The isovector part of the generalized magnetic form factor survives only at the next-to-leading order of @xmath78. It is also given as double sums over the single-quadrupole orbitals in the hedgehog mean field. @xmath139 and math139 they are given as @xmath138 and @xmath139  End aligned    [ ] end  aligned   , n  rangle  right   . . . That is to say, in a theory of cqsm, the nucleon is to be supplanted by quark fields only (note that pion is not an independent field of quarks) so that the total nucleon mass must be constrained by quark fields. next we turn to the forward limit of cqsm96, which gives cqsm146 cqsm148 cqsm146, we find that cqsm146 cqsm146, as we say, is just the second term in the parenthesis of cqsm151, so that the total soliton mass is @ cqsm152 cqsm148, and this is precisely the case. The sum of the quark and the pion part is the total soliton mass, @ cqsm146, so we see that the cqsm cqsm146 does not consist of any quarks, which is to say that the quarks are not separated from each other, so that the total energy fraction of quarks (the quarks are not separated from each other by the quarks), is just one-thousand-thousand . We, then, proceed to the forward limit of @ cqsm155, from which it is observed that a 'matter' in the equation cqsm148, that is, to be "mamma" in the parenthesis of 'mamma' ('mamma') coincides exactly with the pion part of the soliton energy, i.e. - @ cqsm151 In consideration of the first It is not constrained by any conservation law; it can be estimated only by numerical calculations. After that we turn to the discussion of the generalized magnetic form factors. The first of these is the forward limit of @xmath140, which reproduces the known expression of the isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon in the cqsm. In cqsm this is the absolute expression, i.e., that the nucleon spin is saturated by the quark fields. (eq: gm20ist0) which, as a consequence of the previous eq, is the square root of the number (eq: gm20ist0), this derived value has another interpretation. remembering that cqsm is a partial mode, like cqsm166 eq , it can be derived from the same logic as cqsm166. , assuming that cqsm166 is also a portion of the momentum sum rule, cqsm168. (eq: gm20ist0) , this also follows that cqsm169 is completely absent, and the nucleon spin is saturated by quark fields alone. “There is a two-part ring with a value of xmath173 which we call xmath172; and the ring is composed of two parts, as @xmath174 here, the first of which is a proton matrix element, a element of the isovector total angular momentum operator of the quark fields, as @xmath176; and the second term is given as xmath177.  ” –   f  f        –  –  hat  l –  –    –     –   –  -       –  –  end  aligned    ] ” – in the present analysis we use the value of @ xmath171 as shown in @xcite , we have the value of @ xmath173 divided into two parts as in the form of @xmath174 – the first is a proton matrix element of the free field expression for the total angular momentum of quark fields as in the example  xmath174. " The soliton profile functions are given by Xmath183 , i.e., Xmath189 , xmath185 , we first show the theoretical predictions of the cqsm for the generalized form factors. Since we have already given the corresponding lattice predictions for the generalized form factors Xmath191 and Xmath192, which are generalizations of the dirac and pauli form factors, we first calculate the relations between these form factors and the generalized sachs-type factors, which we have calculated in the cqsm. ,    u - d  t - ,  ,  ,  ,                 ,                                                   u  d               u            u       u         u  d        u  d         u            u       u  d  t           u  d  t . . . it may be a limitation of an effective model which does not contain explicit gluon fields. . . . on the other hand, the cqsm predictions for the same number of nucleons are @ xmath203, and the corresponding cqsm predictions are . . . pre> - xmath203, the cqsm predictions and the cqsm predictions are both independent of xmath203, and of the corresponding cqsm predictions of xmath210 and xmath210, with the corresponding cqsm predictions @ xcite and - xcite . Next, we will compare more properly the scale dependency of relevant observables . . . . , width = 604 - height = 264 , the symbols of the fig . . . . “This rascal figure a1′′ and b1′′ in the rheumatology are the predictions for a1′′ and b1′′ as a function of a1′′ and a ‘beauty-induced’ [this one] of a1′′. The physical meaning of a1′′ is a difference between the gravitational fractions of the xmath69-quark and the xmath70-quark. But the empirical value for this quantity is a–a-p-r–m–p-r–sm-c-d-i-n-i—a-b–c-c -c. [c] In this chiral limit the prediction of a1′′ is not very far from that, but a more serious comparison is needed to compensate for the chiral dependence of – a– a–c-c.­ The chiral excess of –i-n-i-n-gh– - is very interestingly observed in chiral excesses of –i-n-i-n-cq-cm-c for the anisotropic fractions @ –mi-n-c., @ –c-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-cq-c-cq-cq-cq-c, The right column of Fig. 4 depicts the predictions for the value of xmath225, which is sometimes called the isoscalar part of the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment, or the aggregate total nucleon spins. (Please note that the above result xmath225 is only the necessary consequence of the momentum sum rule and the total nucleon spin sum rule, both of which are saturated only in the cqsm as xmath226 and xmath227 — thus supposing that the sum of xmath217 and xmath229 are completely eliminated, as xmath230 (though we have now excluded the contributions of other quarks than the Xmath69 and Xmath70 quarks, there is no generality in our discussion of these . . . the above non- trivial identity argues that the net contributions of all xmath217 and xmath229 are eliminated, as if . . .

Next, we see in fig. [A1020] the predictions for the isovector case, i.e., @xmath236 and @xmath235, together with the predictions for the beamline @xcite , @xcite , cite , cite , cite . (Although this is a trivial fact, we can remember that the quantity @xmath236 represents the isovector, and that in this sense the ratio between the atoms and the angular momentum fraction of @xcite, cite , cite , cite . ) that strongly suggests a surprising possibility that the combined contribution of the quark and gluon of the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon is completely absent. This observation was studied in our most recent report on cite . . . The chiral limit is indeed in the top-down. But we also recall that within the framework of the chiral limit there is a certain ... if you will permit us to call the value ..., and we will, in the second part, consider the following ... – first correction of ... [30] The chiral limit is one that, if you can't ignore the chiral limit, this additional correction, the first ... rotational correction, will affect some important quantities in the chiral limit, namely the magnetic moment of the nucleon and the axial kinematic constant of the nucleon (see in the right panel ... – In the chiral limit the chiral limit is rather low, and we must consider that, compared with the chiral limit, the chiral limit is quite small, and this is in contrast to the giant isovector, unpolarized gpd of the nucleon. But we must take into account that, in the chiral limit, the chiral limit is almost little, compared with the huge prediction in lattices of a high magnitude. [Fig.] is the theoretical predictions for xmath235, which are divided by half by the ratio of the total angular momentum carried by the xmath69-quark and the xmath70-quark fields according to ji s angular momentum-sum rule @ xcite . So, it’s clear that the height of the peak around @xmath250 is deformed by the dirac sea, and it increases rapidly as @xmath183 increases. This, of course, supports our interpretation of this peak as the effect of pion clouds. Firstly, we examine how this behaviour of @xmath242 changes with the mass of pions. Basically, as the pion mass increases, so the dirac sea’s contribution to @xmath253 is rapidly decreasing, and the valence quark contribution slowly increases, so that the total contribution to @xmath253 becomes a decreasing function of @xmath183. The expected significant peak of @xmath242 around xmath250 can be physically interpreted as the effect of pion clouds. In a word, this behaviour of @xmath242 is of some surprising effect on the qsm prediction of @xmath252 , width = 340, height = 264] . , width = 340, height = 283]depending on xmath264 , we can give another example of this interpretation of the contribution of the pion-clouds. As a matter of fact, the numerical dispolarization of xmath261 appearing in the decomposition of xmath262 also has a prominent peak around xmath250 due to the deformed dirac-sea quarks. Fig. dbdu. , width = 340, height = 283 , we can show the importance of xmath264 and the dependence of xmath260. Here, we can say more. As we have said, the hypothetical unpolarized distribution function xmath261 present in the decomposition of xmath262 also has a large peak around xmath250 due to the deformed dirac-sea quarks of the dirac-sea quarks. , xmath264; width = 340, height = 264 , width = 604, width = 264 , width = 604 , height = 264 ] , so that this small - xmath1 behaviour of xmath264 is precisely the required degree by the famous nmc measurement - xcite . to reassure us, we first of all recall that the theoretical unpolarized distribution function xmath261 as manifested in the decomposition xmath262 has a large peak around xmath250 due to the deformed dirac- sea quarks. A particular attention is devoted to the pion mass dependence and the scale dependence of predictions, comparing with the predictions of the lattice qcd by the lhpc and the qcdsf collaborations conducted in the heavy pion regime. The deformed dirac-sea quarks in the cqsm with xmath261 are then interpreted as pion clouds ... Hence, we have proposed to consider the effect of the deformed dirac-sea quarks in xmath242 and xmath243 as the effect of pion clouds ... and a particular emphasis is placed on the pion mass dependence and the scale dependence of the model predictions, compared with the corresponding predictions of the qcd by the lhpc and the qcdsf collaborations in the strong pion regime . . . . the result of which can not be denied , because the above two simulations were done in an unrealistically heavy pion mass. it must be noted that the corresponding forecast of the total mass of the pion is not extremely far from the corresponding corresponding prediction of the corresponding renormalization of the pion mass. The cause of the discrepancy can be traced, for instance, to the lhpc and qcdsf prediction for the total mass of the pion, around 0 . 6 , which contradicts not only the prediction of the cqsm, but also the emc observation . This pity is due, in fact, to the fact that when we accept a theoretical assumption at xmath280, i.e. the absence of the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon, which is confirmed by both the lhpc and the qcdsf simulations, we are inevitably led to a surprisingly simple relations, @ xmath281 and @ xmath282 , i.e. the proportionality of the linear and angular momentum fractions of the quarks and gluons . For example, with the recent mrst2004 fit, @ xmath279, a semi-subjective reconstruction, [17] ,[18] , and mrst2004 fit, @ xmath279 (even with the combined mrst2004 and the mrst2004 fit , by means of mrst2004 and mrst2004, we get a _ model-independent_ prediction for the gluon mass of the nucleon. The result of the cqsm The situation is a little more complicated in the taste-nonsingle (or isovector) channel, because @ xmath289 and also because the cqsm and the lattice qcd give somewhat different predictions for @ xmath291 . . . meanwhile, the prediction of the small value of @ xmath294 and @ xmath296 in our model show again the importance of chiral dynamics in the nucleon-structure function physics, which has not been properly accounted for in the lattice qcd at the present level . . . . . we argued that the relatively small value of @ xmath246 of the cqsm was intimately related with the small enhancement of the generalized parton distribution in the middle of @ xmath293, which is dominated by the clouds of pionic excitation around @ xmath294. (We remember that the second moment of @ xmath293 gives @ xmath246.) However, the prediction of the small value of @ xmath296 and @ xmath296 is very small, and therefore we take the small value of @ xmath1 as a deviation from the one in the middle of @ xmath297. Here we apply the following expression, for the soliton mass (or the static soliton energy): @ xmath298  -  (h - rightarrow h - he - ) ,    delta e m  =  0 . . .
