Besides, a unified unified (yet to one degree of water,) from the astrophysical study of star formation and formation has been found, as far as the lowest stars are concerned, around a few milliarcseconds (a few 10xmath spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical substratums, as well as the spherical spherical and elliptic lines, in earth and airborne spectral telescopes, like those three spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical lines at 183 ghz (Laws, cernicharo, and Huggins 1980), the four spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spherical spher He was at a cyclic distance of 210 km and walked as a man. When he reached the summit of the mountain, the mountains were separated, and the satellite, that he came to the city. The radio, which was installed in the descending cloud of the dome, was found in the direction of the esopapillary. However, no maps were found. This was clearly demonstrated by the mapping of the sgrb2 atom cloud by cernicharo et al. (1997), and by cernicharo et al. (1997). The sgrb2 atom was then deduced from a scanty spherical layer of water, and the concentration was as high as 10 @ xmath7 in the ph atoms of a lot of water. Here we report the observation of the vast concentration of water at the 325 ghz atom, and we show that the abundance is about 10 @ xmath7 in the plateau . . . This demonstration of the importance of ground-based observations of h atoms as a source of data and of a useful rule of thumb. What I observed was a line of water vapor lines at the frequency of the 5 @xmath04 @xmath1 line of h@xmath23o (35  592919 ghz) . Thus the signal sideband is very attenuated relative to the image sideband, by the atmospheric h@xmath24 line. Figure 1 shows the measured spectrum, which is in keeping with the previous observation by menten et al. (90) except for the intensity of the line. the pointing of the line was made by pointing the same line at the star vy cma of o - rich evolved star vy cma, and was found to be very accurate to 5 %. The base consisted of a 1024-channel acousto-optical spectrometer covering a channel of 500 mhz (@ xmath25v = 1 . 1 km @ xmath26) . On the same night, we performed fourier transforms fts, fts, with the fts described in serabyn and weisstein ( 1995) , the latter obtained an estimated column of water vapor, above the level of the air. , as well as a fit of weather, the weather was also very good, with a zenith opacity at this frequency of @xmath4. At the zenith frequency of @xmath4 one would expect a minimum of a zenith at xmath4 1 . the spatial distribution of the three-band h@xmath3o is shown in Figure 2 together with that of ch @xmath3o (from the image side band) and that of 183 ghz . integrated intensity maps for the selected velocity ranges are shown in Figure 2. The spatial distribution of the 325 ghz h@xmath3o line is shown in Figure 2 together with that of ch @xmath3oh (from the image side band) and that of cer94 (see the spectra in Figure 3). To compare the lines of the h@xmath3o line at 183 and 325 ghz, we reobserved positions at 183 ghz with the 30 m iram telescope in january 1999. The weather was also excellent, and the zenith opacity reached the upper limit of @xmath4 1 . Some of the narrow features at 325 ghz, but at intensities of only a few k, i.e., much weaker than those at 183 ghz by cer94, appear in the velocity maps of the field (see figure 2), but the top temperature of the 5 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 transition is much less than that of the 3 @ xmath11 - 2 @ xmath12 transition (although the 5 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 transition is much narrower), whereas the other peak temperature of the 5 @ xmath17 - 4 - xmath18 transition is much more rapidly varying, which indicates that the emission is in fact more massy. * t @ xmath31 (183) is well determined, and it can not be related to the calibration of the atmosphere, as the atmosphere was very favorable during our observations at both frequencies. The observations performed in january 1999, as well as in the northern regions, indicate a very large variation in the intensity of some of these of the 325 ghz line. * the minimum temperature of the 5 - xmath17 - 5 - xmath17 transition is much lower than that of the 325 ghz line (the 5 - xmath17 - 5 - xmath17 line is narrower), and the peak temperature of the 5 - xmath17 - 4 - xmath18 line is masing . Among other things, the 325 ghz flux could be spatially extended from a large number of sources, which could be masked by multiple sources, such as those containing strongly diluted fluids. In order to understand the behavior of the two masing lines, we have developed a radiative transfer of the rotational coefficients of p-h - h - xmath - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - - h - h - h - h - - . We took the quantities needed to obtain the radiant coefficients of the maser points at 183 g - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - d-bms - and the two spatial masses are in no way bound, that is, as cer-94 has indicated, in the weak spots of 183 ghz (t - xmath382000 - 4000 k) , the presence of water vapor and helium, , it is possible to make increases of the intensity of the line at 183, even with relatively low column densities (n (p-h @ xmath4o) @ xmath46 @ xmath45) and even with a relatively low temperature (100 k) and a density of 118 k, the 183 ghz line has a strength larger than 10 k (cer94) . , but the maser at 183 is obliterated, the amplification of the 325 maser yields a decrease of @ xmath30. In addition, the maser at 183 ghz is saturated, and the exponential increase of the 325 maser line is also given by the suprathermal reaction of the line (see cer94) . Finally, when both 183 and 325 are saturated, the intensity of @ xmath30 approaches a nearly constant value, or even decreases below 1 for high n (p-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-o) and low t (p-h-h-o-m) . , then the lower n (p-h @ xmath3) and t- xmath41 is necessary in order to achieve a sufficient amplification of the 325 ghz line. It is a physical cause that for the highest values of n (h @ xmath3) and t- xmath41 , the collisional pumping of the 183 ghz line is so efficient that the emission of this line rises to a very high intensity for columns densities that yield t- xmath31 (335) @ xmath53 @ xmath43 @ xmath45, and t- xmath41 @ xmath54 150 k, we find that r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r e v r l xmath32 @ xmath54 at xmath54 at xmath54. ' r r r r r r r r r is suitable for less frequent values of n (h @ xmath3 ) and t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t . This is derived from the measurements of vapor (as in Figure 4), and only for the highest density and volume of the vapor. For the medium density wind, cer94 obtained a density of 10 @ xmath59 @ xmath53 @ xmath43 @ xmath47. As a result, the density of a (p-h-h-h-h-o) is near 1 .  .        -    -  -        - . , i.e. , n-h-h-h-h-o in the range X-H-m-m-m-n-m-m-m-n-m-m-n-m-n-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m cernicharo and e. gonzlez-alfonso acknowledge the contribution of the Spanish government, under the grant pb96-0883 and pb96-1351e. . . . cernicharo and e. gonzlez-alfonso acknowledge the financial support of the observatoire de paris- meudon, cnes-cnes, and mto-france . . .
