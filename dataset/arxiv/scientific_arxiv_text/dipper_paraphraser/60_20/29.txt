. . . it is necessary that the content of the data be stored in qubits . . . a quantum system is always in contact with its surrounding environment, and this leads to decoherence in the quantum system. . . . in the arithmetical world, the information is always in contact with its surroundings, and this leads to decoherence in the quantum system . . . . However, as compared with the conventional coding system, outlined earlier, there is a scheme in which neither the syndrome and the ancillary qubits are necessary for Xcite. In contrast to the arithmetical scheme, described earlier, there is a scheme in which there are no ancillary qubits required for Xcite. add a further set of ancillary qubits, analogous to the classical coding system, to a codeword xmath qm22qm2q2 , in the same way as with classical error correction, it is possible to encode a data qubit to an xmath qm2 codeword so that an error that was acted in the error channel is detected by measuring another set of ancillary qubits added to the error syndrome qq in the formal form of the error syndrome qq psba5405a12 x , this is a method of overcoming decoherence. if a quantum computer is capable of general efficiency, then the physical dimension of the quantum computer is generally limited to a few micrometers or less, while the external noise, such as electromagnetic waves, has a wavelength of a few millimeters or centimeters. A quantized encoding circuit is invented, and the data is encoded in a tinny channel, a qubit of tinny modulation applied to the tinny modulation. . . . To demonstrate . . . , a general efficient scheme is proposed. . . . . for the computation of the tinny modulation, the noise in the quantum channel is assumed to be fully correlated, which means that all the qubits in the register are subject to the same error operators . . . for the demonstration . . . this paper presents two examples of error correcting codes falling into the second category . . . Since the stream is somewhat artificially artificial as an error-reducing channel, it is possible to implement our error-reducing scheme in the following case. In the following example, xmath10 denotes the xmath11th component of the pauli matrix and we give an account of the results of this analysis. It is shown that there exists an xmath4 encoding that accommodates an xmath5 encoding for qubit data, if xmath4 is odd, and an xmath6 encoding for qubit date if xmath4 is even. even when they do not know what basis the other party uses, they can send qubits correctly by adding one extra qubit (if xmath4 is odd) or two extra qubits (if xmath4 is even). We state the theorems and prove them in the following section. — the members of a quantum channel of the form xmath28, the wiggle operators xmath29, which are found in xmath27, are by the number xmath27, and if and only if xmath27 is a qecc of xmath27. . . . let xmath17 be complex matrices, and let xmath19 be a matrix of xmath26 — we introduce the operators xmath14 and xmath15, resolving to the xmath4 space, where xmath3 as mentioned earlier . . . let xmath17 be complex matrices, and let xmath19 be . . . let xmath19 be the sphere of xmath21 , let xmath21 be the sphere of xmath22 — which is the collection of xmath23 such that _xmath24 for some _xmath22 — - @ xmath24 - [@xmath24] orthogonal projection _xmath25 , it is the relative Xmath36 with respect to xmath25, that if xmath40 is even, and if xmath37 is odd, then xmath42 is a correlation between xmath42 and xmath32, where xmath32 is the projection operator, with a range space @ xmath30 . . . so that if xmath43 is odd, then xmath42 . . . and as if xmath41 were a qecc of dimension xmath21 . . . then Xmath42 . . . “then let xmath45 be a number, where xmath47 is the number of combinations from xmath4 elements . . . for xmath43, denote xmath44 . . . . . . therefore, @ xmath51 and _xmath52 are equal. Therefore, the rank - @ xmath21 numerical range of @ xmath57 is the intersection of the convex hulls of any of the eigenvalues of @ xmath57 . . . - Thus, the above observation shows that @ xmath51 and _xmath52 are equal. - Let _xmath25 be the orthogonal projection of _xmath64 . . . Proof let _xmath65 . . . . (A) In a commuting family, if xmath67 and xmath69 are commuting, then xmath79 is normal, and lemma - lem1 is applicable . . . we can assume that xmath68, since xmath70 is commuting, we can assume that xmath72. * Let's replace xmath74 by xmath75, and let's replace xmath76 by xmath77 to obtain xmath78. * , which gives xmath75 and xmath79. . . . What we have is the rank - xmath55 numerical range of xmath79, which is the intersection of the convex hulls of any xmath84 eigenvalues . . . since each eigenvalue has multiplicity, each convex hull consists of at least three eigenvalues . . . as a rule, we prove xmath86. As a rule, if we examine four eigenvalues plotted in the complex plane, we easily find the intersection of all the convex hulls is a single point, . . . as a rule, if @ xmath92 . . . “One-side = xmath101, y-side = xmath102, y-side = xmath103 . Since Xmath101 and Y-side = xmath103, it follows from Xmath103 that . . . Thus, math60 . . . After these calculations, the system becomes qecc. Since the operator is qecc, y-side = xmath100 . . . . and v            ,     ,   . . . and so on . . . and so on . . . I am referring to theorem (theorem) and to the result of qec based on theorem (theorem). in our qec a qubit state is encoded with a ancillary qubit state qec xmath115, as qec 118 . Our qec is simply summarized as qec 118, where qec 119 is written in xmath111 . our qec is in the following example based on a mnemonic, and whose quantum circuit can be implemented with the least number of cnot gates . . . . in a mnemonic, a noisy quantum channel is imposed on the mnemonic state and afterwards the recovery operation is imposed, so that the decoded state automatically appears in the output with no disorders . When xmath121 is tapped, the unitary operation Xmath122 can be chosen as Xmath123, when xmath124 is tapped, xmath122 can be chosen as Xmath125. ... Figure (A) shows the quantum circuits of the matrix Xmath122 for xmath126 and xmath127 . The line-inset shows the quantum circuits of xmath122 for xmath126 and xmath127 . . . Figure (B) shows the quantum circuits of xmath122 for xmath126 and xmath127. . . . - a > for a > for a > - a > - a > is given at the beginning and in the end not redeemed in the encoding. the codeword in this case is immune to noise operators, which is an analogy of the noiseless subspace / subsystem introduced by xcite. , width = 529 , we find a > = decoherence, as follows. - eq. - qecc - it seems, at first sight, that the implementations given in fig. 1 contradict with eq. - (qecc) because the controlled not gate in the end of the recovery circuit is missing . . . note that at first the top qubit is set to xmath138 and the controlled not gate is safely omitted without disrupting the encoding. , its width varies , we are to calculate it if a qubit can be encoded with it at xmath145 , the derivation of which can be generalized to cases of arbitrary xmath150 . . . if a qubit can be encoded with a quantum expression of eq.5, it is possible to generalize this result to other cases of arbitrary xmath145 . . . . Figure neven (a) and (b) represent the quantum circuits for a qubit at xmath115 and a qubit at xmath151 . . . figure neven (a) and (b) depict quantum circuits for a qubit at xmath115 and a qubit at xmath152 . . . The example with xmath126 and xmath127 is investigated in detail, and explicit quantum circuits implementing our qec with the least number of gates were obtained. They have shown that the envelope was violated by the use of degeneracy in the codes. * they have demonstrated that there is a quantum error correction that prevents fully correlated errors, in the form of xmath154, where xmath4 qubits are required to encode (i) @ xmath155 data qubits when @ xmath4 is odd and (ii) @ xmath156 data qubits when @ xmath4 is even. * they have demonstrated that the quantum packing is broken by exploiting the degeneracy of the codes. It seems that this approach is a little too complicated. ckl is a professor at the hong kong university, at the taiyuan university of science and at the shanghai university. He is a lecturer at the hong kong university, at the taiyuan university of science and at the shanghai university. In contrast, we analyzed a fully correlated noise, which is the most degeneracy, and have shown that @xmath4 data qubits can be encoded with an @xmath4 qubit codeword when @xmath4 is odd. In contrast, we analyzed a completely correlated noise, which shows the greatest degeneracy, and showed that @xmath4 data qubits can be encoded with the - qubit codeword of @xmath4 qubits, even if xmath4 is odd.
