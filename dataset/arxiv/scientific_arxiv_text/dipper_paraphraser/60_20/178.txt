" That is, the ratio of the transverse light-ing factor to the radiating surface, which we call the transmitting light, is [6] with the suffice [7], and the angle is [8] with the ref. [9], but this is impossible, since it would be necessary to find solutions of the maxwell equations that meet the boundary conditions at the interfaces of the incident, grating and the transmitted layers. [10] This number is a large number in the literature, and it has long since been recognized in various forms. , and has been derived in several forms. [11] and - a and b are the results of reciprocity of light, whereas the results of reflection are - @ xmath0, and @ xmath3 , respectively. The most general proof was published by petit in 1980, which was based on reciprocity of light, from the helmholtz equation, that reciprocity holds for periodic objects regardless of absorption. The theory of reciprocity is established by the symmetry of the light of the wavenumber vector: - a - or - c - reciprocal. It is difficult to apply the proof to transmission, for it would be necessary to build up solutions of maxwell equations that satisfy the boundary conditions at the interfaces of the incident, grating, and transmitted layers. Fig. .. The proof, thu in the second part of the sentence, exploits plane waves and is straightforward. Then we introduce the equation of electromagnetism. The equality of the two current sources (Xmath12) and the induced em waves (Xmath14), that is, Xmath14 , is the reciprocal theorem in electromagnetism. Then we present a numerical and experimental example of reciprocity. Here the examples of reciprocal optical responses are given. The calculations of recis are based on the equation recis. When two currents exist, as shown in Fig.2, and induced em waves travel in linear and locally responding media in which Xmath7 and Xmath8 are present, the equation recis is the reciprocal theorem in electromagnetism. The dipole oscillating at the frequency of Xmath17 emits dipole radiation, which is seen in the far field. the recis is necessary for reciprocity. , and if the dipoles are coherently oscillating with the same phase, then the emitted electric fields are superimposed and form a wave front far away from the array, in the @xmath34 plane. . . . if the dipoles are substantially oscillating, then the emitted electric fields are superimposed and form a wave front at a position far from the array in the @xmath34 plane, as shown in fig. . . . so, if we place the dipoles far enough from the object, the induced electric fields are superimposed and form a wave front far away from the array in the @xmath34 plane, as shown in fig. . . . so the current is @xmath36 . so we can calculate the electric field as a fourier series, to calculate periodic sources: _xmath_47, where _xmath47 is the fourier coefficient of _xmath49, _xmath50, _xmath52, and _xmath52 is the periodicity of the object along the _ _xmath_19 axis . . . mite> to be longer than xmath58, that is to say, xmath59, where xmath60 is the least common multiple of the diffraction channels that are open at xmath17 . and thus the proof is simple and general. when there is no periodic object in fig.  3, there is the same relationship: the Xmath68 power is provided by eqs .   reci .         , and the reciprocal theorem in eqs .                                                    ,                 ,    ,  , , ,  , ,   ,  , , , ,   , , , , ,  ,  , , , , .  , , , The composition of the sample was as follows: the structure was abrasion of a metal film of a alkaline earth and a quartz substrate. This material consisted of periodic grooves of an abrasion, etched with metallic films of abrasion and carbon, on a quartz substrate whose thickness is 40 nm, 5 nm, and 1 mm, respectively. The refractory energy of gold and chromium was derived from the refractive indexes of the refractive indexes. The refractive indexes of the gold and chromium were taken from refractive indexes of the transverse element. The analytical results of this paper are shown in Figure 5. The material of the beam is of an alloy of au and cr coated with a coating of quartz, with an angular shape that corresponds to the circular pattern of Fig 5. Fig 5. The unit cell is made of au: air: au: air = 3: 1: 4: 5: 5 . Fig 6. The profile of the beam is shown in Figure 6. The structure of the beam is obviously symmetrical about the transverse element. The numerical results of this statement have been improved with the s-math method. The simulation of the transmission angle at the Schengen axis is illustrated. The lines in Fig. 6 show the geometry of the spheres of the matrix. Fig. 6 shows the geometrical arrangement of the unit cell. There are some experimental studies on reciprocal transmission (see ref.) . The reference explains a clear difference of the transmission spectra of a reciprocal crystal in a nonlinear crystal of knbo in xmath81: Mn . The measured spectra are the same for the incident wavenumber vectors at xmath79 and xmath80. However, the transmission spectra of fig.5 c agree quantitatively above 700 nm. However, they exhibit qualitatively lower qualitatively below 700 nm . reciprocity is confirmed numerically and experimentally. Thermometric reciprocity is predicated on the assumption that all media are linear and respond to a local effect. This assumption is given in the form of the inverse of sec. (this is a kind of non-linearity ), in other words, it can happen that the reciprocal optical responses do not take place in non-local or non-locally responding materials. As we have seen in detail in a few experiments on reciprocal optical transmission (see the references in ref.) , the reciprocal optical responses do not take place for the non-linear or the non-locally responding media . in a second-order reaction of the crystal, which is said to be as follows: . . .
