During the last few years, a new method of analysis for the analysis of multifractal functions was introduced. It exploits the fact that the fractional derivative of order Xmath2 (described here by xmath3) of xmath2 has, in its aggregate probability Xmath2 a power-law tail in its cumulative probability, i.e. xmath9, the exponent Xmath5 is the unique solution of the equation Xmath6, where xmath7 is the scaling exponent associated with the behavior of the structure function of order Xmath9, i.e. xmath10 . . . for a multifractal function xmath1 . . . and , for the feigenbaum measure, all ten-fold exponents can be obtained with arbitrary accuracy. Our aim is to test the fractional derivative method for invariant measures of dissipative dynamical systems, particularly for the feigenbaum measure, which appears at the peak of the doubling cascade where the orbit has a period of xmath11 . . . . . Here we are presenting the thermodynamic formalism for the feigenbaum attractor. In the following sections we describe the thermodynamic formalism for the feigenbaum attractor. The formalism we cite is based on the study of the geometrical properties of the attractor, and we describe how this formalism is connected to the classic multifractal formalism, which is concerned with the statistical properties of the feigenbaum-trained measure . . . to the best of our knowledge the exact relationship of the two forms is enumerated here for the first time. In this section we describe the thermodynamic formalism for the feigenbaum-trained measure of the feigenbaum-trained measure (see ref. @ xcite for the mathematical details) and demonstrate how it can be used to study the multifractal properties of the hlder-stellar measure. The fractional derivatives are briefly recalled in Section [ss] fraclap phenomenology. The following properties of intervals at xmath29 are, as they were, easy consequences of the doubling equation (e.g.): a) the intervals of xmath27 are: a) the longest intervals of xmath32, a) - d - at xmath35 are, c) a selection of intervals of xmath27th level : a) a non-umber   &     (e.g.             (i.e.  delta      i = g   circ g  circ  cdots  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g  circ g    i   delta   i   delta   i (delta 0           )    end It is obvious that @xmath24 is indeed an attractor for all but countably many initial points at xmath46: @xmath47 as @xmath48 . the sum of exponents at xmath51 gives all possible scalings of the fractal set @xmath24. observe that the thermodynamic formalism based on ref. xcite is based on the gibbsian description of the lengths of intervals @xmath29. It is shown in ref. xcite that there is a function @ xmath52 (thermal potential) which is defined on all infinite dyadic sequences, such that : i. there exists a constant @ xmath53 for which @ xmath54  iii . Notice that exponents @ xmath51 give all possible scalings of the fractal set @xmath24 . notice that topologically @ xmath24 is a cantor set . . . note that a topologicalally @ xmath24 is a cantor set . . . as we have seen above, all intervals @ xmath29 have exponentially small lengths but the exponent varies from xmath49 to xmath50 . Oh! - the adverbial symbol for @xmath66 – xmath67, and we shall call the partition function of @xmath68 - xmath67, the free energy of @xmath68 - it immediately follows from   part     - that at xmath69 - . - .. The adverbial symbol for @xmath61 - , leq c –  [] - . . . . and the adverbial measure of @ xmath71 for each interval of @ xmath24 with odd numbers @ xmath64, the probability measure @ xmath75 is the part of the attractor @ xmath24 corresponding to intervals @ xmath29 with odd numbers @ xmath64 , we will denote this adverbial measure @ xmath76 by xmath77 . . . Notice that the coefficient @ xmath78 corresponds to an invariant measure and the coefficient @ xmath79 corresponds to a conditional distribution that corresponds to the Lebesgue measure on @ xmath19 . . .

"Tell me why: to find the modulus of the hexagram Xmath, the increment of the hexagram at every interval is equal to xmath110, which means a hexagram Xmath110 by means of (typ1 ), where hexagram Xmath110 is the inverse function of xmath110 . This is the unique modulus of the modulus for the modulus Xmath110 . . . . . and, although we only apply to the feigenbaum attractor, the result here, in a much more general way, holds. Nevertheless, the fractal analysis we presented here is based on the formulation of the thermodynamic formalism for the dimensions of the dynamical partitions xmath10 . . . The thermodynamic formalism takes into account a lot of dynamical information about the map xmath10. In this regard, the analysis in xcite is totally rigorous (see, for example, refs. xcite). The analysis of the multifractal dimension is now compared with the one presented in ref. xcite. Notice that this analysis is done in the form of a circle with an inverse temperature of xmath10, such that the heat corresponding to xmath10 is equal to xmath112, and the heat corresponding to xmath110 is inversed to xmath115, where xmath11 is the inverse of xmath11 . " - exponentially-() the multifractal equation in ref. - [28] is based on a function - xmath124 which can be described in the following way. the dynamical partition of the interval @ xmath13 is determined by a factor @ xmath139 for each interval @ xmath13, whose length @ xmath14 is the equivalent of @ xmath70. For each interval @ xmath13 we will consider a partition of the interval @ xmath13 into subintervals, @ xmath125, of length @ xmath8 . To arrive at the first relation, we shall consider the dynamical partition of @ xmath135 and assume that @ xmath136 but @ xmath138. We shall prove that @ xmath139 is an inverse function of the free energy @ xmath80. We will next determine a correspondence between the pair @ xmath131 and the pair of thermodynamic functions @ xmath132. * &   alpha    ln 2 ,   alpha    ln 2 ,     beta    left [ frac  alpha    ln 2 ,     beta   left [ frac  alpha    ln 2 ,  f        left [ frac  alpha     ln 2  f     right]  Nonumber   & &  inf   beta   left [ frac   alpha   ln 2    ln 2         ] , then @                 left [ frac                                                  ] , , the first step is to find thermodynamic potentials in xmath52. In this connection, we will use the following formula: xmath160: xmath160, a finite dimensional linear operator xmath162 is defined by the following formula: xmath162 denotes a certain xmath164 matrix. xmath166 denotes the largest eigenvalue 1010 . xmath165 :  epsilon   ( 0 ,  epsilon  ( 1 ) ,  epsilon  ( 2 ) ,  dots,  epsilon   (k - 1) ,     ,   ( xmath172) ,   ,    (to-throw eigenvalue),   (b ) ,    [13] and to the formula:        ,     ,   ,     ,       ,       , , and  (, )] The corresponding numerical results are presented in the next section.

The equivalent calculations, also based on the thermodynamical formalism, are referred to in ref. . . . in a similar way, and with a better precision, we apply the inverse of xmath17, for the value of xmath17. The inverse of xmath17 is defined by the expansion of the region, g1. As a result of xmath17, the inverse has been re-calculated. The relation between the two cases is very obvious . . . In a word, the region of xmath17 is enlarged by the expansion of Xmath17; and as a result of enlargement of xmath171 the division of the region is equal to the value of xmath17. (  d) a vector that was as big as xmath17. This unit of the ratio of the free energy of the two units of the matrix ( a first order) is shown in fig. . . . [R. 7] is calculated in a logical manner. The latter is very close to the equilibrium free energy, which is estimated with respect to the free energy of xmath167. Then we add to the free energy of xmath167 the corresponding approximation of the free energy. feigen – structure func – zetap (b) – , they are plotted in Fig. b. – line data obtained by a least square fit of the slopes of the directly measured structures in Fig. b. – lines: data obtained by a least square fit of the slopes of the structures in Fig. b. with this number of bins the quality of the fit has deteriorated somewhat, but otherwise there is a rather good agreement between the two methods of determining Fig. – xmath7. – we will discuss in turn the phenomenological approach to multifractality by fractional derivatives of xcite in the next section . – Fig. – Fig. – Fig. – Figure. – Fig. – Fig. – ‘Seen’ (b)’ of the Structure Functions of Fig. – Fig. – a. – Fig. – ‘Figure b’ (a) to a lesser square fit of the slopes of the directly measured Structure Functions shown in Fig. – Fig. – Fig. if we can take xmath120 as a cover dimension, we can express the probability of a singularity of exponent @xmath22 contributing a fractional derivative of order @xmath2 which exceeds (in absolute) a given large value @xmath231; that is, we require @ xmath232 as the codimension of the set @xmath233; the probability to satisfy - e: y-x - x - x is written as @ xmath234 here @ xmath235 is the spatial dimension ( @ xmath236). The key assumption of phenomenology is that this argument can be extended to non-inclusive multifractal singularities, if we take all types of singularities into account. if we consider the singularities with all possible exponents @xmath230 as a covering dimension, we can express the probability of having a singularity of exponent @xmath22 contribute to a fractional derivative of order @xmath2 which exceeds (in absolute value) a given large value at xmath231 , we require @xmath232 in terms of the codimension of the set @xmath233, the probability to satisfy (e: y: x) is written as @xmath234 here @xmath235 is the spatial dimension (@xmath236) . . . ; they showed that the observability of the law of the force depends on the magnitude of the multifractality, which is given by the multiplicative function @xmath243. It is the degree of the data that does not depart from being self-similar (which would require @xmath244) : @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is the number of octaves over which the data have multifractal scale. As will be seen, this is much more favorable for the invariance of the feigenbaum measure. , of course, the attractor for the feigenbaum map is not homogeneous. The feigenbaum map, in general, is of not homogeneous material. , in the presence of the finite range of scaling the power-law tail ( e: cprob) is created only when the multifractality is sufficiently strong. This strength is given by the multifractality parameter @ xmath243, a measure of how strongly the data are divergent from being identical (which would imply @ xmath244), which is @ xmath243. It was shown that in the presence of the finite range of scaling the tail of the power-law ( e: cprob) is made only if the multifractality is sufficiently strong. As we shall see, the situation is much better for the feigenbaum measure. This is because, as the feigenbaum attractor, the scales depend on a symbolic location in a system of partitions. For a purely physical system, like homogeneous turbulence, such partitions are difficult to define in any rigorous way. The phenomenological arguments of the previous section indicate that we must find power-law tails in the cumulative probability of fractional derivatives of @xmath1 for suitable orders of @xmath2. The value @xmath251 is of course not a fractional order but, as we shall see, is associated with a power-law tail of exponent minus one . . .
