As a result, there have been many discoveries, more than 200, of the eccentricities in extrasolar planets. , there are some very odd, speculative, speculative planets in eccentric orbits. For instance, in the case of our solar system, the extrasolar planets are generally quite spherical, but there are also a few spherical ones (at least a high one) and, at the same time, there are 15 spherical ones, each of which has a dreadful eccentricity. If the angle between the orbit of a planet and a stellar companion is large, the kozai mechanism can produce a large eccentricity, but the largest is the interaction of other planets. This draughts can be limited by general relativistic effects, by interaction with other planets, and thus are most effective in systems with large eccentricities. Here, it is proposed that a fusion scenario is envisaged, in which the inner protoplanets perturb each other and merge, forming one gigantic eccentricity with the xmath3 and xmath4 au. This is a method which has been proposed to explain the architecture of the planetary system and the planetary system xcite, which contains a hot jupiter and two eccentrically eccentric planets in moderate eccentricities. [24] With this fusion, we have found one of the “clouds” of the universe, the tidal jupiter, and two eccentricities with xmath3 and xmath4 au. " and, especially in the case of a compact system, which contains a Jupiter and a moderately large planet , i.e., a 'beautiful planet' (= hd 75732) , gj 876, v. 89693 . The use of the hd 75732 in this way is explained in the chapter in which hd 37605b is discovered. Three of the planetary systems in the following section (hd 3651, hd 80606, hd 89744) are part of this campaign. In this work we are going to combine observations and simulations of known planetary systems with the dynamical constraint of n-body simulations. The high resolution spectrograph of the hobby-eberly telescope (hd) combined with time-varying chromosomes, thereby allowing us to determine the time of observations so as to minimize the time gaps in the orbit of the known planet and to act immediately on potential new planets. Of particular interest are systems which are host to a jovian planet and a low-mass hot neptune (e.g. a. ) e.g. ma cnc = hd 75732, gj 876, gl777a = hd 190360 . a more precise orbit model, is described in a further section of this article. The firm was given the same instructions as we used in our study and for the investigation of the dynamic possibility of the two low-mass planets in each of the six systems examined here. We had for our purposes determined the regions in which these additional planets might remain in stable orbits in the presence of a known planet (s) . . . low-mass planets are considered test particles, for the angular momentum of these low-mass planets is very small. In order to put constraints on the physics of planetary systems, we would like to know where additional objects could be preserved in stable orbits in the presence of the known planet (s) . . . as our observations on these systems are aimed at a single target, a single object in which, when close to the known planet, the particles are destroyed. We selected the regularized mixed-variable symplectic integrator (rmvs3) version of swift, because its capability to form close proximity between semblant planets, is at an advantage. In calculating the orbit of test particles, we made use of the Rmvs3 model of swift, which deals with close approaches of all the particles, which are not interacting with the planets. Since the purpose of these simulations was to determine the region where more planets might remain in stable orbits, we have set this outer boundary, because the current catalog of radial velocity data does not find objects at such distances. We have given the positions for the remaining two planets, hd 45350 and 16 cyg bb, the radial velocity of which is given in the figure, in the figure of xcite. the obtained information for the internal velocity of the het is based on the inverse-variable value of the  , whose truncation is not a parameter, and it is a non-limitable quantity. We take the radial velocity of hd 45350 in the figure of xcite, and the velocity of 16 cyg b from the figure of hd 45350 in the figure of xcite. Our calculations show that the apparent positions of the six planets in this study do not show that there are any additional objects. In Xcite, all the data published were combined with those of mcdonald, and the known planet in each system was fitted with a keplerian orbit, by gauss-fit in xcite, allowing the motion of the velocity parameters between the two sets of data to be a free parameter. To this result, the lower parameter for the het parameter d=45350 was calculated from xcite, and the higher parameter for the 16-cyg b from the hjs observatory We present 23 new observations of hd 37605 from the space of 3166 days, obtained from xcite and 22 observations from het. We have fitted the coralie data with the Keck data, and 23 observations from het. These observations, which we have incorporated into the results, represent only internal errors. We had to experiment with the assumptions of 1 and 7 of radial velocity, which are a measure of jitter in quadrature, in order to obtain the data for hd 80606 . the longest period that this outer companion could have and still remain consistent with the acceleration and uncertainty of the observations is about 40 yr, assuming a circular orbit. This extreme jitter is attested by the extremely eccentric velocity of this planet. This observation is of the highest degree consistent with the calculations of a single planet. The shortest period that this outer companion could have and still remain consistent with the acceleration and uncertainty of the observations, is about 40 yr, assuming a circular orbit. Compared with the expected acceleration of @ xmath12 yr @ xmath13 , we can see that the motion of the orbit is based on the relative motion of the outer body . The parameters of the fit are obtained from the fit without the trend. , the rms in the combined result are: lick17, 1 , het10 , 7 , hjs9 . . . the results of the simulations are shown in Figures 1 – 3 , the short-lived planets hd 3651 and hd 37605 sweep the region inside of about 0 – 6 a.m., this is due to the star’s early spectral type (f7v) which hinders the precision of radial velocity measurements, due to the smaller number of spectral lines. The relative eccentricity of the test particles, in the region of 0 – 2 a.m., in a space of about 0. 5 a.m. in the hd 3651 system, whereas in the hd 37605 system, which has a notably short period, all the particles were still in the rhodium and at an extremely low angle to the final axis. The circle of the stable particles is drawn to the centre of the initial semimajor axis. As you can see in Fig. 1, the short-period planets hd 3651 and hd 37605 sweep the region from about 0 to about 0 au. This is hardly surprising since the planets are so light-weighted. In the case of hd 3651, the whole area remained occupied with extremely low eccentricities. The eccentricity of the particles in the region of 1: 2 mmrs was not a surprising finding as the hd 3651 system had such low mass. a region of instability is seen at 1 : mmr. a region of instability is visible at 1 : mmr. , we consider to be in a condition to try to search for the low-mass, short-period planets. We will use this method in the subsequent experiments, which is to determine the planet’s radial velocity, xmath22. It is the same method as in @xcite, who tested the stability of extrasolar planetary systems and found that there were no test particles in the habitable zones of the hd 80606 and the hd 89744 systems. We have found no evidence for any of these objects in either of the six systems in this experiment. The results of the study are consistent with those of @xcite, who investigated dynamical stability in extrasolar planets, and found that test particles could not be found in the habitable zones of the hd 80606 and the hd 89744 systems. The four planets orbiting hd 80606 swept out all test particles to a distance of about one-fifth of an orbit, and only at about one-fifth of an orbit did test particles remain in the stable orbits throughout the test period. Then we asked what limits can be applied to additional planets using the high-precision het data that we have obtained. The result was the same as that of xcite, except that in this work the best keplerian orbit of the known planet (see 3, 4) was removed before we computed the limit. Now we see that the results of the dynamical simulations of the hd 45350 system are largely based on the obtained results of the estimation of the detection limits. As we see, the estimation limits are generally improved with the addition of more data and with better quality data, and we have to define the measure of the accuracy of the measurement. For the hd 45350 system, the results of the dynamical simulations are complementary to the estimates of the detection limits. In the 16 cyg b system, tests were always stable (as shown in Figure 2b) and our observations were able to exclude the masses of 1 – 3 neptune masses. For the periods less than one year, we can exclude the masses of m sin —as shown in Figure 6b —where the limit is at a neptune mass . In this region, the tests were well settled (fig. 2c) and our observations could exclude those masses of m sin —ii between 1 and 4 neptune masses . As the estimate of the limits improves with the addition of more data and with better quality, we have decided to estimate a parameter to measure the validity of the limits. The values of xmath26 and xmath27 are given in table 2. In the case of the 16cygb system, the results of the dynamical simulations complimented the results of the detection limits. The very tightest limits are obtained in the upper part of the orbit (cf. That material is based on works funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under grant nos. nng04g141 and nng05g107, issued by the Institute of Planetary Science and Astronomy. This material is based on work supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration through grants no. Nng04g141 and Nng05g107 received by the international satellite planetary astrophysics foundation . Moreover, the intrinsic scatter for these three systems was too large to permit tight limits to be determined. this is very true for the f7 star hd 89744. This is a normal condition for the f7 star hd 89744. The three systems with the best limits (hd 3651, hd 45350, 16 cygb), also had the lowest scatter of their orbits ( mean =  2M30 ; table 1 ) . the most stable orbits for these three systems were also @ 2M30 . the three systems with the highest limits (hd 3651, hd 45350, and 16 cygb) also had the lowest scatter of intrinsic scatter about their orbital solutions (mean = 2M30 ; table 1 ) and compared this with the 3m scatter for the rest of the systems (indeed, it is plausible for hd 89744). It is, however, perfectly possible for the f7 star hd 89744 . - 012 - 53932 - 2 - 0 - av - 40550 - hd 3651 - 62 - 197 - xmath330 - 1 - hd 45350 - 103 - 91 - 207 - 190 - 201 - hd 37605 b - 55 - 027 - xmath330 - 1 - hd 45350 b - 111 - 428 - ml - 211 - 257 - 007 - 203 - 201 - 224 - 201 - 4 - 201 - 0 - 204 - 203 - 201 - 0 - 190 - 203 - 236 - 201 - 3 - 58 - 4 - ml - 0 - - ml - 201 - 263 - ml - 190 - 199 - ml - 207 - 198 - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml - ml 9 & 1065 - hd 3535 - 187 - en 2 . - hd 3535 - 195 - en 2 . - hd 3535 - en 3 . - hd 3535 - en 3 . - - hd 3535 - en 3 . - eh - hd 3535 - en 1 . - hd 3535 - en 1 . - eh - en 1 & en 2 . - en 1 & 6 . - en 2 . . . . .  ,  . , - en 1 . . . - en 3 . - en 3 & en 1 . en 2 & en 3 , en 2 - en 1 - en 4 , en 1 & en 2 - en 3 . 79164 - 18 - 3 - 1 - 53606 - 79346 - 18 - 2 - 1 - 53606 - 79166 - 19 - 3 - 1 - 53606 - 79446 - 17 - 8 - 2 - 2 - 53628 - 74206 - 14 - 8 - 2 - 53628 - 74431 - 5 - 5 - 2 - 53628 - 74431 - 5 - 5 - 2 - 2 - 53628 - 79449 - 17 - 6 - 2 - 4 - 53628 - 77521 - 20 - 8 - 2 - 53628 - 77425 - 21 - 2 - 1 - 8 - 53628 - 79164 - 19 - 3 - 1 - 53606 - 79548 - 22 - 2 - 2 - 8 - 2 - 6 - 53628 - 78441 - 22 - 2 - 4 - 53628 - 77521 - 21 - 8 - 2 - 4 - 53628 - 74270 - 14 - 8 - 2 - 6 - 53628 - 74240 - 14 - 8 - 2 - 4 - 53628 . 69410 - 18 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 53628 . 79431 - 17 . 6 - 2 - 4 - 53628 .
