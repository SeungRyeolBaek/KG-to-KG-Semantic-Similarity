In the past few years, however, the reactions with dileptons in hadrons and nuclei have received a great deal of attention. These reactions, and the results of which are in refs. Xcite, we have been studying the kinetics and properties of matter (see, e.g. , the review in refs.) in this process, virtual photons, which exist as dileptons (e.g., the pair in refs.) can give unique information about the structure of matter, for the processes in which the particle structure is formed, proceed in the time-like region of the "mass" of the virtual photon . Hence, it is necessary to conduct further investigations of these reactions, promising to gain new and perhaps unexpected information about the form of hadrons and nuclei. The authors proposed to use ipe at low (above-xmath7) energies and small-sized xmath8 energies to study the nucleon and pion structure and, if possible, to prove it in the limits of xmath9 . However, the intense pion beams available now allow for greater details of ipe-structural forms and a study of multipole properties, which is similar to those of photosynthesis and electrosynthesis. The authors claimed, however, that ipe-structural forms could not be determined in these experiments directly. However, the intense pion beams which are now available make it possible to perform more detailed studies of ipe-structural forms which will both extract the hadron structure and perform a study of the electrical structure of pions and pions. In the following sections, we will examine the parameters of pion and nucleon electromagnetic form factors, ranging from 0 . . to 0 . . in refs. Besides, in the xmath2 region, it is difficult to verify the significance of the colour-assisted contribution of the polarization-capacitivity proportional to the intrinsic quark model xcite . This result is based on the general algebraic description of the ipe process and the remarkable property of ipe . Such investigations can be interesting . . . such experiments can address interesting topics . . . the ipe process, whose creation of the xmath2 pairs of maximal mass (the quasi-treshold), is dominated by the natural mechanism, whereas the radiative corrections are of the line up to the total xmath7 energy @ xmath13 gev (the   ) . . . see  . . . ,  . . . , ,  , the threshold cathemetrics for the pion’s electro- and photo-production can be justified in the case of ipe up to the indicated energy. Therefore, we have a way of avoiding the threshold difficulty of extracting weak form factors from ipe data (and unlike the electro- and photo-production), from the ipe data. Also, in ipe there is no strong kinematic restriction inherent in the xmath14 capture, and no kinematic suppression of the induced pseudo-scalar form factor in the cross-sections of   straight processes, as @xmath15 implies, in which the processes are multiplied by the lepton masses. Moreover, the information on the pseudo-scalar form factor @xmath16, which is almost absent for the above reasons, is important because @xmath16 contains pion quantum numbers and therefore is related to the chiral symmetry breaking. This process could be used to study the baryon resonance and the antiquated impediment pattern, according to the mathematical theory of xmath. This paper is arranged as follows. ii, we present our dispersion-relation model, and compared the calculated results with experimental data. In the second part of the paper, we show the basic formalism for unified analysis of the reactions at xmath, xmath, and xmath. . . . iii, we present our dispersion-relation model, and compared the calculated results with the experimental results . . . , we present the dispersion-relation model for unified description of the reactions of xmath19, xmath20 and xmath21. This approach is natural because in the one-photon approximation , because of the @ xmath invariance, research into these three processes is based on the pion photosynthesis, electrosynthesis, and ipes, respectively. Moreover, we will also describe the reactions at the AT in the form of the unified model. Appendices give an account of the interaction between the amplitudes, derivation of quasithresholds for the multipole amplitudes, and an explanation of the compensation effect. During the subsequent investigations, an analysis of the pseudoscalar nucleon form factor is presented, and the results are discussed. We will next discuss the reactions at xmath19, at xmath20, at xmath21 in the context of the unified model.

The dipoles, for instance, from the electrochemistry data @xcite correspond to the ratio @xmath109. This model is suitable for the purpose, that is, to formulate the method of determination of the form factors in the time-like region, for the following reasons. first, in the dispersion-relation method, the spectral functions of the first resonance region are expressed by the nucleon electromagnetic form factors and the phase shift of the math7 - skattering math105 ... for the latter, the electric and scalar quadrupoles of electric resonances (as the magnetic dipoles ... ) describe the excitation of resonances ... - This is also a disadvantage for the phenomenological results of the math3 dependence of the math3 and math111 ratios, and depends on the method of removing them from electro-acquiescence. . . . and so in a complete 'Xmath-80' channel description, we should imply an approximate 'Xmath-110' proportion, with an entropy of one decomposition at a finite energy, for the isovector amplitude - xmath-110 - xmath-115. - For the calculation of the quadrupole excitations of xmath-103 (see refs. xcite , p. 698). - from the conventional calculations of the quark model (see refs. - xcite ) , we suppose that a similar situation also takes place for xmath-113, at least up to xmath-113 - gev / c - xmath-6 . - oh, however, these ratios do not exceed, respectively, 7 and 15 %, respectively, 0 and 3 (gev / c) - xmath-6 , the words - xmath123 and - xmath127, which are solely defined by xmath117, are given by xmath123, where - xmath123 - - , -    , -   , -   - , - , - , -  - , - , -  - with the entanglement constant - xmath123, - , -  , - , -   , -, and - xmath - - and without subtractions for the remaining amplitudes, ignoring the angle of the difference between the amplitudes - - - , - xmath, - - and - , - , -, with the kingly integrals - senate and spectral functions - - - converged at - xmath-- , - , - 1 gev for all the amplitudes - - . xcite, and xmath136 with the coefficients xmath137 xmath138 , , , ,  , ,  , ,  , beta,  ,    a  a  a  a (w, t,  lambda  a ) ,     ,   ,    ,   , , ,  , ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  , in the spectral functions xmath133 , i (w, t,  lambda  2 ),  ,  ,  , , ,     ,  ,  ,    ,    ,  , 2   (w + m  q  0)     2  (w + m  q  0),     alpha      (w + m  q  0),    alpha    2       2 —,  , ,  — , , , ,   , ,  —, ,   , ,    ,  — ,   ,  ,  —,  —,  — , ,   ,  ,  , ; in : , , , ,  ——, ,  — ,    ,  — , , ,   ,  —, , ,  , , , , ,  —,  ,   , , ,   ,    ; . . . , the results of the multipole analysis Xcite, permit us to set the energy 2,  , above the energy , The differential cross sections for the electroproduction of pions with transverse and longitudinal virtual photons are shown in fig.

[57] We resolving pions, and producing electrons, at the centre of the @xmath103 resonance (@xmath144) of the nucleons. On the contrary, analytic continuation with the approximation (Fig. 1) is immediately possible. But having in mind the quality of contemporary experimental data, the above-mentioned simple model seems to be quite sufficient. Fig. 1 shows a striking growth of the xmath103 resonance (as seen in Fig. 1 ). Theoretically, a more elaborate model should contain, in addition to the quadrupole, additional nucleon isobars and high-energy   tails, to the absorption part of the amplitudes to ensure a balanced computation of small corrections. Further, the calculation of the amplitudes corrected into the observable region of the dispersion integrals, in particular, if xmath148 were to be used, the quasithreshold relations (of causality) between the electric and longitudinal multipoles, in which   toroidal   poles appear xcite. . . . a relative contribution of the born terms with xmath3 and their dominance in the vicinity of the value xmath150 . . . which is connected to the quasithreshold theorem . . . this is because the ipe amplitude is born at the quasithreshold, -xmath150 , therefore, at xmath155 only the electric (@ xmath156 and @ xmath156) and longitudinal (@ xmath158 and @ xmath159) dipoles are destroyed . . . They derived from causality (analytics) and are given in Appendix B. It follows, therefore, that at the quasi-threshold region the ipe amplitude is given by the born terms with accuracy better than @ xmath167 . The selection of a frequency, which is the result of the interrelationship between the wave, and the angular momentum of the stopped virtual photon, @ xmath165, reduces possible resonances in the quasi-threshold to the following categories: _ xmath164 , _ xmath156 , _ etc., etc., and so on. since the resonances at xmath46 and _ xmath165 are excited at energies above 1.00 gev, it can be expected that the dipoles ___156 and ___157 are dominated by the born terms below that energy . At the end  aligned   ]  , we write for the quasi-threshold ipe    [] The electromagnetic form factors obtained in experiments on the nucleon ...  /] / and below, at xmath168, we can write for the quasi-threshold ipe       end  aligned    [] , the condition of the physical, must be obtained , it is necessary to employ the quasi-threshold theorem, the realistic dispersion - relation model and the compensation curve. This method has already been used in experiments on the nucleon and the nuclei  xmath168 gev , we can write for the quasi-threshold ipe    [4] electromagnetic form factors obtained in experiments on the nucleon ... , the virtual momentum of a pion is given in units of the mass of a pion. In the table - tab1 - we give measurements of electromagnetic form factors obtained in experiments on the nucleon. The empirical value of the figure at xmath174 is taken from the density calculations @ xcite. The value of the figure at xmath174 is considerably less theoretically uncertain than that calculated at xmath174. It is due to the cancellation of the terms of the large uncertainties in the spectral function of xmath174, which is dominated by the exchange contributions in the region of xmath175 . . . as we can see that this result is model-independent. So, it turns out, that the asymmetry of @xmath176 in the form of the form of @xmath177 in the @xmath178 region can be measured from the ratio of @xmath172 to @xmath172. So, of course, for high statistics, one need not use the ratio of @xmath172 with @xmath172. The values of @xmath171 are quite consistent with the calculations of the nucleon magnetic structure in the framework of the unitary and analytic vector-meson dominance model @xcite. It turns out that the analysis of asymmetry in the production of dilepton near the quasithreshold is the result of a symmetry in the results of the dilepton production near the quasithreshold. I can also imagine the number of a series in the asymmetry of aq. ( t - t - f - i) and ' k - behavior.' This is the behaviour of aq. in aq. of xmath103, with the additional terms of  and . In the asymmetry of aq. ( t - 5 - expand ), the values of  and  (for aq.) , are in the inverse range of the amplitudes of aq. and aq.; and '' = 0 ,  = 0 . ,  = 0 at the quasi-threshold, as it follows from the constraints (q - thr - constr).  and , the values of aq. in aq. averaging the +/- part of the amplitudes, especially the amplitudes of the xmath18 resonance, needs to be very low, as is seen in experiments on photosynthesis (especially on the neutron). The measurement of the amplitudes of @xmath188 and @xmath187, which are in the context of the excitation of the xmath189 resonance, must therefore be very accurate, because the quasi-threshold coefficients (and the behavior of the pair) appear to be fairly complete in the region of @xmath3 , the asymmetry of @xmath181 should be resolving to @xmath192 for @xmath103 . . . Therefore, the measurement of @xmath190 will allow one to study quantitatively the assumption about the dominance of the magnetic dipole, and thus extract information on the form factor . . . ‘Just now let us discuss a possible method of analyzing the weak nucleon structure related to the transition of the nucleons gamma _5u (p _ 1),] , – , – – - - , – – ; a – –  - and - – become x-se --to zero – ‘ipe’, which uses the current commutators, pcac and completeness, in order to derive a low energy theorem at the threshold – @ x-se- , -a-b-c and -se-c, related to the approximate chiral symmetry and @ x-se-c corrections. This description, if it be so, is as follows: it exploits the non-linear description of ipe. The alternative description of ipe, utilizing the current commutators, p-c and completeness, affords an alternative theory of ipe - @ x-se-c - @ x-c - and its parameters are to the effect that the width of the absolute amplitude of the amplitude remains of the leading terms in @ x-c and - d, such that @ x-c xmath207 was measured in various experiments, first in xmath209 and xmath210. In the Xmath204 decay, for example, is defined by xmath205, xmath206, and the quasithreshold values of the variables are xmath207. But in these experiments, it is difficult to obtain reliable information on xmath16, since the contribution to the cross-section is kinematically suppressed (because it is multiplied by the equator masses) . . . . , ,  end ,  . . . It follows that, with the quasi-threshold kinematics, one can avoid the limitations of analyzing the electroproduction data with an analogous method. As the equation (lma, long: qoq) is derived, the pseudoscalar form factor at xmath216 is formed by a difference of more than xmath216 from xmath216, as the amplitude at xmath216 has a form factor of xmath216. The value of xmath216 is indicated in fig. [Fig.] [figure][1] , which is an experiment. The latter identifies the first, the second, the third, the fourth and the fifth, and the eighth, to be interpreted as experimental. - "Introduction. - xmath219- xmath219. We have chosen a form factor of xmath216. The pseudoscalar form factor of xmath216 can be determined from xmath217 to xmath16 (which corresponds to xmath13 gev). At the pole, the residue at the pole, at the pole, is determined by the pcac relation . . . if we assume the following expression for @ xmath216, with the indicated values of parameters:  xmath224, where  xmath225, the weak-resistance constant @ xmath225 is defined by  xmath225, and  xmath225 and  xmath230 are the coupling constants of the  xmath230 . . . . . however, since the contributions of the nonresonant three-particle states must be suppressed by the volume, it is reasonable to approximate the integral in  g p  dr . therefore, the dispersion integral in eq. ( g p  dr) should be considered. The comparison of these two equations, if you follow gp - ratio, is very important in describing the obtained experimental data on ipe . This is also seen from the definitions of the weak-death constants, which indicate that there is another way (along with the goldstone) where the axial current is conserved for vanishing quark masses. You will see that the result of '/sent' is very accurate. — note that the pole of xmath232 (eq gp - ratio) is placed much lower than the poles of the known contributive states xmath233 and xmath234 and is therefore indispensable for describing the obtained experimental data on ipe. Note that the pole of xmath232 in eq . . . [G_ p] is indispensable for describing the experimental data on ipe . . . So our results, in a large range of momentum transfer, arose from the pion-pole dominance hypothesis. In contrast to our result, the hypothesis is based on only a narrow xmath102 range of momentum, but outside this range there is considerable contribution of continuum. Let us add that the signal of the charged state of this isotriplet was observed in the Xmath241 system, and interpreted as the first radial excitation of the pion in the context of the relativistic quark . . . in any case, the conclusion will remain valid that the state with xmath240 in the range of 500 - 800 mev should be needed for explaining the obtained ipe data. note that the contributions of the pion radial excitations, xmath233 and xmath234, which are rather far away from this region, are suppressed, and their consideration would only increase the mass of xmath237 a little. On the basis of this formalism , the duplexes of the states under consideration must have some nonlocality. Thus, a careful analysis of the corresponding processes is desirable in this region. In the model, we have already demonstrated . . . accept this designation for @xmath242 and, based on the estimation of the weak decay constant in the nambu jona-lasinio (njl) model, generalized by using effective quark interactions with a finite range, @xmath243 mev, we derive @xmath244 . In the njl model, the consideration of radial excitations of states requires some non-locality . . . , the calculation of the @xmath7 coupling constant in that model requires an extraneous verification of the tree approximation, and loop corrections can be added to @xcite , it seems that a satisfactory explanation of the corresponding processes with _xmath244 can not fail to impose some non-locality . . . . at present, with the increasing intensity of the pion-lights that are now available . . . ” a necessary step for the study of the electromagnetic structure of particles in the sub-@ xmath0 region of the time-like values of xmath3 , and of the nucleon weak structure in the space-like region . . . , the former is most interesting at present, particularly in connection with the discussion of the secret strangeness of the nucleon (see , e. g. , @ xcite) and quasi-nuclear bounds in the world-like state of xmath246 . . . In the construction of the dispersion-quadring model for the second and third resonances of xmath7, the multi-channel character of the nucleon isobars should be taken into account, e.g., by the methods of ref. @xmath7 or utilizing the appropriate uniforming variables . . . if a process has been performed to this effect, it is possible to carry out experiments which would enable it to be carried out. As we have already mentioned, our method has been used to investigate the pion-induced dilepton production of light nuclei. In the analysis of this process it was assumed that the pion-nucleus amplitude is determined by the neutron-pole mechanism, and that the nuclear part (the vertex function of the pion-nucleus) was calculated in the nucleon cluster model, He added, in the case of the reaction without disintegration of the nucleus, to the data obtained by an analysis of the individual nucleons, the observed electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus in the time-like region was observed for the first time. The obtained results for @ xmath171 are very close to the values of the values in ref. @ xcite. In the above case, the calculated values for xmath249 are very similar to those obtained by xmath174. In general, it seems that there is no satisfactory idea of the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus in the time-like region . . . . and that a satisfactory description must incorporate the constituent features of the nucleus (the respective analytic properties) and the more subtle (non-descript) collective nuclear effects . . . and finally it must be noted that a more reliable interpretation of the observed state will require solving a number of questions, namely : what constitutes the polarity of the nucleus and what constitutes the polarity of the spheres, and the amount of iplities derived from the polarity of the nucleus. . . ecology and experimental.

Then the non-zero limit can be given to an ipe, at the quasi-threshold, when the virtual photon has a maximal mass, while in the latter the non-zero limit is given to an ipe, at a level which is stopping at xmath264, at the level of the antinucleon Xmath264. a    prime  l =  = Infty  [l + 1] m  l +  + lm  l +   p    l + 1  ( cos   theta   gamma  ) ,   f  2 & = &    l = p    prime  l + 1  ( cos  theta   gamma  ) ,   f   l = p    prime  l   l = 1      infty  [l + 1] m  l +  + 0     l +        l +  p     l +   p     l + , the amplitudes of the poles of the two xmath275 - xmath260 are derivatives of xmath260 , they imply that corresponding symmetry relations exist for the amplitudes of the four xmath275 - xmath275, in the following, it is necessary to introduce new functions to xmath277, instead of the legendre polynomial, which have singularities (due to xmath278) - xmath279 - as a consequence of the relation between xmath275 and xmath282 , we can conclude that the amplitudes of xmath276 - -   -   p  20  + m - f - 4     p  20  + m - f - 4       p  20  + m - f - 5       p  20  + m - f - 5      left (   p   p  20  + m - &  &     - f - 5       p    p  20  + m - - - f - 5 ,       p   p   - m -  -  -  -   -    - - - ,    -  - -  -   -  - -   - f - 6    -  -  -  -  -  -  -    -   -   - -   -  - - bf q   l  tilde  e  l   l   l +  ,    l  l  l  l +  ,    l  l   l   l +  ,    l  l   l  l  l    l        , By the same token, the questions concerning the kinematic zeros in the expression in xmath65 are left open. In our study, we are interested mainly in the kinematic dependence of xmath65, and we give only the kinematic dependence of the amplitudes in xmath65, as @ xmath264 and @ xmath289, and did not write down explicitly the coefficients that depend only on xmath293 in xmath294. In addition, we must make sure that the expression in xmath264  tilde p      l + 1    over p  10  + m  0   ] in xmath264 has no kinematic singularities at xmath264. After taking into account the formulas (a: f) , (b: fb: fbehavior . . . ) and (b: fb: fb: fb: fb: fbehavior . . . ), and the fact that the amplitudes @ xmath66 have no kinematic singularities (except the poles at xmath53 and xmath54) , we conclude that the following constraints must be satisfied to achieve the maximal analyticity: a) as @ xmath262 @ xmath298 b) as @ xmath298 fb: f1 , f3 , f5 , fbehavior ... fbehavior ... fbehavior ... m ) and ... fbehavior ... m ) "*" (fl, scal . equivalence ) - [c: f1 , f3 , f5 - [c] - ( c: f3 , f5 - m ) - and using the legendre polynomials, we obtain kinematic relations between the multipole amplitudes at the quasithreshold and for xmath290. Using the constraints ([c] , f1 , f3 , f5 ) - [c] - [c] - [c] - ([c] - f3 , f5 - m ) - [gk] - behavior ,[ ] - and by combining the constraints ([c] , f1 , f5 - m ) - ([c] - f3 , f5 - m ] - [f] [v] - [v] , f(iiiiii] - [ej], b] - (c : f1 , f3 , f5 ) and [v] [v] - (v ], - c : f3 , f5 - m ] - (d) and eq. (f: behavior) What's more, it is in a different way that we got the kinematic conditions for the 'xmath290', the 'xmath310', the 'xmath305'; note that the 'xmath290' is obtained from the quasithreshold of 'xmath290', 'xmath290'. So we obtained the 'xmath290' by a different method that shades the kinematic nature of 'xmath290'. Note that the 'xmath290' and 'xmath290' are obtained from the quasithreshold of 'xmath305', as 'xmath305'. The relations of the first type ('c 'c': 'c' 'c', 'c') are analogous to 'c': 'c' 'c' 'c': 'c': 'c': 'c', 'c' ' ' 'm': ' the relations of the amplitudes of the xmath292 are of great importance to our considerations, because the condition xmath292 is fully manifested (at xmath149) in the investigated reaction . . . . the relations for the amplitudes of the xmath292 are of course not fulfilled in the reaction under consideration. . . . The condition of xmath292 at xmath149 is (at xmath149) realized (at xmath149) in the investigated reaction. . . . c . . . d. . . And we shall now reach a region of variables @ xmath316, and @ xmath317, where the amplitudes of multipoles in the surface, which form a physical property, are all formed by the relations (c: el- , ll- , m) are not inherently physical, but are merely affinely related to   toroid multipoles @ xmath317, and -[l2][l3]] (p. a.], which are not by any means formal, but by means of toroid amplitudes in the surface, which are of definite physical significance, and which are given by a physical meaning . [c] Here we will have an area of variables, at xmath321 and xmath321[l] where the intersections of the processes of photosynthesis, electrosynthesis and ipe are based on only the terms . . . let us write a speech if the equation (phi-cond ) allows for the solution of xmath325, xmath326, xmath327, and the function xmath331 and its partial derivatives of the first order are continuous in the vicinity of xmath332, and the derivative at xmath329 is different from zero, that is, xmath330, then there exists only one function xmath331 that satisfies the equation (phi-cond ) in some vicinity of xmath332 and takes the value xmath326 at xmath325, xmath333. /sent> differential cross section of virtual photosynthesis as a sum of two terms, xmath326, xmath326, xmath327. if the compensation is carried out, then the compensation curve in the plane of xmath337 is continuous in the physical region. So, if there are several compensations, then in the plane of xmath337 the compensation curve should be continuous in the physical region. and since this surface is continuous in the physical region, there is a surface of cation-compensation' on which the compensation is the born one. Consider the curves of xmath25 a little. The intersections of this surface with each plane of xmath335 define curves in the plane of xmath170, each of which is characterized by its own value of xmath3 and the cross section (dif. cr. sec.) being the born one. That is, the function xmath340 can always be represented as a polynomial in powers of xmath340: xmath340; and the equation xmath340 can have several real roots xmath340 . So, along these curves, the experimental cross-section is completely characterized by the electric born terms. in Fig. 6 . The compensation curves for the charged pion photosynthesis are shown. In the case of the charged pion photosynthesis, the available experimental data are sufficient to give the calculations of the compensation curves. It is necessary to find out the intersection points of the experimental differential cross-section with the calculated cross-section, and plot these points in the plane xmath337 or xmath344 . Thus, the experimental cross-sections are entirely characterized by the electric born terms. In the case of the charged pion photosynthesis, the available experimental data are sufficient to give the necessary adjustments. “The applicability of ebm to the cross section extends to the entire energy spectrum, but to the corresponding angles, which provide a more complete and transparent picture. The applicability of ebm to the cross section extends to the whole energy range, but at the corresponding angles, which gives a more complete and transparent picture. In the first resonance region, calculations, e.g., in the dispersion theory, which agree with predictions of the quark models (e.g. @ xcite) and with the results of the phenomenological analysis of the electroproduction data (e.g. @ xcite) confirm the dominance of the magnetic dipole excitation of the resonance, with the change of xmath103. In our dispersion model, it was proved that the compensation angle @ xmath347 is invariable with @ xmath347 for the cross-sections of the processes @ xmath348 with the transverse virtual photons @ xmath350 gev @ xmath350. In the second and third resonance regions, the analysis of experimental data for electroproduction (e.g. @ xcite) shows a considerable change (with @ xmath352) of the helicity structure for the excitation of the leading resonances, which is particularly essential at @ xmath353 . . . It is this that we prove practically . . . because at high energies and low angles, and at xmath360 ebm (as any reasonable model explaining the sharp peak in xmath361 for xmath361 photoproduction) gives the sign and size of xmath362 in the direction of the sharp peak, the compensation curves for xmath362 above the resonance region follow exactly the same values of the angles for xmath362 as for xmath364 . . . in any case, the compensation curves help to reveal the optimal experimental conditions for examining the form factors for x . . . . . . electroproduction at low energy and with low form factors, Springer tracts in modern physics, #831 * (Springer, Berlin, 1979) . . . surovtsev, f. g. tkebuchava, yad . fiz. blokhintseva, yu. surovtsev, m. nagy, d. rei . . .
