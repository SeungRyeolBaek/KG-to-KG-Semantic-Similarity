The purpose of the synthesis with mrt is to contribute to the database of sources in the Southern sky in the Declination (@ xmath3) range @ xmath3 to xmath5 range, covering the entire right ascension (@ xmath5) range, with a beam synthesised at xmath7, and an expected sensitivity of @ xmath0 to @ xmath0 of @ xmath5 mjy beam @ xmath9 . mrt is intended to be the southern sky equivalent of the cambridge 6c survey at xmath3 . mrt is a high-frequency, fourier, and t-shaped, t-shaped, and coplanar array at xcite. This telescope was built to fill the slackness in the availability of deep-sky surveys at low altitudes in the southern hemisphere. The most important astronomical drivers were acceleration, turbulence, and spherical in the interstellar medium, a study of the high redshift universe and the transient phenomenon of its redshift, as well as the search for the redshifted signature of neutral hydrogen from the cosmologically important period of eorization. The M. R. M. Survey at 151 mhz is a step in this direction and demonstrates the ever increasing interest in the long-wavelength astronomy. a suite of programs developed in-house was used to reduce the hours of the survey (a quarter of the hours observed over a period of xmath19 years) . The deconvolved images and the corresponding source catalogue of the xmath19 sources were published by xcite. It is our hypothesis that this technique will be useful in the new generation of radio telescopes, where, due to the huge data rate, only images after a certain integration will be recorded, instead of raw visibilities. This paper also describes our investigations to ascertain the errors in the array geometry of the imaging. xcite used homography to estimate a transformation matrix (which consists of rotation, translation and non-isotropic scaling) which accounts for the positional errors in the linearly gridded 2D images. This work was carried out by a group of software programs developed in-house and which reduced the views of @xmath18 hours of survey data (about quarter of the total number of @xmath19 hours observed over a period of 4 years) . . . . However, errors remained in the images which hindered the usefulness of the mrt images for multi-wavelength analysis of sources. It was therefore decided to correct the errors in the image domain and to avoid re-processing the images. This paper also describes our investigation of the relationship between the positional errors and errors in the geometry of the image being examined. It is proposed that this technique will be of use in the new generation of radio telescopes, where, due to their great data rate, only images after a certain integration are recorded as opposed to raw visibilities a flux sensitivity of 15  @ xmath0 is sufficiently high to permit a sufficient number of sources of known flux density at xmath23. As mrc has a source density of  xmath26 at xmath26, the chances of considering two unrelated sources as common are very small. Therefore, we used mrc because it is a close companion to the mrt survey, since it is at the same time the most frequent among all the reliable catalogs in the world, and because of its large number of sources. As a result, mrc is reported to be substantially complete and the resolution is estimated to be   xmath24. For visualisation, we presented the errors in @xmath6 and @xmath3 in percentages of mrt beamwidths. As mrc has a source density of  xmath26 , which is    xmath24,  xmath0 ensures a source population which is large enough to estimate homography (and the explanation will be described in the next section) . a flux threshold of 15  xmath0 ensuring a sufficient source population in which to properly estimate homography (which will be explained in a later section). ... the positions of the sources common to the mrc catalogue and the mrc catalogue were compared. The positions of the sources of mrc catalogue and mrc catalogue were compared. , i.e., in the same way as the d-xmath32 of the d-xmath32 gave two sets of correspondingly similar d-xmath32 points, i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., given two sets of corresponding d-xmath32 of correspondingly-dimensional data, i.e., i.e., i.e., the d-xmath33 of corresponding d-xmath33 , the d-xmath3 of the above-mentioned d-grams is found in the d-xmath38 matrix, that is, the d-xmath36 matrix, i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., to produce a histogram of errors in xmath3 of -xmath3 of the first-order, so that the d-xmath32 of xmath3 elapses. Then, to remove the error in xmath3, the image points were identified by the two-d system, which we will discuss in the following section. Then, eq -inhomog - 1016 a homographic matrix, for projective transformation, has 8 degrees of freedom (dif) . thus, a less general, 2d affine transformation is sufficient. a single xmath46 matrix, homogeneous, can account for the rotation, the scaling, and the translation of 2d points. Notice, for example, that @ xmath48 (the translation in the second dimension of xmath6) is added to the normal dot product of @ xmath49 which is used for the rotation and the translation. a two-d affine transformation (two rotations, two translations and two scalings) needs 6-dot-per-difference in xmath38. This implies that the zero-dimensional xmath48 and xmath48 are simply added to the normal dot product of @ xmath49 that represents rotation and scaling. a general homography matrix for the projective transformation has eight degrees of freedom (difference). A simple homography matrix of @ xmath46, with homogeneous coordinates, can account for the transformation of a two-d system. As each two-d point produces two independent equations, a minimum of three point correspondences are necessary to constrain xmath38 in the affine space. The two-dimensional images of mrt are stacked on the meridian. The directional cosine @ xmath61 is zero. Thus, positional errors in xmath6 and xmath3 are not systematic as a function of xmath6 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). So, positional errors in xmath6 and xmath3 do not show systematics in xmath6 (i.e., the first rows of figs. . . . ) we preferred xmath42 representation because all mrt images were already generated in this coordinate system. however, the difference in fitting functions of xmath66 and xmath14 in the xmath3 range of mrt , only xmath69 of the beamwidth in xmath6 is only xmath67 of the beamwidth in xmath6 . the equation e = sinza shows that a error in xmath61 will lead to an error in xmath6 with a corresponding xmath66 – dependence . It is necessary to obtain a good estimate of the transformation matrix from the normalised correspondences in xmath85. The normalisation ensures freedom of scale and origin, leading to a complete reduction of the mathematics in a fixed canonical frame. Then the normalisation is done to obtain the homography matrix @ xmath75, by the least squares method, by the least squares method, with singular value decomposition (svd) . Then, calculating the homography matrix from the normalised correspondences in xmath84, we have employed the method described earlier in the main section. The normalisation of xmath76 is then computed by the least squares method, using singular value decomposition (svd) . the normalisation enables arbitrary choices of scale and origin of points, leading to algebraic minimisation in a fixed frame. * Normalisation of xmath77: compute a transformation matrix, consisting of a translation and a scaling, that takes points @ xmath34, a new set of points @ xmath78, such that the centroid of the points @ xmath78 is the origin @ xmath79, and the average distance from the origin is @ xmath80. The result of the ill-conditioned matrix is that it heightens the gap. This means that if you are to calculate the corresponding mrt-images for the whole source population, a single homography matrix should suffice to express the errors. we have already studied each image independently to find out what the errors are. if the sources are bright (@xmath88) then the corresponding mrt-images are located at the extreme end of the xmath14 range. Suppose, if the mrt-images are located at the same xmath, the errors are independent of the four delay zones and the range of xmath. This implies that the single homography matrix for the whole source population should suffice to explain the errors. The analysis of the errors in the xmath6 and xmath3 plotted against xmath6 and xmath14 (fig. f: sourcecomparison) reveals that the errors are independent of the four delay zones and of the range of xmath6 . Xmath94 also indicates that mrt images should be corrected in xmath14 with a Xmath14 dependence. However, @ xmath95 indicates that mrt images should be compressed in xmath14 by a factor of 595 . [f]) two plots for this comparison, the f-curves (see fig. “f”), show a ratio of errors in the f-curves in the f-curves, in the f-curves (Sydney University molonglo sky survey) for a source that is near xmath99. Notice, after correction (see fig. “f”), the ratio is almost circular, as opposed to elliptical, after correction (see fig. “f”) , the ratio is almost circular as compared to elliptical, before correction (see fig. “f”), after correction (see fig. “f”) the ratio is almost circular, as opposed to elliptical, before correction (see fig. “f”) . The ratio is, as expected, a little less than 1% of the beamwidth for sources above 15 – see xmath0 , as was expected. The f: contours” a and f: contours” b are contours of mrt contours, before and after correction, overlayed on sums” (sydney university molonglo sky survey) image at xcite for a source around xmath100. In the next section we describe how we inspected and corrected the positional errors in the image domain. The image in question was the sumss image of a region of the abell series. By the application of this measure of positional error it was clear that the mrt images stretched (widened) in declination, i.e., a baseline distance of xmath109 m in the ns arm was wrongly measured at xmath109 m (one in 1000) . a scaling error of xmath105 in xmath107 resulted in a scaling factor of xmath107 in the xmath107-component of the baseline vector . . . it was calculated that the mrt contours were stretched in declination, i.e., xmath109 [e] and a complication of Xmath107 was then calculated and applied to eliminate the errors. This section discusses the hypothesis of oblique compression of our figures. From this it was clear that mrt contours stretched (compressed) in declination, i.e., xmath107 , xmath108 , the mrt arm was rounded by an error of xmath110 [1 part in 1000] . This is a sign of compression, and it was the first step to determine the region which is stretched (expanded) by the square of xmath110 m (1 part in 1000) . As we have already noted, our analysis of the position of sources and the homography matrix has been attributed to the position of the baselines or the antennas. Hence there are 945 antenna positions (63 allocations * 15 antennas / allocation) in the ns arm, and a total of 30 , 240 (961 * 32) channels of observation. The observed brightness phase, #xmath112, in a baseline with components @xmath113, is measured by the calibrator @xmath114 with the direction cosines @xmath115, is given by: #xmath112 in a baseline with components @xmath113, by the calibrator @xmath114 with cosines @xmath114, and is given by: #xmath112 where , #xmath112 represents the true instrumental phases, #xmath112 represents ew antennas and #xmath112 represents ns antennas. A small error in a measuring scale of relatively shorter length is likely to grow in line with the geometry of longer baselines, so that a non-zero difference in the estimated instrumental phases might be due to the positions of the calibrations and the position of the calibrations. In our analysis of positional errors in sources and the homography matrix, it is evident that our analysis of positional errors in sources and the homography matrix are correlated with positional errors in the baseline or in the antenna position. The basic principle of astrometry @ Xcite was used to estimate the positional errors in the antenna position and is described in the following table.

Moreover, these three calibrators are unresolved, isolated from complicated sources, and have well-known measured positions @ xcite . - the image shows the typical phase difference obtained with the pair of calibrators @ xmath150, the sensitivity per baseline is @ xmath148 jy for a one mhz bandwidth and integration time of one second . - the sensitivity per baseline, including the non-uniform weighting of the primary beam, is @ xmath150 jy . , the color of the -sheet, the measurement of the amplitude - are displayed in fig. f. f. , the estimated errors in 945 positions of the antenna - that is, the error is equal to one part in 1000 along the ns arm . a plot of typical phase differences obtained by the pair of calibrators - xmath154 is shown in fig. f. , phasediff - a representation of the averaged errors in 945 positions of the antenna. The error, which was given by the correction of the positional error by the angle, is one part in 1000, which translates into an increase in the width of the ns baseline vector, in the visibility domain. This is the cause of the small error in the xmath14 part of the xmath6 fraction that was observed in the positional error analysis and in the homography matrix. The analysis of the synthesised beam in xmath6 with the position of the old antenna and the corrected antenna also confirms this error in xmath6 , this is the cause of a small xmath14 dependent error in xmath6. further, our simulation of the synthesised beam in xmath6 with the old antenna positions and the corrected antenna positions confirmed this xmath14 dependent error in xmath6 . by formulating a linear system, using instrumental phases estimated from three well-distributed calibrators whose positions are well known, the array geometry was re-estimated. We have re-imaged one hour from the steradian and also scanned a completely new steradian. The positions of one steradian are available for download at ... http: / ... the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for the constructive comments and suggestions. Our approach to estimating the geometrical shape of the images supports our estimation of the radian geometry. in our opinion, this new technique will be of use to the new generation of radio telescopes, where the number of images has a great deal to do with enormous data, as a result of a greater distribution of data, the more images have to be analyzed, the more points of view. For our part, we see no systematic basis for these errors. - ... Soobash Daiboo has received a phd bursary from the sun-drenched square-kilometer array.
