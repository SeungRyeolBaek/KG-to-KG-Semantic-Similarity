a. Squires, like h@xmath0 (e.g., - - ? ? - a) (e.g., e.g., ? - hereafter z10), are thought to arise in or near a large accretion disk, which acts as fuel for the central supermassive black hole (log m @ xmath1 m @ xmath2) . The h@xmath0 shows a diversity of lines, as well as profile variations and asymmetries. broad h@ xmath0, with a wide line width fwhm = 500 @ xcite, and as wide fwhm = 40000 @ xcite, has been found. Despite this diversity, some systematics have emerged and are best reflected in the concept of two types of 1 agn populations @ xcite . . . a h @ xmath0 is presently the best fit to a single lorentz function. a h@ xmath0 is defined as a variety of broad and narrow line profiles which allow direct insight into the structure and kinematics of the photoionized and otherwise excited gas in the vicinity of the decisive central massive object. a broad line profile ( fwhm h@ xmath0) is well known, and the phenomenology is often confusing. , a source’s h @ xmath0 profile usually shows two components: 1 ) a classical ’ feii’ broad component (bc; fwhm = 4000 5000), with a small, red, or blue, or a very broad (vbc; 10000) and redshifted (@ xmath5500) component; 2 ) a very broad, vbc; 10000) and redshifted component (@ xmath51000) component. b sources are more complex in their linearity and frequency. feii emits broad feii in type 1 quasars since the time of X-ray spectroscopy in the 60s. As a rule, feii emission is seen in some of the most bright (usually the highest s/n) sdss quasars (Z10) . . . the feii 6450-700 blue element of the feii multiplet at 5018 can be clearly seen by the e. . . . . the resemblance (e.g., smoothness) of the feii 4450- 4700 blue blend (and the feii Multiplet at 5018) near the base feii h @ xmath0. One of the new evidences (h08) is that the eddington proportions are inversely proportional to the eddington ratio (l / l @ xmath7 @ xmath8 @ xmath9) are a redshift of feii relative to [oii] 5007 (and hence the balmer lines) in a large number of type 1 quasars. Previously (h08), it was asserted that a feii redshift of feii relative to l a-z 5007 (and hence the halo lines) in a great number of type 1 quasars. To this result, a narrower estimated feii line width was computed, which, combined with the narrower estimated feii line width, was attributed to the fact that feii emission was arising in a region with a strong field of circulation and a larger radius than the region forming the bulk of h a-z a-z-006 . In our work, based on the brightest ( xmath10 or xmath11) quasars (z10 ) and found no evidence for systematic shifts of feii lines relative to h xmath0. The selection criteria for h08, however, was for the least qualified sources; it could not be excluded that h08 considered the sources which were most vulnerable to the first two causes. There were two possible reasons for the relatively large h@xmath0 (or feii) shifts, namely: the contamination of the host galaxy and the blue outliers. The latter, if it were rare, would not have caused the large, systematic shifts registered in h08. . . . , which were not strongly affected by the first two causes. . . . 2 the highest r - of the r - of the r - iii shifts (and as shown in figure 8 of z10), were a source with a large feii shift (with a ratio of 400 to 1000) and 4 sources with a r - of 320 , the rest - 241 r . . . this procedure tries to overestimate the quality of the data, because it takes into account the major emission lines of the galaxy and the r - of the r - of a r - and the proportions of r - is in excess of the actual quantity, so that in the whole, over 4000, we have a total of 4000 sources, in which r - of r - 4944% of the sources show r - in z10 . The remaining 241 pops - are a few - that is, sources with a large feii redshift (to the figure 8 of z10), a source with a large feii red This is most likely true for composites generated from random subsamples of sources, but not for composites generated from a smaller number of sources. In rough order of importance our studies indicate that the accuracy of feii shift measurements depends on the strength of the feii, the width of the profile, the spectral s/n, and the strength of the heii 4686 emission. The average spectra of typical feii redshifts and s/n near the median of the sample, were derived from the h08 sample and modelled. Generally, the spectra of the individual source show too low s/n to allow for convincing conclusions about feii shift and width. With the template, which has adjustable redshifts from zero to the largest 'quote' , it is impossible to distinguish between zero and '1000' redshift in the majority of the sources. We argue that the reliability of the feii line shifts by composite spectra is not to be confirmed or refuted by the presence of a systematic feii redshift in our example because of the large dispersion of fwhm, shifts, and fluxes for both h @ xmath0 and feii. This is possible for composites derived from random sources, but not for composites derived from other sources. — we analyzed the trajectory of an a2 median composite, involving n = 130 z10 sources (s / n 110), is less constrained, since the lines are broader and feii weaker. As the distribution of feii shifts in h08 is continuous, we focus on the sources with the greatest quoted feii shifts. As we found no systematic feii redshifts in our z10 bright quasar composites, we aimed to build composites of the h08 collection . . . we assume the 4de1 position of the sources, and thereby constrain the range of feii shifts, feii relative strength (and feii in general) . . . We also report peak shifts of bc taken from the best speculative solutions, and peak shifts measured at the centroid of the line peak after the nc addition. we therefore focus on the construction of median composites for all the h08 sources that fall in the 4de1 bins a2 and b1; we develop them within the 4de1 context, thus limiting the ranges of fwhm h@xmath0 and relative strength (and most likely also fwhm feii) for each composite. The line of fits that were fitted was shown in the right and left panels. The model we employed was feii, which was given the inverse square of feii, which was 20 ms square. The most widely used samples were in the range of feii and continuum flux, and the inverse square of feii is the safest. At xmath17 four hundred five hundred, each of which is feii, and which encompasses the whole flux of the feii and continuum, and is therefore the safest region for normalized feii models. At xmath26, our p=18_bl k[24] _7, and the fit with @xmath27 = + @xmath27 (and much more), and a few other cases in the vicinity of the minimum feii value of xmath26 (to the maximum feii value of xmath26). , and the middle panel of Figure 1 on the left shows that the fit with a @xmath13 = + @xmath32 ) is significant (and also bl [24] f – xmath4 – a single, – M-n = 400  ) , (n = 156 for a2 and n = 240 for a1 ). - wm h – xmath32 – ample (n = 156 for bin a2 and n = 240 for bin b1) – a clear preference for zero or close to zero fits – this is hei, and thus, hei, in the optical spectra of low redshift quasars, there is a tendency for the h08 sources with the largest redshifts to favor a lower and lower (for example, a few hundred). However, this will lead to the apparent significance of any assumed redshift, and the hei signature of the hei may, if not removed, increase the apparent significance of any given redshift. As shown in Figure 9, a larger fraction of quasars with fwhm h, xmath35 4000 (billion) appear to have large redshifts. The latter line is not mentioned in the h08 study, so we can conclude that it is not included in the analyses. In the figure 9a of h08 a large fraction of quasars with fwhm h, xmath35 4000 (billion) shows large redshifts. The lower panels of our figure 1 show specfit models superimposed on the b1 median composite, composed of all h08 sources with the recited redshift greater than 1000. Moreover, the effect of hei is still more ambiguous than the a2 composite. However, the same line, not mentioned in the h08 study, is not mentioned in the research, so we conclude that it was not included in their studies. It is difficult to differentiate individual feii redshifts. The evidence of large feii redshifts is not, and cannot be proved. The exclusion of hei4686 from the h08 fits, by default, results in a tendency for heii to redshift the blue feii. The average feii redshift in the narrow feii is not very high, and the lines are too wide to provide a good estimate of the width and the scale of the shift. We tested this conclusion, omitting the hei line from our feii results to bin a2 and b1 composites derived from the h08 sample. Continuing to our previous list of main sources of uncertainty regarding feii redshift and fwhm, we conclude that the low spectral s/n and above average feii strength of h08 were the causes. In a normally low- luminosity sample, in which heii is stronger than average, one would have expected that feii was being systematically redshifted. - ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc c a ‘strange’, but one can only be sure of its usefulness in turning a bit on a changing structure.
