Suppose, for example, that at xmath13 a probe is launched from xmath13, and that for a certain time the movement of the probe is closely monitored by observers who are in contact with xmath13. we use units such as @xmath11 throughout the paper; in particular, the signature of the metric is @xmath11 in our convention. , namely, the quasi-inertial fermi coordinate system @xcite is essential, as it most closely resembles actual observations. Therefore, in order to study relative motion in an invariant manner, the quasi-inertial fermi coordinate system @xcite is necessary, as it most closely resembles the exact observations of astronomers. Let @xmath15 be the fermi coordinates of the probe at an event @xmath16, then a unique space-like geodesic exists with a length of @xmath17 which connects @xmath16 to the path of @xmath2 at an event @xmath18 with a proper time, @xmath17, such as @xmath19 and @xmath20, where @xmath21 is the unit vector @xmath18 which is tangent to the space-like geodesic at @xmath18 . this is in accordance with our metric @xmath12 . This metrical equation of motion of the probe relative to mass xmath2 can be described by the reduced geodesic equation xcite xmath27 where xmath28 is the negative velocity of the probe relative to xmath2 . . . this is because xmath32 is a timelike unit vector. a general feature of the reduced geodesic equation is that it contains a critical speed of xmath39, especially in the case of one-dimensional motion. the length of a cylindrical region of radius xmath34 along the worldline of xmath2 is shown by xmath36, that is, xmath35, where xmath30 is the radius of a curvature of spacetime . we are particularly interested in the role that the critical speed of xmath39 plays in the motion of the probe; therefore, the probe can be launched from xmath2 at any initial speed , but we are only interested in its motion when it is relatively close to the reference particle ... But it is necessary to remember that if the worldline of @xmath2 is given by @xmath47, then the worldline of the probe is given by @xmath48, where @xmath49 is substituted for the temporal coordinate @xmath50 by @xmath6 in the argument of @xmath51. in a general way, there are no explicit expressions for the position of fermi coordinates in the background coordinates, and therefore it is necessary to employ an approximation; see ref. @xcite for a general discussion of this problem. The geodesics of kerr spacetime have been discussed by many authors, for example, ref. @xcite and a number of references. , the geodesics of kerr spacetime have been discussed by a number of authors. See, for example, ref. @xcite and references. We consider the position of @xmath2 to be on a stable equatorial, circular geodesic orbit around a kerr source. It is necessary to calculate the keplerian frequency of the orbits under consideration here as xmath55. The above and below sign refers to orbits where xmath2 is in the same (opposive) sense as the source. in this case, the upper and lower sign indicate orbits where xmath2 rotates in the same (opposive) sense as the source. Finally, the sections to 5 contain a short explanation of our results. cvsent to a complete transformation of the generalized Jacobi equation into an autonomous form. This equation is analyzed in detail. The surface of interest is the outer kerr domain with the measure cv54, where cv is the specific angular momentum of the source. Consequently, it is necessary to define the keplerian frequency for the orbits that are under consideration here as cv55; cv58 as cv60 the upper (lower) sign refers to orbits where cv2 is not polar and vice versa when cv63 is not polar; so that the combination cv64 usually appears in the orbital equations. The spacetime region of interest is the kerr domain with the metric cv54 where cv5 is the specific momentum of the source, and the spacetime region of interest is the kerr domain with the metric cv54, where cv55 is the specific momentum of the source, the lower sign indicates the fact that cv3 has the same (opposive) sign as the source. As we can see from @xmath81, we can now say that the new orthonormal tetrad is aligned to the orbit of @xmath85,   tilde   lambda   mu  hspace   myspace    (3)  tilde   beta   lambda   mu  hspace   myspace  ( 0   end  aligned  ] ,  end  aligned   ] ,    tilde  gamma  [ lambda   mu   hspace     myspace  ,  tilde   beta   lambda    hspace    myspace  [4] ,  tilde   beta   lambda   hspace     [5] [5] ,          eq19  tilde   tilde   lambda       hspace   myspace  [6] ,  end          [6] [6] [7] - xmath110 where xmath109 and xmath110 are the indices of the set xmath107 , that is, symmetric and traceless matrices containing respectively the electric and magnetic components of the riemann tensor . . . at the end of the array - a ccc - a ccc - a  -  - a -  -   - a    , a  - a  - a  - a , a  - a  , a  - a , a  - at the xmath100 coordinates - is said to be, in this arithmetic and arithmetic concomitant, that is, the difference between these angles is due to the conjunction of geodetic and gravitomagnetic precessions.

Furthermore, for – xmath134 – for – retrograde orbits, – but not always for – prograde orbits; indeed, – @xmath127 is only negative for retrograde orbits, but not always for prograde orbits – in fact, for prograde orbits – with a radius of – xmath131. — —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen the interval @ xmath171 . This is the inverse of the axing of the Jacobian equation to the autonomous system. In the case of xmath174 we always assume that Xmath174 the reduction of the Jacobi equation to the autonomous system is basically due to the fact that Xmath174, where Xmath176 is the constant matrix. The transformation from xmath178 to xmath179 involves the rotation from an inner circular frame to a rotating axes; therefore, in the equation we see coriolis and centripetal terms on the left hand of this system. Lastly, a point of note is to point out the boundary condition of Xmath173 that @ xmath177 @ xmath171 corresponds to our assumption that the probe is launched from xmath2 ; in fact, it is only necessary that the probe be located near the reference particle @ xmath2, so that @ xmath41 must initially be very small compared with @ xmath34; for simplicity's sake, we chose @ xmath173 in this paper. The transformation from @ xmath178 to @ xcite refers to the rotation of the local inertial frame from the local inertial frame to the rotating axes; therefore, in equation, we note coriolis and centripetal terms on the left hand side of this system. ,               , At first it was easy to put the answer to the equation as the exact solution of the jacobi equation, but if it were a refactored answer, it was quite simple to prove a solution of the equations with the standard perturbation scheme in the manner of @xmath188. But the results of this simple perturbation scheme, which took into account the small parameter xmath189, ought only to be taken in conjunction with the higher-order tidal terms—that is, those more advanced aspects which have been neglected in the formulations of gravitational potentials in equations, and thereby yield terms in the equation of motion which go far beyond the linear order of @xmath18. The lines of the coaxial probe in the Boyer-Linquist coordinates are given in accordance with the coordinates. 2 y  dot  y  [10]  [10]  y  y   [10]      [11]    [12]    [14]   [15]]   [16]  [16]     [16]; (Y]  zeta    y    2          [16] if the probe is launched in the vertical direction, the resulting motion is limited to the corresponding xmath159 direction according to the generalized jacobi equation . . . if the probe is launched in the purely vertical direction relative to the reference orbit, then xmath204 for all xmath147 , then the equations of motion are reduced to xmath205, that is, the equation exhibits the critical speed xmath207 , beyond which the motion is contrary to the low-speed limit, in accordance with the Newtonian expectations . . . if the probe is launched in the xmath207 direction, the motion is simply uniform for xmath207; that is, the equation is the critical speed xmath207, where the motion of the xmath207 is counter-clockwise, in accordance with the generalized jacobi equation. So the tidal energy of the particle increases enormously . . . if xmath207 is satisfied, then the interval xmath214 is monotonically closed as xmath189 approaches unity. Here, we have observed in our earlier work on tidal dynamics, relating to a reference path along the axis of rotation of the central source, which we know to be counterclockwise, that for relative speeds above the critical speed @ xmath216, tidal deceleration occurs in a cone of angle @ xmath217 which is given by @ xmath218 and corresponds to an angle of about @ xmath219, while tidal _ acceleration_ occurs outside this cone, i.e., within the complement of the critical-speed cone involving latitudes from @ xmath220 to @ xmath221 and where @ xmath227 is restricted to a certain interval, which is called     . . . to look into this in detail, we first note that if  xmath229 is a solution of equations, then        . . . and so we limit our considerations to  xmath232, which corresponds to motion in the equatorial plane . . . . in particular, equation is not symmetric under the parity transformation      ; so , vertical motion is expected to occur symmetrically on the equatorial plane . . . for this reason, we confine our considerations to   , which corresponds to motion in the equatorial plane , and . . . And the state of the domain is characterized by the equations @ xmath245 and Xmath248 (i.e. @ xmath248), where @ xmath249 vanishes, as shown in Figure Xmath257, where @ xmath226 and xmath259 are the same numbers. We are referring to the equatorial orbit, which is the reference axes of this writing. While we have considered a simple circular equatorial orbit as the reference axes in this paper, the principal feature of the equatorial orbit is the axis , it follows that the velocity is located at the intersection of the vertical strip corresponding to @ xmath264 and xmath265 where @ xmath264 and xmath265 correspond, and the circle of unit radius centered at the origin of @ xmath266. As for @ xmath255, however, the shape of the domain changes a great deal. Xmath243 for @ xmath244 is positive, while @ xmath235 is positive for @ xmath224; indeed, this is the case for an extended domain about the kerr axis. However, for @ xmath256 the domain in figure [Fig. 1] remains practically the same as @ xmath255. In the case of a purely radial variation with xmath275, or with xmath276, the jacobi equation has periodic solutions, which correspond to the stability of the circular reference orbit under minor radial perturbations. Xmath269, for instance, the motion is restricted to the xmath270 plane and represents a time-like geodesic if the solution of the gje was derived from the corresponding solution of the jacobi equation as previously mentioned. This difficulty can, however, be avoided in the case of the purely radial variations with xmath275 or xmath275, for the jacobi equation is usually not adequate for the physical application of the mathematical equations of the higher order, because the lower orders of the equation have been ignored in our analysis. In the case of a numerical solution of the generalized jacobi equation (gje) in the xmath270 plane, the parameters of xmath127, xmath189 and xmath270 are shown in the figure Fig. 2 . , then the motion is limited to the xmath270 plane and represents a timelike geodesic, if xmath270 is a sufficiently small constant compared to unity, the solution of the gje is basically the solution of the jacobi equation as described earlier in this section. Nevertheless, it is observed that this kind of oscillation, which is illustrated in Figure 2 , reaches the xmath270 plane only slowly and leaves the corresponding region of the fermi coordinate system. Piqued by the relativistic physics of the accretion disks around astronomical sources, our results may be of use in determining the gravitational aspects of the complex plasma physics that would be involved in the formation of high-energy jets. * 437 * l39 - Piqued by Pique d'astrophys d'astrophys d'astrophys d'astrophys d' ' astron . . . . . int j l 1960 - relativity: general theory a; St. lv, h220* | 1024/1390K0 adv em-acquir d& ccxiii g, qcp, r'p  0511129 mashhoon b 2005 - acquir d . . . ; h228*, **793Mazhoon b 2005  22* l139*, chicone c and mashhoon b 2005 - "quantitative grav.  226* l - tertio y and takami y 2005 - physics. ___ ____ d ________ aliev a n, galtsov d v and Petukhov v i 1986 - astrophys. ____ & __space science . _____ ____ , ____ phys. . _____ ___________________ kato s, fukue j, mineshige j 2001 - black holes accretion disks _[5] _Koto University Press _[6] _black holes _, _ & _[6] _1@ inst. h. poincar __ . . . , l, & , @ , tanr tv [7], ta, , ;nr tk. _[8]
