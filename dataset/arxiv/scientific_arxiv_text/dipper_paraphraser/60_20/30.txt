He cited a number of studies to study the simultaneous detection of euv dimming and cmes (see below). A statistical study of the correlation between euv dimming and cmes was recently carried out by Bewsher et al., based on soho, cds, and lasco data, has proved to be a 55 % correlation between euv dimming and cmes, and vice versa an 84 % correlation between euv and euv dimming. We have a theory based on the hypothesis that the euv dimming experienced during euv dimming reflects the loss of coronal mass, and therefore we expect a one to one correlation between the euv dimming and cmes, unless there are special circumstances. Some studies have shown that, when euv dimming is detected in the onset of a coronal mass ejection, the euv dimming is induced by a small spacecraft. This study, based on soho and lasco data, confirmed a 55 % association between the euv and the cmes, and vice versa an 80% association between euv and the soft x-rays. And, besides, there is one case, with an average euv mass that does not leave any footprints in the euv (robbrecht et al. the dynamics of the cube is often characterized by the rapid expansion of a magnetically unstable corona, which is, from the lower corona to the heliosphere, and from the heliosphere to the heliosphere. Different shapes have been used to describe the shape of a cube, such as a bubble, an ice cone, a crescent, or a helical rope. This is, in a word, a mathematical model, because it yields unique physical parameters for the source, and for the kinematics of the cube, the inverse image, in a measured wavelength. Here we introduce a four-dimensional (3d = 3d + t) model that explains the evolution of the cube in time (t) in terms of 4d electron density distributions @ xmath2 which also allows us to predict and forward fit a corresponding intensity spectra of the corresponding euv density in the observed wavelength. we start from the simplest case, assuming a spherical cube for the front and the cavity; ( 2a) self-similar cube in time; (3b) density compression in the cube front and adiabatic irradiation in the cube cavity; (4b) mass conservation for the sum of the cube front and the cube cavity; (5c) hydrostatic (geostatic stratification) or superhydrostatic density. The “semi-convex” expansion of the cavity results in a rapid decrease in the electron density due to the self-convex expansion, which renders the inside of the cavity darker in euv and appears as the “crumb-line” – the sphere’s cavity. This parameter is consistent with a theory of the convexity of the sphere. During the first phase of the sphere’s expansion we assume a constant force which corresponds to a constant acceleration @ xmath7 and require three free parameters ( @ xmath8) to characterize the radial expansion , @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the initial radius at xmath11, @ xmath12 is the initial velocity, @ xmath7 is the acceleration of the radial expansion. for simplicity we assume a constant force in the initial phase of the sphere’s expansion, which corresponds to a constant acceleration @ xmath7 and requires three free parameters ( @ xmath8) to characterize the radial expansion , @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the initial radius at xmath11, @ xmath12 is the initial velocity and @ xmath7 is the acceleration of the radial expansion . this parameter is consistent with a theoretical formulation of a theoretical formulation . . . Here we constrain the geometry by a cylindrical foot-point area of radius xmath19, which runs from the solar surface to the lowest point of the spherical bubble. We establish an average width of the penumbra (equivalent to the average density of the penumbra) that is approximately constant throughout the self-similar expansion of the penumbra. The actual penumbra will at some time move to large heights without loss of mass (see the right-hand panel in fig. 1). To give a clear idea of the height of the penumbra, we have a circular penumbra of radius xmath19, which connects from the surface of the sun to the lowest point of the penumbra. in order to obtain an ideal magnetic field at the penumbra, the clumsy penumbra must always be located above the conical footstool, which must be at an angle to xmath20, and the acceleration must be @ xmath20. The circumference of the penumbra is shown in Figure 1.1. The sum of the volumes in the penumbra are composed of a spherical volume, the circumference of which is given by the radius of xmath5. The total volume of the penumbra is composed of a spherical volume with a radius of xmath28. In the term of adiabatic escalation of the penumbra, the electron density in the enclosed plasma decreases proportionally to the expanding volume, i.e., xmath23, so it drops by a third power as a function of time from the initial value of xmath24 (of the average density of the penum The mass of the plasma that is swept out of the external corona corresponds to the total volume of the external corona minus the initial volume of the external corona,  =    &   over 3     pi r (t)  3   r  3   r   3  r   0                                                      ,      over 3          over 3   pi          pi r (t)  3  r                 ,                over 3   pi    pi r (t)   3 For example, if the angle is increased, the dielectric density will increase; if it is decreased, the adiabatic expansion will lead to a cavity, and the average density ratio will be decreased, by a factor of 2.70 . . . .   3 &  rm for   rho (t)  ge rho (t)      left [r _0 / r (t)  right . . . ” , –   3 &  rm for    rho (t)  rho (t)  ge rho (t)      left [r _0 / r (t)  right . . .     3 &  rm for    rho (t)  ge rho (t) . . . it also contains the geometry and the kinematics of the system, as described in aschwanden et al., 2009a, b) . this process, which is very similar to the one described by aschwanden et al. (2009a), is an event observed with the stereo, which occurs in the east side of the solar disk and in the north side of the solar disk. Our system assumes the white light emission of the system, usually a few solar radii away from the sun, while our system directs directly to the source of the system in the lower corona, as observed by euv. This event occurred in the east limb of the radio and in the front of the solar disk with the radio and in the rear. Thernisien et al. 2009, temmer et al. 2009, maloney et al. 2009, mierla et al. 2009 a) a). Besides, the architecture and geometry of the system, as a result of the method that we have outlined, has been applied to a certain event which seems to be a spherical expanding shell, and which, therefore, is most suitable for the analysis, is the incident on 25 MAR 18 : and the circular fits to the outer edge of the sphere are then overlayed in fig. 2 and 3 in the horizontal direction. As we note, the fits of the sphere, approximately agree with the envelopes of the difference flux in the stereo / b images (from 18 : 48 ut) until they come to an agreement. This procedure yields the centroid positions of the sphere at xmath69 and xmath70 for the time period of xmath71. The radii and y positions of the circular fits are perfectly constrained from the stereo / a images, so that only the x position of the centroid of the sphere needs to be mapped in the epipolar / b images. we note that the fits of the sphere of the sphere roughly agree with the envelopes of the difference flux in the stereo / b images, up to 18 : 48 ut, but there is a discrepancy afterwards. Fig. 2 and 3 show the outer boundary of the sphere of the sphere, but it was not always possible to trace the sphere of the sphere without ambiguous proof of a continuous expansion. the circle of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere is arranged in Fig. 3 and shown as a baseline (by subtracting a pre-cme image from 18 : 36 ut) to enhance the contrast of the sphere of the sphere. Then he worked out the average values of his models – math92 and math93 for the heliographic positions – and now he proved to me that he could be pointing to the euv , which is visible from earth, as well as to the man, and a figure of the order of the euv, which is indicated by math89 of the spacecraft a / b plane. Using these equilateral coordinates, we derive the data of the centroid of the sphere, the radius of the sphere of the sphere, and the height of the sphere of the sphere. , see figure 313 , a zone of 300, 000 m2 m2 m2 m2 m2 in Fig. 3 , a zone of 600 m2 in fig. 313 , width = 313 m3 , width = 313 m3 , the average of the distances between the two spacecrafts, @ xmath82, @ xmath83, @ xmath84, @ xmath84, and @ xmath85 in fig. 313 The acceleration will first be high and gradually decline as the magnetic force increases in large altitudes. Consequently, we estimate the accuracy of the acceleration to be of order @ xmath0 based on the uncertainty of the leading edge of the balloon. The acceleration is assumed to be high at first, and then rapidly declines as the magnetic force decreases at large altitudes. We model the 3D geometry of the balloon with the fixed radius @ xmath6 and the width @ xmath25 of the compression region. In fig. 5 we illustrate the transverse profiles of euv brightness in a cross-sectional direction (horizontally parallel to the solar surface) and in a vertical direction for the observations of euvi - and a 171 euvi data ( indicated with dotted lines in fig. 5). We estimate the accuracy of the acceleration value to be of order @ xmath0, because of the uncertainty in defining the leading edge of the euv. The acceleration is estimated to be first high and rapid, when the driving magnetic forces diminish at high altitudes . note that the acceleration measured here is from the origin of the euv at low coronal heights of @ xmath103 and from the same heliosphere as measured in the heliosphere, typically tens of ms @ xmath104 in heights of 5, 22 and 5, as measured in soho / lusco . . . , the temperature of the ambient air in each pixel position @ xmath110 is computed by line-of-sight integration along the @xmath111-axis in our 3D density cube @ xmath113. At xmath113 the intensity in dns in the model image is calculated directly by multiplying the instrumental response function @xmath117 of the 171 filter, @xmath117 where @xmath119 dns @ xmath104 @xmath120 mk @ xmath104, and the fwhm of the 171 filter is @xmath121 mk. in Fig. 6 we present the best-fitted solution of horizontal and vertical brightness profiles. The super-hydrostatic factor is most sensitive to the vertical brightness profile (fig. 5, right-hand side panels) for which we find a best-fit value of @xmath124. The absolute flux level is proportional to the coronal base density squared, which we obtain by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed density profiles. As a result, the airship separation angle is given a slight angle, a slight angle at the ecliptic, a slight angle at the middle, a slight angle at the head, a slight angle at the end of the shaft, a slight angle at the end of the shaft, a slight angle at the bottom of the shaft, a slight angle at the end of the shaft, a slight angle at the end of the shaft, a slight angle at the tip of the horn, a slight angle at the center of the shaft, a slight angle at the head, a slight angle at the top of the shaft, a slight inclination of the horns and bottom of the wind. And the wind of the shaft is determined at the beginning of the second velocié, at the beginning of the second velocié, at the beginning of the third velocié. And the set of coefficients at the end of the velocié was calculated, and after we had obtained our fourteen free parameters (which we have set out in Table 1), and set to work in conjunction with the quantities of various measured coordinates and the vertical and horizontal heights (fig. 5), then, after constrained all these parameters, we have applied to our study, some interstitial ones (such as measured coordinates) and for example, a dc and a bipolar angle (fig. 6), which we consider as a factor of cogitation, a single temperature (174 mesh) and a minimum (174 mesh) the extent of the euv halo matches relatively well, although the euv halo is somewhat cluttered with small, bright preflare loops that appear in the aftermath of the euv halo, and these are mostly hidden in the euvi halo observation. The model is less in agreement with the euvi halo observation. however, it is less in agreement with the euvi halo observation. the halo observation is less in agreement with the observed euvi halo observations. The combination of projection effects and gravitational stratification predict a brighter rim on the west side, where we see through a longer and denser column as tangential to the euvi halo, which is not visible in the observations of euvi halo. the light loops of the euvi halo are not compatible with the surface of the modeled euvi halo. The greatest inconsistency between the euvi halo and the euvi halo is the bright rim of the euvi halo. This inconsistency is the bright loop in euvi halo at 18:51 ut, which does not match the surface of the modeled euvi halo. the euvi halo is smaller in size than the euvi halo. Possibly a newer, spherical-coated pore density of the euvi halo – perhaps a spherical tube model could be better suited to the observations than a spherical shell model. This is in keeping with the static evolution of the cubic shell, which is characterized by an adiabatic expansion of the spherical cubic shell with a light front, density compression and a cavity with density rarefaction, satisfying the mass conservation of the cubic and the ambient corona. Secondly, the mass identified in 171 is less than a third of the total cubic mass (aschwanden et al. 2009b) so a more realistic estimate of the cubic mass is about a factor six higher than the lower limit, i.e., @ xmath140 g from stereo / cor2 - 2 white-light observations (colaninno and vourlidas 2009) or @ xmath143 g from stereo / euvi observations (aschwanden et al. 2009b) so a more realistic estimate of the cubic mass is about a factor 6 higher than our lower limit, i.e., @ xmath140 g from stereo / euvi observations (aschwanden et al. 2009a) , so that a more realistic estimate of the cubic mass is about a factor 6 higher than our lower limit, i.e., @ xmath142 g from stereo / euvi observations (colaninno and vourlidas 2009) , thereby making it in the ballpark of previous measurements of cubic mass by the euv , i.e., if @ xmath142 g from stereo / euvi observations ( aschwanden et al. My approach to calculating euv thickness, volume, and foot-point area is the simplest method. The derived base density, the height of the scaly pipe, and the foot-point area are restricted by our model, but the accurate estimate requires a more complete temperature resolution with other euv filters (e.g., see aschwanden et al. 2009b) . thus the size and density compression factor of the euv-shaped pipe are also constrained by our model, but accurate values are required a complete homogeneous membrane. This experiment has shown that the spherical shell can reproduce many of the features observed in an evolving euv-departure, which constrains the physical and kinematic parameters of the initial phase of the euv-launch, but also significant deviations which require the modification of the idealized homogeneous euv-departure. The result of this study is that euv-departure can be understood quantitatively and that it is an accurate measurement of the mass loss of a euv-departure. The geometrical study showed that the euv-departure could be compared to the euvi-departure, and that it was capable of establishing the physical and kinematic properties of the early phase of the euv-departure, but revealed also significant deviations that required a reversion of the idealized homogeneous euv-departure model. , faubourg / chichester / uk, and springer: berlin . . . – ad-Vis d’un corona . . . an introduction – acquire de lige (belgium) , d’une internationale d’ingénieur de l’homme et applique (faubourg) , d’une internationale d’enseignement (eds) , d’être d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un du d’un d’un d’un d’un dans l’actualité – jour d’une d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un d’un du d’un tin d’unit – it was a d’un d’un du d’un, à thuis d’un jeune homme n’est-cieil d’un l’été du Csar, de l’Homme de lige e But yin, b. j., antiochos, s. k., macneice, p. j., zurbuchen, t. h., and fisk, l. a.
