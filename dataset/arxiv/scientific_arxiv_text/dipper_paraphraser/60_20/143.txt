He also has to deal with the possibility of early extinction by a long-term discontinuity of a globular distribution of matter, which is described by the theory of the cosmic web. In this theory, however, there is a greater variety of forms of filaments and voids, which are called the “cosmological web”. In this, of course, mathematical and numerical simulations of the filaments have been successfully performed on the galaxy closest to him, such as the 2dfgrs ( colless et al. 2001, Baugh et al. 2004), the sloan digital sky survey (sdss, stoughton et al. 2002, doroshkevich et al. 2004) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss, stoughton et al. 2002, doroshkevich et al. 2004) and the 2 dfgrs all-sky survey ( 2mass, maller et al. 2004) and the 2 dfgrs all-sky survey ( 2mass, maller et al. 2004). The hydrodynamics of the low-redshift cosmic web (katz et al. 1996; miralda-escud et al. 1998), and indicate that galaxies are only the tip of the iceberg in this cosmic web ( katz et al. 1996; miralda-escud et al. In this paper, we perform the same search, as part of a larger study, which combines a large number of deep star surveys and observations of qsos behind well-defined galaxy groups or clusters. As a result, it is to understand the nature of ionized gas at low redshifts, several groups are pursuing deep redshifts surveys and observations of qsos behind well-defined galaxy groups and clusters. At low redshifts, however, a few groups are pursuing a deep redshift survey, and by means of observations of qsos behind well-defined galaxy groups or clusters (Totaling o at Xmath4roman6 , o at Xmath4roman7, o at Xmath4roman8 and prochaska et al. 2004) . . . , for example, to investigate gas located in large filaments, bregman et al. (2004) strove to locate o-piabbles, indicative of o-piabbles, in regions between quasars , bregman et al. (2004) to search for absorption lines, affixed to o-piabbles, in spectra of background qsos, e.g. whether they evinced in an individual disk / halo, a group, or low density regions of a large filament or void. You will see in this paper that the asterisks and the latitude of the eyeglasses of the abell clusters are located in the abyss of the abyss, and the delimitation of the abyss is also seen. In addition, the eyeglasses and the instrumentation used for astronomy are described in 1 and 2. These are the hst, the asterisks, the nave ultraviolet spectroscopicexplorers (the latter ) and, in addition, the ground-based, near-earth observation and the galaxies, as well as our galaxy redshift measurements. In the second section, we will discuss the various wavelengths of the absorption lines, which we obtain from the asterisks, in 1 and 2; the absorption lines are described in 3; the physical state and metallicity of the absorption lines are discussed; in 5 we study the properties of the absorption lines based on the asterisk spectrum, and examine the properties of the absorbed gases in detail. We shall present that, in this direction, the absorption of gas and galaxies are detected in the redshifts of the structures delineated by the asterisks. In addition, we have obtained images and spectral redshifts of galaxies in the 0624 field. Our observations and analyses are made in two parts: the asterisk / asterisk, the asterisk and the far ultraviolet spectrometer (FLUS), the FLUXAO (PFZ) and the GIF-HEANER (FLUS) . The asterisk is not a low-yielding gas, but is generally cold, photo The data were then analyzed as described in tripp et al. (2001) using the software of calstis from the goddard space station. We also observed hs0624 + 6907 by the pi team several times between 1999 november and 2002 february (program ids p1071001, p1071002, s6011201, and s6011202) . because the spectra in the individual channels have low s/n ratios, we have aligned and combined all available lif channels to form the final spectra which we used. In hs0624 + 6907, the total integration time was 110 ksec. The other channels had a rather lower integration time, as a result of channel emulation problems in some observations. . . . Because the spectra in the individual channels have small s/n ratios, we have aligned and combined all available lif channels to form the final spectra which we used. . . . we retrieved the spectra from the archive and reduced them using calfuse version 2 . . . as described in tripp et al. (2005) . . . for hs0624 + 6907, the total integration time was 61. 95 ksec. a diffraction-limited scope was one of the principal goals of our low-xmath-32 absorption line program. Its goal is to examine the relations between galaxies and absorption systems. The first of these studies was to obtain a diffraction-limited mosaic of images centered on the qso with a spicam on the apache-point Observatory (apo) on October 5 . subsequently, we obtained a diffraction-limited mosaic of math32 images, directed at the qso, with the noao 8k @ xmath318k mosaic camera (mosa, muller et al. 1998), on the Kitt-Ploak National Observatory (kpno) 4 m telescope on December 29 - 30. At this time, the seeing was math32, with a scale of math33 / pixel. On the math32 mosa image of 0 was observed on the 4 m telescope on January 29, 2003. llccccccccccc - 30  330 35 330   1 5039  70 530 - 0257035030 164520005500405650950  3707230030 3023113030517051150219107303205 2610 030203030206 2604601061022025320 710211391910075  19159220703210240  3057 1 04 16128 3356 205  40457520  21213 – 11 – 11 – 22 – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – ‘6 – 13 – ‘6’ – ‘30 –’– ‘31 – ‘35 – ‘19’ – ‘1 – ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘ – ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘ ‘5 ‘ – ‘3 ‘17 – ‘5 ‘ – ‘3 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘18’ – ‘5 ‘19’ – ‘5 ‘0’ – ‘5’ – ‘5 ‘5 ‘ ... 69 & 69 ... 0 ... 77 & 69 ... 05 ... 0 ... 74 & 0 ... 0766 & 15 ... 0 ... 0 ... 264 & 17 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... 0 ... ... 0 ... 0 ... 293 ... nw8 ... 0 ... nw8 ... 0 ... nw9 ... nw8 ... 66 ... 66 ... 57 ... 57 ... 67 ... 58 ... 67 ... 57 ... 58 ... 58 ... 0 ... 59 ... 67 ... 58 ... 58 ... 57 ... 57 ... 59 ... 68 ... 58 ... ... 2 + 30 & se2 & 06: 30 : 45 . 52 & 69 : 17 - 46 . - 79 - 0 . - 2 . - 2 . - 2 . - 2 . - 2 . - 3 . - 21 . - 7 . - 21 . - 1 . - 1 . - 20 . - 2 . - 19 . - 5 . n. & nw6 & nw6 - 29 - 35 . - 35 - tin & tin - 09 - tin - 18 . - 1 . - 19 . - 19 . - nw6 - nw6 - 29 - 35 . - o fxc - 5 - 28 - . - 29 - 28 . - 27 - 21 . 2 - 30 - nw5 - 29 - 35 - 59 - 59 - 97 - 0 - . - 18 . - 2 - 0 . - 19 . - 4 - 20 . “We computed the redshift for all the galaxy regions brighter than xmath45, which were at xmath45, and we computed the redshift at xmath44 . . . the redshift at xmath44 is calculated from the points of the high-resolution na @ xmath44 and h @ xmath44 absorption lines, and the redshift uncertainty was @ xmath4430 km s @ xmath44 . . . the galactic redshifts of the fainter, se13 and sw3, were observed in low density, using a xmath40 slit, which gives @ xmath44 at xmath44. for the fainter, se13 and sw3, fainter galaxies were observed in low dispersion, with a slit 1 at xmath40 which gives @ xmath42 at xmath43. The redshifts of the ne3 redshift were calculated from the centroids of the high resolution na @ xmath4roman1 and h @ xmath4roman2 h and k and the redshift uncertainty is @ xmath4430 km s @ xmath28. Observations of this kind are frequently performed in cosmological models of phenomena and reveal a dificult of cosmological structures, such as superclusters (Einasto et al. 2001 and his papers). In this section, we consider the abell clusters that are located close to the 0624, and in addition to the smaller, and close, galaxy groups (exp. sec.) , we give a discussion of these structures, in particular a cluster of abells (the cluster nearest the 0624) and also smaller, and close, galaxies (second). In this region, the density of abells is relatively high, compared to the density of the other clusters in the abell catalog: the number of abells in the 2@ xmath58 (the cluster closest to the 0624 axis) is two (a . 6) times larger than the average number of all abells in 2@ xmath58 (the cluster closest to the 0624 axis) times larger than the average number of all abells. In the cosmological simulations, clusters are formed at the nodes where the expected gaseous filaments join together, and to investigate the properties of these filaments. in this section we describe these structures, and describe the relationships between them, namely aquiline abells (see the sect: aquiline aquiline), and a close-by abell cluster (see the sect: close-by) . a description of the three clades in the table [tab] : red.547], in the second figure we can distinguish three different groups: two clades seem to be present at redshifts of the same abell clusters, i.e., at xmath63 (nine galaxies) and xmath64 (two galaxies) ; it is certain that the filament of the galaxies that connect a559 to a549 must extend west from a549, and the wire of galaxies that connect a552 and a554 must extend west to xmath64 (nine galaxies) to cross the qso-seeing line. We present here the following section, in which we draw some comments on specific galaxies and galaxies close to the qso-seeing line, which, according to colberg et al. (2005), more than 85 per cent of the clusters of the smallest size are connected with a filament. . We will see, later, in the section on galaxies with an asymmetrical redshift , that both absorption lines in the spectrum of 0624 and galaxies close to the qso-seeing line are revealed, which suggests that gaseous filaments are interwoven with the clusters. - Fig. - Abell 559 - 564 supercluster appears to extend from the northwest across the view line to the northeast. However, abell clusters are only visually seen, and it can be seen, from figures (fig. - field) and from fig. - Graziano, that is, the one closest to the sight line, a557 , it is possible that a557 is not a cluster, but rather a mixture of several groups in projection. - we note that the redshifts of the h=xmath43 systems (see, sec. - redshift) are not in the spectra of the galaxy, and compared with the redshifts of the l-xmath66 abell 559 and 564 (by means of a mathematical formula) - almost always located in a few hundred redshifts (compare table - spec - redshift) - as can be seen from the following table - table - lyalist - - is very similar to the results of previous studies (e.g. lanzetta et al. 1995; tripp et al. 1998; impey et al. 1999; chen et al. 2001; bowen et al. 2002; penton et al. 2002) Two or three galaxies can be seen in the filaments that feed into the clusters near 0624. These four galaxies are the only candidates, since photometric redshifts have extremely high uncertainty. In the case of the strong h at xmath4roman1 system at, the nearest visible galaxy to the redshift around that redshift is at xmath69 (ne3 in Table [Zagret Zone]]) . However, we cannot identify a more distant and fainter galaxy by using spectroscopic survey. In the following section, we will see that the strong h at xmath4roman1 system at is composed of a large number of components spread over 1000 . Therefore, we can hardly conclude that this absorption takes place in the great halo of this particular galaxy, but we note that three galaxies are found at xmath74 kpc . Moreover, we find no clear kinematics to indicate the existence of individual lines and individual galaxies in this complex. Using photometric redshifts (measured as described in chen et al., 2003) to measure the distance between the heavenly objects and the redshifts of xmath70, we find that the closest galaxies closer to the redshift have a large effect parameter kpc . I have measured the density and doppler parameters of the ly@xmath16 lines in the spectrum of 0624 with the Voigt Profile Decomposition software (see web. 1987.39 - vpfit.html ) .. we refer to the strongest ly@xmath16 absorption in the zone of xmath13 at xmath13 = 0 . The circle of xmath 13 , where a strong ly@xmath16 absorption can be seen, cf. at xmath13 = 0 , to avoid confusion with a galaxy, we will refer to this group of lines as a   complex '. 'This complex contains at least 13 ly@xmath16 components spread out over a velocity range of 1000 km s. You see, at the redshifts of the ly, n-do-xmath16 cluster, a pair of detonations. But it's full of white, and there's no evidence for n-do-xmath16 absorption. lccl & - & - xmath81 & - xmath83 & - xmath83 & - xmath83 - = - - - - - - - - - - = xmath81 - = xmath83 - - - - - - - - = -- - - - - - - - 5 - 5 - a + - - - - - - 0 - 0 - 0 - 207540 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 207540 - - - - - - - 5 - 150 - xmath84 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 5 @ xmath87 - 125 @ xmath8410 - 13 - 86 @ xmath841 - 008 - 0 - 0 - 00473 @ xmath841 - 0 - 0 - 054935 @ xmath842 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 054367 @ xmath841 - 0 - 005 - 5 - 5 @ xmath87 - 11 - 60 @ xmath8414 - 0 - 0 - 05474 @ xmath8411 - 273 - 1554 @ xmath8412 - 88 - 1552 - 1053 - 110 - 110 - 110 - 110 - 20 - 223290 @ xmath842 - 902 - 1052 - 1052 - 1062 - 123305 - 9 103 - 103 - 1082 - 25 - 7 - 0 . 10 - 30 - 10 - 0 - 0 -  102 - 30 30 - 21 - 552 - 80 -  1  5 - 0 - 18 & 17 @ xmath84 4 . 0 . . . 279771 @ xmath84 0 . 0 e- 5 @ xmath87 & 128 @ xmath84 7 & 13 . 63 e- 5 . . 0 . 05 & 30 @ xmath84 4 . 0 . . 0 . 0 . . 0 . 0 . . . b. . - 7 @ xmath87 & 101 @ xmath84 13 . 59 e- 5. - 5 @ xmath87 & 174 @ xmath84 13 . c. - xmath84 13 . - c. . b. b. b. - 5 @ xmath87 & 174 @ xmath84 13 . c. c. c. c. c. 231@ xmath84 1 . . 0 + 0 . xmath84 2 . . 0 + 0 . . . c#@ xmath84 0 . . . c#@ xmath84 0 . . . c#@ xmath84 0 . . . c#@ xmath84 2 . . 0 + 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The metal lines at the redshift have a distinctive two-part profile (see figures [fig] - civ064] and a profile shape that is in good agreement with that of the c - xmath4 and the c - xmath4 lines. The profile parameters of most of the lines in the xmath3 cluster are reasonably well strained. In some cases the component a is highly mixed and therefore more uncertain than the formal profile; these are indicated in table [tab] - lyalist. - But, the metal lines at this redshift have a distinctive two-part profile (see figure - syst0063] and [ - civ064] and the profile shape of the si - xmath4roman3 lines is in good agreement with the profile of the c - xmath4roman3 and the si - xmath4roman4 lines . . . this indicates that the si - xmath4roman3 does not form (in another) and at xmath13 = 0 . . . by the size of the radiance at xmath100 = 970, we derive an upper limit of xmath96 (h @ xmath4roman1 ) = xmath104 (upper black curve, in figure          ) [fig: lls                                               the sic2a spectrum does not show any compelling evidence of lyman -then-then; but the continuum is somewhat uncertain and so a small lyman -thenthennr could be observed . the subconditinence of the s/n of the sica is very low, but sufficed to constraining In the cloud the gas is ionized by the background of the quasars at xmath108. We calculated the intensity of the quasars at xmath108 with a normalized intensity of xmath109. in these models the ionization corrections and metallicities are based on the ionisation parameter @ xmath110 ( ionizing photon density / total hydrogen number density) and the overall metallicity, = log (@ xmath110 (xmath111) and 0 (@ xmath110) ). The energy of the gas is mainly ionized, and the implied metallicity is relatively high. We use the ionization field u and u and u u, which are defined in a detail in our study of the metallicity of these systems (si @ xmath110, si @ xmath110 and c _______). In the case of cloudy photosuncles (v96, ferland et al. 1998), we have obtained from the computed surface of the background uv from the quasars at xmath108, as discussed in a note —19 - v______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________ _______________ ___________, _____________, ________________, _____________, _________________, ______________, ______________________________________, ________________________, ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ For example, if the condensed velocity is reduced to the X-rays at X-rays (e.g., zabludoff & mulchaey1998), the diametrical cross-sections of these elliptical groups, e.g., zabludoff & mulchaey 1998, a diffuse x-ray emission is observed, which is characteristic of the warm medium of the sub-group. But, as we have already mentioned, the elliptical, spiral groups are much less dim in x-rays than spiral groups, but they could still contain hot sub-group gases, if the gas was slightly cooler (to a lower temperature) or much lower density than in elliptical, spiral groups (see below). Nevertheless, we argue that the majority of the gas in the sub-group is in the sub-group at x-meter840. “If we hold these dimensions together, it is at x-meter840 that the velocity of this sub-region is at x-meter840 , the velocity of this sub-region is approximately the same as this value, though somewhat more uncertain (because the scale of the redshifts is larger). , it is easy to hide a broad component of hot gas (see, e.g., figure 6 in Tripp & Savage 2000), and therefore the narrow component does not prevent the presence of hot gas, but it does indicate that there are many cool clouds in the intergroup medium. Moreover, the composition of the components favors cool, photoionized gas. Then, if the components of a metal line would form in gas in the collisional ionization equilibrium (cie), the cosmium (c c c c d l dnlist0064) would need to reach xmath84 (c c d e c v d xmath84) and at xmath89 (c d a d e ) - hence the Cosmium (c d e g) of the cie; therefore the cosmium, which is a Composition, should be divided between two Compositions (incl. cldnlist0064) and the Degrees (incl. * ; see table cldnlist0064), would need a gas temperature of xmath138 k (sutherland et al., 1993) , that is, the Cosmium (cldns) is also very narrow. In a complex-complexed ensemble it is easy to hide a broad component of hot gas (e.g., figure 6 in S. Savage, 2000) ; the narrow component does not prevent the presence of hot gas, but it does indicate that many cool clouds exist in the medium . It is the strong component at xmath143 kms, at xmath28, that is, greater than the weak component at xmath143 kms, at xmath28, which is more extensive (see figure [civ064]); but the Xmath96 (c @ xmath4roman4] / Xmath96 (c @ xmath4roman4] / xmath4roman4 / xmath4roman4 ratios, in a relative range between xmath144 and xmath28, we expect the ionisation mechanism and physical conditions to be similar in both components. The 3rd cloudy models obtained from the uv background are in full agreement with the measured si @ xmath4roman3 , si @ xmath4roman4 and c @ xmath4roman4 column density (and the upper limits of undetected species) at xmath13 = 0. stemoid> and [m/h] = @ xmath145 compared with the observed column density (big symbols) . We can see that the metal column density is in agreement (within the 1 @ xmath146 observations) with this model at log @ xmath148 . At the first wavelength of a Solar Emulsion, oh, o, o - o, o - h, o - o - xmath146 would require a gas temperature similar to that given by the collisional Equivalence Hypothesis. Then, in accordance with the Incomplete Negation Hypothesis, we obtain the conclusion that oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, a density is considered, and thus, to oh, oh, oh, at xmath146, is always more than oh, oh, in the schmutzler Equation, which we have examined. This non-equivalence conjecture has many other important implications, beyond the basic conclusion that the gas is photoionized. And as the cloudy model, for instance, indicates that the absorber has a relatively high metallicity of XM@141, even though there have been no luminous galaxies within XM@151. for a similar metallicity of o @ xM@141 at this temperature is always higher than our higher limit (@ xM@141  a degree higher in the shapiro model) . . . by adding the more conservative upper limit of XM@143 ( h@ xM@141) to the absence of the lyman limit (  h@ xM@141) , see figure 1 I will consider the limits of certain physical variables, such as the size of the electrodes (the length of the passage through the absorbing region) and the thermal pressure (see caveats 5 and 6 of tripp et al.). .. When we are using the steeper background (e.g. madau, haardt, rees, 1999) the measurements are still in keeping with the cloudy model for a lower metallicity of - m / h = xmath155 and a higher ionisation parameter log - xmath 160. In this way we find the value of - m / h = xmath160 at the 2 xmath146 confidence level. The maximum xmath156 obtained at xmath145 and log - xmath160 , we calculated the '' at xmath156 and log - xmath156, where xmath96 denotes column density, and the sum is over the three ions si - xmath4roman3 , si - xmath4roman3 , si - xmath4roman4 , c - xmath4roman4 . Figure 7 - Absorbed Size - confidence intervals for the absorption diameter @ 2 - xmath 160 . In the case of cloudy formation, a steeper cloudy formation is assumed, resulting in a pressure less than a factor one. In addition, the pressures predicted by this low pressure are found in some theoretical models of galactic halos (wolfire et al. ) ., and thus, a similar pressure is predicted for civil hvcs surrounding the milky way - and thus, in fact, sembach et al. (1996) , whose diameter is  math_13, bl -c.5 and bl -cm., s. and s. 914, etc.) The range of pressures in the contours, in order of magnitude, is several orders of magnitude lower than the gas pressure measured in the disk of the milky way (see jenkins and tripp 2001), and even lower than the pressures measured in the milky way halo (e.g., wakker, oosterloo, pawnloo and putman 2002; fox et al. (1996), although, though, in some theoretical models of galactic halos (wolfire et al. ‘‘Eight tons of carbon can be found on the X-ray of the ray from the gas of x-rays – x-rays, namely – in which, and are the fractions of –x-ray and – -ray – -rays of x-rays – ‘eight tons’ of x-rays, from the y-ray of x-rays and x-rays of x-rays of the gas of a particular star, with a third star (now, at x-rays – ti = 266) having a different band of unrelated elements extending beyond the expected wavelength of the doublet of x-rays – and these lines might obscure a weak o-ray of x-rays . . . but this is still rather high in metallicity, even though the luminous star has been observed at the horizon (the nearest galaxy is nw3 at x-rays – see table – spec – red –) . . . But we can apply to this lower limit the mineral and tin content of the tin and tin, respectively, and to the alloy itself. In this example, the maximum is not seen, as is Fig. – Cloudy M., because it occurs at a higher value of x-rays than is indicated. 682 & 27 @ xmath84 4 & l, z, z, z, z , z, z, z, z, z , z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, y, and z, in x , z, s, e, a x - x - see e, y, our astronomy survey has also revealed four galaxies in x -v, a535, a552 and a562 represent that a large - - string, a - supercluster, in the x - e, b, and -, -*. - * - e, b - x-m, c, c, d - x-m, e, d - s. - - 2 - 2 - d - d - e - e, - 1550 - To my mind, are we to expect ly   14lines which arise from hot gases? Richter et al. (2004, 2005) and Sembach et al. (2004) have recently identified a number of ly  14 lines (blas) with  181 40 km s   22 in the spectra of several low   24S  24s in the spectra of some low  24s (pg 1116 + 215, pg 1259 + 593, and h1821 + 643 ) based on simulations, richter et al. (2005) and williger et al. (2005) find that some of the 25282262brs are not exclusively thermally enlarged, but are rather coloured by an interplay of blends that are difficult to see at the 25n given by a typical stis echelle spectra. , besides, richter et al. (2005) finds that about 50 per cent of the 25brs are mainly thermally enlarged, and some of the high 25ns in the above studies are extraordinarily smooth and broad, and seem to be entirely consistent with a gaussian (see, e.g., Figures 4 and 5 in Richter et al. 2005). bowen et al. (2002) also have found some 25brs based on slightly lower data. , the solid line indicates - xmath83 vs - xmath96 (xmath96) for a gaussian line with central optical depth - 0 . - . this is a threshold; any line with a combination to the left of this line is not likely to be detected . . . in figure [fig] the minimum value of xmath64 (as a function of xmath64) is calculated according to the hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of dav et al. . . from these hydrodynamic cosmological simulations by dav et al., we see the distribution of ly @ xmath64 ( s. . ) which we obtained from the 0624 view from the line in question appears to be generally similar to those obtained by sembach et al. ( 2004) and richter et al. . . . sembach et al. and richter et al. , both of which are found to have considerably different line parameters, for a gaussian line with central depth = . . . Now, we know that the 1823 line is half a wavelength, and so it is not a full wavelength, but it is one wavelength that contains a broad cross-section of cation; and so, if we use this technique, it would be better to reject the 10 cations (see table (the three lines in the yellow color)), so the remaining 11 cations would imply a redshift of 923 @ xmath191 [0], and then we find 921 905] 703 [219], and so on to 901 [219], and 904] [191]. With the addition of the equations 1 and 5, 606 of Sembach et al. (2004) and richter et al. (2005) , we find that our sample implyes the baryonic content of 893[219] = 0 (i.e., @ 913[219]] . , this is somewhat larger than the results of sembach et al. The aforementioned thermal broadening mechanisms have enormous, yet extremely difficult to study. The Galapagos’ and the absorption systems of the orbit of 0624, particularly the galaxy and the ly » xmath1 complex, have some interesting and perhaps surprising implications. What are the implications of these measurements for broader questions of galaxy evolution and cosmology? The galaxies and absorption systems of the orbit of 0624, especially the galaxies and the ly » xmath1 complex, and the galaxy group and the ly » complex in xmath75, have some interesting and perhaps surprising implications for these questions, which we now discuss. The radiating process, which takes the gas (e.g. accretion) and removes it from galaxies (e.g., the winds, the dynamical stripping), can have profound effects on the evolution of galaxies, and the reflection' of matter and energy from galaxies into the igm is now believed to play an important role in shaping the structures that afterwards grow out of the igm (Wu , m., 2005) are also highly interesting, and perhaps unexpected, to the conclusions of this work. Henshar and Johnston, & Jones, & Reimer, & St. Petersburg, p. 139)—that is, the whole of the 10 galaxies we have found in this group. The largest of these galaxies are bowed, and the ne3, s13, and s5 galaxies, which look as though they were early bowed galaxies, show colours and magnitudes that are based on the red-gold sequence (as is well known, bower, lucey, & ellis 1992, mcintosh et al. 2005), and that these galaxies are likely bowed (the other seven bowed galaxies have blue-blue colors characteristic of late bowed) . Despite whether the group is bowed or not, it is surprising that we have seen so many cool, photoionised clouds in the subgroup (as shown by figure Xmath45). The spherical and spirally composed masses are much more similar than the spirally rich masses ( mulchaey et al. 1996; zabludoff & mulchaey 1998). Among the clusters of ethereal rocky outcrops, bower, lucey, and ellis (see mcintosh et al., 2005); these are s0s (as indicated by the other 7 galaxies, with the blue color characteristic of late types). In fact, the node of the galaxy and the ly @ xmath16 clouds along the line of the line of the line would give the false impression that this group was bound, virialised. However, in the simulations of large-scale filaments whim gas is likely to be widespread at the present time, even in the most modestly dense regions (see, e.g., Fig. 4 in Cen et al. 1999b) so it is interesting that we see a large number of cool clouds at xmath12. These ly @ xmath16 lines, as well as the ly @ xmath16 lines at xmath196 059 toward pks2155 304 (shull, tumlinson, giroux 2003), or the ly @ xmath16 lines at xmath196 059 toward h1821 + 643 (trph et al., 2006). But unlike the 0624 ly @ xmath16 complex, both the pks2155 304 and h1821 + 643 nsm both have evidence of warm-to-warm intergroup gas. Alternatively, the axis of our gaze crosses the long axis of a large-scale filamentary structure in the cosmic web. In this case, the projection of the galaxies and ly @ xmath16 clouds can give a false impression of a group in which hot gas would be expected. For instance, in the direction of ngc3783, the Galactic high-speed cloud (hvc) is at xmath197 , it is now recognized that the hvc is tidally stripped from the smc. This tidally stripped material shows a broad range of absorption lines, but there are little or no absorption lines for this tidally stripped material (lu et al. 1994; Sémbach et al. 2004) and this may not be in keeping with the absorption lines that we have observed in our study. More likely explanations are that the high-metallic gas, as we have shown in absorption, has been tidally stripped from one of the nearby galaxies. This galaxie is also a plausible source of tidally stripped matter. one of the nearby galaxies, se, has a distorted spiral-shaped shape. Besides, the tidally stripped material shows a wide array of low- and high-ionization absorption lines, but there is no high-ionization absorption (lu et al. 1994; Sembach et al. 2004). “The most notable group of galaxies that we have seen in our galaxy redshift survey is at xmath12, and not in the vicinity of an abell cluster, for which no spectroscopic redshift has been found, a557, which has been found largely by the galaxy group at xmath12 . The first and the strongest systems in this ly – xmath16 complex are in the galaxy groups of xmath199 and . the most dramatic ly – xmath16 absorption is especially striking: at this redshift we find 13 ly – xmath16 lines, spanning the range of 1000 km s – xmath28 and a line-of-sight dispersion of two hundred km s – xmath28. This is rather surprising because we study the gas in large-scale intergalactic filaments. The two most striking ly – xmath16 absorption systems at – 198 emerge in galaxy groups at – 199 and – – . At – 199, we see a gaseous component in this – ly – xmath16 complex, and there is high metallicity in the gaseous component, – m – h – m – h – h – – – r-c – a – well-doing of the cosmic web – we notice – om – – om – om, – om, – om – om – om – om – o This assumes that we are looking at a large-scale cosmic web along its long axis. We find the galaxies and the dense ligands at xmath19, which are disposed at xmath20, which are probably tidally stripped. This origin of the ligands can explain the high metal content and the absence of hot gas. We have compared the distribution of ly at xmath16 doppler parameters and the density of h at xmath198 columns to high-resolution measurements of other lines, and found good agreement. sent> is at xmath201 kpc. it seems more likely that in this case we are viewing a large cosmic web, and along its long axis, we have seen an extensive variety of early and late galaxies and many cool, photoionized clouds. these are probably extremely thin layers, which could explain the high metallicity and the lack of hot gas. The baryonic content of these broad 200 25 absorbers is still very uncertain and requires confirmation from higher s/n data, but it is probable that some of these broad 25 absorbers are formed in warm - hot gas and contain a substantial part of the baryons in the surrounding universe. . . . we look forward to comparisons of these observations to the infrared, and look forward to the comparisons with our cosmological simulations. – nn-astrophysics grant nn-astrophysics – nn-astrophysics grant nn-astrophysics – nn-astrophysics grant nn-astrophysics – et al. this research was conducted by the Pi Team of the Nasa-cnes-csa Project, which is run by the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology, under contract with Nasa.
