(see below). Galled trees, galled networks, reticulation visible networks are three of the most popular classes of phylogenetic networks that have been introduced for the combinatorial and algorithmic approaches of phylogenetics ( wang et al. 2001, gusfield et al. 2004; huson and kloepper 2007; huson et al. 2011) . (At least in the past two decades, phylogenetic networks have been spotted in modelling and displaying the reticulation of living organisms.) In the past two decades, phylogenetic networks have often been seen for the modeling and visualization of reticulation processes (gusfield 2014; huson et al. 2011). In general, it is well known that the number of internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree with xmath0 leaves is xmath2 (this is not to say that a regular phylogenetic tree with xmath0 leaves has xmath5 nodes at most. Besides, the arbitrary network with two leaves can have as many internal nodes as possible. For example, a tree with xmath0 leaves has xmath2 nodes at most. a regular network with xmath0 leaves has xmath5 nodes (that is, when comparing with the arbitrary network with two leaves) has xmath5 nodes at most (Francis and Steel 2015) . the x-maths in a pyramid are relatively invariable, and our experiment was conducted on the ground in the neighborhood of the dykes. In the section 'sect' a certain notion or series of ideas is introduced, such as are necessary for our study. In this section 'sect' a word is added introducing the concepts and notation necessary for our study. In the following section 'sect' a means is given for establishing the x-maths in pyramids. 'sect' a means of leading a node out of a node; it is called an incoming node of a node; a node of a node is a head and tail of the node. In the case of xmath11, let Xmath8 and Xmath9 be two nodes in xmath9. Let Xmath9 be an acyclic graph, and let Xmath8 and Xmath9 be two nodes in xmath10 . Note that in an acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic acyclic a phylogenetic network, if it does not contain reticulation nodes, is simply a phylogenetic tree. For a phylogenetic network without reticulation nodes, a node is called a tree node if it is either the root or the node with indegree one; it is called a reticulation node if its indegree is greater than one . a phylogenetic network without reticulation nodes is simply a phylogenetic tree. for two nodes in xmath35, if @ xmath35 is the parent of xmath9, if @ xmath9 is the child of xmath9 , if @ xmath9 is a 'parent' of xmath9, and if @ xmath9 is a 'child' of xmath9 , if @ xmath9 is the parent of xmath9 and if @ xmath9 is a 'child' of xmath9 , note that leaves are trees and that a tree node may have both indegree and outdegree. - For each step from the root of the network, one must pass through the Node, which is visible, and so the Node, which is visible, is visible to the Node, which is visible to the Node, the Presence of the Shadow (subnetwork). for each Path from the Root to the Head (the Dong) we say a reticulate Node, Visible, with respect to a leaf in the Network. In the rest of the paper, the Connected network is merely called a Network and the Petition Tree is a Petition. We say that a node, the One visible (or the Unusual) is Visible with respect to the Head (Fig. 1). For every Path from the Root to the Head, it passes through the Path. Therefore, at least a Node is Visible in @xmath42 if it is Visible. Then a Node, Visible (Or Unusual), is Visible (or stable) with respect to the Head (Fig. 2), and so is Visible for all the Leaves in the Network. In the rest of this work, a Binaristic Regression is called a Network and a Tree is a Tree. Here, we are concerned with the size of a Binary Phylogenetic Network. It is thus that the edifices mentioned above – the network in which every node has a visible child – are [448] tree-based. Tree-based networks are, however, another interesting class of networks which has recently been introduced by francis and steel – a network whose leaf, having the same leaves, can be obtained from a tree whose leaves are the same. If any one of the nodes in the node xmath53 is a parent of xmath54 such that either (a) xmath53 is below another node in xmath55, or (b) there is a path from xmath54 to xmath54 that avoids xmath8 , then there exists a path from xmath56 to xmath54 that avoids xmath8 for each node in the node xmath54. (f). ' stable-child' networks are networks in which every node has a visible child . . . but almost-stable networks and stable-child networks are not necessarily tree-based. – Next, we present an alternative proof, to show our approach. By taking a reticulation visible network with a reticulation mark on it, we have at the top of it, by making it visible, with a mark on it: a marked-up tree with the same root and leaves as a mark on it (see Fig. 3). On the other hand, there are as many as a mark on it, as indicated in Fig. 3 – FIG. 3 – xmath72 below xmath64 for xmath65, and (iii) the node whose root is xmath66 has a parent xmath66, so that there is a mark on xmath72 from xmath66 to xmath71, and this mark on xmath72 avoids xmath8 – interestingly, Xmath2 is the strong lower bound, which was independently proved by bordewich and semple (2015) in a direct induction method. if xmath78 is of the second degree, Xmath78 goes through xmath28 and ends at the third degree. if xmath28 is of the second degree, Xmath78 is simply the open edge that enters xmath56. Note that xmath80. , the following statements have been cited in gambette et al. (2015, p. 210). . Each of the cross edges math47 is called a cross edge if ,xmath82 and ,83, math85; .3>, which are not a cross edge. . The facts in this proposition are given in the proof of theorem 1 in gambette et al. (2015, p. 235) . . . there is no one of the cross edges math78 in the same trivial path in .. [5] Note that xmath79 . . . for each cross edge   79, such that =82, =83, =90, =9 is between =8 and =9 in =93 . . . for a cross edge =47 such that =82, =83, and =9 =9, we say =7 = =90 and = =90 . , if the cross edge does not enter a trivial path, the weight of that trivial path is set to 0 . . . by the law of "stable" [30] the weight of a trivial path is at most two . . . - the cross edge at xmath105 is bounded by xmath105, and the non-cross edge at xmath105 crosses over xmath105 for xmath108. - - the node at xmath110 is below xmath111, and the node at xmath110 is below xmath113 . ( c . ) - the node at xmath110 is below xmath110, and the node at xmath114 is below xmath115 . ( fig 2 ) the node at xmath110 is below xmath110, and xmath114 is below xmath115 . ‘I’ll give you an example of @xmath118 and @xmath119.’ And then, take @xmath119 and @xmath119 . . . so if @xmath114 were in the path of @xmath134, it would mean that if @xmath112 were not below it, then @xmath112 would not pass under @xmath111, and so on. So, by lemma . . . we will say that there is no cross-edge into @xmath112 for a node at xmath126, and a descendant @ xmath112 of @ xmath112 at xmath112 in xmath113 . . . so we will prove that @xmath118 does not pass through @xmath119 . . . then a cross-edge @ xmath129 enters @xmath130 and a non-cross-edge @ xmath131 jumps over @ xmath130 for each @xmath132 . . . In the tree of xmath113 we have proved that xmath110 is not between xmath103 and xmath112 in the tree of xmath113 . as xmath137 is not below xmath112, by symmetry Xmath114 is not between xmath103 and xmath115 in xmath134 . by symmetry Xmath114 is not between xmath103 and xmath115 in xmath134 . so , if xmath111 is below xmath112 in xmath128 , if xmath136 is not in xmath112 , Xmath136 is avoiding xmath112 . , then Xmath110 and Xmath114 are both not in Xmath138 , then either xmath111 or xmath139 is between xmath45 and xmath114 , which contradicts that xmath45 is the lowest reticulation node in xmath113 . . . . so . . . if xmath110 or xmath114 is in xmath78, the lowest reticulation in xmath78 is not visible, a contradiction. So . . . if xmath110 or xmath114 are in xmath78, then the lowest reticulation in xmath78 is not visible, a contradiction. Therefore , if xmath114 or xmath114 are in xmath78, then the lowest reticulation in xmath78 is not visible, a contradiction. . . . Note that every single trivial path other than xmath78 starts with a node in xmath150. Then , if xmath148 is not between xmath103 and xmath141, as was proved above. This is a contradiction . . . so, either xmath134 or xmath113 is less than 2 . When @ xmath147 has been substituted for @ xmath169, there is a double zero in @ xmath164, and nodes in @ xmath164 are mapped to different nodes in @ xmath165. - (@ xmath17) - a sphere of reticulation with nodes @ xmath169, where the first inequality is derived from the substitution of @ xmath168 for @ xmath169. -     leq & 2 ( | v - 1 , v - 2 , v - 3 , v - 4 )        v - 4 , v - 4 -   , v - 4 -  -   , v - 4        , v - 1 , v - 1 , v - 4 , v - 4 :   -       -   - , v - 4   -  -  -  -   -    -  -     - Xmath67 is a reticulation network, and by the law of steady i.e. 1 we can show that Xmath79 contains exactly one incoming edge for each reticulation node, and b) xmath49 is a subtree with the same leaves as xmath67 . if xmath79 contains only the open edge entering xmath73, there is no edge in xmath79 that is in xmath79 . . . we prove the result by showing that xmath49 does not contain any non-cross edges and only one cross-edge can end at a node in xmath90 for xmath145 . if xmath79 only contains the open edge entering xmath73, there is no edge in xmath79 that enters xmath79 . . . . if xmath79 contains only the open edge entering xmath73, then there is no edge in xmath79 that enters xmath79 . . . After all, we have shown that there is no edge in @xmath49 that is not in @xmath49. As the node in @xmath27 is a reticulation node, there exist two paths between @xmath178 and @xmath179 in the tree @xmath49 such that (i) they are internally disjointed and (ii) @xmath178 is the only node in them . (Excuse me, that is not the case) as if the node in @xmath181 were in . . . the reticulation node in . . . (But if a node in . . . . is in . . . . then the node . . . must be a non-cross node, and if xmath186 were to be below . . . then . . . (but otherwise it is not visible . . . .). This, as a matter of fact, is impossible, since the reticulation node . . . is in . . . if @ xmath190 contains an edge in @ xmath49 other than @ xmath93, then it must pass through @ xmath111, a contradiction. This is a contradiction . . . if @ xmath190 contains an edge in @ xmath49 other than @ xmath93, the head of the edge is a reticulation node, and is therefore visible in either @ xmath79 or @ xmath79. . . . . So , if @ xmath79 contains more than one edge in @ xmath79, it must pass through @ xmath111, a contradiction. if @ xmath79 contains more than one edge in @ xmath79, it must pass through @ xmath139, a contradiction . . . in fact, there are more than one edge in @ xmath79 whose head is in each trivial path in @ xmath79, which is @ xmath145. . . . So, in this section, we will indicate the number of reticulations in a nearly stable network. It has nine reticulations (sub-circles) that are not visible in @xmath27. And in the xmath42, we will see the reticulation visible network xmath42. That is, we will replace the nodes of degree 2 in @xmath42 with the same orientation. Suppose that @ xmath42 is a subdivision of a binary reticulation visible network. Let the dashed paths in @xmath42 be cross and non-cross paths, which are removed to create a subtree with the same leaves as @xmath27. [4]  [5] We will see that the edges of @ xmath42 are a set of arithmetic edge. Suppose that @ xmath49 is an empty path, with four leaves. [5] Let the [6] and the ((7] [8] be the two cases that are examined in the proof of part (c) of the lemma [8]: a non-cross path from @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 is the tree node @ xmath194 of @ xmath27, and it contains the reticulation node @ xmath194 of @ xmath27 [7] [8] . I imply that there is a cyclic relationship between xmath197 and xmath204. . . . And (ii) if xmath19 is a cyclic relationship between xmath177 and xmath204, and (iii) if xmath19 is a cyclic relationship between xmath17 and xmath19, such that xmath89 is between xmath17 and xmath19, and (iv) if xmath19 is a cyclic relationship between xmath19 and xmath19, and if xmath19 is a cyclical relationship between xmath17 and xmath19, then xmath19 and xmath198 are only edges in xmath19. . . . let xmath199 be a nearly stable network and let xmath49, xmath42, xmath128 and xmath197 be defined. . . . *)* if there are two or more internal nodes in a path in xmath197, then by a b, they are consecutive and not visible in xmath27, contradicting that xmath27 is nearly stable.  c)* if there are two or more internal nodes in a path in xmath197, by a b they are not simultaneous and not visible in xmath27, which is in counter to the fact that xmath27 is almost unavoidable . . . let xmath36 be a non-cross path between xmath8 and xmath9, where xmath8 and xmath9 are in some path at xmath90 in xmath19. . . . note that Xmath204 is a sub-path of xmath90 and is in itself indiscriminate from xmath36. . . . so Xmath89 must be the unique internal node of xmath206 . . . say, if there are two or more internal nodes in a path in xmath19 it is (a) that they are consecutive and do not show up in xmath198, contradicting the fact that xmath19 is almost unfavorable . . . Xmath47 says that Xmath26 is not a path in Xmath47, and therefore is not a path in Xmath47 , whereas Xmath47 is a curve. Xmath47 says that Xmath49 is a trapezium and not visible in Xmath47 , so Xmath47 is a node in Xmath47 . That Xmath194 and Xmath27 are both not visible in Xmath47, , is contradicted by the fact that Xmath47 is nearly stable. Then Xmath47 is a node in Xmath47 . . . if Xmath47 is below xmath47, then Xmath218 is a path that does not pass through xmath47 in Xmath47 . so Xmath47 is not visible . . . note that xmath21 and xmath214 are derived from a network leaf in Xmath47. (or, by (a)) , xmath194 and xmath127 are both not visible) . . . therefore Xmath47 is not visible . . . " xmath 177" is the cross path from xmath 177 to xmath 177. Xmath 177 is the reticulation node in xmath 177. . . . if a trivial path does not contain an end of the cross paths in xmath 197, its weight is set to 0 . if a trivial path does not contain any end node of the cross paths in xmath 197, its weight is set to 0 . . . as we said in . . . stable , if a trivial path does not contain any end node of the cross paths in xmath197, its weight is set to 0 . , in a close network, any reticulation node is a child of a visible reticulation node. . . . - i - i - the path from xmath110 to xmath115 is a cross-path from xmath113 to xmath134 - solid arrows and curves represent the edges and paths in xmath113, while square dot arrows and curves represent the absent edges and paths . . . xmath110 is a cross-path between xmath103 and xmath115, where xmath110 is in xmath134 . . . [1] . . . . [2] 1  (a) the tree path xmath237 consists of either one edge or two edges in xmath130. The path from math110 to math115 is a cross-path between math140 and math235 . . . In order to give the proper view of the situation, let us assume that there is a cross-path @ xmath240 between @ xmath103 and @ xmath115 in xmath134 (figure 4.4 a) and let us suppose that @ xmath232 is a node between @ xmath133 and @ xmath134. As @ xmath133 is nearly stable, there is only one node in xmath251 as there is no visibility of the internal node. c) suppose that xmath233 contains an internal node that is a divergence node in xmath27. Suppose that xmath232 is a leaf in xmath137 . . . Note that Xmath142 is a leaf in xmath136 . . . Then let @ xmath278 be the edge removed from @ xmath230 in the process of making @ xmath42 into @ xmath42. If @ xmath113 has a node @ xmath231 between @ xmath103 and @ xmath112 in @ xmath133, then @ xmath278 is either below @ xmath113 or the path from @ xmath73 to @ xmath64 avoids @ xmath103. If @ xmath113 contains a node @ xmath231 between @ xmath103 and @ xmath112 in @ xmath27, then @ xmath253 must not be an edge in @ xmath27 . since the reticulation nodes @ xmath257 are below @ xmath103 and satisfy the condition in lemma , there is a path from @ xmath73 to @ xmath41 which avoids @ xmath103 . _a  if _a  _ii 245 _a _a  if _a  a , _a _xmathii  - if _a  xmathii is the child of _hii in _iii , it is trivial. In _iii  - if __alpha -i , _239 , _ , __ , _385 - if __xmathii 1 - where _m239 is the child of _hiii_1229 , this is trivial. The path from _[1] to _115 is the cross-path which begins at the node in a trivial path that departs from _109. _10 if _iii, _i] from _iii and [2] from _ - . _i] if _ 2 is the child of _[2] in _113. _ii [4] for an internal node @ xmath103 of degree - 3 which __265 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . “Q”) is, “if the cross path from Xmath110 ends at a node in Xmath115, where Xmath115 is in Xmath134. Thus, if there is no cross path from Xmath110 to Xmath115, by eqn. ( weight = 2), then Xmath110 has two reticulation parents (see fig. 6 ) . . . if there is no cross path from Xmath110 to Xmath115, then by eqn. (weight = = ) , then Xmath110 has a reticulation parent (see fig. 6 ) (see fig. 6 ) . . . . if there is no cross path from Xmath110 to Xmath115, then by eqn. (weight = = ) , Xmath115 has two reticulation parents (see fig. 6 ) . if a non-cross edge is jumping over xmath279 (Figure 6 e) , then xmath279 is only the child of xmath103, or a tree node xmath238 between xmath103 and xmath234 in xmath130, so xmath265 . Similarly, xmath236 . . . if xmath240 has an internal node that is a reticulation, c . . . , if xmath240 has an internal node that is a reticulation, then c . . . . if there is a non-cross edge jumping over xmath263 , then by c . . . by lemma . . . . . . that xmath263 is either below xmath263 or there is a path from xmath73 to xmath140 that does not pass through xmath103 . . . So , xmath263 . . . Assuming that @ xmath267 is the starting point of @ xmath116 and a parent of @ xmath233, @ xmath287 is the parent of @ xmath288. Assume that @ xmath289 is a parent of @ xmath288 in the trivial path of @ xmath285 , we will say that @ xmath288 is not visible , @ xmath288 is not visible , we will say that there is no edge at the cross path of @ xmath272 and there is a boundary in @ xmath287. To this we will say that @ xmath289 is the edge that is removed from @ xmath288 in the first stage , let the Xmath290 be the parent of @ xmath288 in the first stage , if @ xmath289 is a boundary, then the boundary will be a tree in @ xmath27 . if @ xmath291 is a boundary, then if @ xmath291 is below @ xmath204, it must be below @ xmath112 . We can assume that there are no nodes between @ xmath267 and @ xmath287 in xmath27 . Assuming that the path @ xmath285 and @ xmath284 are two consecutive nodes and cannot be distinguished, we conclude that @ xmath285 and @ xmath285 are two consecutive nodes and cannot be distinguished, it is evident that @ xmath286 is not beneath @ xmath288 or @ xmath112 . Thus, @ xmath268 is not visible. Thus, @ xmath204 is not visible. Taken together, if @ xmath234 is not beneath @ xmath288 or if there is a path from @ xmath73 to @ xmath140 that avoids @ xmath204 . . . (see fig. b). After verifying that the path from @ xmath285 is really an edge @ xmath284, we now prove that @ xmath269 is almost stable . . . . so, @ xmath204 must not be visible . . . To a tree path (not below xmath2) of any level below xmath267. For any leaf under xmath267, the tree path of xmath136 is not open in xmath267. So , xmath267 is not open. It is true that Xmath27 is an acyclic network. From xmath89 to xmath177 there is no cross-path from xmath299 to xmath177, such that @ xmath300 and xmath301 for xmath145. (*a *) xmath110 is an internal node in xmath116 . (a) if xmath270 is a relative of any degree in xmath128, then xmath103 is an ancestor of any degree of 3 or more . . . therefore , xmath267 is not visible. (b) if xmath134 and xmath113 are two of the same weight, and if xmath279 is the start node of the cross path at xmath302 which enters xmath106 for xmath303, then either xmath110 or xmath114 is a node in xmath78. So, let @ xmath265 be a nearly stable network, leaving off xmath0. (fig. 7 ). (c) and d) Let @ xmath150 denote the set of internal nodes of degree 3 in @ xmath128; and let @ xmath259 be the start node of the trivial path of @ xmath160 that enters into @ xmath9. * * *** Here, let @ xmath152 be the set of internal nodes of degree 3 in @ xmath128; and let @ xmath150 denote the set of internal nodes of degree 3 in @ xmath128; and if @ xmath152 is in xmath152, then we define @ xmath158 as the start node of the trivial path which enters into @ xmath128. - d_b_; and b_c_; and the two nodes in d_b__________________________ are not mutually coincident. The stable-child network shown in Fig. , a has more than math3 reticulation nodes. In this section we will prove that a stable-child network can have as many as math3 reticulation nodes . * d____ ) at xmath47 each parent has a common parent . . . . . . if a reticulation node is not visible: (b) b) xmath44 has a parent Xmath320 and a sibling Xmath55 under xmath320, such that xmath55 and xmath4 share a common parent . . . if it is not visible: (b) b, (c) , if it is not visible: (b) b, (c) , if it is not visible: if it is not visible: (c) b, c, d, c. There is a good reason why a reticulation node does not have an outgoing edge, and (ii) when the outgoing edge is a visible outward node, the reticulation node is a reticulation node. As a result, a reticulation node has an incoming edge, as a result, @ xmath49 has the same leaves as @ xmath27. Note that a reticulation node is only disposed in the direction of a tree, and that for any tree node of @ xmath 103 the outside edge is the reticulation node of Xmath. Therefore, the reticulation node of Xmath 45 the edge is 'hidden' if the head is a visible reticulation node, but the opposite edge is 'hidden' if it is a concealed edge. Similarly, if it is not found at the moment, then we choose a removal of Xmath50. For this we only remove the incoming edge of a reticulation node, and do not remove the incoming edge of any tree node, so the network of Xmath50 is connected. This means that a hidden sc-edge is removed only if the head is a visible reticulation node, and if the sc-edge is removed at the same time, the corresponding sc-edge jumps over the sc-edge that is removed at the same time. Suppose that, in principle, there are two internal disjointed paths in xmath293, Xmath324 in xmath293, so that their inner nodes are all of two degree two. It is impossible to assume that Xmath293, Xmath324 is the same as xmath177. Suppose, however, that xmath293, Xmath324 is the same as xmath177. In xmath293, if neither xmath293, nor xmath324 is a single edge, then the two children of xmath8 in xmath293, in xmath334, are not visible, contradicting the fact that xmath27 is a stable and child network. according to the three rules which we have formulated for removing the edges in xmath49, if an incoming edge is removed, its child in xmath50 is visible in xmath27, this means that the path in xmath27 does not consist of two or more degree 2 nodes that are not visible in xmath27 . Hence, either xmath259 or xmath324 is a single edge from xmath8 and xmath9 . . . without putting a general conclusion, we may enlarge on the assumption that xmath324 is equal to xmath177 . ‘eight’ and ‘eight’ (‘a) are precisely the continuation of the fact (a) and ‘b’ (‘c) in the second part of the lemma (ns. 2). Let ‘eight’ be a path in ‘eight’. As in the second part of the lemma (ns. 2), we have @ xmath328 denote the trivial paths in ‘eight’, where @ xmath78 denotes the trivial paths that start at ‘eight’. – Let ‘eight’ be a path in ‘eight’. – Let ‘eight’ be a path between the start node of ‘eight’ and ‘eight’ at the end of ‘eight’ at ’eight’. ‘Eight’ means that ‘eight’ is simply an edge. ‘Eight’ is simply an edge . . . . . so that , if the sc-edge xmath332 was omitted from xmath332 to obtain xmath42 from xmath332 , then a strip of xmath332 was removed from xmath332 to obtain xmath42 from xmath332 . . . if there is no cross-path from xmath337 into xmath319, then the weight of xmath335 is set to 0 . . . . Let xmath337 begin at a node in xmath89 . . . if neither xmath330 nor xmath36 is a single edge, then the two children of xmath89 in xmath36 and xmath331 are not visible, contradicting that xmath27 is stable. . . . if Xmath270 is the starting node of Xmath115 and Xmath268, then Xmath345 . . . if Xmath270 is an edge, then Xmath350 and Xmath351. . . . note that xmath345 . . . if Xmath275 is an edge, then Xmath350 . . . if Xmath350 is an edge, then Xmath350 . . . if Xmath275 is an edge, then Xmath350 . . . and if xmath349 is an edge, then xmath349 . . . . . . . . So , by eqn. ( sc. 2 ), Xmath347 . . . if Xmath270 is an edge, then Xmath350 and Xmath349 . . . so , by eqn. ( sc. 2) , Xmath347 . . . . . . . if there is a node between xmath103 and xmath304 in xmath360, then the two children of xmath103 are not visible in xmath27, contradicting the fact that xmath27 is stable-child. so xmath103 is the parent of either xmath115 or xmath112 , then xmath110 is in xmath108 .  If xmath110, by  a , the weights of xmath134 and xmath113 are not zero , then Xmath302 is a crossroad, ending at a node xmath304 in xmath106 and beginning at xmath279 in a trivial path different from xmath106 for each xmath357 . . . if xmath358 and xmath305 are separated by a crossroad, then Xmath357 and Xmath268 are separate. We assert that @ xmath103 and all the internal nodes in @ xmath371 are not visible. This, in contrast, will confirm that @ xmath103 is not a reticulation. By the fact that @ xmath336, and also in @ xmath338, is a reticulation , xmath366 or xmath336, is an edge. So xmath336, or xmath369, is an edge. . . . since xmath336 is not a reticulation, the proof in (a) and (b) of sc- 2 confirms that @ xmath336 is not visible. Therefore, xmath366 or xmath367 is an edge . . . it is impossible. . . . . if xmath110 is not visible in xmath336, then xmath368 is an edge, and thus xmath369 . . . if xmath114 is in xmath332, then xmath330 is an edge. , it is the xmath180 crossing over xmath112, and is not the cross-road of xmath110. If xmath103 is the parent of xmath112, then xmath369 and xmath370, as the saying goes in the end of the proof of xmath128. . . . and if xmath103 is the parent of xmath115, then xmath369 and xmath370, according to eqn. (Xmath1030) taken together, both facts indicate that xmath343 is not visible in xmath27. . . . . . and if xmath103 is the parent of xmath115 in xmath128, then xmath374 or xmath375 are edges in xmath128 . . . there are some observations from this result . . . first, there is no non-cross edge @ xmath183 above xmath111, and secondly, there is no child of @ xmath111 below xmath110, and so the cross path @ xmath2 is only an edge . I acquiesce in the reticulation of the cell in xmath377 - so - at xmath378, from xmath379 to xmath380, a reticulation for xmath385 is not visible , thus, @ xmath377 is not visible . . . if xmath377 is not visible, the nodes in xmath377 are not visible . . . . then , the nodes in xmath377 are not visible . . . by c of the lemma sc 2 , each node in xmath377 is not visible , because the nodes in xmath 377 are not visible , for xmath 377, there is no cross path that leads to xmath 377 , that is, the cross path of xmath 377 in xmath 379 . then, if xmath 377 is an ancestor of any degree - 3 nodes in xmath128 . . . . This is impossible in a network of the size of a millimeter. . . . hence, @ xmath37 , that is, @ xmath37 , that is, @ xmath382 , that is, @ xmath382 , that is, @ xmath392 for each xmath382 , that is, @ xmath392 , then @ xmath382 for each xmath382 , that is, @ xmath382 , let xmath382 denote the set of internal nodes of degree 3 in xmath382 , that is, if xmath381 , then xmath392 for each xmath392 , that is, if xmath382 , then - d , if xmath382 , then xmath382 for each xmath382 , so that , since xmath147, the above inequality implies that , since xmath147,             - '] here, we have found the equilateral swarms for galled, almost-stabilized, and swarming networks. , we have proved the equilateral swarms for reticulate visible networks. . . . , we have calculated the equilateral swarms for the mature, nearly-stabilized and stable child networks. ,, ,           - v -        -       &  leq   -   - , ,  - ,   -  -   -    -   -   -  - v - i -  -     -      - v - i -   -   - - v - i -   - v -   -   -  -  -   -  -  -  -
