The study of black hole perturbations is still an extremely interesting subject which has a great influence on many important properties of a black hole. The study of black hole perturbations is in general one of the most interesting issues. The dynamics of perturbations of a black hole in general is generally classified into three stages. The first stage is the formation of waves on a black hole which depends entirely on the disturbance field, the second stage consists of sloping oscillations, known in the literature as quasinormal oscillations, whose frequency turns out to be a complex number, the real part is the oscillation frequency and the imaginary part is the damping. qnms are solutions to the wave equation, with complex frequencies, with a boundary condition which is completely inward at the horizon and completely inward at asymptotic infinity. In general, the study of black hole perturbations remains an extremely interesting topic, which has a profound effect on various important properties of a black hole, including its mass, charge, and angular momentum. The physics of black hole perturbations, generally speaking, is one of the main topics of interest. a black hole, for example, in general relativity, can be classified in the following categories: the first is a whirlpool that depends entirely on the initial perturbation field, the second is a damped oscillation, which, according to the literature, is called quasinormal, whose frequency is a complex number, the real part being the oscillation frequency and the imaginary part the damping. The third is a great sloping tail behavior, at very late times. At present, we shall take up the second of the three stages of evolution of the Black Hole perturbation in the Flat Darkness, in a Regular Darkness over a regular Black Hole, as the Subject of the Whole, in a flat Darkness, in the same. In a Flat Darkness which is entirely free of singularities, it is called the Darkness of the Clouds. In this respect, the study of Darkness of the Clouds is a crucial task. As far as general relativity is concerned, we know that it is prone to the appearance of singularities. There is, in short, much research into the Fundamentals of General Gravity in general. This work is known to be a most fundamental and long-standing problem, and it is a very old one. Thus, the question of avoiding singularities in General Gravity is one of the most important and most old problems. This is the reason why, in general, the solution of regular black holes has a physical force, for the gravity in de sitter space is not a space-time singularity. The first solution, of such regular black holes with non-singular geometry satisfying the weak energy condition, has been obtained by bardeen, who is now called the bardeen black hole. But bardeen’s solution had not much physical force, for the black hole had not a square radii of its own, at the beginning of de sitter. In general, de sitter space turns out to be a maximally symmetric solution to the vacuum-Einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant. In general, the problem of avoiding singularities in general relativity is one of the most fundamental ones and it is an ancient one. “ - Frydlin - oit del corret del corret del corret , one of the motivating forces for avoiding singularity, was proposed in the literature. In the present paper we will discuss the qnms of the bardeen de sitter (tomorrow bds) black hole by scalar (massless and massive), and dirac perturbations. We will see in this paper the qnms of the bardeen de sitter (bds) black hole due to scalar (both massless and massive) and dirac perturbations. There have been many articles on such regular black holes: qnms of the bardeen, qnms of the black hole, thermodynamics, geodesic structure of the black hole, to mention only a few. In this section we will discuss the bardeen de sitter (bds) black hole, followed by fernando-xcite’s physics. In this section we will briefly discuss the Bardeen-de-sitter (bds) black hole. In section 3 we will discuss wkb methods, a study of the scalar qnms of the bds black hole. In section 4 we will discuss the quasi-normal modes of the bds black hole. The interesting feature of bds geometry is that it has a non-singular structure everywhere. As we have already said, the bds background metric is given by equations (metric) and (fr) , as discussed in section 2, bds background metric is a simple equation of equations (metric) and (fr) . It can be directly calculated that all the scalar curves xmath1 , xmath14, xmath15 are finite everywhere, except for the electromagnetic field axis xmath16, which is singular xmath17 xcite . The bds black hole is similar to the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter (rnds) or born - infeld de sitter (bids) black holes, which also permits the possibility of three different horizons, as well as a single or degenerate horizon. in this section we will study the massless and massive scalar field perturbations of the bds black hole in order to study the behavior of qnms in bds with the given black hole parameters . As is known in the second section , the metric for a massless scalar field xmath18 is xmath19 and (fr) . This equation - the klein-gordon equation for a massless scalar field xmath19 is defined by xmath19 , it expresses the form - xmath19 - . The seventh order formula for a general qnms of the bds black hole is discussed below. The radial coordinate is now in the radial radial radial radial radial radial radial and in the radial radial corresponding to the maximum qnms of the qnms of the bds black hole. (Click here) The radial radial coordinate is now defined in radial radial direction, while the old radial radial coordinate is where the physically accessible region is situated between the black hole and the cosmic horizon. The sixth order formula for the general qnms of the black hole is given below. Xmath36—the height of xmath35; Xmath37—the radial coordinate is the coordinate at the point where the maximum potential exists and the radial coordinate is the average of xmath35 and xmath35. It has been shown in the literature that the sixth order method is extremely effective for determining qnms of the black hole. The sixth order method is more precise than the third order method, and the former actually gives results almost equal to those obtained by a complete numerical integration of the wave equation of xcite, for modes with a small imaginary part, and for all the multipole numbers. It is this wkb method that we will now discuss in this paper for the massless qnms of the black hole . . . " -   1  270   left ( frac  v 0   (3 ) At the X-math, one finds that the real part of the frequency increases progressively over the third-order figure; whereas, on the other hand, the negative imaginary part, obtained with the sixth-order method, declines progressively over the third-order figure. The data from the table indicates that the value of the real part of the frequency is gradually increasing over the third-order figure; whereas, for the negative imaginary part, it is decreasing, as compared to the third-order result. 460789 - 0 . 288097 - 0 . 287783 - 0 . 466177 - 0 . 698242 - 0 . 688277 - 0 . 698417 - 0 . 698417 - 0 . 698417 - 0 . 698417 - 0 . 698389 - 0 . 873746 - 0 . 446646 - 0 . 446952 - n = 1 & 1 . 828001 - 0 . 629992 - 0 . 825285 - 0 . 62992 - n = 3 & 1 . 05883 - 0 . 265737 - 0 . 05960 - 0 . 05730 - n = 1 . 02. . . . . 06. It is worth mentioning here that by computing the lyapunov exponent (the inverse of the instability timescale associated with the geodesic motion) one can show that in the eikonal limit, the qnms of black holes in any dimension are determined by the parameters of the circular-invariable geodesics at xcite. in this, we plotted the quality factor at xcite and vvvvv in . the quality factor increases with increasing vvv and decreases with increasing vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv vvvj of vvvs math23 and vvvvvvj  vvvvv 2 for massive scalar perturbation vvvdh1 is given by vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv plvvk, where the cosmological horizon merges with the cosmological horizon, or the inner and outer horizons coincide. So the quality factor increased with increasing vvvvccv and decreased with increasing vvcvvvvvvcvvvvvcvvvrvvvvn by vvvvvvv, so that vv.v.v indicates that oscillations are more intense with larger magnetic charge, and decay slower with small vvvcvc qnms are known to be the waves trapped in the peak of that potential. Since qnms are known to be the waves trapped within the peak of that potential, we can expect the same for bds epoch. We have plotted the changes in the imaginary and real part of @xmath41 versus the field mass @xmath69 for different values of @xmath13, @xmath52, @xmath56 and @xmath70. In Table ii we have plotted the numerical values of the qn frequencies with the parameters fixed. (cols = “” , “”, “,” ”] , “header” , ” ; “and ” to demonstrate that, if we assume that wkb method is more accurate for @xmath71, we have presented only the qn frequencies for @xmath71. ” As in xcite we expect the same behaviour for bds black hole that the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequencies decreases with increasing scalar mass, and on the contrary the real part of the qnms increases with increasing scalar mass. In , we derived the effective potential of bds black holes from the spherical harmonic which was at xmath70 (as measured by xmath80), but it rose above xmath25 by different values of xmath31 for the massless dirac disturbances, width = 326] (we have computed semi- analytically the massless fermions of the sixth order wkb . The function of the effective potential of bds black holes is given by xmath77, where xmath24 is the tortoise coordinate which is given by xmath74, xmath75 is the energy. The ratio of the coefficients of effective potentials, to be precise, is given by xmath76, we can conclude from this that the field perturbation, which is given by a mass, decays faster with large cosmological constant, xmath13, and oscillates better with large magnetic charge xmath56 . the effective potentials are given by xmath76. It is worth mentioning here that the potentials @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 corresponding to dirac particles and anti- particles are supersymmetric, and derive from the same superpotential @ xmath79 . In this section we will be able to analyze the massless fermion qnms semi-analytically by using sixth-order wkb method. The effective potentials are given by xmath77, and the width is shown below. the figures also suggest that if we plot the frequencies from lower to higher frequencies and assuming different orders of wkb, we see that the resolution of the qnms is better at @xmath81. In this paper, we have discussed the massless and massive scalar field perturbations, and the massless fermionic perturbations for a regular bds black hole. We have examined the effect of masslessness and massive perturbations on a regular black hole. In this study, we have studied the frequency variations as a function of the massless and massive perturbations, as well as of diracs, but the imaginary part of the frequency increases with the increasing number of xmath31, whereas it decreases with increasing value of xmath13. For the massless and massive perturbations, we can see that the density of the black hole is decreasing, and whereas, on the contrary, the density of the magnetic field is decreasing with increasing value of xmath13. We have also studied the behaviour of the q-factor of the massless scalar field with respect to the scale of the massless and the scale of the massless, and with respect to the p-value of the magnetic field - - Science and civilization. - Constellation - kokkotas k, schmidt bg, 1999 - spphys kokkotas k and schmidt bg, 1999 - living rev. - d66 - 04402 horowitz gt and hubeny v e 2000 - phys . - d66 - 024026 konoplya r and zhidenko a 2011 - phys . - d63 - 054026 konoplya r and zhidenko a 2011 - rev. mod. phys . - , 809 abott b - et al. - 2016 - phys . - eph. kokkotas k d and schmidt b g 1999 - living rev. - spphys kokkotas k d and schmidt b g 1999 - living rev. - d66 - ten thousand ; konoplya r a and zhidenko a 2011 - rev. mod. d66 - ten thousand - r163 berti e, cardoso v, and starinets a o 2009 - class. quant. grav . sent> 4006 505 bronnikov k a 2001 phys. 5014 04005 9005 9005 9005 1006 3002  nekvet k a 2001 phys. 8002 8003 1004 8002 konoplya r a 2003 phys. 8002  6004 6005 9005 6006 6006 9006 1006  304 1103 273 1402 ayn - beato e and garcia a 2001 phys. 5504 3003 1005 8002 308 6202 605 614 483 6202 506 904 1006 1006 406 1011 2103 1032 1104 1004 1032  104 1023  1011 1011 lopez - ortega a 2007 1032 1104 6006 706  586 ayn 10505 705 996 ayn 489 ayn 1249 ayn  79 101011 1011 1011 lopez - ortega a 2007 1010 1008 akira ohashi, aki sakagami – classical and quantum gravity – d. r. brill and j. a. wheeler – d. r. brill and j. a. wheeler, rev. d79 – 064016 konoplya r a 2003 phys. rev. d78 – d79 – 064016 jing j l 2004 phys. rev. d78 – d79 – d75 – 104005 schutz b and will c m 1988 – phys. rev. d75 – d75 – 104005 schutz b and will c m 1988 – phys. rev. d75 – d75 – jing j l 2004 – phys. rev. d78 – d78 – d77 – d75 – 104005
