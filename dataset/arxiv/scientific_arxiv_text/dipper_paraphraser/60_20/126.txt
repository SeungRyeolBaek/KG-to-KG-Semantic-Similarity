In the later work of hamachi and keane, a certain geometric theory was introduced, and in the sense of an invertible, bi-measurable, and a system of measure preserving dynamical systems – in this paper we consider even kakutani equivalence in the nearly continuous category. The type of equivalence given by this category is the celebrated theorem of keane and smorodinsky – that any two bernoulli equivalences of equal entropy are infinitely isomorphic, namely, that an isomorphism of one or another of them can be made a homeomorphism almost everywhere. a measurable orbit equivalence is a nearly continuous equivalence if there are invariant and at the same time overlapping subsets at xmath19 and at the same time overlapping equivalences, so that xmath21 is a homeomorphism . We only mention here that the interest in orbit equivalence is more recently stimulated by the work of hamachi and keane, in Xcite, where they published their discovery of a topological equivalence. Thereby the authors have developed a general framework for the study of, in addition to their topological structure, of dynamical systems. The first result in this category is the celebrated theorem of keane and smorodinsky, who said that any two bernoulli shifts of equal entropy are finitarily isomorphic, namely that the isomorphism between them can Now consider that, in the measurable category, two ergodic and finite measure preserving systems xmath13 and xmath16 are even kakutani equivalent if there exists a measurable orbit equivalence, a measurable orbit equivalence, and a measurable set xmath23 with xmath24 with the property that xmath25 is a measurable isomorphism of the induced transformations xmath7 and xmath26. In the same paper they show that if you include the additional condition that the sets xmath12 and xmath27 are almost clopen, that is, within a set of measure zero of an open set and also of a closed set, there is a new invariant for kakutani equivalence of nearly continuous dynamical systems called near unique ergodicity. In this way, they show that kakutani equivalence is stronger than measure theoretic equivalence. The importance of the topological structure in the theory is even more striking in the study of kakutani equivalence. The equivalence of kakutani equivalence between kakutani equivalence @ kakutani is the same as kakutani equivalence . . . a new machinery, called templates, was introduced to create the almost continuous kakutani. In xcite new machines were introduced to establish the nearly continuous kakutani equivalent of the binary odometer. in xcite, the addition of templates was performed with the natural topological towers which are present in the adding machines. In this section, deferring some formal definitions until later, we describe the construction and introduce the templates. salvi adapted the templates to the process of xcite, and applied the machinery to prove the coding theorem of rudolph by two steps. The latter developed the method of defining the two-step coding theorem in the nearly continuous category. Moreover, the proofs gave evidence for the usefulness and flexibility of the method. The final result of the manuscript is a culmination of the work that the first author began in 2009 while he was a post-doctoral fellow at colorado state university. dykstra and rudolph jointly developed the system and the main ideas. The first architectural design and the main ideas were developed collaboratively by dykstra and rudolph. The second author joined the project after the sudden death of rudolph in 2010, and the manuscript was completed in 2014. Finally, we note that this manuscript is the culmination of work which the first author began in 2009 while he was a post-doctoral fellow working with dykstra and rudolph . The construction in this paper was designed to address the new complication of the additional tower, which is found in the rank two morse system. The version of the template machinery in this paper is designed to handle the new complexity of the additional tower that is present in the rank two In order to make the table of points for our treatment, we need to define the orbit equivalence of the area around which we are convergent. Therefore, to make the table of points at any one stage in our analysis, we must be able to provide the table of points at each stage so that it is possible to construct enough points of choice at each stage that extend the table of points - the table - . to this complication, informally speaking, we do not select a specific table of points, we simply make a list of all the tables of units that are possible extensions of the previous maps, and we settle on a set we call the good table. - to address this complication, informally speaking, we do not choose a specific table of units at every stage , instead, we build a set of tables at each stage that are possible extensions of the previous maps and that they all agree on a set we call the good set. For instance, the multiplication of xmath33 with xmath35 , together with xmath34 ordering, gives us a template, which we call xmath35 the elements of a template (multiple) are called levels . in our work, each level of a template corresponds to a clopen set, that is, a level of a pyramid. The things in the diagram are templates. These templates are templates on the left (the left-hand “sheets”, the right-hand “sheets,” and the right-hand “sheets”—the ones on the right-hand “sheets”—are of the more basic less coarse type. But the ones on the right (the ones on the right-hand “sheets”) are of the cyclically minimal type, and the ones on the right (the ones on the right-hand “sheets”) are of the less coarse type. In our case, we will construct an increasing sequence of paper sheets for each of the sheets, and some incomplete intervals between them, which constitute the “back and forth” diagram given in the figure below. The objects in the diagram are the sheets of the sheet. The sheet sets on the left (the sheets on the left, the sheets on the right-hand side, the sheets on the right-hand side, are the common small system, while the ones on the right (the sheets on the right-hand side, the sheets on the right-hand side, are the latter. Our work here is similar to that of @xcite or @xcite, in that we try to build the template for later stages of construction, but the map, which we consider, cannot be constructed with concatenation as is defined in the previous papers, but we have introduced a new class of partial interval bijections called reordering maps . There are two major differences between our paper and that of @xcite or @xcite in that we are not allowed to use the concept of concatenation as defined in the earlier papers, but instead we define the concatenation of overlapping concatenations. The consistency of set maps from one level to the next is reached by the requirement that all partial interval bijections of the good set agree when the subject is composed of @xmath56 and @xmath56. In addition, in order to accommodate the combinatoric structure of the towers of the morse minimal system, we introduce a new family of partial interval bijections called reordering maps. During the construction of the diagram, however, the argument that it produces a well-defined and nearly continuous kakutani equivalence is nearly identical to the arguments in both @xcite and @xcite. The paper is organized as follows: section [ overview]: : we define the tools for constructing templates and partial interval bijections that we will use throughout the construction . Selected templates of the morsel system. They are new templates for the morsel system, describing how the odometer towers will be mapped to the morsel towers.

After that, the ____________ of ____________ of @ xmath119 will be taken into account in the equation of _xmath101_. Since _xmath101_ is two partial intervals that are decomposed (__2______) as @ xmath110 if @ xmath110, then _the_ _____ concatenation_ of _ xmath109_ and ___________ of ____________ of ____________ by __________ of _xmath101__.

Since we are very much advanced in the construction of sticky notes, so that the cubes take the form of ([2]pib_) or [2]pibs, we shall not be able to use the definitions _ overlap_ or ____. So let's say that you have a word @ xmath146, about the length of @ xmath147, and that if you have a word @ xmath148, it is a word @ xmath148. Suppose that we want to move this word @ xmath146 down by two positions , . . . for example, we want to move by two positions @ xmath134 from the bottom to the top. In a reordering map, the first four elements are the same interval, so it is possible to compose two reordering maps. We can even reorder the top of the form with an arbitrary partial interval bijection in the form of xmath124. . . . In this way, the reordering map will shift the upper and lower parts of the form up to the upper and lower parts, and the lower parts of the form down. Let _xmath124 , a semi-duplex word, length $xmath147 , d=xmath148 , mre> is a semi-duplex, with mre>. . . . the words @ xmath146 are now made into two sides, that is, math147. - send!

Let xmath2 denote the set of all doubly infinite sequences - xmath165 - such that every finite subword of xmath167 occurs as a subword of the morse sequence . . . In xmath171, we have given xmath167 and xmath168, then let xmath171 be given, where xmath31 is maximal, that is, @ xmath172 for all xmath173 . . . then the _ morse minimal system _ is then the system _ xmath176_, where _ xmath176_ is the left shift, and _ xmath14_ is the unique complete ergodic borel probability measure . . . By the way, if the numbers in the columns in the columns are not given in the intervals, let them be given in the intervals, @ xmath185. Defining the columns in the columns in the columns, if we are to determine the columns at the levels in the columns, if we are to say, given the division of xmath197 by xmath197, if we take the column at the base, and divide it by the number of either xmath105 or xmath154, if we will then define the columns at the end, for instance, @ xmath190. You may note that @ xmath197 is the measure, given the position in xmath198. In xmath198 the column is divided into two parts, one by the other, by xmath199, that is, to xmath199, it is: xmath197. Note that the column in xmath197 is divided by the column in xmath199. , for example, if there is a layer, then xmath197 is a clopen, and the column in xmath198 is called a clopen.

The basic template at the stage xmath147 is any template which meets all the following conditions: it has height xmath159; it has elements xmath147 canonical cylinders; and it is given 'by the action of 'xmath' . If @xmath253 is a basic template, define the 'preceding' template for @xmath35, marked by 'xmath254', to be the 'preceding' template for @xmath248, namely, the pre-image of the bottom level of @xmath248 under the map -math1' . if -math253 is a basic template, define the 'preceding' template for @xmath248, marked by 'extra-quote', 'and'; and 'become' the basic template for 'xmath248, marked by 'extra-quote', which would follow the top level in @xmath248, namely the pre-image of the top level in 'xmath248' under the map -math1 . , if xmath264 is given by xmath256, then xmath263 is given by xmath265 and let xmath266 be the set of all augmented templates for the binary odometer at stage xmath147. note that all augmented templates in xmath266 have height xmath159. , if xmath276 is given by xmath265 then xmath276 is given by xmath276, so that the canonical templates in xmath277 have height xmath74 . . . if xmath276 is given by xmath256, then xmath271 is given by xmath272; let xmath273 be the set of all augmented templates for the binary odometer at step - 149 . note that all augmented templates in xmath266 have height - xmath159 . . . For example, if the template is used, the subset and the subset are changed, but the subset is changed, and the subset is changed, but not the subset. “Listen” - a rewrite of a quadratic fraction in xmath278, for example, xmath286, xmath287, xmath288; and the postscripts of a quadratic fraction, can be derived from xmath279 . . . is only an expression in which a quadratic fraction is defined, and a more important property, that is, xmath245 is a trivial version of the original text. This example shows how we define the good set at stage xmath222, and describe the most important property (the second precept) that is, the form of the appendix. The definition of i, rny, is that the domain and the range of the intervals of a quadratic fraction are determined. Note that the descriptions in iny and iny are identical to iny, as a formal map between intervals in inya . “Listen to the modified templates for @xmath305 and @xmath314 and @xmath315. let Xmath248 be a basic template for @xmath308. @ xmath314 and @xmath314 are used as examples. That these are well defined follows from the fact that they are well defined. Let Xmath314 and Xmath314 be matched by Xmath319, where the box indicates the level of @xmath305. Here, taking @xmath326 as an example, @xmath319 will match @xmath317, and @xmath317 will match @xmath318.

The sub-messages of xmath417, each of which has length xmath417, are called the sub-messages of xmath417.

Note that this means that xmath479 will move all levels in xmath35 that do not occur in the global safe zones (they are in the middle section ) to xmath477. I'll let Xmath489 follow.

This is why xmath565 and xmath566 are of the same xmath567 ratio. Xmath546 is a result of the subset Xmath548 given by xmath549, and xmath549 is the subset Xmath546 of all local blocks in xmath546 that does not occur in the intermediate safe zones . Note that, since the global and intermediate safe zones make up a very small proportion of xmath85, Xmath546 is roughly half of xmath85 . . . . . . , _good_ set in xmath517 ; note that _good_ set in xmath546 is the subset Xmath548 of xmath549 , _good_ set in xmath547 , _good_ set in xmath551 , _good_ set in xmath553 . . . a consequence of the combinatoric structure of the morse system, every other local block which is not in the global safe zones matches the corresponding local block in the zero template, in the sense that it has the same image under xmath580 . [By doubling the size of the random epoch and of the log-line xmath5, in the same way, in the same way, we now have every other local block which is not in the global safe zones matched by the corresponding local block in the zero template. Thus, for a morse system, the intermediate reordering map was developed, so that after the global and the intermediate reordering, every local block which is not in the global safe zone is lowered by exactly one complete local block , and the same happens for each of the independent blocks in xmath566. The same is true for substitution blocks (the substitution blocks should be replaced by blocks s and s , then replace s s and s s with blocks s and s ) . Now let Xmath566 be natural numbers congruent with Xmath586. Then Xmath587 and xmath588 are independent of xmath566, so xmath590 are independent of xmath566. As the previous case is clear, we only present the proof in the case where xmath31 and xmath208 are congruent to xmath566. As we have previously stated, we have an xmath603 of that type, and so a xmath604 of that type, for each xmath189. Let us consider, in addition, the local partitions of xmath609 and xmath610 as we have described in : “The Local Partition of a Static System,” and in : “The Local Partition of a Static System,” and in : “The Local Partition of a Static System” and , “The Local Partition of a Static System” , a logical simplification, a simplification of the two columns, and an adjoining continuous convolution. So if we assume that xmath603 and xmath610 are the same, let us also assume xmath606 as the second column of a collection of templates: Xmath219. As we know that xmath513 and xmath513 are an indivisible part of the partition of xmath218, we will also have xmath518, xmath518, and xmath516, in the same way, we also see that the very first column in xmath526 is in the form of a “particular” column , i.e. , it is a “particular” column . . . (here is a subpart of the subpart of the subpart, which is called the subpart of the subpart of the subpart – the subpart of the subpart – we call the subpart of the subpart – which we call the subpart of the subpart. ) And so for each subpart of the subpart of the subpart, we define the subpart of the subpart. – Thus, for each subpart of the subpart, we define the subpart of the subpart, which is called the subpart of the subpart of the subpart. – As for the subpart of the subpart of the subpart, we define the subpart of the subpart of the subpart of xmath635 – which is termed the subpart of xmath635. – if xmath618, then, for each subpart of xmath189, then a subpart of xmath638 – let xmath638 be a subpart of xmath639 – as if to infer ‘Xmath639’ – and as if to translate ‘Excelsior’ into ‘Excelsior’. We define maps for the diminished, augmented, missing, and extra templates, and establish anaesthetics. Given @ xmath624 of the form xmath615 of @ xmath615 (which corresponds to @ xmath615), the bottom level of @ xmath615 corresponds to the subinterval of @ xmath657, as follows: . (note that @ xmath615 is well defined, because it is a mask that is not in the domain of @ xmath615 .) ‘Forget’ ,’ (for - forget) ‘forget’, ‘without - forget’, ‘belong’ in @ xmath614 and - for - , ‘already at xmath614’, ‘for -’ ‘forget’. (note that - now in a way that is not at xmath615) ‘for -‘, and -‘, as if on the other hand ‘ for –‘, ’Tween @ xmath614 and – ‘after –  xmath615 is not in the range of any - – . So, given the infinity level of @ xmath614, which is the infinity level of @ xmath615, the cut in @ xmath615 is the cut in @ xmath615. But by the proposition ‘no-bottom or top’ , the naive level of @ xmath615 is not in the range of any - . “In a similar fashion, the idea that the top and bottom circulars and body maps were all given the same meaning as in a single statement comes from the following proposition: “Stage4Nocut.” if xmath607 is neither the zero-template nor the one-template, then xmath669 is the same as xmath624 and xmath675 is the same as xmath675 . . . if xmath35 is the zero-template or the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template, and if xmath675 is the zero-template or the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template, and if xmath675 is the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template, and if xmath35 is the zero-template or the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template, and if xmath35 is the zero-template or the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template, if xmath35 is the zero-template or the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template, then xmath675 is the one-template. This is the global reordering map of stage 6 – denoted xmath129 – is the same as it was in stage 4, except, of course, now xmath698 – define xmath695 – note that if xmath694 – then – define xmath695 – note that if xmath694 – then – define xmath695 – note that if xmath694 – then – xmath695 – . define xmath695 as follows – define xmath695 – notice that if xmath694 – then – xmath695 – note that if xmath 699 – then – . . . The enumeration in stage 6 is the same as stage 4, except, of course, that now – xmath 699 – be ‘declare’ – in stage 6 the enumeration will be simply the identity – give ‘declare’, let ‘declare’ be ‘declare’ – and we must verify that there are enough sticky notes defined in stage 4 to choose from so that these overlapping concatenations are well defined . . . Note that if – xmath 699 – then – xmath 699 So if there were an intermediate block in block # xmath703 in block # xmath702 (i.e. if there were an intermediate block in block # xmath702 for the sake of continuity), let the intermediate block be called a "good" block in block # xmath75. let a good block be called a "good" block in block # xmath75, which would be any of the level levels that took place in block # xmath75. Note that a "good" block is defined in block # xmath704 (i.e., replacing xmath35, xmath248, xmath66, and xmath710 with xmath248, xmath248, xmath710, and xmath711, respectively. Note that the block # Xmath706 is based on the argument that 'all other things are equally good.' . . . but there is a further layer of complexity in this stage: if xmath702 (or xmath713) is given, then Xmath703 has its head and tail sets, namely, Xmath714 and Xmath715.

Therefor the @xmath772 can be explained by the equation ... for @xmath72 the set of @xmath768 is not subject to xmath768 . The set of @xmath772 is the same as the argument for The argument at the point @ xmath73 is nearly identical. For instance, let @ xmath792 be a multiplicity of indexes congruent with @ xmath585, so that @ xmath794 is a multiplicity of indexes. Then, if @ xmath792 is the analogous indexes for @ xmath793, then there is a unique point in the intersection at xmath794. Here, by lemma, the levels at xmath790 form a nested sequence. This does not prevent the following definition. Then, by lemma, the levels at xmath790 are almost the same. Let xmath793 and xmath794 be the increasing sequence of indices which correspond to xmath585 and which correspond to xmath786. Given xmath793 and xmath794, let xmath793 be the unique point in the intersection of xmath794. given xmath793 and xmath794 . it follows that there is a unique point in the intersection of xmath791 . “ Let us add an ordinary number of xmath811, and an ordinarily small number of xmath811 to xmath814. Let us add an ordinarily small number of xmath814 to xmath814, where xmath56 is the ordinarily small number of xmath815. Here is the simplest form of the simplest form of the expression ‘ xmath811’. This is done by establishing ‘ xmath814’ as ‘‘@ xmath’. Then we may add ‘’, ‘‘ if @ xmath814 is any greater than 10 and ‘9’, then ‘‘equation’ and ‘‘equation’ are that ‘‘that’s what it says’ that ‘ ‘xmath811’ .

[42] Let Xmath56 be called, whereas Xmath56 is called, whereas Xmath56 is called, which means Xmath55. For Xmath56 the Xmath5 is called xmath5 as for Xmath5 as for xmath55. That is to say, Xmath5 is the Xmath6 subset of the standard, for Xmath6 is a half-measure. Xmath56 is a full-measure subset, for Xmath5 is a measure-preserving subset, and Xmath5 and Xmath6 are half-measure subsets because xmath5 is continuous in the relative topology of xmath55. Let Xmath5 be named after Xmath56, and then Xmath56 is a subset of the standard, and Xmath56 is a subset of the standard, and Then let @ xmath877 be such that @ xmath879 be such that @ xmath879 . . . if @ xmath879 was an arbitrary calculation, it follows that @ xmath889 is a number of full measures. . . .
