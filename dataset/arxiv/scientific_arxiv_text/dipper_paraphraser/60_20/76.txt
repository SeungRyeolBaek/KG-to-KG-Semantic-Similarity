Many decades ago astronomers declared that the lines of absorption derived from the spectra of distant qsos are due to the extended gaseous halos of intervening galaxies. Therefore, while qsos may be used for generating high-resolution, high-resolution data, they obscure the galaxies projected by the sun, and therefore severely limit analysis of the halo, especially at low energies. Further, qsos are too rare in the sky to investigate the whole sky, and thus to see many individual galaxies with different rotations. But, while the apparent brightness of qsos is a reliable instrument for giving high-resolution, high-resolution data, it greatly exceeds the distances that it is projected by, and therefore, consequently, prohibits a detailed study of the distribution of halo gases, especially in the areas of neutral hydrogen, (at xmath12 ; : ? ? ; ? ? ? ) in a broad range of neutral hydrogen, from a wide range of neutralities (at xmath15 ; ? ? ? ; ? ? ) in a broad range of neutral gas-phases (at xmath15 ; ? ? ? ? ) in a broad range of neutral hydrogens (at xmath15 ; ? ? ? ? a common technique for studying the halo of a galaxy, at xmath, that is, in the  X-math, a transitional method, which is already practiced at X-math, in a converging spiral; it has already been used at low redshifts, at low redshifts, in which higher resolution images and spectroscopy are gained for each galaxy. Besides, many galaxies are extended sources, which provide the opportunity to study gas on several lines of sight through the halo, as well as their own (e.g.,         ?   ? ? ,  ? ? ) in a real way, it may be possible to study the halo gas of foreground galaxies along the sightline. (e.g.,    ?  ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? ?  ? in a particular study,  x-pray, found a cooling gas of several kiloparsecs from the nucleus of a sample of the x-pray galaxies. In one of the first studies to study this phenomenon,  x-pray observed a hot gas several kiloparsecs from the nuclei of a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. . . . , wl.q., lris. ): the approach is in the xmath25 range and fwhm is fwhm and fwhm in four optical bands (f435w, f606w, f775w, f850lp) or fwhm27, fwhm28, fwhm28, fwhm28, fwhm30 and fwhm34. q., q., q., q., q., q. , q., q., q. ) of our targeted galaxy pair (see W.295 ? ? ? ) and has been surveyed by the hst advanced camera in four optical bands (f435w, f606w, f775w, f850lp, or fwt.27, fwt.27, fwt.27, xmath28, xmath29 and xmath30). two sets of spectra were obtained: the first one was placed in a slit-mask, a blazier blazed at 4000 on the blue side, and the second one blazed at 7500 on the red side with the d560 dichroic. Moreover, since the distance between the galaxies is only a few degrees, we use a spatially narrow gaussian to weigh the extracted spectrum (for blue and red sides, respectively) and we use a star-spectral element (e.g., h9, h9) to constrain the output to xmath45. For each galaxy the redshifts have also been confirmed by eye. These redshifts are within xmath50 of the redshifts that were obtained in the surveys of the Treasury, and [73] [54] ; ] , that is, from publicly available programs developed for the survey, we derive the minimum values (xmath45) of the obtained spectrum as a function of the gap between the observed spectrum and a linear combination of three templates. one template is an artificial emission line spectrum with lines enlarged in order to maintain an instrumental resolution of xmath46, another is an added spectrum of thousands of absorption-line dominated galaxies, and one is a star spectrum. We have taken this line to be the minimum value of xmath45 of the electromagnetic spectrum in the deep (sci s Faber et al., 2009) . Aside from that, the Xcite figure for absorption and absorption had a number of other dimensions, which, however, were of a comparatively small size. At least two of these, and the absorber-superiors, have the equivalent size of xmath55 (Table 1, supra. ) (but not the absorber-superiors of the Xcite figure, as they did not have the same magnitude as xmath57, are as follows: a. (but we did not include the two qso-absorbing pairs from the qso-spot , since we lack the spectroscopic confirmation of the redshift of the associated galaxies) are also expressed as xmath55 and are classified as a strong (yet again) absorber yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet to yew yet yet yet yet yet yet, by this system, yet yet yet , yet yet yet yet another galaxy, yet in the redshift of yet, yet to the redshift of the yet, yet it has no emission, e.g., yet yet, yet this galaxy, halo the converging ss in the ss in the ss of the ss in the ss of the ss in the ss in the ss (all other converging ss in the ss) may therefore affect the ss of the ss and the oxygen abundance. In our lris spectrum we see a weak ss in the ss in the ss, and this means that the object is host to an agn (e.g., -=|||||||*|||||||||||]0/[11] and a double dispersion of ss. xmath66, which corresponds to the solar abundance of 8 . . . - So the ssfr is not very accurate, and the calibration of ss to ssfr is needed to convert it to ssfr. [11] It is also observed that the emission is weak, which is a good indicator of the presence of an agn (e.g., -, -? -—- , the emission is very weak, so a gaussian fitted to the line profile produces a rebound of @ xmath67, which is close to the rest-contained dispersion of the instrumental velocity in the wavelength. (All other dispersions reported are calculated by performing a nonlinear least squares fit of a gaussian to the appropriate emission line and its surrounding continuum, subtracting the instrumental velocity from the fitted gaussian @ xmath70 in quadrature. Even for its comparatively young population of 7,100 gyr (qsp7), it has been chosen because it is a recent sunspot, of the form of an interstitial burst of stars (ssp7) and a star-forming population of a hundred million years old, continuing for a fixed period of time , we conclude that the spectrum of tkrs4389 is well fitted for our and those spectra, and as we note previously (see “the plug-in”), it has the capacity of testing for the supply of cool gas, particularly the lower part of its orbit, but above the bright forming regions of its star-forming region. As we have noted previously (see “the plug-in”), the spectrum of tkrs4389 shows evidence for a substantial outflow of cool gas. In addition, we have included a separate tkrs4389 spectrum, with an independent dimension of xmath73, and the space-time of its space-time of xmath73, and for which we have provided a calibrated spectrum, a spectrum with an arbitrary regularity of the equations, and to indicate the contribution of the agn to the galaxy continuum. (Calibration of the equations is discussed in sec. fg.) This spectrum, as expected, was quite well fitted by the models with a range of xmath72 that combined a strong starburst with a power-law component that accounted for less than thirty % of the emission at 4200 in the rest-frame. The spectrum, of course, is fit by the fit by models with a range of xmath72 which combines a strong Fig. fgspecspec]), and by using a local reflection model of the halo in the spectra, it was possible to derive an exact measurement of the strength of balmer absorption in the spectra, to a parameter of 600 mcv, of which a high accuracy is expected, since spectra of the halo are not marked in the spectra. This is because the halo is a relatively bright galaxy, located in the green valley, between the red sequence and the blue cloud, which ... (fig. spd., width = 172, xmath77 and xmath77). The fine points of this absorption are indicated by dotted lines. The incongruity of these absorption profiles is asymmetric about the deepest part of each line. The measured accuracy of the data is indicated by the dashed line. The halo, the balmer and the k band absorption, were suppressed in the spectra prior to the fitting of the model (the masks are shown in green) because the spectra do not include agn or agn. , we also detect a small [@ xmath67] with declination -92 (see table  ew ), indicating that this galaxy hosts an agn. However, because [ ] / h @ xmath9 is correlated with metallicity in star-forming galaxies, and because there is a tight relation between mass and metallicity in these objects (e.g., ? ? ? ) , we may use the corresponding line luminosity, for example, in a sfr. However, because [ ] / h @ xmath9 is correlated with metallicity in star-forming galaxies, and because a tight relation between mass and metallicity in these objects (e.g., ? ? ? ) is noted, this galaxy is likely to have an agn. Sadly, we have not got a spectral coverage of Xmath85 and cannot strictly classify this galaxy as a nebula. [ Pt. iii] - ascertained by Xcite, the galaxy falls below the nebula ratio [pt. iii] ratio [pt. iii] of the elements in the system of spectral classification, e. . . , @ xcite and xcite . As for the material, we measure the x-ray luminosity of @x-mm89 for the subject. It is low enough to produce star formation; but based on our observation of the optical spectrum, we conclude that the emission is of the low x-ray type. We can not, however, rule out the continuing star formation based on this analysis alone. We are now constructing models with @x-mm89 for this object. As above, each of these models is equipped with a 7 – 0 gyr old single-threst stellar population (ssp7) of mass, @x-mm94, with sun-gold ( @x-mm95) and a 100-year-old continuous stellar population (@x-mm99) that creates a mass in stars @x-mm96 . we compute a velocity of @x-mm93 for this line, and note that a line of this width may derive from an agn, as a line of this width has the same velocity as the bulges of the host galaxies ... , . . . we compute the same method for supersolar chemistry ... . We can, however, rule out any continuing star formation based on the analysis. We calculate the fit of each model at each of the X-math106 positions, and we find that the models do not include the nebular or agn line emission, so the lines are hidden before we calculate the fit. , and we examine the conditions for each model, and find that the X-math106 position and the Y-math-status have no effect on the fit. However, we want to examine other star formation histories, too. One possibility, based on the position of the galaxy in the atoms and on the structure of its geometry, is that the galaxy has been forming its life for several billion years and then had a sudden burst of star formation, which has since ended. a continuous rate of sfr of 100 myr is added to each model at a time, with a value of x-math-status that varies between 1 . 8 . 200 Myr, as described below, this span of the rate of sfr, of a few million years, may include the strength of the balmer absorbance and the k- and g band absorbance in the data. We can minimize the value of q-status for each model in our grid by reducing the @x-status of each model. the expression "total" means not significantly different from the value of q-status. We also wish to examine different star formation histories . . . . . . . the results are like those of . . . models with . . . . 111, . . . 111 and . . . or . . . models with . . . . or . . . models with . . . . and . . . , or models with . . . and . . . models with . . . , . . and . . . models with . . . . and . . . model . . . , i.e., models with . . . or . . . but in . . . the full - frame is . . . this 72 85 111 . . . in . . . it has an asymmetrical morphology and is located in the green valley in the M. . . the result is the same for . . . . ev_ ew ratio of the lines in our system is @xmath118 , which is of high saturation. This is the result of the previous results from @xcite, who have shown that the absorbing gas mixture almost completely covers the background light and has a large speed spread at all the locations examined. For the most part, the size of the light source - the Xmath110, - and the relative resolution of the instrument is very high. This constraint on the xmath10 is particularly striking, since the large beam in the background is the distance between the two brightest knots of the galaxy is Xmath122 kpc at Xmath0. The higher the resolution of the spectra, the more inscrutable the profiles are, and the deepest traces of the lines may indeed appear at much lower normalized fluxes when seen at higher resolution. because the lines are highly saturated, the depth of the lines depends on the fraction of the background light that is covered by the absorbing gas and the resolution of the instrument. , and this is a consequence of the previous results of xcite, which show that the velocity coherence of absorbing clouds in the kpc scale is attained on the xmath123 scale. This constraint on xmath11 is particularly striking since the rays of the background galaxy are large: the distance between the two brightest knots in this galaxy is  xmath122 kpc at xmath0. The deepest parts of the line patterns obtained from the slits of the spectra from the slits reached   79 % of the continuum, which lowered the level a statistical analysis of the heat of the surrounding galaxies, by @xcite, shows that, in haloes that are at the limits of the milky-way (at the limits of xmath130), a smooth, hot gaseous corona is resilient to thermal disturbances and therefore will not condense into cool clouds. In the three-dimensional simulations of @xcite, it is shown that even in haloes well above the threshold mass (at xmath131) in which the hot gas, virialized by a gas accretion, develops at the end of the cooled gaseous atmosphere, cold gas filaments of the intergalactic medium (@xmath) penetrate deep into the hot halo. At high redshifts (at xmath132) these cold flows reach the central galaxy and fuel the formation of stars. This dispersion could easily produce a _______@ xcite, similar to the measured ________ for this galaxy. The three-dimensional cosmological models derived from ________ indicate that even in halos that are far above the transitional mass (______) of a star (#] * ), cold particles of gas (*) are capable of insinuating into the hot halo. However, this study does not account for the effect of gas inflow from the igm, and the assumption of a stable hot gaseous halo is not probable for the case of our host galaxy, for it is a merger remnant. xcite discovered that in the case of absorbers with xmath139 at xmath51, the mean distance from rest (see the equation) is xmath140. The absorption rate, as noted in [sec. the link], was a substantial one, about xmath140 ; also, we found that, for absorbers with xmath139 at xmath51, the average absorption of a metal in the ratio of a metal to a metal, is close to the one that is measured in milky-way. The gases of this system may contain metals and dust. However, strong absorbers with xmath138, whose redshifts are above xmath140, have shown to have a much more significant effect on the background, as well as increasing with xmath139. These results indicate that there may be a considerable amount of dust in this system. " Xcite find that the cool clouds distributed in a uniform spherical halo, when the total density is proportional to the total density of matter, are inclined to produce a cool gas in the form of a dense spherical halo. But we cannot measure the metals and dust content of this system directly, since we do not have the necessary spectral coverage. As for the density of the dust-in-the-darkness ratio of the high-energy absorption systems, which at xcite ... The cold gas which has been tidally withdrawn from the progenitor galaxies of this merger-employer might also give rise to enriched halo absorption with great @xmath54, provided that the velocity spread in the tidal ashes is large enough at xcite. We may further state that if this gas had been derived from a previous star-formation, merger or agn phase, this gas might have been the origin of the gas. This means that in this case, if the gas had been ejected or ejected from the remnant galaxies of this merger, it would have remained cold for a few days, i.e., that is, the distance that would be given today would be at xcite4 kpc, where xcite4 is the angle between the plane of the sky and the path taken by the gas. However, we note that there is no evidence of the continual expulsion of ism, as the present and expected agnation of stars in the galaxy are so little in operation and the observed agnation is mediocre. Thus, in this case, if the cool gas was produced by the tidally stripped galaxies of this merger remnant, it may also be enriched by halo absorption with great (xmath143) velocity, provided that the velocity spread in the expelled clouds is large enough to xmath54. if we assume that the temperature is not rapidly changing, we can conclude that cold clouds driven into the halo by a star-burst or merger (Mid century ago), will remain cold today, and for at least 1 gyr more. In addition, we are informed that the clouds at the upper end of the mass range are evaporated by conduction, on times scales of Xmath154 to the halo virial radius (Mid century ago) [16] and in the next cell of the universe. , we will see that the cloud is stable against kelvin-helmholtz instability. The galaxy evolution (39] (#39] (31] and references therein) predicts that a large number of gaseous, major mergers, are brought to the center of the galaxies, and thereby fuels in the form of explosions, black hole formations, and luminous agnities, fueled by a variety of mechanisms. , if the hot gas composition does not change substantially with time, then we may conclude that cold clouds which have come to the halo from the ism, or during a merger, (dynob), from the ism, when a starburst, merger, or luminous agnity, whose velocity is equal to the virial velocity (as a percentage of the rotation velocity is equal to the virial velocity in this case; see xcite for details). besides, the gas of the ism which was tidally stripped during the merger is also left behind at large strike-rates. Finally, a luminous agn might have contributed to directing cool gas into the galactic halo and quenching star formation. Furthermore, gas that had been stripped during a merger may have been left behind at a large impact factor. in this case, we consider whether clouds ejected from the ism would have a large spread of movements in the space of 1 gyr after the event. In the example of Xcite, the phase in which the residual material of the ism has disappeared and the remnant of the merger reveals itself is expected to be felt in the first few hundred myr after the merger. For Xcite, the phase in which the qso has faded and the remnant of the merger is reddened and exhibits a post-starburst continuum occurs, @ xmath156 after the merger. We also consider whether clouds ejected from the ism would have a very large spread in velocities, by 1 gyr, after the merger. At first, we assume that the outflow of gas, as a function of the distance from the point of the explosion, is given by @ xmath160, where @ xmath160 is the velocity of the outflow, where @ xmath160 is the distance of the flux, @ xmath160 is the lower limit on the starburst luminosity needed to expel a great fraction of the gas, when it is thick, and @ xmath164 is the radius of the outflow. - xmath172 kpc, then we may compute the distance and velocities for clouds that are projected between xmath176 kpc and its first velocities at the next gyr. from the evidence presented here, we conclude that the absorption system is most likely gaseous fragments of the ism of the mergers. " A bipolar shaped shape for the flow is taken, and the opening angle of the evaporation cones traced by h - xmath17 and co emission in m82 (e.g. - - - - -) such that the line of sight intersects both evaporation cones and parallels the axis passing through the center of the cones. - - so that the line of sight intersects both the flow cones and is parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the cones. This is quite naive, but it suggests that clouds driven out of a galaxy one gyr ago might have the large density of the ism, and that it will continue this large density for another gyr. The last magnitude is well above - . The velocity spread is far above - " xcite - a method recently developed to study the host galaxies of absorption - analyzes the dispersion strength of a large group of absorbers with respect to the dark matter-rich galaxy (lrgs), to estimate the mean halo masses in which absorbers of varying strength are found. These studies show that there is a weak anticorrelation between xmath135 and the bias of systems at xmath179. * - The amount of absorbers with xmath185 == 1020470 is insignificant; that is, absorbers with xmath180=2060 have mean halo mass @ xmath1801; while xmath183=2 absorbers have mean halo mass @ xmath183 (@ xcite; see also @ xcite and cite) . - But, however, these studies have shown that the clustering of absorbers is unbiased with respect to dark matter, and therefore, in general, strong absorption does not occur preferentially in low masses . The authors say that he is more likely to extract gas from the globular disk in shallower depths, and therefore they expect that strong absorbers are preferred in lower masses . As explained in the introductory note, if a gallop had occurred, a beam was not visible, and a mass of many tons of phosphorus amounted to almost a megagram, but its magnetic poles were somewhat larger, and could have been captured by a wave, which was made by a nova. And the gallop would have experienced a gust of cold air and possibly even have exploded the star, which might have caused it to expand and burst out of its center. This gallop does not have a continuous star activity and is mainly self-agnized; but it did experience a collision of a gas in the middle of the galaxy halo, at the size of three kilometers. And, in addition, it showed the accelerations of the cold gas at its entry into the gas at one or two large hot spots, and so the cold gas accreted onto the hot spot, as we have already mentioned in a different chapter,  Sub-systems . . . Our galaxy is, in contrast, peculiar in that it is a post-collision galaxy, and the existence of an enriched energy in a halo whose mass is not above the transition mass (as well as the separation between heat and gas), in a case when the cold gas absorbed by the halo is dominated by the mass, and if the gas absorbed in the star , we can say that the effect of star formation on the gas in halo is detected to a great extent in the mass in which the gas was accreted, or (b) there is a rise in the transition mass for different galaxy halos. It is well known that the life of this galaxy is rare It is possible to obtain such detail with a study of the background galaxies by means of an instrument such as lris, which requires a bright, blue background, so that the equable signal-to-noise ratio of @xmath197 to @xmath195 is not terribly low. It can only be used to find the post-starburst and to age it by means of this dataset. It is possible to search for the starbursts of @xmath198 to analyse their origin, which is needed to find the starbursts of @xmath198 absorption; this method can not be used to identify host galaxies of in-built absorbers, which is a tendency to emit xmath198 at starburst time; in this way it is impossible to distinguish planetary galaxy absorption from a starburst by the presence of xmath198 in the angular separation of xmath198 for a absorber at xmath198 . Such detail is possible because of the rich dataset available in goods, including redshifts from tkrs, cite, and our lris spectroscopy. Several large surveys, currently completed, have been completed, which can be used to find pairs of a type that are suitable for targeted observance of halo gas. This study is only beginning to demonstrate the power of using background galaxies to study foreground halo gas. a side-long ridge made by infinity and which will have a scale of at least 20 cm / 8 pc at xmath201 d, which will allow for an unprecedented number of photometric redshifts. The authors wish to thank c. tremonti for freely providing her stellar population modeling code, k. cooksey for her absorption feature and for a careful reading of the manuscript, and luke winstrom for his idl code for creating colour images. luke winstrom, which we thank for your helpful and helpful discussions, thank you, too, for the way you have treated the results of the experiment. We thank c. tremonti for free providing her stellar population modeling code, k. cooksey for his absorption feature and for reading the manuscript carefully, and s. patel for his colour code. The use of galaxies as background probes is complementary to the study of the vertical stars of a halo, which has a negligible beam size, but which also allow for a detailed analysis of the light materials of the starry component of the absorber. 47285 - xmath210 & xmath210 - xmath216 - xmath224 - xmath225 - xmath225 - 0 . , i. & r. shapiro, xmath209 - p. & v. m. , 161172, p. 222, p. 201 , p. 201 , p. i. - xmath214 & xmath216 - xmath216 - xmath217 - xmath218 - xmath220 - ) - z. - 2244 - 2344 - 274 - 2374 - 274 - 274 - 2382 - 287 - 285 - 2285 - 224 - 226 - 228 - 228 - “ xmath248 $] [7] Xmath248 [8] & no coverage + * 2365 & xmath248 & no coverage + * 2365 & xmath252 & no coverage + * 2365 & xmath252 & no coverage + * 2365 & xmath252 & no coverage + * 2389 & xmath249 & no coverage + * 2390 & xmath248 & xmath259 & xmath248 & xmath248 - & xmath248 - & xmath248 & xmath248 - p>
