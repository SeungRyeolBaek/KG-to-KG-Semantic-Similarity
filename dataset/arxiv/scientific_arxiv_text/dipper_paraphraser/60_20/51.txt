the critical property of this @xmath12 heisenberg model on a square lattice is well known. One of the most disconcerted 2d models is the quantum spin – xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice, with competing magnetic (n) and next-neigh (nn) antiferromagnetic interactions (known as the @xmath12 model) – xcite. Here, at xmath13, the magnetic asymmetrical lengths are confined to the fixed-pitch wave vector, with a laggard smaller than the fixed value (quantum fluctuations) and which vanishes continuously at xmath13. Besides, a particularly interesting 2d model, known as the quantum spin – xmath12 heisenberg antiferromagnet, in a square lattice, with competing nearest-neigh (n) and nearest-neigh (nnn) antiferromagnetic exchanges (known as the @xmath12 model) , a critical model of the atoms, a heisenberg-type antiferromagnet. The critical properties of this @xmath12 heisenberg antiferromagnet, are still in debate. For xmath20, we have two distinctly degenerate collinear states, helical and helical, with pitch vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and these two collinear states have the parallel spin direction of their neighbors in the vertical (or horizontal) direction and an antiparallel direction of their neighbors in the horizontal (or vertical) direction, and That is why the synthetic components of the studied ferritics have been substantially stimulated by the experimental realization of vanadium phosphates, which are i.e., li @ xmath24vosio @ xmath24, li @ xmath24vogeo @ xmath25, and vomoo @ xmath25, which are also the products of the frustrated models , which, from high to low, the geometry and topology of the phases of the ferrimetric structure can be studied continuously from high to low in the xmath6 regime, by applying high pressures (p) that affect the distances and the angles. These tinostructural compounds are composed of a layered structure containing v@ xmath28 ( @ xmath28) ions , i.e. v@ xmath28, li @ xmath28, vomo @ xmath28, which might be interpreted by the superexchange by this frustrated model in the case of X-ray dilatation . . ., since the two-fold degeneracy of the ground state for X-math31 is not possible to say, a priori, that is, the magnetic wave vector (i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., x-math28, li, x-math28, vomoo @ x-math28 , which might be described by this frustrated model in the case of X-math26 it would be also an erroneous point of the order parameters xmath0. - " xmath36" - in the two orthogonal dimensions xmath0 and xmath37 the two structural groups nn and nn in the lattice of nn and nn. In xmath36 this equilibrium has been established by the quantum triple point (= qtp), which is located at xmath43 and above which there is a second-order phase transition between the af and the caf phases, and above this qtp there is the intermediate magnetically disordered phase (vbs or rvbs) of vbs or rvb. By combining the combined domain of qtp with its connected cluster, they found the surprising and novel result that there exists a quantum triple point (= qtp) with coordinates at (@xmath43) below which there is a second-order phase transition between the af and the caf phases, while above this qtp there is an intermediate-magnetic (in colloidal) phase between the nn and the qtp. Ayre and Balentes, in spite of the great progress in computer technology and the increased efficiency of programing, have recently been used in a recent study of the ground state by the liar, _et al. _____. Xcite. These results are in agreement with those of starykh and balentes, who showed that the "qtp" in the ground state diagram observed recently by Bishop, _et al. ___ ___, _et al._. " The analysis of the ground state (Gs) of the two-dimensional, tidbit, the es de es of the es of the es of the es of the es of the es of the es of the es of the ground state (Gs) was not in the equation of qtp, that the es of the ground state, 'o'rr', and 'a's the other side, it was not possible to repeat this procedure for the next interesting es. for the exact diagonalization, the perfect diagonalization is made up of singlet states on a pair of sites, which cover the whole 2d lattice , the complex of these states is not orthogonal, and over-complex. Moreover, the results obtained by starykh and balentes , that gave no sign, but only showed not the qtp in the 'field state' phase diagram which Bishop , ___, et al. , we denote the hamiltonian model by @xmath35 by the column direction, and @xmath37 by the column direction, and @xmath58 by the diagonals, and assume all the couplings to be positive by @xmath59. In sec. iv we give a short summary of the results. in sec. iv, we give a brief summary of the results. The primary analysis of the critical behavior of the quantum spin-–@xmath59 @ xmath12 heisenberg model has been studied for many years, but very little has been done in the anisotropic square-shaped case, which is described by following hamiltonian:  xmath54, where        1 , where       1  1  52 10 a, where = 21 12 , the first sum runs over all nn, the second sum runs over all nnn pairs . . . In the case of 30 30 ( 30 30) the line is divided into two phase transitions: the - , the 1 or l for 26, separated by a first-order line at 63 . They did not find, however, only the second-order phase transitions in the phase diagram. this contradictory qualitative result (above or below) is the chief motivation of the present work. However, we have already given a measurement of the multicritical nature of the phase diagram of the ground-state system in the xmath66 plane for the pure xmath68 model. In the measured phase diagram of many physical systems such as mixtures of fluids, superfluids, binary alloys, liquid crystals, certain ferromagnets, etc. , which have existed for over a century at least. Despite their long history, new singularities at the cccccvcvvvrnty have been predicted. Despite the ccvrnty of ccvvvve, new singularities were predicted. Fisher and Upton predicted that a new singularity in the ccvvvvnty of the first-order phase transition line would arise in a ccvve * . and this prediction was confirmed by the phenomenological studies of a spherical model. “With this selection of vector states, we get the energy of the spin operator in each of the locations of the pin, which is given by @xmath78 @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83, which is based on the same parameters (the canonical transformation) of ref. @xcite, i.e., @xmath84 and @xmath85, which is based on the normalization condition @xmath86 . –  left ( lambda + 1  right) x – 4  left ( lambda + 1  right) xu –  2   2  + 2  alpha –  2  –  left (y – lambda + 1  right) –  alpha –  2  = 2  eta –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –  left ( lambda + 1  right) – v – 2  alpha –  2  = 2  eta –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –   left ( lambda + 1  right) –   –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –  –  left ( lambda + 1  right) –  alpha –    2  =  eta –  left ( lambda + 1  right) – v – 2  alpha –  2  = 2  eta –  left ( lambda + 1  right) the boundary conditions of the two ordered states (af and caf) are located in fig. the solid line indicates the critical points and the dashed lines indicate the first order frontiers. The order parameters Xmath110 and Xmath111 are numerically calculated as a function of the frustration parameter Xmath8 for a given value of spatial anisotropy Xmath7 . we observe that the order parameter Xmath112 is smoothly zero when the frustration parameter Xmath8 increases from zero to xmath113, with xmath113 marking the second order transition. This navete phase is not affected by a deformation, it is a second order phase transition. The boundary conditions for af and caf are - avet aet a, - avet avet a, - qp - (quantum paramagnetic) . The af and qp phases are separated by a second order transition line at xmath114, in the form xmath115. The intensity of the grating in the * af and qp phases is - at xmath114 - a first order transition . The critical end point - qce - - in the qce - - at xmath123 (and in the qce - at xmath124 - the boundary between these phases is outlined - - in xmath129 there exists an intermediate region between the critical point - - 129 at which - 127 for the af - phase, is a second-order transition, and the point - 136 at which a discontinuity is found between the af and the caf phases, in a first-order transition . , in the af phase - 132 for af - phase, a direct first-order transition, is supposing at xmath139 for af - and at xmath142 for af -, the transition point for the caf phase is at xmath139 (a classical value). . . . so that we see from the outlines fig. 2 that for xmath129 there exists an intermediate region between the critical point - xmath130, where xmath131 for the af phase characterizes a second-order transition, and the point - xmath132 where the xmath133 order parameter is a discontinuity for the af phase, characterizing a first-order transition. mit>, and others, mit , and some of the others, cite, and can also be compared with experimental results for the k-nif @ xmath24 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math25 math26 math26 math26 , math 25 math6 math148 math6 math16 av; av; p> the black point represents the uv critical endpoint ( qce). in a word, we have studied the effects of the spatial and the frustration (@ xmath8) parameter in the quantum spin- @ xmath0, -@ xmath148 heisenberg model. av. - caf, - qp. - av - qp; - caf - qp , - qp. - av. - qp = qe ; - - qe , - qe . . . _ f . bishop, p . h . y . li, r . darradi, r . melzi, n . papinutto, and p . millet, phys . . f . - essui t . . f . melzi, p . h . y . li, r . melzi, n . papinutto, and p . millet, phys . . . - 86 , 054412 ( 2008) r . f . bishop, p . h . y . li, r . darradi, j . schulenburg, j . richter, and c . e . campbell, phys . : condens. . . . . .
