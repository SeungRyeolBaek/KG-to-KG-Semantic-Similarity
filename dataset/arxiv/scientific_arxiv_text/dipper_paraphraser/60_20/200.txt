In a variety of ways, the investigation of xmath1- conjugated polymers is influenced by the structural disorder of these systems. In this respect, it is especially influenced by the chemistry of the polymer films of xcite, e.g., by the rate of excited light in a polymer, so that, in consequence, the xmath1-subunit is occupied by an entire polymer, and the vibronic resolution of the transition is very much equivocal. The particular electrochemical state of xmath1- conjugated polymers is generally described by coulomb confined electron-hole pairs . therefore, these electronic states are often referred to as excitons, although they must be distinguished clearly from the extended bands in crystals. Also, the oligomeric materials of lppp are a very good opportunity to study large cylinders of planarized phenylenes. In the absence of any specific absorption point, the photocurrent can be observed in a discrete, vibronic space, and a vibrational resolution of the transition can be seen at xcite . A reasonable estimate of the exciton binding energy in conjugated polymers, e.g., has been established, e.g., by using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, which yielded about xmath3 ev. Excited states, e.g., with a smaller, and larger electron-hole distance, should be more susceptible to separation. This study of oligomers instead of an infinite polymer, adopts the above-mentioned method and allows direct comparison with experiments. The analogous systems studied in the experiments of oligomers are compared with lpppp, a mixture of which there are to be found in about eleven phenylene rings. As the experimentally used molecules are computationally too demanding, hydrogen must be replaced by hydrogen (see fig. 1 and fig. 2). This substitution should have negligible effects on the optical properties, which are governed by the frontier orbitals of the @xmath1 symmetry. For the excited states with a dominant oscillator, the wave function will be called ‘the first excited state,’ the second excited state and the higher energetic, the frenkel-type  state. The electronic ground state will be called ‘the electronic ground state’. The wave function in the corresponding ground states is the indo (internal extension of differential overlaps) and the wave function in the spin-silver sector. As the experimentally used molecules are computationally too demanding, one must replace the large aliphatic substituents attached to lppp by hydrogen (see figure [fig. 1], table ], as expected, the predominant configuration of the excited states was neglected. As for the excreted singlets, we will consider the indo- / s method with the minimum am- ions from the electronic ground states. As for the organic space, it is a large active space, and contains orbitals of the symmetry of some excreted oligomers. In the present case, the austin polarisation (am-1) has an almost exact agreement with the polarisation results (cf. cf. cf. @ xcite for the bond lengths in Table [Tab. 1] )). These results are a reference for the semi-empirical method. In the present case, the austin polarisation (am-1) has an almost exact agreement with the polarization results (cf. cf. cf. @ xcite for the polarisation times in table [Tab. 1] ) . this method will therefore be used to calculate the geometry of the ground state. In the next step, excited states are calculated by the zerner s indo / s method, which is based on the minimum am- structures of electronic ground states. The resulting point groups are equivalent to those proposed by the simple lewis structure, see figure 1 . . . In a few cases, only one transition is discussed (the @xmath2 transition for the @xmath11 oligomer, and the @xmath16 transition for the trimer, see figure 1 ) . all structures have been optimized without symmetry constraints . . . he analyses the ratio of the c-c bond of an oligomer with an even number of phenylene rings, and we assume that the smallest c-c bond is 1 . . . , so we assume that the hydrogen atoms of the bridge are not engaged in conjugation, though that would be allowed . . . as the smallest c-c bond of a methylene bridge is 1 . . . , they are assigned to single bonds. [27] . in . . . . [29] Figure - 2: - the (highly resolved) spectra of lppp oligomers is plotted. All the structures are optimized without any symmetry constraints. v) states are determinant of the xmath7 state, and that states of the high energy region . . . as shown in Figure 3a, the energy of all three optically important transitions is measured by the ratio of the number of phenyl rings in the molecule. This equation, however, does not give any quantitative basis for the effective conjugation length of xcite, for the theoretical curve leads to an unphysical negative value. The energy of xmath7 and xmath8 is strongly dependent on each other, whereas the energy of the xmath15 transitions is hardly changed by the size of the system, as observed in the experimental test. The main reason for this error is that we have ignored the polarization energy in the calculations which stabilizes the excited states in the condensed phases in the experiments. Besides, the linear extrapolations for the transitions to the xmath7 and xmath7 states show a strong linear dependence, whereas the energy of the xmath7 transitions hardly changes with the size of the system, in agreement with the experimental observation. The infrared wavelength xmath34 is proportional to the real part of the optical conductivity, as defined by the kubo equation xcite . . . and he is an independent entity of the u-a -d, which is k o.d , which consists of a constant number of phenyl- ringed bases. From the information in the table [tab. 3], it is seen that a value of xmath33 corresponds to an effective conjugation length of about 20 phenyl-rings, in good agreement with the value of 14 rings estimated from other optical experiments. . . . , as a result of the ka-ohm basis, it is estimated that the size of a little-particle is not more than about 20 ringed bases, in reasonable agreement with the value of 14 rings estimated from other optical experiments. . . .

Thus, the quantities at xmath63 can be reduced to the form at xmath61, where the particle-hole amplitudes are calculated by the intersection of the excited state @ xmath63 and the ground state @ xmath64 with an electron at @ xmath65 and a hole at @ xmath66 (if @ xmath67) . . . Note that the analysis of (the amplitude) does not require the full spatial dependence of the many-particle wave functions @ xmath63 and @ xmath64, as in @ xcite or the density density correlation function of the ground state @ xmath64. , the amplitude of this absorption process is, at xmath53, proportional to the strength of the oscillator, at xmath54. Thus, the amplitude of the amplitude of the amplitudes @ xmath59 enables to answer the question as to whether a given excited state @ xmath63 may be viewed as an excitation of an electron by an electron by an electron and a hole by an electron (if @ xmath67) .

"(Eq.), ["x" is the minimum density of the excited state and of the ground state, with an electron-hole pair around the nuclei at xmath76 and xmath77. These approximations for xmath71 and xmath79 indicate that the air convection of the molecules is to be defined by the combination of Junguangya State (v) and its axis X  X [2, Eq.[12], the chemical indices and the xmath88 indices refer to the active space of the occupied and virtual orbitals, respectively. The results of this second calculation of indo/s wave functions are described as linear combinations of the Pssyasya System [12] —crystal v. d. [13] where the molecular orbitals xmath79 (d. ) are expressed as a linear combination of spatial atomic orbitals (aos) — xmath81 — xmath82 , tr-tsi       n . . . , in the state representation of a cis structure this function has the coefficient @ xmath102 for xmath103, @ xmath104, and all other coefficients are set to zero. However, the n-wave function , in this case, is investigated according to the n-wave function ( amplitude  ). in a cis context this function has the coefficient @ xmath105 and the normalization of @ xmath97 in '[phicisdef]', so that @ xmath98 may be considered as a discrete probability function for finding a hole around the nucleus @ xmath74 and an electron around the nucleus @ xmath77. (*) is a continuous probability function, as it were, for finding the distance of the electron and hole pair, which can be estimated by the length of the bond lengths @ xmath105 and @ xmath107, in small molecules the confinement of the oligomers ... in this case the results can be checked whether the values of @ xmath99 carry significant weights, corresponding to the aos of @ xmath13 symmetry, it turns out that this weight is negligible, and we can add all contributions of the aos of an atom without losing any information ... Then, to make the graph more clearly, one would apply a kind of quasi-one-dimensional ring of carbon atoms, such as the example shown in Figure 4a. This ring of carbon atoms has, as can be seen from Figure 4b, no bound state; it is thus dominant even on the length of four phenylene ring-rings. The parallel lines on the graph of the two-dimensional ring are also smoothed to xmath113, which is simply a function of the distance between the electron and the hole. The two-dimensional ring of xmath110 can be further smoothed by Xmath111, which is only the function of the electron-hole distance. math110 shows a smooth curve in the interval of xmath114 as a function of xmath89. The third point is that, in order to get a better pictorial view of the excitation, one can concentrate on a quasi-one-dimensional chain of carbon atoms; the figure [fig. 4a] shows how the chain is chosen. The state is clearly identified in the form of the state of xmath7. The density of the excitation is dominant up to the length of four phenylene rings. see WHERE ARE THE POSSIBLE RANDS OF THE SUMMER OF THE HIST AT XMITTER COMMONS AND CARDS , which, like the rest of the apters, did not increase significantly over the initial wavelengths of the oligomer xcite , did not have a significant change in the number of rings. The very large values of xmath118 were attributed to the fact that the distribution was flattening and broadening with the increasing size of the oligomer xcite , so that the most variable values of xmath122 and xmath124 were saturating. The proportion of xmath124 and xmath122 decreasing with the increasing phreatonomy of the system, however, weakened by a high percentage of the additional phreatonomy of xmath121 and xmath124, if you like, has a little more than a little excess of xmath124. In the present study, the xmath8 state is located in the same region as the phreatonomy in ppv, that is, between the xmath121 and the xmath122, namely, the symmetrical transition between the two polymeric film phreatomer. Thus, the population of this state is responsible for this abatic behavior of the light wave. It is therefore, in the view of the observance of the local heat from the excess of energy, that the photocurrent Xcite is being accelerated, not the optically accessible states. Moreover, the curves for Xmath128 in the order of oligomer length resemble those for Xmath119, viz., fig. , fig. . a. Compared with xmath119 the elctron-hole separation is not at all saturated, but increases with the size of the system, viz. Fig. , fig. a. , fig. b. - is qualitatively the same as for the corresponding xmath7 states. as far as the octane formation is concerned, namely, is concerned the local heating of the elctron-hole pair and the electron-hole pair in particular. Similarly, if we compare xmath128 with xmath119, we can find a similar elctron-hole pair of phenyl grouping in xmath128. Similarly, the Xmath129 oligomer curves are qualitatively the same as the corresponding xmath7 states . . . for instance, compare xmath115 and xmath129: xmath115 are essentially zero in the fa-lateral . . . that is what we find in the theory of local heating: a heat generated by excess energy is what generates the photocurrent of lppp at 4 . . . But in order to see the difference between the two extremes of the excitation of Xmath7, Xmath8 and Xmath9, the analysis was repeated for Xmath101. . . . if one considers the emitted electrons in the molecule as a single electron, a mutual motion is observed in this manner, as shown by Fig. 8a, Fig. 8b, and Fig. 8c, the relative motion of the electron and the hole in the molecule is uncorrelated. The excitation of the emitted electron and the hole in the molecule is uncorrelated. The two pair is atoms bound to the electron and the hole. In this way, the emitted electron and the hole in the molecule are noncorrelated. Moreover, as a rule, there is no further expansion of Fig. 132, when system size increases, and the smoothed distribution function — Fig. — keeps the same curve. To compare the intensity of the excitation with the excitation of Fig. , see (). Hence, the excitation of the states xmath7, xmath8 and xmath9 is real, and not just a coincidence of the unequal motion of an electron and a hole. In the physics of semiconductors, they are an analogous pair.
