The interplay between superconductivity and electronic modulations in cuprate superconductors remains one of the most fascinating and unresolved issues in the field of high temperature superconductivity. However, this argument can also not be fully resolved on purely theoretical grounds, for it requires accuracy of ground state energy that is not possible in first principles theories. The interplay between superconductivity and the onset of electronic modulations in cuprate superconductors is still a controversial and unresolved question in the field of high-temperature superconductivity. The determination of the stripes and the checkerboards of 1 / 8 lanthanum cuprates is widely regarded as one dimensional, often referred to as stripes . Yet the principal details of the same experimental evidence also agree with the possibility of two-dimensional modulations, called checkerboards . . . the experiment based on the checkerboard was of the first, but a rather indirect one , as it required an accuracy of the ground state energy, which is not possible with first principles theories . . . , the underlying density of the grain is less than 1 %. Beyond 1 / 8 lanthanum, the generic situation involves the fluctuating counterpart of the static density of the texture in the present work. Hence the use of the generic surface for describing the superconductivity in cuprates. , the standard of observable fermionic states. As a rule, the colour b-states with the exponents xmath5 (blue) , xmath6 (green) and xmath7 (green) , b-states with the exponents xmath10 (blue) , c-states xmath11 (blue) , c-state xmath12 (cyan) , xmath4 ; in this respect, the Exponents xmath4 (p-states) has the coupling of low energy fermions. , xcite . . . The general reason for constructing this model is the same as for ref. - iii. in this respect, the Exponents xcite shows us that the coupling connection of low energy fermions is strong . . . The surface of the hamiltonian is composed of four such plaquets, each of which is of the same material, a prism, a core and a cupola, each of which is of a spin, a degenerate condition. Moreover, as we know in the fig. [a] Fig. [b] , it contains four completely different types of prism, so we distinguish two a- and two b- states by a-fool, and a-fool , for a-fool, and a-fool, respectively, with a wavy wave function that is known by an inversion of the other. (c) The second a- state, or the second b- state, two a- and two b- states, with different values of xmath3, or xmath4, are, for the time being, b-states, and so on. Then, , we predict that the lowest-energy states of the polarized plaquets around the centers of the vortices are non-spine degenerate, and therefore we consider exactly one state per plaquet . the highest-energy state of the polarized plaquets around the centers of the vortices is expected to be non-spine degenerate . The second set of terms is b-states , and the second set of terms is c-states , we call them b-states . . . b    dagger  i  alpha  uparrow    i  alpha  downarrow  c  m  text  e                                              right (b     dagger       alpha            left    left  left ,  end  collected    ]      left    left (b     dagger      i   alpha  uparrow                      left ,   left    h .     left ”  h . He then guessed that he could find the solution in spite of the fact that it gave at least the right qualitative view of the model ’s behavior. However, he proceeded to find the solution in spite of the fact that it gave at least the right qualitative picture of the behaviour of the model. In the solution he first proposed the bogoliubov transformation for xmath33 states (eq: bgvtransb), and adding to this the thermal averages of terms which do not change the occupation of b-states, we obtained a partly averaged hamiltonian, @ xmath33, where xmath33 and xmath33 are positive real numbers satisfying a constraint arising from the canonical fermionic anticommutation relations of the canonical fermionic anticommutation relations, and @ xmath37 and @ xmath37 are the transformation phases, which are later determined by minimizing system s energy . eq: ( ] we must rewrite the hamiltonian in the terms of real-space fourier transforms for a- and c-states. , it is necessary to define the following vectors (all in units of underlying crystal lattice): the subscript xmath2 in xmath49 is chosen, that is, xmath2+th b-states are located between the pairs a- and c-states connected by vector xmath49 of the even-a-states. To obtain proper fermionic anticommutation relations between bogoliubov counterparts of a- and c-states, the bogoliubov transformation of these states must be made in the quasi-momentum space. Finally, we rewrite the hamiltonian ([16] : where we define the position of each unit cell by the position @xmath50 of an even-a-state within that cell. The subscript @xmath2 in the subscript @xmath49 is chosen so that @xmath2 is the subscript of an even-a-state . -            left -        left -                                                                   left        left        left       left (e   i   varphi                                          left (e (a)  left (a)  text  e  (a)  text   (a) mathbf  k      text  o  (a)  text   (a) mathbf  k      text   (a) Mathbf  k       (a)     (a)       (a)  left (a) text  e  (a)     (a)  text  e  (a)    (a)    (b)   (a)        (a)    (b)       left (a) text   (a)   text     (a)            left (a)           left (a)  text  e  ( mathbf  k ) Mathbf  k  Mathbf  r       varphi  2                                                 non    end  aligned      non          non                non  end  aligned                      [0] -                            ,         ,       [6] - i     varphi      2 = u ( mathbf  k  ) – ‘So we substitute these coefficients for eq’ ( ‘eq’ – energy’) and compute the energy of a bogoliubov particle from the derivative of the total energy ( ‘eq’) at the fixed quasiparticle number – Xmath90, – Xmath97, – xmath81, – xmath82, – xmath40 . in general, it is a numerical matter, but you can also obtain a closed analytical equation for the critical temperature – xmath0 by assuming that, near the transition, the superconducting state is close to normal, allowing you to establish the limits – Xmath98. The following tables give: – end – separated – label – tc1 –             – . Then, removing the coefficients, we replace them with eq ( eq: energyfinal) and obtain the energy of a bogoliubov particle by obtaining the energy of a bogoliubov particle by taking derivative of the total energy ( eq: energyfinal) for the quasiparticle occupation numbers @ xmath90, xmath91, xmath92. “Once again, in this case, we obtain, on the critical temperature, xmath110, and on the superconducting gap parameter xmath112 associated with van-Have singularity for a- and b- states located at xmath113. Fig. [31] shows the numerical calculation of the temperature dependencies of superconducting gaps for the cases i and ii, and see also the table in Fig. [31], fig.[32] Fig. [33] the families of plots for the cases i and ii are connected by the critical case @ xmath114, which is represented by the thick red line , so that the ratio of @ xmath120 is clearly measured, if the assumptions of the present model are true, then the ratio of @ xmath120 represents a transition from the usual behavior at xmath121 to the unusual behavior at xmath122. This case corresponds to the ratio @ xmath120. The family above the critical case corresponds to case i: at xmath116 all the axis points are not zero, but are always in a different plane from bcs. " The figure shows the predictions of the model in Fig. , [fig. , fig. ] . all the measurements in Fig. , [fig. ] show very good or satisfactory agreement between the predictions of the present model and the experiment. We have, moreover, to note that despite the very significant difficulty in measuring at xmath129 near xmath130 the very idea of the critical ratio @xmath127 which separates dependencies ending at xmath131 from those ending at xmath131. this is the same set of experimental results as in ref. p. . . for a experiment of the water-filled raceway. In addition, there are also plots in fig. [fig.][3] in which one can select from the xmath127 the ratio being larger or smaller than @xmath127. It should be noted here that the experimental data themselves are subject to a number of uncertainties, especially that the overheating effect of the ilt measurements are in particular due to the fact that the experimental measurements are under the influence of heat. The analysis of the ilt measurements was of a higher quality, especially in the frames (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, o, q, r, s) , were of less use in the frames (i, e) and remained more or less equal in the frames (h, i, j) . The main difference between the model of the spin - vortices and the model of the grid - is the critical ratio @xmath127 above which the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap reaches the value @xmath133, which, in turn, is probably related to the pseudogap . in this appendix, we proceed to the derivation of steps ii and iii. In this appendix, we discuss the derivation of steps (iii and iii) and the derivation of steps (iii) which were mentioned after eq. (a) in general, the model presented in this work is a little too simplified . in the context of cuprate superconductivity, the model taken for this work is still rather oversimplified. It is possible, however, to develop intuitions of a more realistic setting which requires fluctuations of the spin background and other interactions between fermions. All variables are defined in section (iii) , there is, besides, the first two points in the expression are: the kinetic energy of the two subjects.

Hence, the eq. a. – (eq. – ca) and eq. - (eq. cc) – and thus the energy equation is further reduced by varying the values of xmath35. The relation between xmath137 and xmath152 is an implicit function of xmath155 and xmath155, both xmath155 and xmath155 are dependent on four phases – xmath157, xmath158, xmath159, xmath160. and thus the minimization of xmath164 can be further reduced by varying the varying energy of xmath35. j . . tranquada, b . . sternlieb, j . d. axe, y . nakamura, and s . uchida, Nature, (London) 561 (1996).
