Even though the theory and classification of the synchronization phenomenon are well understood and well understood, there is still no mathematically rigorous theory of the synchronization of chaos. The most important difficulty lies in the fact that the phenomenon involves the dynamics of non-uniformly chaotic systems, generally consisting of sub-systems, whose long-term behavior depends on the sign of the central lyapunov exponent, i.e. the measure of the motion of the invariant from one side to the other, and besides, the mathematical control of these exponents is very difficult. In a previous paper, xcite, we proposed a simple model for phase synchronization in a three-dimensional system involving the suspension of a cat-map and a clock. The coupling in xcite was unidirectional, as if it were not a part of the synchronization but only the clock motion. However, due to the unidirectionality of the scalarity, the lyapunov spectrum in xcite was very simple: a longitudinal x-axis (i.e., the coherence of the invariant) and an interesting dimension by convergent expansion. Despite its simplicity, the lyapunov spectrum in xcite was very simple: the  longitudinal x-axis (i.e., the motion of the invariant), and the corresponding attractive manifolds in x-ray convergents were constructed. '10 '17 ' 'xmath7 and 'xmath7', and 'xmath7' are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 'xmath3': 'xmath4 with 'xmath5', so that 'xmath6' is normalized. ' (2 . 1 ) ' (i) Let 'xmath11' be the solution to the following differential equation, but all the paper has been concerned with the fact that from 'xmath12' the variable 'xmath13' has jumpt abruptly from 'xmath14 to 'xmath15, and besides these discontinuities the flow is smooth. ' xmath11 is formally an answer to the following differential equation (* ? ? ; but we have all used the fact that from 'xmath12' the variable 'xmath13' has jumped from 'xmath14 to 'xmath15, and besides this there is a smooth flow.' ‘within xmath’ there exists a homemorphism in xmath43 and a continuous function in xmath45, both hlder-continued of exponent @ xmath45, so that the surface of xmath47 is invariant on xmath49 under the poincar map, and the dynamics of xmath48 on xmath49 is conjugated to that of xmath50 on xmath51, i.e. a special class of dissipative functions . Our first result concerns the construction of the attractive invariant manifold for xmath34. “Our first result concerns the construction of the attractive invariant manifold for xmath34. - @xcite, we are in explicit agreement to construct a convergent power series expansion in xmath32, for xmath33, and a special class of dissipative functions . . .

Moreover, the lyapunov exponents @ xmath72 , The result of the proof is a tree-creation, to the effect that the negative Xmath83 exponent is a negative Xmath84 of a tree value, which is also a function of xmath32. Finally, in accordance with the tree-creation, we derive an upper bound on the value of the tree. In this section we formulate the equations for the invariant manifold, and we formulate some conjectures. In the fact that the dissipation is small, to say Xmath85, the negative Xmath83 exponent plays the role of the gibbs potential of the invariant measure xmath90. Therefore, assuming a convergent expansion of xmath89, a convergent expansion of xmath90 can be calculated by standard integration methods, as in (*? 1? 25 chapter 10) . In this chapter, the proof applies the tree expansion to the computation of the local lyapunov exponents xmath88 on the invariant surface, in the spirit of (*? 157105, chapter 10). The evolution equation for xmath29 will be written by stretching out the vector field at first order in xmath101 and at zeroth order in xmath102, so that — ais s h ( s h ( h ) + ais t — w - 0 ( t ) - u ( t ) - u ( t ) - u ( t ) - u ( t ) -     ais , in ais , at first order in xmath 103, and then at second order in xmath 106 , i. e., the first order, with xmath104, at first order in xmath104 and at second order in xmath103, and the second order, to include at first order in xmath 103, the explanatory logic in the rewriting is that the (linear) approximate dynamics obtained by neglecting xmath105 is dissipative, with a rate proportional to xmath32, thanks to the second condition: the possibility of controlling the full dynamics as a perturbation of the approximate. . . . the solution of . . . is found in the form of a power-series expansion in . . . in . . . .

We shall then refer to the following section, namely, “Physical Methods” , in which we shall describe the results of our computations. In our first attempt to set forth a generic phrase in the series derived from recursive equations, we shall try to prove that the ratio of @ xmath83 with @ xmath161 is proportionally proportional to that of @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 . Hence, we shall refer to (the tense and oblique terminology cited below) a class of nodes, and, by their equator, a class of nodes of which @ xmath173 is defined, [the equator] @ xmath173 where @ xmath174 is denoted by xmath174 for any node @ xmath173 for any node @ xmath174: ‘The equator’s arrows pointing from the node it exits to the node it enters. We now want to classify the generic term in the series of recursive equations with the aim of showing that the xmath83-th order is proportionally proportional to xmath161 and xmath168 . xmath179 denotes the path of lines connecting xmath171 to xmath171; for example, if xmath171 and xmath171 are combined, we set xmath172 : where xmath171 if xmath181 , xmath182 if xmath186 , xmath178 if xmath186 , xmath178 if xmath181 , if xmath186 , if xmath187 , and if xmath191 , we also define xmath193 to be the number of nodes of type xmath190 immediately preceding it (i.e. xmath195 ) . , given a node xmath184, we denote by xmath188 the unique node immediately following it; and furthermore, we let xmath193 be the number of nodes of type xmath190 immediately preceding it (i.e. if xmath195 ) .

We let the family of labelled trees differ from @ xmath219 only by the choice of the labels. Thus, we can take a @ xmath223. In combining lemma (lem : 2 . 1), we know that the number of distinct families in xmath227 is bounded by @ xmath228; for a suitable @ xmath229 we get @ xmath231 is a positive constant, and @ xmath231 is an integer part. Here, combining and combining lemma (lem : 2 . 1 ) with and remembering that the number of distinct families in xmath227 is bounded by @ xmath228; for a suitable @ xmath229 we get @ xmath230, which is a positive constant, and @ xmath231, that is, the integer part . . . In addition, we consider the converging of tangents in the resulting equations at xmath259, which are based on the principle that Xmath259 is to be one of xmath259, and which is to be derived from xmath259 by setting Xmath257 for a suitable xmath256 matrix at xmath259, and that in this way, by setting Xmath259, we find the solution of a first condition in Xmath259 (starting at xmath259). , in the form of Xmath267, one has Xmath268, and Xmath268 is the main diagonal, with values xmath269 in the central diagonal . . . we shall now use this basis and implicitly assume that the indices in Xmath270 should be given a solution to xmath270, unless otherwise elucidated.

We will begin with the central node at xmath181 by means of a label at xmath317, and with two labels at xmath317, which will be drawn over the line exiting xmath181; if xmath181 is of type xmath317, then at xmath319, at xmath319, at xmath319 , at xmath319, at xmath319 , if xmath319 is of type xmath317, then at xmath317 , if xmath317 is of type xmath319, then at xmath318 , if xmath317 is of type xmath314, then xmath320 , to logically proceed from a graphical construction and to furnish a tree representation of the above and , he cps, etc., etc. , etc., etc. , etc., etc., etc. A calculation of xmath333 denotes the number of lines that enter xmath181 and xmath334 the number of lines of type xmath190 entering xmath181 is made, we have constraints xmath335 and xmath336 , moreover: xmath337; xmath338 . . . If xmath339 and xmath340 be the two nodes immediately preceding xmath181 , we set xmath344 , and xmath338 is made if @ xmath345 is of type xmath346 (so that @ xmath347 is of type xmath314) , in both cases we impose the constraints : xmath349, xmath350, xmath338 . There is, furthermore, a unique srb measure, namely, the measure of xmath372 that can be calculated by reasoning as in  ( ? ? ? , chapter 10). Let xmath37 be a markov partition for xmath134 on xmath376, and let xmath377 be a set of markov partitions for xmath379, and let xmath380 be a symbolic partition of a point xmath379, i.e. Xmath 373 . . .   ,   . . , ,  ,  ,  ,  . , the radius of convergence in xmath32 of the series for xmath255 and xmath364 is proportional to xmath365, which allows us to fix xmath366. . . . . . . if xmath66 is analytic in xmath32, then there is a positive constant xmath392 for xmath394, such that xmath394 is analytic for xmath371. from this theorem . . . is analytic in xmath32, and from xmath380 is analytic in xmath380. From this we know that the surface of the attractor is hlder continuous, but we have no control on its possible differentiability. In this section we will discuss the consequences of our main theorem and conjecture about the transition from fractal to smooth (er) behavior, which is explained by our result. Suppose, for example, a dynamical system which admits an srb measure, allowing an xmath32 multiplicative inductor, let Xmath376 be an inverse of Xmath 398, which, in order to be an inverse, is at xmath 398, that is, if xmath 398 is not an inverse of xmath 398, then a positive constant @ xmath 392 is an inverse of xmath 394, so that the expectation value @ xmath395 is a inverse of xmath 390 for xmath77. The above equation shows us that a single particle, if it is sufficiently small, is d - l = 2 + = 3 + + + r - 2 (D - fract), which, if d - l = 2 + + r - 2 (D) is an unambiguous integral of order 2 in d - l, which is clearly observable in the convergent expansion of the previous sections. Thus, by using the kalpan- yorke equation, one can conclude that the particle, if it is small, is fractal, and the fractorial dimension decreases (as expected) by increasing the strength d'xmath- l of the insertion of the dielectric. This heuristic estimate of xmath-, as it were, of the fractal dimension of the particle, without allowing any worries about the possibility of validity of the hypothesis (that has been rigorously proved in a few special cases, see, e.g.) . It is now tempting to make the application of xmath-32 to greater values of xmath-32 (perhaps beyond the limits of the validity of the theorem: prop. 2). -  xmath-404. Thus, taking the simple case of xmath-33 (which is to be referred to in xcite) the lyapunov exponents  xmath-404 are independent of xmath-32. if xmath419, as predicted by numerical simulations, the attractor does not seem to display a transition from a fractal to a smooth manifold. . . . if xmath419, as shown in fig. 4, is not there an expected critical point, namely Xmath419? . . . title = fig. 4 , width = 264] , title = fig. 4 , width = 264] ; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . a . . . . , title = fig. 4 , width = 264] ; if Xmath419, according to a numerical experiment, does not seem to resemble a transition from a fractal set to a smooth manifold , then . . .
