, it has a very complicated form, an integral with variable limits, whose integrand is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function. " The absolutely continuous part of the transition density of the symmetric markov random flight with unit speed in euclidean space, by unit speed, in euclidean space (see xcite, xcite, xcite, and xcite, respectively) was presented in (? , ? ? ] formulas (? ?) and (3421) in which they have an explicit form (see xcite, xcite, xcite, and xcite, respectively) , the deepest part of the transition density of the symmetric markov random flight with unit speed in the euclidean space (see xcite, xcite, xcite, and xcite, respectively) is presented in (* , cite, cite, cite for the markovian case and cite, cite for the non-markovian case), the markov random flight in the three-dimensional space xmath1 is, undoubtedly, the most difficult and difficult to study . . . . while in the lower, even-dimensional space xmath9 and xmath10, one could determine the distributions of the motions in explicit form (see xcite, cite, cite, respectively) , only in the important three-dimensional case, only a few results are known . . . the presence of these two parameters, i.e. the speed and the intensity of the motions, in any process of random if the circumstances of the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight are considered, in addition to the immense theoretical and applied importance of the problem of the description of the finite velocity of the motion in space, the latter might be given some consideration for investigation. In this way, the importance of the inverse fourier transformation of the unconditional characteristic function is expressed in section 4, and the error in this formula is the order of the order of the whole of the four units. Various asymptotic formulas could be obtained by using the characteristic functions. In the case of the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight, there are, in particular, important results for its characteristic functions. (In particular, the closed-form expression for the laplace transform of the characteristic function is obtained by different methods: in ( * ? ? ? ) and (4), for unit speed, and in ( * ? ? - formula (45)) (for arbitrary speed), and so on. This formula shows that the density is discontinuous at the border, but that it is discontinuous at the edge. This formula indicates that the density is discontinuous at the edge, but it has an order xmath6. This is the main idea of the derivation of series of descriptions of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three change directions, referred to in the following section. the first point in these analyses is the possibility of examining the inverse fourier transform of the unconditional characteristic function, which yields an asymptotic formula for the transition density of the process, which is presented in section 5 . It follows that at arbitrary time instant, for instance, the particle is located in a closed three-dimensional ball of radius xmath21 located at the origin xmath21. In the above equation, we merely determine the accuracy of the resulting formula and show that it gives a good approximation on short intervals whose lengths depend on the intensity of the switches. In section 6, we calculate the accuracy of the resulting formula and show that it gives a good approximation on small intervals whose lengths depend on the intensity of the switches. The error in the obtained asymptotic formula is represented by the interval xmath6. Consider the stochastic motion of a particle that, at the first time instant xmath13, begins from the origin xmath13 of the Euclidean space xmath1 and moves with some constant speed xmath15 (note that xmath15 is treated as the constant norm of the velocity) . At arbitrary time xmath20 the particle is, with probability 1, located in the closed three-dimensional ball of radius xmath21 centred at the origin xmath22 : xmath24 considers the probability distribution function xmath24 of the process xmath4 , where xmath24 is the infinitesimal element in the space xmath1 . At xmath36 the part of the distribution of xmath26 which corresponds to this case is concentrated in the interior xmath35 of the ball and forms its absolutely continuous component. Here we obtain the series representations of the characteristic functions of the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight Xmath4 in two and three-dimensional changes of direction. As its singular part is clearly expressed by () , we are more inclined to study the asymptotic properties of the absolute part of density (). as the absolute part is explicit in its () , we mainly work on deriving the respective asymptotic formulas for the absolute part of density () of the density. the one-sided part of density () is given by the formula:  xmath43, where  is some positive function absolutely continuous in  xmath43, and  md 4 is the heavy-side unit-step function given by md 4 . in this section we obtain the series representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three shifts. As mentioned above, there are a number of closed-form expressions for the characteristic functions (both conditional and unconditional) of the three-dimensional symmetric markov random flight @ xmath4 . asymptotic behavior of the transition density (struc2) on small time intervals is the main subject of this research. - eq-symbol - alpha - a -  f n - (c  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert - -   s   right (c  left (text - arctg   frac  c  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert -   left -   left ( text  arctg   frac  c  vert   c  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert     left (  left )     left - ( left - text  arctg  frac   left  c  vert   alpha  vert   left )  n + 1  right [1   left ,  left ]       mathcal l ...                t ,  ] ; c  vert  boldsymbol  alpha  vert )  k     ,  k     -        left (k +  frac  1  2   right)  k          -      left (k +  frac  1  2   left (k +  frac  1  2   right) -      mathcal l - I just happened to mention that there is a formula in xmath79:                                                        left                   left   left (            left        left      left           left ( text  arct                    left  (       left  left (          left)           left   left (      text the result is given by the following formula.

The following formula, [7] is true. We do not invert any term of the series separately. . . . . so that, although there are the inverse fourier transforms of the whole series (char2] and [7] , it is impossible to invert any of the terms, and therefore, it is impossible to obtain closed-form expressions for the respective conditions. . . . . . . ‘ The =_-=1-xe-—>> In view of = =‘char1’, we have = ‘xmath96’.
