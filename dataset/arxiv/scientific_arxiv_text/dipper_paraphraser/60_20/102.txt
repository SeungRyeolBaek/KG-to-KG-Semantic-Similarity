if there is no correct model, then any effort for parameter estimation or prediction is useless. In many areas of science, machine learning is involved. Given a set of candidates, the goal of model selection is to choose a model that is a most accurate and accurate representation of the observed data and captures the underlying regularity. When we define the goodness of fit (Gof) and the generality (Cogn) of the models, we give a balance between the _goodness-of-fit_ and the _complexity_ of the models. The generality / Complexity reflects how well a model can capture the regularity of the data. For models of greater complexity than necessary, they may be overfitted and underfitted, while those that are too simple will underfit and have low Gof / Cogn . The skewed - model (Cogn) measures the accuracy of the model on the unobserved, or how well the model (). In contrast to re-sampling methods, the process of selecting a model is performed with a knowledge criteria such as ac, bic and bic are not re-validated to calculate the error of the model on the observed data. The information criteria are considered as a criterion that estimates the generalisation error by penalizing the error of the model on observed data. in bic and bic, for example, the narrower the parameter of penalisation favours simpler models, whereas bic favors larger ones. In bic, for instance, the closer penalisation is to the simple models, while in bic it is more efficient to apply the acquiescence method to the large number of samples. In this way, data is mapped from the original space to a higher dimension, the resembling hilbert space (rkhs). the idea behind this mapping is to transform the nonlinear relationships between the points of the original space into an easy-to-compute linear model in the feature space. he says he’s pleased with that, and in the proof of xmath he’s satisfied with that. But the literature on kernel methods has tended to be devoted to kernel selection and tuning kernel parameters, but very little has been done on kernel-based judging . . . in classical methods, the performance of the judging criteria is tested theoretically, by demonstrating consistency where the sample size tends to infinity, and empirically by means of simulated studies for finite sample sizes. In this study we investigate a kernel-based information criterion for ridge-regression models . . . In a kernel-based approach, one can measure the value of the kernel parameter to be assessed . . . some of the reasons for this are: the size of the model to be examined for the sake of under- / over-fitting in . . . (For example, . . . . This is the case with the classical methods. They are usually applied to the basic method of trial and error, which is always infinity, and then based on simulated experiments for finite samples. In this work we investigate the kernel parameter of a ridge regression. We want to find out whether the kernel parameter is adequate to meet the prediction of the data on the given hand or the unseen data. Van emden et al. @ xcite developed the covariance information criterion (cic) for model selection in kernel principal components because it outperformed the results in orthogonal linear regression. As a result, van emden @ xcite pointed out that a desirable model is the one with the least number of dependent variables. The eigenvalues of kric and the eigenvalues of the kernel were used to determine the regularization parameters in kernel logistic regression and support vector machines (svm) . rosipal et al. @ xcite developed a covariance-based indicator (cic) for model selection in the principal component of the kernel, for its success over the aic and the bic in orthogonal linear regression. demyanov et al. @ xcite developed a chiasm criterion (cic) for model selection in the kernel, because it showed an outperformity in results compared with aic and bic in orthogonal linear regression . The researcher called it the kic method. In our study we have developed a new variable—the variance of a Gaussian process model (GPR, @xcite) and a kernel-based information complexity (Ki-Comp)—to obtain a complexity measure from the combination of kernels defined on the parameters. The methodology we have devised is as follows: defining a complexity term which measures the interdependence of the parameter parameters helps one select the most appropriate model. In our study, we define a new variable—the variance of a kernel—and obtain a complexity measure from the additive combination of kernels defined on the parameter parameters. We also add a dimension to the complexity measure, in the form of a kinematical order of kernels defined on the parameters. Although we have no theoretical proof for the consistency of kic, we apply an empirical evaluation of its effectiveness to synthetic and real datasets, and produce state-of-the-art results compared with leave-one-out-of-threshold validation, kernel-based icomp, and the maximal log marginal likelihood in gpr. That is, the tree-derived kic is described in the section “Pyramid ”; the kic is compared with other factors, in this section “Pyramid exp” , we consider the performance of kic through experiments . . . the inferences minimize the squared errors, @ x, ” . . . from kernel-ridge regression. In this section, “Pyramid ” refers to a brief description of the methods to which kic is compared, in which we examine the performance of kic through a series of experiments. The axiom kic is described in detail in section . . . of kic. We assume that the error, noise vector . . . is an xmath1-dimensional vector whose elements are drawn i. . d. , whereas . . . xmath13 is an xmath1-dimensional identity matrix and xmath16 is an unknown variance . . . “Did you think that “your” choice of the two fitting terms was appropriate?” “No,” the answer was, “all this has nothing to do with “Your,” or “Your” choice of the two terms, since in reality he uses “Y” for a “K” (that is to say, the end is the Greek word “th”—where th is the period.) Hence the following equation—The Regressions of the Trained Line”—is chosen. The Regressions of the Trained Line are given in terms of X.13—22—in kernel, a ridge regression, krr, of the data matrix X.9 is non-linearly transformed in rkhs by a feature map with X.17. Thus, the sloping estimator (e.g. @xcite) is chosen, which excludes X.13. Xmath29 , using xmath30 for the calculation of krr is similar to regularizing the regression function instead of the coefficients, where the objective function is : xmath31 and xmath32 denotes the relevant rkhs . a desirable model is one with the least dependent variables . . . the description of van emden @ xcite for the complexity of a random vector is based on the interactions among random variables in the corresponding corresponding covariance matrix. The main contribution of this study is to introduce a new kernel-based information criterion (kic) for the selection of the model in kernel-based regression. . . . the definition of van emden @ xcite for the complexity of a random vector is based on the interaction of random variables in the corresponding covariance matrix. . . in the next subsection we develop these terms. I look at the definition of the complexity measure. The larger the values of xmath44, the greater the dependency between the covariates. If and only if the covariates are independent. At xmath44, if and only if the covariates are independent. To overcome these drawbacks, Bozodgan and Haughton have introduced an icomp information criterion, based on the maximal complexity of covariance, which is an upper bound on the complexity of the equation: @ xmath47 this complexity measure is proportional to the estimated arithmetic and geometric mean of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The complexity of the equation changes with orthonormal transformations, because it depends on the coordinates of the random variable vectors @ xmath46 @ xcite. By adjusting the recursive form of this complexity measure, he derived the scale of a ridge estimator—a ridge estimator—based on the kernel of the kernel estimator. Here he showed how to define the sufficiency of the inertia of the measure, and how it is calculated. We will now focus on the calculation of the complexity measure in the next section. Besides icomp and gpr, the measure of complexity is computed on a ridge estimator’s covariance—say, xmath54—of xmath54—for xmath9 of xmath10—with the view that the maximum extent of the axis is not at all important. In contrast to icomp and gpr, the complexity measure of kic is defined by the hilbert–schmidt norm of the covariance matrix, at xmath53. In contrast to icomp and gpr, the complexity measure of kic is based on the equivalence of the kernel with a view to the maximum extent of the entropy in the joint entropy. [Eq. 2] If a number of parameters is necessary for the parameterization of a model, then a variation of a kernel is needed, and we introduce a variable-wise variance in the form of an additive combination of kernels for each parameter of the model. In order to obtain a degree of complexity that depends on the magnitude of a kernel, we take into account the following proportional factorization: xmath55. xmath57 is the parameterization of the kernel ridge; xmath57 is the vectorisation of xmath58; xmath59 the solution of krr is given by xmath60. The function xmath67 is thus written as follows: xmath68 where xmath6 is the prefix of j -th component of vectors xmath65 and xmath66 . The parameter @ xmath72 is given by @ xmath72, and thus @ xmath69 is equal to @ xmath74 in equation eq. g. The xmath72 parameter , given by @ xmath72, is given by @ xmath72, and so @ xmath69 in equation eq. g is equal to @ xmath74 . . . gretton et al. . . . . , if Xmath80 and Xmath81 are simple, as /sent> see. Xmath80 is a linear operator, xmath88, such that: xmath89  end  aligned     ] where xmath90 denotes the tensor product, xmath91 = e [k ( cdot, x ) ] $ ], for xmath90, and associated kernel function xmath36. . . . the hsic measure for separable rkhs, the cross-covariance operator, and he is called: xmath90  end  aligned  ] , which he explains in a more detail. We calculate the hsic on a covariance matrix associated with the parameters of the model, and if and only if xmath104, Xmath106, and xmath7 are independent (theorem 4 in Xcite). - From xmath104 the constant is a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix, - xmath105, and the trace of the hs norm of the covariance matrix is equal to : -  -  -      -  -  -   -   -  -  - 2  - k   alpha i -  - 2  -  end            -      - kiccd - kicc - kiccc1 The minimum kic is the best model ... if we ... /sent> ... a complexity measure that is stable under changes in variance (and similar to the icomp criterion) ... a penalized log-like likelihood - Persistent (qoll) in krr for the normally distributed data is defined by:  End  outlined Xcite denotes a snaie, aie, aie, aie, aie aie aie aie; aie aie aie-ie, aieien, aie, aie , aie , aietonded , aie cv and aie, respectively , aie, and iey ev, ai, addressings of these methods, like icomp and gpr, is time consuming at xcite. . . . For example,  xmath111 , math123 is the computational cost of math123 the number of parameter combinations , math124 is the processing time ... . The reason to compare kic with icomp and gpr is that in all these methods the complexity measure computes the interdependency of the parameters in the covariance matrix in different ways. We hereby consider the kernel-based closed form of loocv for linear regression which was introduced by Xcite: xmath127  - 1  i-h y   2  2  2   n   end  aligned  ] where xmath129 is the hat matrix. maximizing the log of marginal likelihood (gpr) is a kernel-based method of regression. The log of marginal likelihood is the primary criterion for gpr, because it balances between the lack of fit and the complexity of the model. maximizing the log of marginal likelihood is the ideal parameter for a model selection. - icomp : - the kernel-based icomp introduced in @xcite is a set of information criteria for selecting models and is defined by the equation - xmath136, where - xmath50, - xmath39 is elaborated in equations - cicomp , - sigma-icomp . - in this section we examine the performance of kic on synthetic and real data, and compare it with competing methods of modeling. - Figure - Sinc-second, which shows the Sinc function and -'/' a fit was obtained for the ridge parameter of @xmath143, and the kic was computed for the 100 random data points, with different standard deviations , @xmath143 , in one test of the perturbed data. The following experiments were performed: (a) demonstrates the effect of kic on complexity, (b) demonstrates the effect of kic on sparseness and mse on training sets, (c) demonstrates how kic and mse change when the sample size and the noise level of the data increase, (c) demonstrates how kic and mse on training sets change when the sample size and the noise level in the data change; (d) evaluates the consistency of kic in predicting the choice of parameters. The results are shown in the figure  co . la kic. kic balances between these two values. The model generated with xmath144 is over-complex, whereas xmath145 is simpler, and xmath145 is less complex, while the goodness-of-fit is adversely affected. ‘The influence of training the sample size was examined by comparing the size of the four experiments, @ xmath146 , , , , , , , , , – a = @ xmath146 , a = @ xmath148 , a = @ xmath148 , a = @ xmath149 , a = @ xmath150 . The mean squared error, mse, mse, @ xmath151 , is shown in figure [kic-mse] . . . , the noise and the sample size have no effect on the mean squared error for choosing the best model . . . the gaussian kernel was used for the @ xmath151. . . . the kic and mse of the different @ xmath151, @ xmath150 . the kic and mse of the different @ xmath151, @ xmath153 , * [29] , , , , the gaussian kernel was used with @ xmath151 . . . . Observed in general, the mse of all the methods is larger when the nsr is high, @ xmath159, and smaller for the greater of the two training sets (100 samples) . . . (see Fig. 3). The effect of using the gaussian kernel, -155, versus the cauchy kernel, -155 was investigated. The kernel, @ xmath155, and @ xmath158, respectively, were computed for the basis of the kernel-based descriptors, icomp, kic, gpr, and loocv . . . - e - gpr - gpr - gpr - e - gpr - e - e - gpr with sent>. all the methods have smaller mse values using the gaussian kernel versus the cauchy kernel . The Cauchy kernel produces results comparable to kic, but with a standard deviation close to zero . . . we considered four experiments of this kind, each with an xmath163 sample, and one with an xmath164 sample . . . the parameters to tune or tune are shown in Figure 2 (Locv) for locv, and in Figure 3 (Kic) for kic. These parameters are in figure 2 (Locv) for locv, and in figure 3 (Kic) for kic. The frequency of tuning and tuning is shown in Figure 2 (Locv) for locv, and in Figure 3 (Kic) for kic. The more concentrated the frequency, the more consistent the criterion. But for the abalone, the task was to estimate the age of abalones. We simulated the arm motion from the point of view of these factors. The degree of nonlinearity was determined by the degree of bias (in this case, n), and the level of noise (unpredictability) in the data was either moderate (m) or high (h). The kin family and the puma family were reasonable simulations of a robot arm in which combinations of these variables were considered, such as whether the movement of the arm was nonlinear (n) or fairly linear (f) and whether the level of noise (unpredictability) was medium (m) or high (h) . . . in the kin family, the datasets in question were: kin-8fm, kin-8fh, kin-8fh, kin-8fh, kin-8fh, and kin-8nh . . . in the kin-8 family, the datasets in question contained: kin-8fm, kin-8fm, kin-8nh, and kin-8nh. The data set is drawn in a box-plot which is based on the figures “abalone,” “kin-family”, and “puma-family” as the data set. The results are shown in a figure titled “Amalone”, “Kic1,” “Kic2,” and “Kic3,” on the three data sets, for the abalone dataset. The kic1 and “kic3” correspond to the same kic1 and “kic3”; while kic3 and “kic4” had similar values, larger than for the other methods. For the abalone dataset, similar results were obtained for kic and loocv, which were better than icomp, and for the smallest mse value obtained by sgpr. The best results of all three data sets were obtained by kic, and the second best results were obtained by loocv. The best results were obtained by kic, and the second best were achieved by loocv. Kic is equivalent to icomp and better than gpr for puma - 8 nm. kic is equal to icomp and better than gpr for puma - 8 nm. Except for puma - 8 nm, kic gets better results than gpr, icomp, and loocv. kic, for example, and kic, for example, are much better than gpr, icomp and loocv for puma - 8 nm. whereas, for puma - 8 nm, the median mse value is better than kic, and kic is even better than gpr for the kin - 8 nm. The difference between kic 1 and kic 2 is that kic 2 has a larger mse than kic 1 in the case of datasets with high noise. The difference in kic 2 is a function of the variance which it takes into account in its formula (the eq : kic2), rather than of xmath16 in the equation. In this respect kic 2 has a higher sensitivity to noise than kic 1 in the case of noise that is moderate compared to puma - 8fh, and puma - 8nh, where noise is high. We present an empirical argument that kic outperforms loocv (the eq : kic2), and in comparison with the estimation (kic's closed form formula) and with gpr (which is based on the kernel's scalar formula) and pcr (seeing that the parameter is not defined in the eq : kic's ), so that the real contribution of the parameters is obscured. In this work we used fnsnf grants (p1tip2 , pbtip2 , 14005). This work was supported by the ptsnf grant (ptsnf 14005). In these experiments kic efficiently balances the accuracy of the fit and complexity of the model, is robust against noise (though for higher noise we have a larger confidence interval), and sample size, is consistent in tuning and selecting the ridge and kernel parameters, and has significantly smaller or comparable mean squared values in comparison to competing methods, while generating stronger regressors. We want to thank arthur gretton and zoltn szab for the fruitful discussions.
