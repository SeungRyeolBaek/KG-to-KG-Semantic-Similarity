The experimental investigation of mesoscopic interference, on the one hand, and on the other, of the discrete spectral spectrum of interacting systems, namely, of coulomb-blockaded, quantum-dimens. The coulomb-blockade oscillations in the two-terminal band dot conductivity do xcite. In a stable state, e.g., in a quantum-dimens, and in a continuum of states, e.g., in a quantum-wire or an open ring, generally give rise to asymmetric lines characteristic of the fano effect. Xcite a theoretical treatment of the fano effect was first developed for scattering, for scattering, in optical spectroscopy, and in Xcite, but now fano resonances have been used in a multitude of mesoscopic systems . . . , in mesoscopic transport, the energy-dependent conductance of a fano resonance can be modulated by a magnetic flux applied through the region enclosed by the ring. It is a polarity of light: it is the polarity of light, and is measured in the electron tube. In the tachymetrical regime, fano resonances are introduced into the resonant-oblique regime. In the tachymetrical structure, the fano phenomenon arises from the interference of the acoustic resonances of a quantum dot with the acoustic resonances of a narrow resonance with the acoustic resonances of a wavy type, with a line of fano. kobayashi et al., according to this definition, the magnetic field allowed them to adjust the relative phase of the non-resonant (ring) and the resonant (dot) path, and periodically change the asymmetry of the fano curves. a large fano peak was observed in a ductiature of a cobalt atom on a gold surface. The paper is composed of the following parts: in section ii, the experimental realization of the coupled-dot structure is presented, and a low temperature transport calculation is made. In section ii, we will give a model of the ring-dot system, in the form of scattering matrix, and link it to the Fano formula, eq. eqn1 . , and section v: the limitations of the model. c) Three currents, simultaneously measured, @ xmath0 (dotted lines) and @ xmath14 (solid lines) when @ xmath15 = 50mv, 46mv, 42mv , this is the present peak of the dot. The thickest line indicates the strongest coupling. (c) The current from the ring to the ring shows the typical asymmetrical lines characteristic of the fano effect . The vertical white lines show the peak positions of the cb by averaging the electrostatic coupling between the ring and the dot . The mass of the dot from the ring and the ring is measured by a source of a certain amount of eq. eqn. in p. . the paper is divided into three sections: in a sphere, in a double-layered system, with a high-quality two-dimensional conductive gas ( 2d) , 33 nm in thickness, the density of the eqn. . . the thickness of the white lines shows the peak positions of the dot by a certain amount of eqn. “A symmetrical ac bias voltage was applied to the two leads of the ring at a frequency of 21 Hz and, as before, at a frequency of 14 Hz. These three currents constituted, subject to spin degeneracy, the following three currents (assuming spin degeneracy): @xmath24   %. A narrow stripe of tgc was used to separate the ring from the dot by completely eliminating the ring. Details of the fabrication procedure are contained in ref. (b) and fig. (b) . . . . the tgc was screened out on the tgc; and the afm was again used to split the top gate into individual split gates (tq4 , tq3 , tq4 , tq4 , tq1 , tq2 ) as indicated by the gray lines. t . . .  .  a symmetrical ac bias voltage was applied to the two leads of the ring at a frequency of 21hz, and the same time , t . .  mathrm  dot    v   mathrm  dot           h                       h    left . . . At the bottom of the range are measurements of the k coulomb diamonds. (c and d). g, c and d . Our system allows us to assess the magnitude of the mismatch between the two ring structures, due to the coupling of the gate electrodes and the direct coupling of the current. We use the magnetic field to calibrate the coherence of the ring to the dot, which, in its entanglement with one of the arms of the ring, acts as a fano-splitter (see below). g, our figure - Figure (fig 1), c and d - Figures from which we calculate the energy of xmath3 and xmath3 when the central gate cut off the channel between the two structures is shown in Figure - Figure (c) and d) . Moreover, the magnetic field is used to modulate the absorption of the ring and the impediment of the dot between the two structures, without changing the coupling and the voltage of the gateway . I think the same is true with the top electrodes of the top electrode, which allow us to tune the electron density in the ring or the number of electrons in the dot, over a large range, without changing the relationship between source and drain. Moreover, the gate on the top electrode changes neither the characteristic amplitude nor the phase of the ab-switching in the ring, nor does it affect the electrical conductivity of the ring. We find that the same is true with the top electrodes of the top electrode. In this case, the structure is more stable, and the gate voltages are a smaller one. And thus the currents @ xmath0 (dotted lines) and @ xmath14 (solid lines) at xmath37mt (top panel ) are not substantially modified by the increase in the current at xmath14, except that the source-drain coupling of the dot is influenced a little, which leads to a greater current for the strongest coupling. In order to couple the two structures we increase the current by xmath15 . "Brotherly resembling a round or other, it has been shown that a round ring is a typical fano system. This ring combines a magnet with a copper-wire coupling. In the figure [Fig. 2] (a) you can see the curves of @xmath0 and @xmath14 as a function of @xmath4 and the different gate voltages, and, of course, the coefficients of the inverse of each other are changed. Note that we have increased the coefficient of @xmath41 and @xmath42 from 0mv to 200mv in order to create the channel from the ring to the dot, and in the following way more negative values are needed to close this channel. In this case, the behaviour of the ring current increases by half a flux, and it is so that the dot, which is now as a result of a tidal dip, decreases by a factor of two. Note, too, that the voltages for @xmath41 and @xmath42 were increased from 0mv to 200mv to optimize the wire coupling from the ring to the dot. From this the vertical lines of a peak map are again the locations of the six peaks at xmath42, as shown in Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. Fig. d. we obtain a unitary scattering matrix of a general barrier, where xmath50 is the reflection probability and xmath51 are free phase parameters. This is explained by the fact that xmath1 measures the difference between the two parallel lines xmath46 and xmath47 and the difference between the two centimetres is so great that the dot exhibits a close resonant for all six peaks that are depicted.

For this closed-off structure, the amplitude is limited to the circumference of the circle, and resonances arise when - xmath62 and - xmath61 are different. [13] The following Fig. [14] illustrates this by a distribution of the amplitude of xmath72, which is determined by the amplitudes @xmath67 and @xmath69. The amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the amplitudes of the incoming and incoming of the wire and the incoming and - at the incoming of the wire.

For Xmath77 and Xmath71 , the coherence and response are at xmath75, where xmath76 is the coherence parameter . [ Fig. b] the inner space of the graph is taken from a reference matrix of xmath72 . The ring-dot structure as a result of the experiment can now be modeled by placing the transfer matrix @ xmath95 in one of the arms of the ring, as shown in Fig. c. cva.cj5a.vq>, 1I3122a, 222a, 23282c23d3a, 30-dpnpnnbrev2rmperfecture-hper in eq. ft=d, wrvergdot vrcaré of the same gate in a closed-loop structure (wr-dot ) when the electron passes through the opposite side, it acquires the resonant (es-dpr) , math98 math98 math98 math99 (different signs for clock and anticlock), math99 math100 math100 math10 math100 math10 math10 math90. In the following, the three terminal junctions are considered to be symmetrical beam splitter, which is described by the unitary scattering matrix xcite, math9 , this unitary scattering matrix math math 9 , which is based on the homogeneous scattering matrix xcite math9, e) for comparison a similar section of the measured form of xmath0 (as a function of b and xmath111) is shown in Fig. [F] ., e. by a d-direction, for example, a very good fit is found, which demonstrates that our simple model precisely reflects the experimental situation of the ring-dot structure. this agreement is robust against variations in xmath50, but sensitive to changes in xmath84, because xmath84 is linked to the fano factor xmath10 . We have found xmath112 in agreement with the experimental procedure, where we have optimized the ring-dot structure to produce the most symmetric fano line. this process is qualitatively similar to the experimental results in ref. , where the whole structure, which has a dot embedded in one arm, is considered to be a fano scatterer. This result is qualitatively similar to ref. , where the whole structure, with the dot embedded in one arm, is considered to be a fano scatterer. The xmath10 parameter is a measure of the relation of the magnetic flux through the ring to a certain extent, and is therefore limited to the real xmath10 parameter describing only the fano effect of one arm of the ring with a dot interposed. ‘ev’. This transition is more complete in the experimental data, where for ev’s, there are only small ab-like oscillations on the eq’.’ – if ‘ev’ is lowered, @ xmath11 is reduced, while the white areas on eq’111 seem to disappear. The last figure to the right shows ev’11 with ev’11–70, where ab–like oscillations are seen, but where at ev’ 11–90 the traces are drawn along the coulomb resonance marked with arrows in ev’5–a, and the difference between the value of @ xmath11 and the value of @ xmath14 (only @ xmath15), and the peak maximum of @ xmath14 (only @ xmath14) in ev’11–a is shown, while the traces vary from 1 to 0 . In the experiment, the traces are carried along the coulomb resonance marked with arrows, and for each value of @ xmath15 they are cast in @ xmath4 such that the peak peak peak in @ xmath14 (only @ xmath14) is decreasing. Besides, the reflection probability r is probably increasing. - xcite at xmath123 - - - 68 - 68 - 69 - 69 - 69 - 68 - 69 - 1 - 69 , 1 - 69 - 71 - 69 - 1 and xmath124 - - the curves are measured over the peak marked with an arrow in fig.5 , and for xmath127 - 3 = xmath127 with strong decoherence in the dot, a 13 - 136 - 27 = , 10, 15 12, [2] - (a) @ xmath12 for xmath12, and 0 - 5 - 70, 20 with a 13=(5], 130 12 6 = 12 (b) 12715 for xmath128, and 0 including decoherence in the dot, with a 11130 10 , 112 - 106 , 120 -  , 101225 , width=326 , 10111, 12 1303530 The figure figure (Fig. 6-9) shows @xmath127 for @xmath139, @xmath140, @xmath141, @xmath142, @xmath143, and @xmath146 taking into account a finite phase coherence length of @xmath146. The distance is drawn between @ xmath146 and @ xmath146. This is the re-injected velocity, 10—absorbed amplitude, 20—by introducing an additional term in the two-tactile conductance, @ xmath134, where @ xmath134 is the length of the path through the dot, and -math146 is the length of the phase coherence length. The re-injected velocity is asserted to have a conservation of the structure, and therefore to the symmetries required by the two-tactile onsager relation. the gray solid line is shown as the criterion for @ xmath142 in the fully coherent case. [p. 18] The close proximity of the measured data of @ xmath148mk (Fig. X1][p. 19] (fig. a)[2] implying that, even at such low temperatures, the contacts to the quantum dot are still decoherent, as is usual, and that, as a measure of decoherence in a quantum dot in the Fano regime. It follows that the cross-coupling of @ xmath15 has the opposite effect, and the peak width in @ xmath14 is decreased when the xmath115 resonance is reached. This is evident from the good agreement between @ xmath127 and @ xmath0 in this case. The scattering model, based on the dimensions of the ring dot, reproduces the whole characteristic feature of the experimental data, but there are a few points which we should notice. .. Note, that the cross-coupling of @ xmath15 has the opposite effect, and the coulomb peak width of @ xmath14 is augmented when the resonance is decreased. This fact, in this case, can be observed from the good agreement between @ xmath127 and @ xmath0. We have used the parameter parameters in the model in such a way as to resemble the values of fig. d, measured at xmath151 . The magnitude of decoherence in the junctions is very small, for we expect a coherent converging between the two structures. These parameters were chosen so as to resemble the data in fig. d, measured at xmath151 . The cross-coupling of @ xmath15 and @ xmath14 has the opposite effect, and the peak width of the coulomb peak in @ xmath14 decreases with the decrease in @ xmath115 . The induced flux in the sphere is not only determined by space minimization, but also by the coulomb interactions between the electrons on the sphere. We have shown that the influence of the cross-coupling from the sphere is negligible in the totally decoupled system (see also ref.) . so we limit ourselves to decoherence as we have mentioned above and hypothesise that the induced flux on the sphere is the main cause of decoherence of the fano effect. However, when the dot's magnetic field is greatly suppressed, we estimate this contribution to be about two times smaller than the peak peaks in xmath0, for xmath122, and we are therefore led to think that it has little effect on xmath0 . we have proved that the influence of cross-coupling on the sphere is negligible in the completely decoupled system (see also ref. ). however, in quantum dots, the addition of energy between two resonances is not only determined by space quantization, but also by coulomb interaction between the electrons. Therefore, we have restricted ourselves to decoherence as described above, and speculate that the extra leads on the sphere are the main source of decoherence of the fano effect . . . from simultaneous measurements of @ xmath1 we estimate this contribution to be about two times smaller than the dips (peaks) in @ xmath0 for @ xmath122 and therefore it seems to us that it has little influence on @ xmath0 . , there is a great deal of agreement between the data and a single channel scattering matrix, which enables us to identify a structure with a fano diffusing unit embedded in a two-terminal abring. The higher the temperature, the fano effect nearly disappears, while the absorption of the abring in the ring persists above xmath157. nse> . . . - As can be seen, e.g., in fig. a. . . . b. - with a gate voltage to adjust the coupling between the ring and the dot . . . we conclude that spin is not necessary for the observed interference, and that kondo correlations are therefore negligible . . . and thus negligible . . .
