For the moment it is thought that the solar magnetic fields were created in the tachocline, the transition between the convection zone and the radiative interior. A perturbation of the buoyancy in a spherical trough made them upward and escape into the solar atmosphere as infiltrated tubes . . . - xcite and xcite used to study time-lapses of spectropolarimetric observations taken by the solar optical telescope on the Hinode , the authors followed the development of a magnetic loop in the network, and concluded that they appeared on spatial scales smaller than two xmath7. . . . . . . , Potential ... , Potential ... Potential ... , Potential ... Potential ... The largest-developing active regions produced sunspots with a flux in excess of xmath4 mx, with a life of several weeks to months. The smallest-developing active regions were so-called ephemeral areas. They had fluxes in excess of xmath4 mx and lifetimes of several weeks to months. More recently, @xcite reconstructed the horizontal elastic flux in the slow-moving sphere by reconstructing the three-dimensional topology of the magnetic field vector in the calm regions of the solar photosphere. It was observed that the least 20 % of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun was connected with low-lying loops. Is the emergence process a local phenomenon confined to the photosphere or does the magnetic flux reach the higher layers? What's more, the mhd simulations of @xcite present mhd simulations in which the magnetic field enters the photosphere in the form of small-scale loops, forming small-scale loops. Then they are collected in the chromosphere and circulated into the corona and spread to the chromosphere. In our study, we have used the optical observations of the stellium of the sun, in a grayscale, of an extremely high resolution, from a distance of several kilometers (from 27 July to 30 September 2007) by the apparatus of the dutch open telescope. The data analyzed in this study are time series of polarimetric and imaging observations of the quiet sun at the center. In this study, we have examined a period of seven days (26 - 29 september, 1 and 6 october) with the instruments of the dutch open telescope, and the spectral observations of the middle-line, a tiny magnetic field, which enters the imagesphere and merges with the local magnetic fields that expand into the plasma and produce high-frequency mhd waves which propagate in the corona . The data collected in this paper consist of the time series of polarimetric and imaging observations of the center of the sun ad 'ent ' in the center of the sun. " It is not clear from the theoretical point of view whether the fields of the calm photosphere can penetrate the chromosphere.

The image shown in Figure 4 is the first stage of the formation of a small-scale magnetic pulse, as seen in the 630-nm line. We draw the following ejected portion of the figure, to look for weak linear signals between two patches of circular pulses of opposite polarity. The ejected portion of the image is based on the decomposition of the lines between the scales. From this point the spectropolarization of the paper is interpreted to examine the topology of the field in the photosphere. as the signals of a small-scale magnetic pulse are very small in the calm sun, we ascribe these cases to the loop-like structures only after corroborating that the linear pulses of a pair are produced by symmetric stokes at xmath24 and xmath29. Our analysis of the sp data is complemented by the cn filtergrams, which reveal even a speck of light entangled with magnetic fields. The different panels represent the continuum intensity, the total linear polarization, and the total circular polarization at the bottom. The red contours indicate the enhanced linear polarization; the black and white contours indicate the locations of strong negative and positive circular signals. For this purpose we use the Sp data to investigate the topology of the field in the photosphere. As a general rule, the linear polarization signals in the tranquil sun are very small, and so we ascribe these cases to loop-like structures only after corroborating that the . . . note that this sign convention is different from the one common in astronomy. Since the stokes q and u were not recorded, the mg i magnetograms can only be used to detect relatively vertical fields, such as would be expected at the foot-points of magnetic loops. . . . the distance between the foot-points grows each time until they reach the edges of the region scanned by the sp. , it is true that the stokes q and u are not recorded, so the stokes q and u are not recorded, so that the mx cm at xmath1 and mx cm at xmath2 are valid, respectively, at xmath3 . the proportions of xmath34 and xmath35 are transformed into magnetic flux density and velocities according to xmath39, where the subscripts r and b represent the measurements at xmath37 and xmath38 pm from the center of the b line.

The green curves depict the regions of large linear polarization signals in 630 nm. The red curves mark the regions of large linear polarization signals in 630 nm. Note that the time steps are not always precisely spaced; rather, we have adapted them to better describe the various phases of the emergence process. For example, one of the most clear examples of a loop reaching the chromosphere was loop ml09, which we saw on the 25th of september, 2007 at 14:39 ut. the red contours mark the regions of large circular polarization signals in 630 nm. for the negative and positive signals, respectively. For the black contours, we computed the thickness of the red contours. We draw from left to right cn filters, photospheric los velocities from the stokes @ xmath57, zero-crossing shifts of 630 nm. 517 nm, total circular polarization maps in 632 nm . One of the clearest examples of a loop that had reached the chromosphere was the loop ml07, observed on september 25, 2007 at 14:39 ut . At xmath60 s the linear polarizations vanish under the noise, and the positive axis has drifted into an intergranular lane, and the negative axis remains grounded in the granule and is more diffuse. we see upward pulsations in the photospheric velocity maps. interestingly, the correlative magnetic structure at the bottom of the survey, at a height of about one fourth of the current showing fov, is well visible in the b magnetograms and in the ca magnetograms, and will remain so for most of the time. The field in the upper layers is higher than in the lower one. Thus it is possible that the polarisation disappears when the apex of the loop leaves the plane of the central line of the b line. It is also interesting that the b magnetogram exhibits some subtle and weak circular polarization signals cosplaying with the photospheric foot-points, and this is what confirms the equilateral movement of the traces. However, the magnetic field is still in the lower one: there are no circular polarization signals in the b magnetograms, nor changes in caih that could be connected with the loop. This demonstrates the usefulness of our observations: the magnetic structures visible in polarization maps but not in b or h are intrinsically lower in the solar atmosphere. The upward movement of the lines from the horizon helps the field lines to rise from below the sun. The lower equilateral movement indicates that the axis has reached the top -thin layers where the central part of the b line forms. The north axis also shows that the axis is ascending. The same process is repeated again and again in the case of the footpoints in the road . . . but, in the case of the b magnetogram, the footpoints are clearly visible in the b magnetogram and in the b dopplergram. In this case, the distance between the footpoints is about 4000 km . . . we mention in passing that a new loop is visible in the fov, very near to the site of emergence of the structure we are describing in detail . . . we see, in Fig. 7 , the distance between the footpoints is determined as a function of time. and the distance is computed only when the two footpoints are visible, both in the maps (squares) and in the b magnetogram (tactile) . at xmath64 s, the footpoints are clearly visible in the b magnetogram and the downdraft in the b magnetogram. The whole structure is rising, because the footpoints continue to separate. The linear increase of the distance with time is a characteristic feature of the loops, and signifies that they do not walk in free random succession (the distance would increase as the square root of time) . The ratio of this constant separation with time is the common characteristic of the loops, and means that they do not walk with a random walk (or the distance would increase as the square root of time) . At xmath66 s, the loop is almost completely visible. The photosphere velocity map shows a clump of upflows at the location of the loop, confirming its rise through the atmosphere. At xmath67 s, the loop passes almost to its largest extent (520 km), while the upflows begin to diminish. d. the negative footpoint is approaching a negative polarity patch with which it will become mixed. This footpoint is in the vicinity of a positive polarity patch with which it will have mixed its penetrating shape. At the next frame, at xmath68 s, the loop is seen. The first frame, a patch of linear polarization is observed in a granular vein (see the white arrow) . the positive footpoint is very weak, although it does not cease to show any downward pressure at the peak of formation of the b measurements. These features will survive the disappearance of the footpoint, due to the interaction with the network. a certain class of loops which remain in the photosphere show very similar behaviors. In general, loops disappear very quickly, disappearing not far from the region where they came up. The evolution of the loop is so rapid that it appears and disappears almost at the same time . interestingly, the footpoints never approach each other . . . . This allows the idea that the descent of the loop is in a pond below the surface of the solar atmosphere as the cause of its disappearance. There is a loop encircled by a granule at xmath70 s.; its beginnings are the same as the loop represented in fig. ej2 crom. Nevertheless, the loop is one of the loops encircled by _ h  2 crom, which appeared on September 26, 2007 at a time of ut . . . unless it is seen at the levels in which h  2m 18 , it will first appear in the fifth column, then in the fourth, and finally in the third. Unfortunately, the combined observation of the hinode and the dot, in poor sight, causes a good deal of overlap . . . the image of a loop detecting h m 18 is not complete, and it must be strengthened by euv and x-ray observations, which are suitable for the identification of such magnetic structures in the hot corona. In this respect, we make use of the h m 18 measurement of the dot, in order to examine the evolution of the loop to the upper chromosphere. The first steps of the loop are detected in the photosphere at m70 s. the whole structure is exhibiting upflows in the stokes v zero maps, showing the ascent. and the absorption signal – at Xmath72 s the waveform is extinguished until the loop falls simultaneously from the lower and the higher layers. The total flux at Xmath72 s begins to fade away in a flash, and the blinking signal at Xmath72 s recedes simultaneously from the low and the upper layers. The size of the loop, however, varies from one to the next, and if there are more than one loop, the longer the separation, the greater its separation, from the chromosphere. . . . with this, we have the most important results, namely: the physical properties of the small-scale loops, observed with-in-situ examples, and loops forming close to network elements or in crowded areas are not omitted to the analysis to maintain the quality of the result. In this section we are concerned with the physical properties of small-scale loops observed with-in-situ examples, and loops appearing near strong network elements or in crowded areas are omitted from the analysis to maintain the quality of the results. The time of the time between the appearance and disappearance of the polarization signals — the time taken to indicate the time between the appearance and disappearance of the signals — is the moment when the initial signals at the foot-points become smeared together — at xmath72 s, whereas the second is the time at which the loop disappears from the low and the upper layers of the chromosphere — the lifetime is the time between the appearance and disappearance of the polarization signals , a second is the time spent until one of the foot-points begins to tre a cat is wholly different from the other. b C cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The maximum separation between the foot points is a strong function of the lifetime and ranges from 0 to 40 km s, although most loops disappear within a few minutes. The largest distance between the foot points is as a function of their lifetime and is usually between 0 and 4 km s . . . B, as can be seen from Table Q25 , the density of magnetic fluxes is usually 2040 mx cm , in a circle of 630 nm at the level of 630 nm in a circle of 630 nm, which is much larger than the rest of the values. The vertical thickness of the foot points is, as a rule, 1500 m, and the width of the lines of 630 nm is much larger than the rest of the numbers . . . , it is noted that the separation speed tends to decrease in the middle of the granular zone, which is likely due to the low internal forces of ml24, which are intergranular. The maximum separation between the foot points is a strong function of the lifetime, and can be measured from 3500 to 4000 km. Among the observations which we have made, the observations indicated that magnetic fields do come into the quiet solar atmosphere in the form of small loops. We have found, in most cases, a patch of linear polarization flanked by two circular polarization signals of opposite polarity. in almost all cases, the linear polarization appears before or at the same time as the stokes of xmath24 signal, as one would expect from loops of xmath0 formed through the atmosphere. In the light of this, 15 % of the loops are shown as bright points in the h line - core filtergrams. This means that a considerable fraction of the magnetic flux which emerges from the photosphere enters the chromosphere. in contrast, 77 % of the loops do not reach the chromosphere. it takes an average of five minutes for the loops to come from the photosphere to the height at which the b measurements were formed, although, of course, faster and slower ascends were observed. The description above has shown that magnetic fields are formed in the quiet solar atmosphere in the form of small loops, verifying the results of xcite and xcite. This is because the loops are seen as a patch of linear polarization flanked by two circular polarization signals, in particular, the polarization of a circular polarisation, as can be expected from loops of xmath2 rising through the atmosphere. As we shall see in a short time, however, a large number of loops appear at the same point. These loops, for example, lie in the xmath146 region of the solar surface, where in a space of one h we have uncovered nine events in a single hour. In this region, as the whole set of observations has been collected in the electronic edition of the Astrophysical Journal. These regions act as granules, at the edge of the water, although there are exceptions, in dark places, of the same type. The foot-points generally follow a rectilinear path, like the steps of active regions and ephemeral regions. But the important thing is that the magnetic field is so weak that it can be driven and pushed about by the flow, but without being destroyed in the process. In general, the loops are generally in granules, and will descend to the nearest intergranular lane. The loops come out in granules or at the edges, although there are exceptions of loops appearing in dark regions. the red curves correspond to the example in fig. ej1 crom.. the loops are coherent all their life, as if they were unaware of each other. This area, as shown in fig. ej1 crom, belongs to this region. It is important to note that the magnetic field is sufficiently weak that it is pushed and pushed by the granular flow, but _without destruction in the process _ . This is the case in active regions, where the signs of the leader and the follower are governed by Hale's rules (see, e.g., e.g. , e.g. , ? ) , one can expect to get a regular ordering of the footpoints at the moment of their emergence. It is also possible to analyze the nature of the magnetic flux, which is present in the solar photosphere on granular scales, in the form of transient horizontal fields xcite and small magnetic loops xcite . During the solar cycle 23 in the northern hemisphere the leader polarities were positive in the northern hemisphere and in the southern hemisphere. This is what happened in active regions, where the signs of the leader and the follower polarities are governed by hale's rules (see e.g. ) , if the statistical sample is not very large, they seem to have almost random orientations. As for the graph of the orientation of the small-scale emerging loops, it is defined as the angle between the solar equator and the line connecting the positive footpoint with the negative one, measured from the west. He is also evidenced by the observation of small loops and their longitudinal movement, which is consistent with the tangled field of the sun - which is quite opposite to the actual height of the sun - by the small-scale loops, which can thereby be estimated to occupy a few kilometers in the light of the sun - the distance from the photosphere is about five minutes, so that the ascent of the loops is of a relatively high order of magnitude compared with that of active and passive areas. The time interval from the first observance of the sun to the appearance of the b magnetograms is about five minutes, which means a rapid rise of a few kilometers. The rise of the tiny-scale loops may serve as an efficient mechanism for transferring substantial amounts of energy from the photosphere to the chromosphere - this is a claim made by @xcite and @xcite that the tangled fields of the quiet sun store sufficient energy to heat the chromosphere. In a tangle of the sun's signals disappears very soon, while the circular signals tracing the center of the loop are also observed to become divergent with time. - ut> (Zwaan 1987)   .. as a matter of fact, the spectral fluxes of the tangles between the upper and lower magnetospheres are estimated to be at the order of 1 km @ xmath3 . this is at a speed of of at least 1 km @ xmath3 . We present three-dimensional simulations of the final stages of a certain tube’s emergence. It was placed horizontally at the top of the convection zone, just under the photosphere. – a sumptuous line of quiet sun fields as deduced from hanle measurements @xcite , but it was impossible to reach a precise conclusion without studying the compatibility of hanle and zeeman measurements. At the surface, the emergence of a flux tube is confined to small spatial scales (often between 1000 – 2000 km), and short time scales (of 5 min). – the separation of the tubes may also explain why there is a re-emergence of loops which are repeated one after the other. However, it may also be the result of the interaction of fragments with the near-surface convection, if it reveals all the information originally contained in the tube . – it is a natural consequence of the collision of fragments with the near-surface convection, which would remove all the information that had been contained in the tube . – but this is not unrelated to our observations. – There are two levels of image resolution, and as for the polarization of the chromosphere there are calls for the determination of the nature of the horizontal magnetic fields, which are located in the vicinity of the active regions of the solar interior. To clarify the nature of the magnetic fields that are observed in the region of the solar interior, it is important to determine the nature of the loops that have been observed, in the internet, and in the circuitry, in addition to higher resolution photospheric observations, there are demands for polarization measurements of the chromosphere, which can be performed with the help of two-dimensional spectrometers like ibis, sharp, and imax. As a matter of fact, the scales have not yet been precisely figured, and, as a consequence, there are no more corresponding submerged fields , and besides that, there are no measurements of this chromosphere in which we are now able to distinguish between a vertical dynamo and a vibrating 'silent' magnetic flux which emerges from the solar interior . it is therefore necessary to determine the nature of the loops observed in the internetwork regions, and to gain a better understanding of the magnetism of the quiet sun and its role in the heating of the solar atmosphere . , we thank the seducer kamio - naoj - for coordinating the campaigns, and the scientist pter stterlin (recht university) for making the observations at the open telescope, and reducing them.
