It is well known that in the upper half of the plane of Euclidean Geodesics the continued fractions represent a cut of hyperbolic geodesics. The dynamical properties of such transformations have been well studied in these last thirty years, bringing it into use for billiards in rational polygons, for measuring foliations on surfaces, for teichmller geometry and dynamics, etc. the interval-exchange transformations are closely related to abelian differentials on riemann surfaces. Keane’s conjecture (the unique ergodicity of almost all interval-exchange transformations) has been confirmed in avila, gouzel, and yoccoz. using this relation h . masur in @xcite and w . a . . veech in @xcite independently proved the keane’s conjecture (the unique ergodicity of almost all interval-exchange transformations) . More recently, avila, gouzel and yoccoz proved the exponential decay of the correlations for the teichmller geodesic flow on the strata of the abelian differentials (see @xcite). more recently, bufetov and gurevich proved the existence and uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy for the teichmller geodesics on the moduli space of abelian differentials. Thus, using this relation, h. masur in @xcite and w. a veech in @xcite have independently proved the keane s conjecture (the unique ergodicity of almost The 'modest' space of curves is naturally distinguished with the Modest space of Quadratic differentials. From this point of view, the strata of abelian differentials represent special orbifolds of high codimension in the total space of the tangent bundle. Thus, in order to generalize the technique of rauzy-veech induction to quadratic differentials in a consistent way, it was necessary to find combinatorial criteria to determine generalized permutations, which belong to the attractors, and to those that represent the vertical foliations of quadratic differentials. natural generalizations of interval-exchange transformations were introduced by danthony and nogueira in @xcite (see also @xcite) as cross sections of measured foliations on surfaces. these experiments showed the appearance of attractors for the rauzy-veech induction, as well as examples of generalized permutations so that the corresponding linear involutions are minimal for a domain of positive measure, and non-negative for a domain of positive measure ( examples of these types are presented in figure : rauzy-veech : 2ii) in the appendix : math2. in this paper we define in the logical sense a rauzy-veech induction for quadratic differentials. Thus, in order to generalize technique of rauzy-veech induction for quadratic differentials in a uniform way, it was necessary to find combinatorial criteria to select generalized permutations, which belong to attractors, and to those which represent cross-sections of vertical quadratic differentials. For a given irreducible permutation of xmath3, a subset of parameters which is the corresponding interval exchange transforms based on keane's property is always satisfied for almost all parameters when xmath3 is irreducible (i.e., @xmath7), and when xmath3 is reducible, the corresponding interval exchange map is never minimal. (Sir) Note that the behavior of the orbit of the induction provides important information about the dynamics of the interval exchange transformation, corresponding to the starting point. Similarly, for the space of interval exchange transformations with irreducible combinatorial data, the renormalization of the induction process is frequent (and even ergodic by the theorem of veech) . this induction can be considered a dynamical system on a finite dimensional space of interval exchange maps. note that the keane’s property (see below) is a criterion of “irrationality” (which in particular means minimality) of an interval exchange transformation. note that the irreducible permutation of xmath3 has been satisfied for almost all parameters when xmath3 is irreducible (i.e. xmath7), while when xmath3 is reducible, the corresponding interval exchange map is _never_ minimal. Moreover, for the space of interval exchange transformations with irreducible combinatorial data, the renormalized induction process continues with respect to the lebesgue measure (and even ergodic by the theorem of veech) . It is possible to show that any irreducible generalized permutation is dynamically irreducible; the converse is not true in general, as we will see. a generalized permutation of type xmath16 (with xmath16) is a two-to-one map of xmath16 to an alphabet xmath19. a generalized permutation is called irreducible if there is a linear involution connected with this generalized permutation, representing an appropriate cross-section of the vertical foliation of some quadratic differential. a generalized permutation is called dynamically irreducible if there is a minimum linear involution connected with this generalized permutation. as above, a _generalized permutation_ is encoded by a combinatorial data ( generalized permutation’) and by continuous data. This corresponding criteria are described in the following manner: a definition: dyn: irr; the corresponding expressions are stated as definitions (def: irr) and definition: dyn: irr. a generalized permutation is called _impermissible_ if there exists a linear involution associated with this generalized permutation, which represents a suitable cross-section of the vertical foliation of some quadratic differential. It must be a linear involution of the unit interval, and we shall suppose that a sequence of iterations of the renormalized rauzy-veech induction, defined on the set of xmaths, is recurrent. note that the geometry of the rauzy graphs is very different and more complicated than that of the true permutations, since there may be a missing one of the rauzy operations. sent> irreducible, but if xmaths does not belong to the set of resolving parameters, the linear involution is not minimal. if xmaths is dynamically irreducible, then for almost all permissible parameters xmaths, the linear involution is satisfied by the keane’s property and is therefore minimal . . . . since the rauzy-veech induction happens to commute with dilations, it projectes to a map on the space of normalized linear involutions; we will call this map the renormalized rauzy-veech induction . . . . . the renormalized rauzy-veech induction . . . a subset of irreducible generalized permutations is of one-to-one correspondence with the connected components of strata of quadratic differentials. In general, the extension of the extension of the extension of the extension of a generalized permutation is a generalized mathematical phenomenon which is based on the predetermined ratio of the corresponding differentials. Note that the second author's theorem, xcite, classifies all connected components of all strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at least simple poles. note that a theorem of the second author xcite classifies all connected components of all strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at least simple poles. based on this approach veech proved that the minimum stratum in genus xmath35 has two connected components and arnoux proved that the minimum stratum in genus xmath35 has three connected components (for abelian differentials) . the same theorem xcite proves that the minimal stratum in genus xmath35 has two connected components and arnoux proved that the minimal stratum in genus xmath36 has three connected components (for abelian differentials). Note that the second author xcite proves that all connected components of all other strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at least two poles are grouped together, and the corresponding ratios are hyperelliptic. Traditionally, extended rauzy classes were used to prove the non-connection of some strata of abelian differentials. " - iem" we recall the definition of a linear involution and give us the basics of its properties . . . we illustrate this property in the following way: in the second place, we introduce the property of keane for the linear involutions and we prove the second place, that is, the law of xmath41. - In the third place, we introduce the property of keane for the linear involutions, and we show that there is a law of keane for that, if and only if the induction is always well defined and the length parameters tend to zero. In this way, we use the teichmller geometry and the finiteness of the volume of the strata proved by masur and veech (see xcite) . in the third place, we investigate the dynamics of the renormalized rauzy - veech map in the space of the linear involutions, and prove the law of resolvability @ xmath31 . - In this section we will briefly review fundamental notions of flat surfaces, moduli spaces, and intervals. a flat surface is a (true, compact, connected) genus of xmath42, equipped with a flat metric (with isolated conical singularities) such that the holonomy group belongs to xmath42 . Therefore, all cone angles are integer multiples of xmath3 . hence, a quadratic differential is defined locally in the coordinates of xmath53 by the formula xmath54 . Observe that holonomy is trivial if and only if there is a subgroup of holonomy ... we will sometimes use the notation xmath55 , or simply xmath55 . a flat surface is a 'true'  xmath44, such that xmath45 is a topological connected surface, xmath46 is a finite subset of xmath46 (whose elements are called singularities), and xmath47 is an atlas of xmath48, such that the transition maps xmath49 are translations or half-turns: xmath50 , and for each xmath50 a contiguous cone is called by the formula xmath55 . This flow is known as the teichmller geodesic flow. This flow is further tested by masur @xcite and veech @xcite in the xmath68 case and the xmath75 case. We define the moduli space of quadratic differentials by the moduli space of pairs @xmath65 (where @xmath56 is not the global square of any abelian differential) in terms of the Equivalence relation equivalence-wise. In general, these strata are not connected in general (for a complete classification, see @xcite in the abelian differentials case and @xcite in the quadratic differentials case) . this flow is known as the teichmller geodesic flow. It is important to observe the linear action of the @xmath72 parameter subgroup of diagonal matrices at xmath73 on flat surfaces. This activity is ergodic in its own way , it gives measure-preserving flow to a natural measure of xmath74, maintaining each stratum of area one flat surfaces. - the length of the intervals is a vector of xmath87, and combinatorial data is a pair of one-to-one maps of xmath89. We will define the rauzi-vee induction and its geometric and dynamic properties (see xcite for more details). an interval exchange map is a one-to-one map from xmath83 to a co- finite subset of xmath81, that is, a translation on each subinterval of its definition domain. Thus, we will describe a permutation at xmath92: in the following alphabet . . . marmi, moussa, yoccoz . . . under the example of marmi, moussa, yoccoz . . . a permutation at xmath82. (the length of the intervals is a vector at xmath87, and combinatorial data is a pair of one-to-one maps at xmath88 . . . then, a permutation at xmath84 is the permutation from xmath90 into itself given by xmath91 . . . . . . . . . . Let us define a subinterval in xmath100 by removing the loser in xmath101, as follows: xmath101, the rauzy-veep induction in xmath102, is defined as the first return map of xmath10 to xmath100. This is an interval exchange transformation of the letters xmath4 (see e.g. xcite ) . . . . It is clear that this is again a sextuple of intervals defined by xmath12, in that case Xmath10 is typed as typed as typed as typed as “xmath” (see e.g. math12). Xmath101 is typed as “xmath103”; and the winner is xmath107 . . . . . then xmath110 where xmath123 and xmath124 we have xmath115 if xmath116 and xmath117 are ... In the following chapter, we will examine the rauzy-veech induction as a dynamic system defined by the space of interval-change transformations. In this case, we want the iterates of the rauzy-veech induction on Xmath10 to be always well defined. We will say that xmath10 satisfies the property of Keane (also called the infinitely distinct orbit condition, or i . d . c. property) if the orbits of the singularities of xmath131 by xmath10 are infinite , we want the iterates of rauzy-veech induction on Xmath10 to be always well defined. note that if xmath10 satisfies the property of Keane, then xmath10 is minimal . if Xmath132 is rationally independent vectors, that is Xmath133 for all nonzero integer vectors - xmath134 - then xmath10 satisfies the property of Keane (see xcite). thus we need the iterates of a rauzy-veech induction on xmath10 to be always well defined . In the case of linear involutions, we may remark that the “renormalized” rauzy vee-tort induction can be generalized by the renormalization of the rauzy vee-tort induction in the space of intervals : given a permutation, if @xmath143, we can define two other permutations, namely, @xmath144, such that @xmath146 . so the relation produced by xmath147 is a partial order on the set of permutations; we represent it as a directed graph @xmath148. Now, as a matter of fact, suppose that there exists an oriented path between @xmath143 and @xmath152, and that there exists @xmath155 such that @xmath146 . note that @xmath143 is irreducible if and only if @xmath143 is irreducible . so that there exists an oriented path in @xmath148, joining @xmath3 and @xmath152 , there exists @ xmath157 such that @xmath156 . and so the relation generated by @xmath147 is a partial order on the set of irreducible permutations; we represent it as a directed graph, at xmath148 . if the lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 have no intersection other than their ends, then we can construct a translation surface @ xmath45 for each side @ xmath164 and @ xmath168, starting at the origin (see figure : suspension : iet) . if the lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 have no intersection other than the ends, then we can construct a translation surface @ xmath45 for each side @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 by a translation (in general we must use a zippered rectangle construction, see section : zip ) . . . let @ xmath17 be the horizontal interval defined by @ xmath172 . . . . if the lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 have no intersection other than the ends, then we can create a translation surface @ xmath45 in the following way: we can identify each side @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 by a translation (there is a veech zippered rectangle construction in general, see section (subsec) : veech) . In short, let us say that @ xmath88 is irreducible if and only if @ xmath182 is irreducible. Let us assume that @ xmath182 is irreducible. Let us suppose that @ xmath182 is irreducible. If xmath193 is irreducible, then the existence of a suspension data is derived by a masur and a veech (see @ xcite, page 174, and the formula xcite for a more precise description) . - Let us suppose that @ xmath182 is irreducible, if and only if @ xmath193 is irreducible, then this is a suspension data for @ xmath193 . . . We consider a rectangle, width, height, xmath191 based on @ xmath193. The zippered rectangle is the translation surface of the rectangles, where xmath195 is the following relation: we identify the top and the bottom of these rectangles by xmath195 for xmath197 . xmath199 is thus defined, on the space xmath214, the rau-ri-x-math-220. Here the rau-ri-x-math-219 is determined by a single differentiation from xmath220 to a stratum of the moduli space of abelian differentials (see note : moduli) . observe that it is an almost everywhere, almost invertible mapping: if xmath214 is a rau-ri-x-math215, then every rau-ri-x-math214 has exactly one preimage for xmath137 . . . . if xmath200 is the winner for xmath201, then _____________________________. _____________, ____________, ____________, _____________, ________________, ___________, ___________, ____________, ___________, _____________, ____________, _____________, ___________, __________, __________, __________, __________, __________, __________, ___________, __________, ___________, __________, __________, __________, __ 7>math31 and 8math226 is the Lebesgue measure. Note that xmath235 is the core domain of xmath214, where xmath235 is the fundamental domain of xmath195 and a poincar-map of the teichmller flow on latexmath: p=math-214, math-235, m-- s =  ,  z, s (,  pi, zeta) ;  pi,   textrm,    immovable ,  supposing  on suspensions. The mapping of math-235 preserves the area of the corresponding flat surface, the teich-m-ller flow also acts on the subset math233, corresponding to the area one of the surfaces, and the measure math-233 induced by the measure math-23 on that subset is preserved. Moreover, the action of math-230 is linear. They also proved that the induced measure on @ xmath241 is infinite. So let xmath45 be a (flat, connected, oriented) flat surface, with a linear holonomy, and let xmath242 be a horizontal segment with a choice of a positive vertical direction (or, equivalently, a choice of left and right ends) . to resolve this problem we must consider xmath243 the first return map of vertical geodesics starting from xmath242 in the negative direction. _xmath242 is a finite union of open intervals, xmath246, and the restriction of xmath244 on each of these intervals is of the kind xmath247 . so the map xmath243 is well defined outside the finite number of points xmath80 (called singular points) that correspond to vertical geodesics that stop at a singularity and begin again at xmath242 . “the first return map of a vertical geodesic foliation on a horizontal segment @ xmath242 in a flat surface @ xmath45 defines a linear involution: a smooth involution, without fixed point, defined on @ xmath259, where @ xmath80 is a finite subset of @ xmath260. . . . if @ xmath261 and @ xmath262 belong to the same connected component of @ xmath263, then the derivative of @ xmath258 at @ xmath219 is @ xmath13, otherwise the derivative of @ xmath258 at @ xmath219 is @ xmath72 . . . The previous definition was motivated by the following remark. “The oriented surface of the paper ” [Section X] – orientable . . . ” observe that the orientability of the surface @ xmath45 forces the second condition on the derivative of @ xmath10 in its definition [Ef iu gym ] . Let Xmath270 be an alphabet of Xmath4 letters. We will call such a generalized permutation Xmath273, which is a two-to-one map Xmath274. a generalized permutation of type Xmath16, with Xmath271 is a two-to-one map Xmath270 . Note that a permutation defines in a natural way a generalized permutation. [c] Let Xmath270 be an alphabet of xmath4 letters . The domain of definition of xmath258 is a finite union of open intervals, where Xmath278 is subintervals of xmath266 and Xmath279 are subintervals of xmath268. As in the above definition, we choose a name for each pair of xmath249 and generate a generalized permutation, in the sense of the above definition, which is a generalized permutation. Let xmath270 be an alphabet of xmath4 letters . . . The following table (if xmath294 is used) will show that the discrete datum associated with the linear involution described in figure X-diagram is the generalized permutation of xmath3 . . . if xmath274 is not a 'true' permutation, then an obvious necessary and sufficient condition for xmath274 to be a 'true' permutation is that there exist at least two indices at xmath295 and xmath296 such that xmath297 and xmath298 are . . . . we denote in section - iem - that 'short'. - xmath102 of xmath10 is the linear involution obtained by the first return map of xmath10 to xmath305, like interval-exchange maps, the combinatorial data of the new linear involution is only dependent on the combinatorial data of xmath10 and on whether xmath306 or xmath307 . - xmath305 if xmath328 and xmath317 , then we define xmath329 as of type xmath16 and that: xmath330 , otherwise xmath326 is not defined . . . . note that if xmath275 is a generalized permutation, the subsets xmath319 and xmath325 can be empty because xmath311 or because of the linear relation on xmath312 that must be satisfied. “Excuse me,” and as follows: “Razoy-veep induction of _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________,______________________________________ ;_______________________ _____________,*______________________;_____________________________________; [19] and _________________________________.—. Then the substitution of example [16] is indicated by example _______________. Then ____________________ is not defined. Then ______________________________________ is not defined for any________________________. But _________________________ is merely a model for generating ____________________________________. . . . let xmath365 be a line with a finite number of edges, on the plane such that the edge number xmath365 is represented by the complex number xmath366, for xmath367, and xmath168 be a line with a line that begins at the same place as xmath365, and whose edge number xmath368 is represented by the complex number xmath369 for xmath370 ( figure : suspension : data) , and thus one will say: suspension , for a generalized permutation . Let xmath10 be a linear involution, and let xmath359 be the lengths of the corresponding intervals . Let xmath359 be a collection of complex numbers, which are: 1 . 2 . xmath326 . . . - we present a sketch of this construction (e.g., “xcite” for interval maps, or “segments” in subsection “segments”) - besides, we can define a flat surface by an analogous construction, a modified rectangle - we say this for each pair of intervals @ xmath371 on @ xmath242; and for each pair of intervals @ xmath371 on @ xmath242 the return time @ xmath372 of the vertical foliation @ xmath373 on @ xmath373 and returned in @ xmath374 . for the general case, we create rectangles @ xmath377 with the same formulas . identifications for the horizontal sides @ xmath378, wherein the horizontal dimensions do not depend on the horizontal parameters, will be clearly defined after the following section . identifications for the vertical dimensions, that does not depend on the horizontal parameters, will be clearly defined after the following lemma . I mean, if there is an attrition to be determined, there must be a leeway in a condition (i.e. if there is a stifling ring); then the stifling ring would be too large. Thus, if there are any leeway in a section, the following follows: if xmath45 is a flat surface, with no vertical saddles; if xmath242 is a horizontal interval attached to a singularity on the left; if xmath242 is an integral part, then Xmath242 is a functional part, which is equal to xmath242 ; and if xmath242 is a derivative part, then Xmath242 is a distinct part from xmath242 , that is, with the same imaginary part, and that Xmath394 is very close to xmath395 ; in that case Xmath242 also defines a suitable polygon. See xcite, “see section ”1 ; this is a natural fact ; see the following notion . . . note that we have not yet discussed the existence of a suspension data . . . and we will discuss this in the next section. Suppose Xmath303 is a linear involution, and Suppose Xmath163 is a suspension over Xmath10. Suppose Xmath303 has type Xmath103, then Xmath399, Xmath400 if Xmath338 and Xmath403. Let Xmath407 be an alphabet, and let Xmath408 be the set with multiplicities xmath409 of the cardinal Xmath410, and will use analogous notations for subsets of xmath19. let Xmath303 be a linear involution, and Xmath163 be a suspension over Xmath40. .. if xmath404 is a suspension over xmath30, and defines a surface isometric to the one corresponding to xmath405 . . . let Xmath404 be a linear involution, let Xmath163 be a suspension over xmath10 . . . The sets at xmath421 and xmath422 will be called top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corners respectively. a permutation which is not reducible is irreducible. Note that the existence or absence of a permutation is independent of the length data at xmath6. Therefore, the choice of a singularity on the left-end of the segment in the construction of section - susp - giem is an important one. - let Xmath421 be a linear involution. we do not assume that xmath423 is reducible, if xmath425 admits a decomposition in which the subsets - xmath425 are not all empty and one of the following statements is true: no corner is empty, it is on the left, it is on the right . - So that, if a permutation is not reducible, it is irreducible. This section has the main result: the second theorem, which, combined with proposition - irr: natural - represents the first part of theorem - We are ready to talk about a few differences. Let us suppose that there exists a suspension in @xmath163 over @xmath3. That is to say, there are no corners in @xmath433, we define @xmath433 and @xmath4 in the same way as @xmath4 and @xmath4—in short, all corners are empty. This is the case: If there is an empty corner in @xmath439, then we can say that @xmath439 is a negative number, and that @ xmath439 is a positive number. , we say that if it is empty on the left, then @xmath439 is empty and if it is empty on the right. So, for example, if they are both on the left, then we have =44, =48 and =47 which contradicts the first. =39 There are three such instances. It is only in this section that we will use this vocabulary . . . We will say that a pseudo-sudden-sudden-sudden-sudden-sudden aeon is defined. Suppose that a blunder at blunder 3 with blunder 3 . . . well, let blunder 3 be an arbitrary generalized multiplicity . . . let blunder 3 be a generalized multiplicity satisfying the convention c. . . normal , which admits a strict blunder. a blunder at blunder 3 is an integer @ blunder446, corresponding to @ blunder447, such as @ blunder448, and likewise @ blunder449 . . . . a pseudo-sudden suspension is _refined_ if all the previous inequalities are rigid except for the extremal ones . . . we will use this vocabulary only in this section . . . . . a pseudo-sudden suspension is _refined_ if the vanishing index of @ blunder445 is strictly included in the vanishing index of @ blunder445 . . . As we have seen in Section [Second, data, iem] there is an explicit formula, because of masur and veech, which imposes a suspension when a permutation is irreducible. We have now reduced the problem to a strict pseudo-stiffness. Let @ xmath3 be a true permutation defined by @ xmath464, then the integers @ xmath465 for @ xmath464 are a few. Then let @ xmath459 be a generalized permutation. let @ xmath465 be a generalized permutation. let xmath465 be a generalized permutation. * The subset Xmath457 of elements , xmath485 contains exactly one element in xmath411 and one element in xmath412. * The subset Xmath458 of elements , xmath485, such that Xmath459 contains exactly one element in xmath412 and one element in xmath485 . * The subset Xmath461 of elements , xmath485, such that Xmath485 contains exactly two elements in xmath411 (and therefore no elements in xmath485). There is an example of the ‘mirror symmetry’ of Xmath476 of Xmath476. @ xmath476 is of type Xmath478 and its form Xmath479 is Xmath479 . we can see that Xmath476 is reducible if and only if it exists xmath486, such that Xmath486 is a vanishing index . . . if @ Xmath476 is a tabulated representation, we will use @ xmath475 to construct a new permutation of @ xmath476 on xmath485 . . . Lemma solmv2 and Lemma solmv2 have created the desired collection of numbers @ xmath487. We can easily check that @ xmath475 is reducible if and only if there exists @ xmath486 such that @ xmath486 . . . let @ xmath490 be the same vanishing index at the top of @ xmath490. Let @ xmath490 be any vanishing index on the top of @ xmath490 . . . Then let Xmath501 be the first top and bottom disappearing index for Xmath500 (so maybe Xmath511 ) . . . we can in a given case - in a given case - Xmath500 is a pseudo suspension of Xmath560, - in a certain case - xmath560 is a pseudo suspension of Xmath508 (and that there is no better pseudo suspension). . . . , sir : lemma (lm: dec) implies that one of these is a subset of the other. . . . , sir : it follows from the , lm: dec, that neither xmath2 nor xmath501 are empty . . . , sir, sir, sir, fig. , sir , sir, sir, fig. . . . (as if xmath509 were a pseudo-strain of xmath505, then xmath506 would be a pseudo-strain of xmath507, and xmath511 would be a pseudo-strain of the generalized permutation of xmath508 . . . so that there could be a change in xmath471 or xmath506 without a loss of generality . if there exists @ xmath529 in @ xmath549 such that @ xmath547 , then either @ xmath545 or @ xmath546 or @ xmath547 , we have an argument : we have : @ xmath531 for @ xmath536 , if there exists @ xmath536, then @ xmath539 , then @ xmath539, and if there is a xmath539 for @ xmath538, then : xmath539 and the lemma are proved. So we have an argument : let @ xmath534 and xmath544 be the first and last vanishing indices of @ xmath274 , let @ xmath539 and xmath544 be the first and last vanishing indices of @ xmath274 , let math539 and math546 , if there is math548 in math549 such that math548 , then either math546 or math547 , if math548 exists in math549, then math546 , math547 , math548 , math548, math547 , math547, math546 , math547 , math546 , the same thing happens if the vanishing index is on the top or on the bottom. In this case, the vanishing index is on the top or the bottom. . . . It follows from lemmas and lemba and from the turn of the page we have the following form of xmath274 . . . Note that if Xmath560 is not vanishing, then at least two other corners exist, at least one of them empty, otherwise one of them is Xmath559, and corresponding corner is empty. . . . in this case, lemma [lemma] assumes that there must be a vanishing index in Xmath560 . . . but if Xmath451 is not strict, then at least two nonempty corners exist in the top or at the bottom , since there must be a vanishing index in the top or at the bottom, the former argument was: if there is a vanishing index on the top, then the two corners are non-empty. The first case is: the right-hand corner is xmath40 . . . other cases correspond to an incomplete, pseudo-solution. in the first and second cases xmath274 is not vanishingly irreducible. So the right-hand corner is not vanishingly irreducible. so the right-hand corner is not vanishingly irreducible. and so the right-hand corner is not vanishingly irreducible. Note that xmath3 is assumed to be strongly irreducible, so the top-left corner is not vanishingly irreducible. We can therefore choose any element xmath578, xmath579, xmath580, and change xmath576 by xmath577, and xmath587 by xmath586 . we can consider all the elements of xmath568 and vice versa. So, the bottom has vanishing indices; then the bottom-right corner can be Xmath587 or Xmath588 . This is what is known as xmath594: let xmath594 be the smallest index, such as xmath594 and xmath595 the largest. + here xmath604 is the difference between the number of indices in xmath610 that are in xmath606 and the number of indices in xmath607 that are in xmath602 . . . this value is always greater than zero for xmath608, and strictly greater than zero for xmath607 when xmath 608 is the first vanishing indices . . . @ xmath599 be the first vanishing indices . . . Let xmath599 be the first vanishing index . . . we have the following facts: . . . We assume that there are no corners in the bottom line. If the top line is not square, we choose any element at xmath620, at xmath621, at xmath622; we replace xmath623 by xmath624, at xmath581 by xmath625, and at xmath626 by xmath626. (See figure, 12) which contradicts the maximality of @xmath451. * if @xmath363 is square, then @xmath362 must be square, and therefore @xmath362 must be square. if there are no corners in the bottom, then the bottom-right corner belongs to the list: @xmath627 or @xmath567. - if there are no corners at the bottom, then the bottom-right corner belongs to the list: @xmath627 or @xmath567 ... and if xmath363 is square, then the top-right corner must be square, so that @ xmath37 is not sharply sharp . . . If @xmath461 is empty, then the top-right corner is also @xmath37, so that @xmath37 is not strongly irreducible . . . so if only one corner is empty, then it is on the right. . . . the proposition is proved . . . note that @xmath640 defines a generalized permutation, which is not strongly irreducible by assumption. Note also that @ xmath640 defines a generalized permutation which is not strongly irreducible by assumption . . . we can conclude that @ xmath640 is not strongly irreducible (i.e., at least one corner is not empty in the decomposition) otherwise the theorem follows from lemma [lm: strongly irreducible] and from proposition [ max: donc: reducible: star] . thus, @ xmath640 is better than @ xmath4 and maximal for this property. . . . if @ xmath461 is not empty, we choose @ xmath620, @ xmath621, and @ xmath579, and set : math636 and math450 is better than @ xmath4 . We can deduce from @ xmath450 a suspension of @ xmath274 . . . if two corners are empty, we can assume that @ xmath274 decomposes into: @ xmath654 with @ xmath655 irreducible . . . , we set: if @ xmath661 is small enough, then : @ xmath661 satisfies: * for all @ xmath662 . . . for all @ xmath662 . . . now let @ xmath650 and let @ xmath579 . . . for an interval exchange map of the xmath20 either the underlying permutation is reducible and then the transformation is never minimal, or xmath10 has the keane's property (and thus is minim) for almost every @ xmath6 (see section iem: iem ) . . . as we shall see, the situation is more complicated in the general case . . . in this section we prove the theorem Xmath40 and the second half of theorem Xmath2 . He has the property of Keane. If he has the property of Keane, then by induction all his iterations by Xmath227 are well defined and have the property of Keane. To make this conclusion, let Xmath10 be a linear involution, let Xmath10 be a linear involution. . . . Let Xmath670 be a subset of elements of xmath671 such that Xmath672 reduces an infinite number of time in the sequence xmath673, and let Xmath670 be a linear involution. . . . the following statements are identical . . . . Let Xmath680 be a subset of elements of xmath671 so that xmath672 is well defined for all elements of xmath673, and the lengths of the intervals @ xmath664 tend to @ xmath103 as xmath70 tends to infinity. Moreover, in the above case, the transformation @ xmath10 is not very great. Let xmath680 be a subset of elements of xmath671 such that xmath672 decreases an infinite number of times in the sequence xmath673, and let xmath680 be a linear involution . Let xmath670 be a subset of elements of xmath671 such that @ xmath672 reduces an infinite number of time in the sequence xmath673 , and let xmath670 be a non Suppose that there is a maximum #xmath24 which is an absolute of @xmath131, and that the sequence #xmath686 of iterations of @xmath10 is infinite and all length parameters of @xmath684 tend to zero, when @xmath70 tends to infinity. Hence, we have to have @xmath685 for some #xmath681 and #xmath682 . so we have to have @xmath682 . so we have a connection of length zero, so we have @xmath686 . so we have an elongated math685 in math8 , which is a singularity of math131, and such that the sequence math686 of iterates by math10 is infinite, and all length parameters of math684 tend to zero when math70 tends to infinity. so , there is an elongated math685 in math8 , and this is a singularity of math10 . . . so , we have math680 . . . if the map math683 is well defined and math683 is well defined, then math693 is not inclined to zero, and hence there is math694 such that math135 is inclined to zero . Suppose xmath10 is a linear involution on xmath242 satisfying the keane property. we prove that if xmath10 has a relationship, then either the sequence xmath706 is finite, or the length parameters are not all bound to zero. Hence, if xmath10 has a connection, then either the sequence xmath706 is finite, or the length parameters are not all necessarily finite. hence xmath244 is an interval exchange map. so , let xmath244 be a linear involution on xmath707 satisfying the keane s property. Suppose Xmath701 is in Xmath702 and Xmath703 is in Xmath704 . that is, we have proved that if xmath10 has a connection, either the sequence Xmath706 is finite, or the length parameters do not tend to zero. So , if xmath701 is connected, he has some time 5 in xmath709 such as @ xmath709 . . . and if xmath711 is not in xmath712, then he has a time  xmath711 . . . The proof is complete. [i] xmath717 is a generalized permutation of xmath715, with (up to changing the top and bottom of xmath715) xmath716, and the length parameters xmath716 satisfy the following inequality. [i] xmath717 is a generalized permutation of xmath717, if the corresponding set of parameters is nonempty. [i] Here one may also observe that if xmath717 is irreducible, then xmath717 is dynamically irreducible (the set of permissible parameters being the entire parameters space) . . . and that xmath717 is always open. qs. 1 and 2 respectively . . . 1 These two combinatorial notions of reducibility were introduced by the second author (see: xcite) . . . note that if xmath6 is not admissible for xmath274, then xmath21 will have a relationship of length to xmath103 or xmath72 depending on the case or the definition [xmath6] and never minimal . . . . In the first place, we assume that the sequence is finite. - First step: - we assume that the sequence is finite. - In the second place, we suppose that if xmath10 does not have the property of the keane, then there exists xmath24 such that xmath695 does not have the permissible parameter (def: dyn: irr) . - In each case xmath695 does not have the permissible parameter (case ) . now we assume that the length parameters do not all tend to zero. xmath723 is irrational, either xmath724 or xmath725 belongs to the only pair xmath726 on the top of the permutation and xmath727 belongs to the only pair xmath728 on the bottom of the permutation . then we assume that in this case xmath6 is not admissible for xmath274 . . . First, Xmath724 admits no clumsy-veech induction . In that case, setting @xmath750, the generalized permutation @xmath270 decomposes to : @xmath751 with @xmath752 and @xmath753; hence, @xmath270 has no admissible parameter (employer) . . . in that case, if xmath739 decomposes to : @xmath746, let us assume that @xmath742 is at the bottom of the line, if the twin of @xmath742 is at the bottom of the line, but not @xmath743 . . . if this place is in the bottom-right corner, then, clearly, xmath10 has no permit (employer) . . . if the place is in the bottom-right corner, then, obviously, xmath739 has no permit (employer) . . . but, perhaps, it is the last element of the top-left corner . . . . if xmath739 decomposes as : xmath746 , we denote by xmath747 and xmath748, and obtain xmath274 by removing xmath745 from xmath749 and putting it at the right-hand end of the line . . . And we show that almost all irreducible linear involutions are the same for almost all irreducible linear involutions. They are the first return map of the vertical foliation on a segment of saddle-connections. , we see that there is a non-zero pseudo-strain at xmath755 (see definition : pseudo) , then we denote by xmath170 the complex number at xmath756 for all @ xmath383 . , in this section, we first prove that the set of irreducible linear involutions in an attractor is the renormalized rauzy-veeh induction. we have found a non-zero pseudo-strain at xmath755 (see definition : pseudo) , otherwise we can prove that @ xmath10 has an admissible parameter (case 1 ) . . . . then, as in section (subsection) red12 , we have a broken line @ xmath164, which begins at xmath103, and whose edge number @ xmath365 is represented by the complex number @ xmath366 for @ xmath729 . then, as in Section We consider the line #xmath760 which begins with a Complex Number, #xmath760. We first show that it still defines a flat surface. In the first instance we define the line #xmath760 as the first return map of the vertical flow of #xmath45 over a transverse segment. In this case we impose that the first return map of the vertical flow of #xmath45 over a segment adjacent to a singularity and without singularities in its interior is guaranteed. So in our first instance we can show that this does not override the flat surface, but in the first instance ... the second broken line of @xmath760 starts at the complex number #xmath760 ... and then we decompose each vertical segment into a pair of vertical segments of the same length and then glue them together ... we have two vertical segments left ... we are going to decompose each vertical segment into two vertical segments of the same length and bind them together (see the figure ) ... that makes a polygon, and the sides come together by pairs, so we can bind them together as before ... This is similar to proposition 9. if xmath70 is big enough, then the segment xmath770 corresponding to the limit of xmath771 has no singularity on its interior. xmath759 is the first return map of the vertical flow of xmath768 on a shortest horizontal segment xmath769, adjacent to a pole. so the surface xmath759 does not degenerate when xmath96 tends to zero, and so there is a sequence xmath764 that tends to zero such that xmath765 tends to a surface xmath45 . . . if xmath70 is large enough, then the segment xmath770 corresponding to the limit of xmath771 has no singularity on its interior. the transformation xmath683 is the first return map of the vertical movement of xmath45 on a shortest horizontal segment xmath769, adjacent to one of the poles . . . The rouble-pointed square of the space that occupied xmath214 is the mapping xmath230 on xmath214. It is a highly invertible map: if xmath781 is the map of xmath197, then xmath197 has precisely the same preimage as xmath137. . . . . We derive xmath780 from xmath777 by considering the first return map on the largest subinterval xmath778, whose right endpoint corresponds to a singularity of xmath777 . . . So . . . . so . . . we define the quotient of xmath782 of xmath214 by the equivalence relation created by xmath783 . the mapping xmath227 preserves xmath223 on xmath214, and with xmath227 denotes a measure, again denoted by xmath223 on xmath782 . . . The cloak consists of a rectangle which provides a subset of all measures in a connected component of a stratum @ xmath793 of the moduli space of quadratic differentials. In this case, the degree of this cover is xmath794 where xmath795 is the dimension of the stratum . (contrary to this, math796 is the genus of surfaces) . so that a vertical separatrix @ xmath797 adjoining the singularity @ xmath798 . let math813 be the linear involutions corresponding to math813. now let math800 be two admissible segments and let math813 be the corresponding eddysphere . . . so that a vertical geodesic passes through the right end of @ xmath812 and returns to math812 in a positive or a negative direction . . . . The subset @ xmath810, corresponding to surfaces of area 1, is a finite ramified layer of a connected component of a stratum of quadratic differentials, and the corresponding lebesgue measures are proportional. The degree of @ xmath810 is clearly obvious by construction. if xmath810 is the number of possibilities for horizontal separatrices, then the degree of @ xmath810 is @ xmath794 (decided by labels and the choice of intervals - ) , so that @ xmath810 is a finite cladding. - if xmath810 is a linear anvolution, we can use this theorem to give an alternative proof of the minimality of such an analogue. - in the arithmetical space of the quadratic differentials is finite, and so @ xmath810 has finite measure. so the teichmller geodesic flow on @ xmath811 is recurrent in the lebesgue measure . . . the relations Xmath818 has a partial order on the set of generalized permutations; it is represented as a directed graph Xmath148; and as for permutations, we shall call rauzy classes the related components of this graph. In the case of intervals, the periodicity of the maps Xmath104 and Xmath105 provides a simple proof of the fact that the above relation is an equivalence relation (description of the section : rauzy: classes: iem). In this section, we prove that there is no less equivalence. Moreover, the corresponding statement is still true. Suppose there is a sequence of maps Xmath104 and Xmath105 that converges Xmath275 to Xmath739 . . . if Xmath821 is a string of parameters Xmath822 , then a string of parameters Xmath823 is a string of parameters Xmath824 such that But let’s say the inverse, let’s say the interval maps, which we gave the definition of irreducibility to infinites in Section – combinatorics, there’s no difference between the two maps: for instance, the generalized permutation of xmath19 in letters, and we define the generalized permutation of xmath19 in the subset of irreducible generalised permutations, which can be obtained from xmath275 by the composition of maps – xmath275 and – xmath275 – we begin by an irreducible generalized permutation of xmath270, and we construct the subset of irreducible generalized permutations, by means of some composition of maps – xmath275, and – xmath275, as follows: if xmath275 is a generalized permutation of type – 16 defined over an alphabet – xmath19 of letters, then the generalized permutation of xmath275 is of type – xmath290, if xmath275 is a generalized permutation of type – xmath208 by xmath275, then a symmetric permutation of xmath284 is obtained by a combination of maps – xmath104 and – 106 – which sends – xmath739 to – xmath275 – that is the case. In general permutations, this corresponds to the conjugation of @xmath817. Moreover, if we return to the first return map of @xmath843 to the interval @xmath844 we can consider the first return map of @xmath846, where @xmath847 is the minimum element of @xmath845 that corresponds to a singularity of @xmath846. Let @xmath849 be a general permutation . let the first return map of @xmath849 be the first return map of @xmath844 on the interval @xmath846, where @xmath847 is the minimal element of @xmath845 that corresponds to a singularity of @xmath848 . let @xmath849 be an irreducible general permutation . Remember that the rauzy-veech induction applied on @xmath10 is based on the first return map of @xmath843 , where @xmath844 is the maximal element of @xmath845 that corresponds to a singularity of @xmath10 . . . ‘Negative rauzy-veech induction’ (on the right and on the left) is the map of @ xmath68 which is the first return map of the vertical flow on the subinterval @ xmath860, adjacent to @ xmath862 . we assume that each @ xmath249 has an orientation, so that the corresponding singularity at xmath855 is at its left end . ‘Negative rauzy-veech induction’ is applied to @ xmath859 and it is the map of the first return map of the vertical flow on the subinterval @ xmath860 adjacent to @ xmath862 . ‘ We’ll take the barefaced segment at xmath850, and if it is long enough, then @ xmath856 will be its first intersection with @ xmath850 . we’ll assume that @ xmath45 has no vertical connection with its saddle. Let’s assume that @ xmath450 has no vertical connection with its saddle. Note that @ xmath850 may not correspond to some singularities of @ xmath253 , so naive rauzy veech recitation on xmath850 might miss the interval between @ xmath850 and @ xmath850 . . . . so that we find some composition of the maps Xmath817, Xmath866, which pass Xmath475 to some Xmath865; so that Xmath817 is in the same rauzy class as Xmath849 . . . on the left, we find two linear involutions, which correspond to the first map only differing by a different orientation . . . hence we have proved that if two irreducible generalized permutations correspond to the same connected component, then they are in the same rauzy class . historically, extended rauzy classes have been used to prove the non-connectivity of a stratum of abelian differentials (see for instance @ xcite) . so the corresponding corresponding rauzy data satisfy 1 . . . . . . . . . . , - and - if the corresponding rauzy data satisfy 1 . . . . , 2 . . . . But as we have mentioned, these two permutations are not from the same extended rauzy classes (i.e., up to a equivalence of xmath264) , therefore the stratum xmath 893 is not connected . therefore, the stratum xmath 893 is not connected. For the stratum xmath893, one may likewise consider generalized permutations. That is, the generalized permutations are irreducible. Then, if one considers a somewhat more complicated case, for example, permutations defined over xmath36 letters, one finds an interesting phenomenon. The first is that a rauzi class is filled with irreducible (infinite) generalized permutations and the permutations are irreducible only if they are dynamically irreducible. Moreover, there are similar conclusions for other strata with the following generalized permutations. Figure (Razezi: class 2ii) shows this class. The generalized permutations @ xmath884 and @ xmath883 are irreducible. The corresponding surface of the stratum @ xmath890 are not connected. Therefore, the stratum @ xmath890 has exactly two connected components, corresponding to the two extended rauzy classes. In the table - rauzy: 2 - , we present a more complicated case with an unstable "() unstable" series of permutations. . . .

Xmath835 is irreducible. Let Xmath835 be a correction of xmath36 by adding the three following elementary observations. Let Xmath835 be a decomposition of a generalized permutation of xmath3 (type Xmath16). So if xmath164 is irreducible, so are xmath28 and xmath29 (when defined). Let Xmath850 be an extension of an irreducible generalized permutation of xmath3 , that is to say, of xmath3 , then we shall be able to get an extension of xmath950 to xmath10 by xmath950. And so if xmath850 is a decomposition, then there is no empty nook . 1 . in the remarks rem : a strong : irreducible ; omitting the matrix xmath948 and a suitable xmath949 , we shall be able to get an extension of xmath950 over xmath10 by xmath950 . Hence xmath850 is irreducible . . . 3 . let xmath952 minimize the value of xmath953 . . . so that if a decomposition of xmath3 is held, then there is no empty corner . . . . sent> ##850 and math851 are each adjacent to a singularity math852 and math853 so that for each math365 the linear involution math854 given by the first return maps on math365 has combinatorial datum math482. let math960 be the suspension over math253 which corresponds to the surface math45, then let math960 be the corresponding point, and then, having solved the matrix math962 for a suitable math949 (which does not change the vertical foliation), we can assume math427. we can assume that math70 does not have a horizontal saddle connection . Let math962 be the coefficient of math952 that reduces the value math961 and math962 be the corresponding point. Let math952 be the second return-map of math954 for @ math851 small enough, so that @ math859 is isomorphic to the first return map of a subinterval @ xmath864 of @ xmath850, with @ math868 or math869 a singularity of @ math850. Since the surface admits a finite number of vertical separatrices starting from the singularities, the same argument produces a sequence of irreducible generalizations connecting @xmath970 to @xmath978 corresponding to our description consists entirely of irreducible elements. Here, we assume that @xmath974 is a reduction of @xmath980, and then @xmath975 is a reduction over @xmath976 that corresponds to the first return map of @xmath950 on the subinterval @xmath977. In addition, the sequence of generalized permutations joining @xmath976 to @xmath978 corresponding to our description consists entirely of irreducible elements.
