In spite of several attempts to explain it, it proved particularly difficult to understand the x-ray spectrum of this object. Despite its inconsistency, it was unable to estimate the mass of the compact object at the far end of the galaxy. It was one of two known galactic x-ray sources with superluminal radio-jets (Grs. 1915 + 105) , and is the object of one of the two known star-earth-based sources of the type known as a microquasar (Zhang et al., 1994) with its spectral and temporal similarities to the other superluminous x-ray source of the type groj1655 (Zhang et al., 1994) , which has the form of a black hole system (Badyn et al. 1995) . Even with a difference in distance, the peaks of the x-ray light are remarkably high, i.e., .5 ergs / sec, which is about the eddington luminosity for a y- m-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm-xm- x-ray-x-ray x-ray-glass-black-hole-system (ze, e If xmath7 were truncated with xmath8, then the elasticity of shakura-sunyaev-zeovox was unexpectedly low (which may mean that the standard elasticity of shakura-sunyaev-zeovox can't be applied to this source) . However, it seems to us that the analysis of abramowicz et al. (1996) and taam et al. (1997) reveals a defect in the heat-cooled equation for the disk which, corrected, constrains the model to be of the same strength as the standard shakura-sunyaev disk, and thus cannot explain the grs 1915 + 105 observations. Nevertheless, it seems to us that the analysis of abramowicz, chen et al. (1996) and taam et al. (1997) found a model for the low frequency quasi-period oscillations (qpo) observed in selected x-ray binaries, where the corona above the 'standard accretion' disk leads to a moderate oscillation . (The accretion disk theory developed in the most detail by abramowicz et al. 1988. It is well known that this theory of accretion disk does not constitute the observed phenomena of grs 1915 + 105 (Appendix a). However, we observe in appendix a that neither the hot central region, nor the advection-dominated flow, nor the slim' accretion disk are compatible with the observations of grs 1915 + 105. In addition, we have the correct trend in the rate of accretion. Moreover, the ratio of the typical rate of accretion with the average accretion has the correct metric. Thus, we introduce a more elaborate model in [p. 1]; where, according to the observations (e.g. mirabel & Rodrigues 1994) the inner disk is allowed to scatter some of its energy, in the form of a non-steady jet. Hence, we make use of this new viscosity formulation to solve the equations for the time-dependent disk with the addition of this new viscosity prescription. Figure 1 shows four examples of typical x-ray light curves from grs 1915 obtained with the rxte satellite (e.g., morgan, remillard & greiner 1997). In [fig. 2] the figure shows four of the typical x-ray light curves from grs 1915 obtained with the rxte satellite (e.g., morgan, remillard & greiner 1997). We presume that the emitted energy is not observed in the x-ray, but that it is produced by radio emission. In our calculated light curves, we show that this more elaborate model agrees more strongly with the observations (e.g., mirabel et Rodrigues 1994) , we assume that the inner disk is allowed to decompose some of its energy in a non-erect jet. We then enumerate our results in [p. 2] in [p. 3]. , you must omit the temperature of the gas to a certain extent and check the diffusion rate of the gas. the second extreme is a coaxial pipe at a given thickness, the second medium is of a less numerous thickness, the third is a compressible tube of a common-length height, and the third is the distance from the central object. Moreover, the viscous time scale is much longer than the thermal and hydrostatic time scales (see frank et al. 1992), although it is highly unlikely (below ) that a coaxial advection of energy occurs. The basic principles of modified viscosity are not new (e.g., taam et al. 1985, taam et al., 1994; and also other references in this section). But let us look at the incomparable behavior of the system in general. As a rule, the initial amplitude and frequency of the qpos is strongly correlated with the spectral strength of coaxial pressure (chen et al. 1997, muno et al. 1999) . In the one zone limit, the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction is Xmath14, where xmath15 is the mass of the black hole, xmath16 is the height of the radial distance, and xmath17 is the distance from the central object. We have already talked about this earlier (by belloni et al. 1997a, b, and taam et al. 1997a) and taam et al. 1997 , which was then more fully appreciated by us, for it was argued that the upper state of the power source, as a rule, lasted longer than the lower, which was presumably the stable gas-pressure branch. We can, however, join together equations (Eq1 ) and the square root of the variable h in order to eliminate the variable h, and then create a new equation for the coefficient of the standard Shock (and this is shown in the end of the Appendix.) for any given viscosity. As we said earlier, in the Shock-Shakura-Sunyaev formulation, the stress tensor is proportional to the total pressure; i.e., if the slope of the Shock-Sun is positive (e.g., frank et al., 1992) , this could be useful in view of the instabilities observed in the series of spectra of Xmath12 and Xmath13). The definition of adafs (advection-dominated accretion) will be discussed in the second section (see Chapter 1, adaf) , here we will concentrate on the smallest accretion disks (Abramowicz et al.). We have not yet discussed adafs (advection-dominated accretion flows) as described in . . . adafs (adafs in which we apply an advection-dominated surface) have a high-degree solution even at the standard viscosity level, which consists of cooling (and evaporation) by advection. Hence, if one assumes that the lower part of the disk changes from the lower part of the curve to the stable branch, and that the absorption rate of the inner disk is about to remain about the same, then the advection rate in the inner disk must increase by as much as a few hundred to a thousand in order to reach the stable advection regime. However, in the case of advection, we have not discussed any advections. These flows have a high advection rate, even in the standard viscosity-polymerizing direction, through the addition of the additional cooling (energy exchange) by advection. Therefore, if one assumes that an unstable part of the disk passes from the lower, advectional, branch of the s-curve to the stable branch, and that the accretion rate is approximately constant, then the accretion rate must increase by as much as a factor if the high accretion rate is very much greater than the low accretion rate, then it takes only very short time in the high accretion rate to free this excess mass from the inner disk. It is therefore concluded that the stable disk will not sufficiently account for the occurrence of grs 1915 + 105, at least if we seek to find some theory capable of explaining all the variations in this source. a discussion of the viscosity itself will be delayed until the [number ] prescription . The geometry of our unstable disk is the standard shakura-sunyaev configuration (except for the viscosity law) in the sun-yaev configuration. (Such a model is presented in their figures 7 and 9). The standard equations for the conservation of mass and angular momentum in the disk (e.g., frank et al., 1992) can be combined in the usual way to form the equation describing the evolution of the surface density: xmath37 right,  hu , sample label  eq4  ] where all the variables, except xmath37, were defined in the previous section. This is reflected in the temperature curves calculated for the instability of the disk by szuszkiewicz & miller (1998), see their figures 7, 9 a perfect accretion (r f r h) and a partial r j       .  eq5   end  aligned  ] (the radial velocity of the disk math49 is given by the standard expression (eq. 5-6 of frank et al. 1992): math49. ” —  the ratio of the radiation to the gas pressure,   the ratio of the specific heats (  ) and        ,      vr    ” ,      ” —  vr     ] where math41, math42,    is the ratio of the radiation to the gas pressure, math43, math43,                  ,         ]    partial (  r f    r f    )  partial ( v   vr       ] ,   vr   ] Then we present the radial coordinates in a dimensionless form, i.e., - xmath57, where xmath59 is the schwarzschild radius. Then we use a fixed grid - xmath57; the spacing is uniform, and we take 100 to 300 radial bins. In a future study of the spectral components, we shall have to examine their own characteristics carefully. So, the radial coordinates of the disk are chosen at a large radius, i.e., several hundred to a thousand, so that the disk at xmath61 is always gas-dominated. Hence, the radial coordinates are given by xmath62 and xmath63 for xmath64, where xmath65 and xmath66 are the temperature and the column density of the shakura-sunyaev formulation at this radius, for xmath67, xmath10 and xmath68, where xmath69 is the viscosity of a gas-dominated disk (see below). a new paper has been published by different authors and proposes to include the enumeration of the enumeration, namely, at the height of the cross-section, of the currents, a probability of no more than two or three, in order to explain the sharpness of the dwarf nova explosions (Stern et al., p. 823) in which the dielectricity of the gas under test has been measured and in what respect the volume averaged magnetic field energy density is to be calculated. . . . . in the case of a highly fluctuating gas, the temperature must be substantially increased. It has been shown that the position of the @xmath0 parameter must be larger on the hot stable branch than on the low branch of the solution. This approach is obviously only to be taken when the temperature of the gas is approximately constant, that is, independent of the local thermodynamics of the disk, as it probably is in a number of cases. For instance, Lightman & Eardley, 1974; hereafter Le74; stella & rosner, 1984; hereafter sr84, suggested that @xmath71, where @xmath73 is the turbulent eddy velocity and the scale length, respectively, and xmath76 is the sound speed, and xmath77 is the volume averaged magnetic field energy density. As a matter of fact, we have formulated a viscosity prescription that is incomparably compatible with shakura-sunyaev’s and lightman’s prescriptions. Using this simple formula, we have calculated the viscosity prescription that, at xmath80, is stable in spite of the fact that it has no instability in the upper limit of xmath80, as you can see from the dotted curve in fig. (fig. 12). However, this viscosity prescription (which we will call the lightman’s prescription) is quite unstable at the lower limit of xmath80, and thus does not reproduce the instability observed in Gr. 1915 + 105. Thus, if xmath 80 is very stable, then this viscosity prescription (which we will call the lightman’s prescription) is not too unstable, and so it cannot reproduce the instability observed in grs 1915 + 105. However, as long as xmath83 is stable, the magnetic field will not exceed the gas pressure (because xmath82 is too great), and thus the arguments of sr. ” Our measured mass was an alpha of xmath89, which is typical of the masses of potential black holes in binary systems (see, e.g., Bartlett et al. 1996) . We set a value of xmath69 equal to xmath90, because it yields an aqueous time-series as well. In other words, we chose a value of xmath91, for it yielded a sensible s-curve. Likewise, we set a value of xmath91, in part because it reproduces the s-curve of s-1915 + 105. We then present a light curve and variations of the disk parameters over one complete cycle. (see Fig. 1, fig. 2, fig. 3, fig. 4). Figures (a) and b) show the evolution of the effective temperature of the disk, the ratio of radiation to gas pressure (as a ratio of a density of gas), the optical depth of the disk thomson. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the effective temperature of the disk, the ratio of the Radiation to Gas Pressure (as a ratio of critical ratio xmath82) and the v. = xmath67, the fraction of the luminosity transported vertically by means other than radiative diffusion. This wave is often called a density wave or a transitional wave. The outermost region of the disk is the zone in which the gas descends to the high state. The higher the concentration, the faster the gas ejects its angular momentum, and the matter is ejected from the high state. The higher the concentration, the more it ejected, the faster the angular momentum of the gas, so that the volume decreases at a faster rate. ((5:6:1: qt Xmath103))—in the upper left corner of figure (which qt Xmath103), a heating wave is initiated, and propagates from the inner disk to a higher xmath17 ( qt Xmath17) , and in the Xmath17 state, it is the outermost density that has the lowest frequency, whereas the innermost density has the highest frequency. (In the Xmath17 state, in the Xmath17 state, the fluid contains the most mass, and it loses its momentum and is transferred into the inner disk, where it continuously drops into the hole. . . . The energy flow coefficient, Xm106, was chosen as the most appropriate because of the following considerations. We now systematically studied the effect of the new viscosity on the disk, in order to compare the results with the gross temporal behavior of gms 1915 + 105. As for the energy transport fraction, we also tested a wide range of values for xm106 and found that xm106 was the most appropriate, because, as with the other parameters, we examined a wide range of values of xm106, and found that   [26] for xm107  - 9   [36] [38] [25] [34] . The density wave dies away, the most unstable regions are emptied of the excess and cool down. In this state, the flux of the disk inflow is low, and the pressure of mass falls in the innermost regions of the disk. , then the instability begins, and the total mass in the innermost region is exhausted. A portion of the curve (the arc) is a depiction of the evolution of the integrated luminosity as a function of time for nominal values of the following parameters and for @xmath118, 0 . . 0 . 0 and 0 . . . in agreement with the equation dmo, we find that for the nominal values of @xmath118, the rate of building up the excess mass is at xmath120, where xmath111 is the maximum stable accretion rate given by equation dmo, and so a small increase in the rate of xmath111 at xmath111 above xmath111 can cause a considerable reduction in the rate of cycle . . . As a rule, as the value of xmath110 increases, the time for the disk to complete one of its cycles (called the cycle time) increases with xmath10, from about 5 % at xmath110 0 . . . where the instability first sets in; this increase in cycle time actually decreases with xmath110 . . . and compared with the equation (dmo) , we find that, as the value of xmath110 increases, the duty cycle (i.e., the time at which the source spends in the high state) increases by about 5 % at xmath110 0 . . . in general, we find that the xmath110 is increasing with the value of xmath10, from a rate of about 5 % at xmath110 , to about 50 % at xmath110 One point that strikes me as particularly interesting in the Figure is that the progression of time and the average luminosity (i.e., the count rate) from pattern (a) to (b) in fig. (Fig.) is very similar to that of fig. 1a, in that in fig. 1b there exists a short state of mass growth (the low state) . Next, the fourth panel (c) in fig. (Fig.) is somewhat similar to that of fig. (Fig.) in fig. (Fig.) because, as a rule, the liquid stagnates in the helium (seeing that it is a liquid, it is a liquid, and it is very little time to get rid of the vaporous mass in that region. (Fig.) The difference between the cyclic behavior of Fig. (Fig. 1) and Fig. 1b is mainly due to the fact that in the data there is not a complete decomposition of the vaporous mass and that oscillations continue with a gradually declining amplitude, while in the simulations this high temperature is maintained until the bulk of the vapor has been swallowed up by the black hole. The physical reason for the shorter cycle time of a little space of xmath10 is that the vaporous mass can be build up faster at higher rates. In the simulations we observed that the density of the disk was proportional to the density of the column density, as we saw in Figure . . . . ; if the high state was a state of high counts, then a peculiarity in Figure . . . is that the count rate increases first and then increases at the end of the high state episode. The simulations prove that the density of the disk is slowing down, but that the disturbance begins to show itself globally. . . . . so, in a discharge, the luminosity of the disk is always negative, not positive, as in Figure . . . . . a swell, as in a case of a swell, increases slowly and gradually. In this case, the peak of the discharge is at first, and sometimes at second, peaks. In all our simulations, it has been seen that, as the eruption progresses, the mass of the inner disk increases because of the greater and greater inflow of mass from larger radii. So, the profile of the outburst in our simulations is that the second derivative of the eruption @ xmath122 is always negative, not positive, as shown in Figure 1 . So, in an outburst, the flux of light in the inner disk only decreases when the outer disk cools down and the injection of mass stops, leading to the decrease of the internal flux in the inner disk . Finally, in one of the panels in Figure ([fig] ] ([fig] ) , a first peak is shown, and sometimes also the second peak, and that is the opposite of what is shown in Figure 1 . The temperature of the discs, as can be seen from the relatively high temperatures of grs 1915 and 105, e.g., at xmath124 kev (belloni et al. 1997b) precludes the possibility of a neutral reflection. In this case, the combined albedo of the reflected spectrum of the corona in the form of a strongly ionized disk can be much higher than the standard number 0 - 0 in eqs 15 of haardt & maraschi 1991. According to the following, it is possible that as much as xmath124 of the xrays emitted by the corona towards the disk (e.g., magdziarz & zdziarski 1995) if the reflection and the reprocessing take place in a neutral medium ( neutral in the sense of high-z elements, like oxygen and iron, which are necessary for the reflection spectrum) . so, it seems, that in principle the blackbody flux may exceed the in a thermal component by the ratio xmath124 (see eq. 15 in Haardt & Maraschi 1991, xmath125 and xmath127) . As indicated by nayakshin and dove (1998), the integrated albedo of the reflected spectrum in the case of a strongly ionized disk is much higher than the standard 0 - 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 2 of the neutral reflector (i.e., - at xmath129 in eqs. 15 and xmath126) One physical mechanism that can speed up the transfer of energy from the disk is mhd waves, which might be a different kind. The most significant of these is that the upward averaging (i.e., a zone approximation) of the conventional accretion disk theory is not quite accurate in the estimation of the vertical radiation flux of the disk. The heating of the unstable region in grs 1915 occurs on a time scale very much shorter than the cycle time. Fig. c - Panel -c - (fig. - data) shows rapid and chaotic oscillations as fast as a few seconds at the end of the high state, whereas our simulations do not show the same behaviour. - One explanation could be that these rapid oscillations are failed attempts by the disk to move from the high to the low state - and that in this quick oscillation the disk is always brighter than it is in the low state, which might be interpreted as a confirmation that only a small part of the disk (more likely the innermost part) in the simulated disk does not participate in these rapid oscillations. Further, the rise and fall times are shorter in the data than in our simulations. The time scales for the rise and fall of the arrays in Fig. 2 are much shorter than in our model. Note that the rising and falling times are shorter in the data than in our simulation. The act of reversal of the inner disk causes the intermediate event, which is a precursor to a major outburst, as seen in fig. (Fig. 9: Variable Alpha) . the presence of these two time scales is evident from a look at the light curves. In a case like that, since the Xmath0 in the inner disk is larger than the Xmath-13 in the outer, the time for the oscillations in the inner disk is much shorter than the viscous time, which has a dependence on Xmath-13 (e.g., Frank et al. 1992) . the radial length of the Xmath-13 is also calculated, so that the @ xmath-13 is roughly equal to xmath-13 for xmath-13. this corresponds to the action of the Xmath-13 in the eddy of the inner disk, as shown in Fig. (fig.) [25] . the inverse in the figure (Fig.    ) was, in fact, a function of this sort allowing the @ xmath-13 to be roughly              [28][29] in the inner disk (Ziphid et al. 1992) to be given as a coefficient of   (in a word,   ). And as for the small mass of the inner disk, which is small compared to that of the outer disk, it is also difficult to explain the rapid ebbs and waves of the inner But all our efforts in this direction (with a reduction of xmath67 in the transition from xmath140 to xmath141) have been unsuccessful. although we do not intend to depict light curves, we do, however, merely to say that we have attempted to allow the fraction @xmath67 to be a function of @xmath85, for the transition from @xmath140 to xmath141 implies a significant change in the physical conditions of the disk. Among the other general trends depicted in the light curve of the accretion disk, the speed of the heat of the liquid in the hot-state is equal to the speed of the transition wave, which was studied analytically by meyer, ’84, ’ and numerically by menou, hameury, and stehle (1998), both of these studies find that the speed of the transition wave is xmath143 . . . although our model is capable of detecting many general trends, the rise and fall timescales in the data are always shorter than in the simulations . . . the fast rises and falls of the wave resemble, rather than being rounded, the irregular patterns in the simulations (see fig. c). In other words, our hopes were that the freedom in choosing xmath142 might be able to reproduce the flickering disk . . . but all our efforts in this respect (as the number of times the change in the shift in xmath90) were unsuccessful. For example, if some physical process could cut off the simulated light curves, say, by a factor of math150, so that the bright spot in the discharge would not be seen by the observer, the discharge profile would be much more definite. to consider the possibility of constructing a process that could cut off the simulated light curves, we must remember that there are enzymatically a number of ejections from the plasma that takes place in the innermost part of the disk. So if a physical process could cut off the light curve, it would be clear that there are powerful ejections of plasma from the ejecting disk. (Eikenberry et al. 1998) and fender et al. (1998) have shown that there is a strong link between x-ray ejection and ejection in the infrared and the radio. (Eikenberry et al. 1998) had found that the minimum strength of the jet (which might consist of individual ejections) was as high as xmath149 few xmath148 erg sec@xmath115 for the event first observed by mirabel and rodriguez ( 1994) . which is still in order to eject into the jet, which is as great as the largest x-ray luminosity of the absorbed light. (Eikenberry et al. 1998) had shown that there exists a strong connection between x-ray emission and the emission in the infrared and infrared. This is simply to say that the jet power is not visible in x-rays, but only appears in radio or other non-x-ray wavebands. This is because the importance of advection in relation to the radiative cooling is roughly equal to the ratio of x-math159, and that according to our discussion in Appendix (Section 3), the advection of energy is not important in our model. Therefore, the observed x-ray power is in the form of disk power (fractional fractional fractional fractional fractional fractional fractional fractional fraction) and the coronal luminosity, which is an equation analogous to equation (lj) except that it has an extra parameter, @ x-math158, in place of @ x-math158, if we wish to impose this same parameter on the finite element of the integral. This parameter ( @ x-math158) can be a constant, a function of the local conditions, or of some global variable, e.g., the total force of the disk at x-math155. as we have already mentioned, the mass carried away by the jet is relatively small compared to that carried away into the black hole, so that we ignore the former in the mass conservation (eq. eq. eq. 4). - to the higher power, for example, by the magnetic fields, or by electron-positron pairs, the mass that is carried away in the jet is also smaller. We will take the fraction of xmath158 as a numerical function, namely, xmath168, where xmath168 is the radiative efficiency of the disk, and xmath152 is the total power of the disk. - We consider the vertical momentum of the jet, that is, xmath167, which is equal to xmath168, where xmath168 is the radiative efficiency of the disk and xmath152 is the total power of the disk. This approach is qualitatively reasonable, since we expect the particles to be ejected from the disk when xmath102 is near (and then above) the eddy limit. - a similar consideration allows us to neglect the angular momentum of the jet. However, the latter measure is dependent on the model of the jet, for example, if the particles actually gain a considerable amount of the angular momentum as they are being ejected, the strain exerted by the jet may be so non-necessary. . . . . . Note that the overall luminosity of the model is the same as the one we would have obtained with our basic model, for the same choice of @xmath67 and @xmath10, but without jet ejections (see sect. 1 & 2 below). As a second example, we test the following prescription for the jet power: . . . xmath175 (as opposed to the one given by eq. fj1], it was one of the few that we tested to reproduce the panel c and d of fig. ) . and so it can be reproduced as a feature of the light curves of fig. . . . . the x-rays are now distorted to the profile of the actual disk power, the x-rays are actually more like a square wave, and the rise and fall seem to be sharper than for the model with x-ray174, thus the form of the light curves (especially in fig. d) . . . it may be that the strange profile of the outburst of fig. ' - ft is a function of the radius @ xmath178 which is a constant part fixed at the previous chosen value of xmath180, - xmath179 is a random number distributed uniformly between - 1 and - 1 (a new value of xmath180 is randomly chosen every three seconds) , - xmath182 is a function of radius @ xmath183, such that it is unity in the inner disk, and it is zero for xmath184 . a lot of the conclusions of this paper are based on the choice of the random part of xmath67. The figure 'xandj' (fig. 'xandj') shows the resulting light curves for four different accretion rates. The case with the accretion rate in the lower part of Xmath111 (i.e., panel c in fig. 'lcurves') was not affected as strongly as with the case with the upper part (i.e., fig. 'xmath') in which the plasma ejections and random fluctuations in 'xmath' were absent. The second term on the right-hand side of the equation (ft.) appeared to be an extraneous addition, and was neither necessary nor necessary, and served only to make the curves look a little more random. But since it is quite straightforward, and there is relatively good agreement between the two models, and the observations of Gr. 1915 + 105, we have much better knowledge of the essential characteristics of accretion in this source. Besides, we believe that accretion must be fundamental to the accretion process. The accretion of X-rays is almost entirely produced in a circular optical corona that covers the entire inner disk, or is composed of localized magnetic flares (e.g., haardt, maraschi, ghisellini et al. 1994; Nayakshin et al. 1997; Nayakshin 1998) . While we are less confident about the origin of the s-curve in the x-math189 space, we believe that the geometry of accretion in grs 1915 and 105 is the geometrically thin and optically thick one (see section 2: geometry) . . . furthermore, we believe that accretion events must be an integral part of the accretion process . . . . . “ but if you look at the last figure, it is quite clear that the inner disk is quite dim (up to a factor of about 10 , see figure [the figure] dim), whereas in the high state the inner disk is much brighter than its equilibrium luminosity, i.e. it has the luminous flux of a normal disk. Moreover, the inner disk is never completely empty in our model, although the difference between the density of the inner disk in the high state and that in the low state can be a factor of several to a few (see fig.] a) . thus, the inner part of the disk is partly indiscreet and can be said to be 'missing'. Note that at xmath7 as defined by belloni et al. the largest radius the heating wave is calculated in our simulations. Besides, the inner disk is never completely empty of mass in our simulations, though the difference between the inner disk surface density in the high state and that of the low state can be a factor of a few -  xmath - of  xmath10, in a word, xmath10 - > 10 - if the disk was stable, it was dim in the low state. Moreover, we have systematically analyzed the physical principles underlying the behavior of rhytms 1915 + 105 and have drawn several important conclusions concerning the nature of the time-dependent accretion in this system. In this connection, the disk may become optically thin and radiate as a modified blackbody (see the discussion in taam et al.) in order to produce a burst as long as @ xmath194 seconds, geometrically thick accretion flows must have inconceivable small values of @ xmath0 . but in fact if the accretion rate is very high, if the accretion rate is relatively high, a dense adafity would require an inconceivable smaller value of @ xmath0 . therefore, the value of @ xmath194 obtained by us would probably be smaller for the kerr black hole. Thus, the graphs of the outbursts in our model are rather regular, so that we believe there is a correlation between these three quantities, in contrast to the belloni et al. et al.'s results. Furthermore, many observations (other than those made by belloni et al.) do not show a good correlation between the burst duration and the earlier quiescent phase (t . belloni 1999, private communication) . However, if the velocity is very high-eddington, then the flow should be enormously thick. However, if the flow is very light, a dense flow must have small values of @xmath0. We will discuss this in the future. if future observations show even more examples of the jet–spray relationship (e.g., belloni et al. 1997; muno et al. 1999), then we have the means of calculating the dependence of math158 and math67 of the disk luminosity. However, the critical reader may be asked whether the relatively large number of parameters introduced in this work enables us to determine the real values of these parameters. Besides, we must take into account the fact that other transient, persistent black holes do not exhibit instabilities of the sort as grs 1915 et al. , at least not to the same degree. As we have seen in this paper, this geometry has allowed one to get a very good general agreement between theory and observation, and to understand certain features of the light curves in terms of fundamental physical processes. For this reason, we propose that a standard cold accretion disk, with the altered viscosity law, a corona and plasma expulsions seems to be the only sensible choice. As a case of the need for a detailed study of the spectra and the qpos, we point out the following. This results of Muno et al. (1998) indicate that qpos are present when the law of symmetry dominates the spectrum, which usually happens in the low quartiles. In the results of the results of the work of eikenberry et al. (2000), we found that qpos are present when the law of symmetry dominates the spectra, and as we have seen from the results of the latter, they show that qpos are present when the power-law component dominates the spectra, which , the corresponding value is -0454470 - d , it is not very well depicted in the first place. The discussion above focuses upon the particular choice of the viscosity law that we have derived from this work. Although we have not yet made a detailed study of this possibility, we may possibly accommodate it within our model, but only if we allow the parameters in our viscosity law to depend on the surface luminosity . . . if the topological drop in the plasma, fig. 1 , may then be understood, since these are the low states, as measured by the absorption rate, and the lower states of the three panels (a-c) of fig. 1 show the same shapes, although they are lower. The appearance of the swarming of Fig. 1 (d) does not indicate the actual situation in question. . . . however, based on the results presented in this paper, we feel certain that there is an swarming in this source and that this swarming can be modeled approximately by the viscosity law. However, based on the results of this paper, we are confident that there is an swarming in this source and that this swarming can be approximated by the viscosity law . . . however, in view of the results we have presented in this paper, we feel confident that the swarming is real and that this swarming can be described by the viscosity law.
