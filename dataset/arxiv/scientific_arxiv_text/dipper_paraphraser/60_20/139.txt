. . . “but we cannot prove the existence of pulsars in the formation of pop ii nss, as there is no direct evidence for that since there is no pop ii nss or pop ii nss. . . . Nevertheless, we can say that pulsars have proper motion in the formation of pop ii nss, though there is no direct evidence, because no pop ii nss or pop ii nss is observed. But , the physical mechanism for such a movement may be attributed to the Harrison tademaru mechanism, to anisotropic excitations of neutrinos, to anisotropic explosions, and so on (see lorimer @ xcite for a review). Moreover, it is also plausible to assume the existence of the pulsars in the formation of pop iii nss, though there is no direct evidence that any pop iii star or pulsar has been observed. The proper motion of pulsars is in accordance with the maxwellian distribution of @ xmath5 @ xcite, where  = xmath7 is the dispersion . “Second row” . . . – b. m. . hansen and e. s. phinney, mon. not. soc. – a . . .

In particular, these initial conditions are formulated by the monte-calro method and then, in addition, the first distribution functions, such as the initial mass function, the initial mass ratio, the initial separation, the initial eccentricity function, and the initial eccentricity function. These distribution functions are defined by the Monte-calro method and derive from the initial distribution functions of the initial mass function, the initial mass function, the initial mass ratio, the initial separation function, and the initial eccentricity function – ief . b. m. . . hansen and e. s. phinney, Mon. not . soc. j . b. hartle, phys. rep. ; p. 240.
