if it’s true that a bipartite state is called bell-local if and only if there is a local hidden variable (lhv) model for any measurements that alice and bob perform. for our purposes, we’ll talk about bipartite correlations, with the two spatially separated parties named Alice and bob as usual. In between these non-classical correlations lies epr-steering. As we have said, a bipartite state is bell-local only if there is a local hidden variable (lhv) model for every measurements that alice and bob perform. However, there are degrees of non-classicality in quantum systems. Although invented eighty years ago, as this special issue celebrates, the concept of epr-steering was only formalized eight years ago by one of us and fellow workers @ epr-steering. The other level of non-classicality is epr-steering. It is famous for its alarming property that two spatially separated parties cannot confirm the existence of entanglement if neither of them, nor their detectors, can be trusted The above three notions of nonlocality for the pure states coincide with those of the pure states: all non-product pure states are non-separable, eps-separable, and bell-separable. However, in mixed states, the interplay of quantum and classical correlations produces a far richer structure. In this manuscript we investigate the epr-separable states of the class of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, so-called t-states. Using the ellipsoid formalism, we develop a deterministic lhs model for projectsive measurements on these states, and conjecture that this model is optimal. However, no relation between the ellipsoid and epr-separability has been determined. For certain classes of highly symmetric states (at least in the case where alice and bob perform Projective Measurements) , this so-called t-states have been studied extensively, the so-called steering ellipsoid, and in the so-called t-states we develop a deterministic lhs model for measurements on these states, and we conjecture that this model is optimal. The logical hierarchy of the three concepts leads to the bipartite states: the set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non-epr-separable states, and the set of bell-local states is a strict subset of the set of bell-local states. This paper is concerned with whether the state is 'driveable', that is, whether it allows correlations that demonstrate epr-driver. In section 5, two asymmetrical steering inequalities for arbitrary two-qubit states are derived. in section 6, two asymmetrical steering inequalities for arbitrary two-qubit states are calculated. - , each observer carries out a local measurement, called 'xmath1' and 'xmath2', and obtains corresponding results, called 'xmath3' and 'xmath4'. - The lhs model for projective measurements on t-states . in section 5, two asymmetric steering inequalities are obtained. A state is 'autonomous' if it has no autonomous model . - so that it can show the steering of alice and bob, for example, by the secure generation of a cryptographic key between alice and bob without trust in their devices , in the resulting distinction, it is evident that all non-steerable states, if alice is steering, then there is no need for a detailed set of projectors. The role of alice and bob can also be reversed in this regard, in order to define steerable states. In this respect, it is clear that the condition for bob to have an lhs model, eq. (lhs) is obtained by comparing eqs . (lhs) , it is clear that all non-steerable states are bell-local. In the case of a separate quantum state, there is both a local and a non-local state. Moreover, although not as powerful as bell-locality in general, steerability is more robust in the detection of inefficiencies , steerability allows for the use of untrusted devices in quantum key distribution, but only on one side . Moreover, the class of non-steerable states is strictly larger than the class of non-steerable states . we are interested in epr-steering states for all possible _projective_ measurements. We are interested in epr-steering states for all possible _projective_ measurements. This phenomenon epr-steering is a special case of this phenomenon, and is only possible for a subset of non-steering states . . . On the other hand, in this article we give a strong necessary condition for the epr-guided behavior of a large class of two-dimensional states, which we have reason to suppose is necessary, in order to determine epr-guided behaviour. It is shown in the following sections: the arbitrary two-dimensional state may be written in the standard form: Here  tr [ rho ,  i  otimes  sigma There are steered states that have centred themselves in a tetrahedron. The semiaxes of xmath38 are the roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix, xmath40 the eigenvectors of xmath41 give the orientation of the ellipsoid around its center , xcite , so that the general equation of the ellipsoid surface is @xmath42, and @xmath43 is the displacement vector from the center , . in which the ellipsoid surface is , the surface of the ellipsoid is , the surface of the ellipsoid is defined by the set of steered curves @xmath37, and in ref. xcite it is shown that interior points can be obtained from the positive operator-valued measurements (povms) . Thus, the eigenvectors of @xmath41, the eigenvectors of @xmath41, give the orientation of the ellipsoid around its centre, @xcite . Xmath49 may be considered a singular value decomposition of the spin correlation matrix xmath27, for some diagonal matrix xmath50 and orthogonal matrices xmath51 , i.e. , where the diagonal matrix xmath55 may now have negative entries. The t-state ellipsoid is centred at the origin, xmath64 , so that the intersection of the t-states at xmath64 , in the space parameterised by xmath62, forms an octahedron within the tetrahedron at xcite . . . so that all properties of the shared state at xmath47 can be formulated in a representation in which the spin correlation matrix is in the diagonal form at xmath59 , that is, we may consider the rotations at xmath57 and xmath58 by local unitary operations , as an octahedron in a single instance. . . . . the rotatings at xmath57 and at xmath58 may be implemented by local unitary operations on the shared state at xmath47, resulting in a local change . . . the t-state in question is always a mixture of bell states and hence forms a tetrahedron in the space parameterised by xmath62 and xcite . . . so that all properties of a shared state, including the stability properties in particular, can be formulated in a representation in which the spin correlation matrix has the diagonal form @ xmath To consider the possibility of obtaining the result @xmath18 from hermitian observation on her qubit, we draw an astonishing connection between this equation and the epr-disasterability of t-states as follows. Such observation can also be represented in the form of projections, with a @xmath70. in which case, in addition to the probability of obtaining the result @xmath75, we are able to deduce a lhs model for a t-state corresponding to @xmath80, we are able to deduce an lhs model for a t-state corresponding to @xmath70, by the convexity property of non-steerable states.  ((paste), and) with $xmath73, the probability of obtaining the result @xmath18 , is given by eqs. (quenched) and (paste), respectively, from eqs. (quenched) and from eqs. (reduced) and , we have, therefore, an lhs model for bob if and only if there exists a representation of the form 4 7 for all unit vectors 4.1 . . , and so on, from the symmetry of the surface of Xmath88, i. . Xmath87, which (ii) is defined by eq. (eqform) , iii is a hemisphere for each unit vector of xmath36 , the only constraint to be satisfied by a deterministic lhs model for a t-state is eq.

([Distance]) corresponds to those t- states which satisfy eq. (Distance) as a result of the convexity of non-steerable states (see above) all the t- states corresponding to the region defined by this surface and the positive octant have local hidden states for bob. Fortunately, we have been able to confirm this result analytically by the explicit measurement of the integral of the integral in eq. (distance) for eq. (distance) for eq.

Thus, our model is most We show in appendix 1 – cov – that if there is an lhs model for bob, then the singular values xmath123, xmath124, xmath125 of the spin covariance matrix must satisfy the linear epr-sweep inequality xmath126, and thus, using xmath60 and xmath128 for t-states, it follows immediately that there is a simple ‘sufficient’ condition xmath129 for the epr-sweepability of t-states (by either alice or bob). and as soon as one has the simple ‘sufficient’ condition xmath129 for the epr-sweep state of either alice or bob , we have a relatively strong condition. As a result, we will conclude in the appendix (Appendix – Appendix – cov) that if a lhs model for bob exists, then the singular values @ xmath123, @ xmath124, @ xmath125 of the spin-covariance matrix are derived from @ xmath124, and that corresponding hermitian observables are measured on their observables. Fig. 1 shows that this condition is somewhat strong. Alice and bob share a two-qubit state, where bob can measure observables @ xmath130, @ xmath131, by means of @ xmath132, and alice can measure observables @ xmath134 on her observables, with the results labelled by As a result of the above exclusion, the corresponding nonlinear inequality, i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., to e.

Finally, we note that the steering ellipsoid is a representation of all collapsed states, even those arising from povms (these are the interior points of the ellipsoid) and this may provide some indication of how one might proceed with this generalisation. sj would like to thank david jennings for his early contributions to this project.

So, if the surface of integration is a hemisphere bounded by the great circle, a circle bounded by xmath171. Then if xmath171 points to the north, then if xmath171 points to the north, then he will make a metric expression. Hence, if xmath174 is a unit vector without loss of generality, we will recalculate the unit vectors of xmath80 and xmath157 with xmath164 and xmath165 , resulting in xmath178 . so, xmath177 . . . . the surface of integration is a hemisphere surrounded by the great circle xmath174.
