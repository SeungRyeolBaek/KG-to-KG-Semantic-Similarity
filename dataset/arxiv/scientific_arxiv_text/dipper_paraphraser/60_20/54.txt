Whatâ€™s more, the idea of minimizing the skewness of the skewness can be overcome by a selection of gradient-based algorithms, the kind i.e., @xmath8 where @xmath8 is a constant, symmetric, positive-definite gain matrix . one can obtain the latter, but the relative merits of normalized and normalized algorithms are still somewhat controversial. Let us, for example, take a look at the differential equations and, under the assumption that @xmath11 is exactly zero, we take an equation: @xmath13, the non-negative function of @xmath13 has time derivatives @xmath14, hence @xmath14. As for the error at xmath18 (a norm is drawn on the interval of xmath19 where all signals are defined) there are several ways of dealing with the problem. In adaptive control and recursive parameter estimation one needs to adjust the estimate of an imaginary vector, which contains constant but unknown parameters, with measurements of a quantity, @xmath3, here, @xmath4 is a vector of known data, often called the regressor, and @xmath5 is the measurement error signal. This is the main property which an algorithm needs in order to be considered a suitable candidate for the role of tuner in an adaptive control system. What is the effect on the expected value and covariance of @xmath43 on the presence of a measurement error? This is the approach we will use. A formula is derived (with the corresponding @xmath23 integrals) if the measurement error is absent, for the unknown @xmath24 appears only in scalar product with @xmath24. The same result can be obtained with the positive-definite function @xmath41 in the same way. The results are that @xmath11 is a white noise with zero average and covariance, and that @xmath45 are given deterministic data. Here we shall look at the effects of the expected value and covariance of @xmath43 on the expected value and covariance of @xmath43. The second is deterministic. The third is deterministic. The fourth is deterministic. The analysis will now be made for the acceleration detection that is used in a particular case. As a result, the differential equation xmath65 will be given. The property of xmath70 and xmath73, according to the same reason as for the inverse, is still not as high as xmath71, because the right-hand side of the unit is not suitable for immediate integration. This finding shows the difference between the higher convergence rate and the lower error in the initial calculation of the parameters, which require both larger and smaller gains of the gain xmath9. let xmath71, if xmath72, according to the same reasoning used for the inverse, one concludes that xmath73, and that xmath74, although the properties of the acceleration and the inverse are not yet precisely comparable, for the right-hand side of the unit does not lend itself to immediate integration. In this sense, the compromise between higher convergence speeds and lower  steady state error, which require, respectively, higher and lower amounts of the gain xmath9, both larger and smaller. A less conservative estimate of the integral can be obtained by combining @ xmath95 with the average value of @ xmath96 in the definition of @ xmath90. It is not a metric to compare, but a mathematical one, because the algebra does not involve any approximations, and therefore a superior estimate of @ xmath94, valid independent of @ xmath54. Note that @ xmath85 by design. Then, taking xmath85 in, @ xmath87 results in a semidefinite mixture, and thus, in the case of @ xmath88, the combination of and shows that @ xmath87 can be increased without having an increase in the stability of xmath90, which, at least in the case of @ xmath91, @ xmath92, and @ xmath37, are  scalars . . . notice that @ xmath83 is by construction. . . . . The simulations in this section compare the behavior of the accelerating tuner with the behavior of a normalized gradient tuner.

In addition, a certain form of stochastic analysis in [37] covariance shows that the stability and the convergence properties of the accelerating tuner, together with their moderate computational complexity, can be a good tool for adaptive filtering applications. In addition, we expect that the accelerating tuner will find its way into adaptive control of nonlinear systems and perhaps even in dealing with the topological incompatibility known as the 'loss of stability' problem.
