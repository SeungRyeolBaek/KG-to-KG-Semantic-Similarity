It has been tried out and it is a general theory of the kbs. Using the simple kbs, the bcs theory is often used, which is a good description of the correlation of pair interactions in macroscopic systems, such as metal superconductor systems. The kbs theory, however, ignores quantal and thermal fluctuations, which are important for small systems, and therefore must be corrected for finite ones. On the one hand, a theoretical example of this phenomenon is the novel hamiltonian theory, which presents a system of kbs interacting with the parameter kbs2 and rotating with angular velocity kbs3, and the fixed angular momentum projection kbs, with the goal of refining the method. The recent theory, namely the modified bcs theory (mbcs), has shown for the first time that the microscopic source of the non-comparisoning kbs is the quantum - number fluctuation (qnf) of the particle, causing the non-comparisoning kbs to collapse at finite angular momentum. In a rotating nucleus, the phenomenon of temperature-induced pair-correlation, which reflects the strong fluctuations of the order parameter in small systems, has also been predicted. For the first time, the micrometric approach called modified kbcs (mbcs) has shown for the first time that the source of the non-collapsed kbp is the quaternary number of the kbp , which is responsible for the non-collapse at finite angular momentum. This hamiltonian was calculated by using a variational approach to minimize the expectation value of this hamiltonian in the great canonical ensemble. This variational approach was followed by the calculation of the final equations for the intersection of the pair, the particle number, and the total angular momentum, containing the effect of qnf in the form @xmath21 @xmath22 , which also contained the amplitudes of scqrpa and scqrpa amplitudes. The quantum factor  xmath33 is defined by the ratio of  xmath33 with      ,  sum  k m k (n  k   +        ) ,  nm      ,   label  nm                     ] , where the quasiparticle energy at xmath23 and the renormalized single-particle energy at xmath24 are given as @ xmath25, @ xmath26, and @ xmath28. A highly degenerate, equidistant model of matter with the number xmath38 equal to the number of particles, xmath1—also corresponding to xmath41—and to xmath41—for the same reason; the scqrpa correction is more than negligible for heavy nuclei like xmath42sn. The results obtained show that, at zero angular momentum, under the effect of qnf within ftbcs1 (ftbcs1), the sharp sn phase transition predicted by the ftbcs theory is smoothed out. however, for heavy nuclei, such as xmath42sn, the scqrpa corrections are not negligible in comparison with those obtained by ftbcs1 (ftbcs1) . . . the dynamically derived forces and heat capacities obtained for xmath4 are, as a rule, incomparably compared with the results obtained by ftbcs1 (ftbcs1) . . . for xmath4 higher than the critical value xmath46, where the ftbcs gap for xmath47 disappears, thermally assisted pairing correlations appear, in which the ftbcs gap reappears at a given xmath48 and remains finite. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — a — a — a — a — a — a — a — a — a — a — a—— e—— (2001) — a — a—— a—— b—— 397—— [197]——— phys. b———, 397—— — —— phys. c———, 397———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
