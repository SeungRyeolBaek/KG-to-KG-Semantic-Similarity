- The smooth composite bundle of xmath10 over xmath10 of all holomorphic quadratic differentials of an area is, naturally, the unit cotangent bundle of xmath9 for the metric - teichmller. - as the euler characteristic of xmath0 is negative, the teichmller space - xmath9 on xmath9 is the quotient of the space of all hyperbolic metrics on xmath9 under the action of the group of diffeomorphisms of xmath1 that are isotopic to the identity . so that the flow descends to the quotient - xmath12, again denoted by xmath5 . we assume that xmath3 is a closed surface of the genus xmath1 from which xmath2 points, so - called punctures - have been removed . . . The main aim of this paper is to build up a subshift of finite type @ xmath26 and a suspending force @ xmath27 over @ xmath26 that admits a semi-conjugal and semi-conjugal Coordination in the Teichmller Computation. (It is important to note that we make use of a normalization for the teichmller Computation that is different from that in @ xcite.) recently avila, gouzel, and yoccoz discovered that the lebesgue measure in the moduli space of a _abselian_ differential is even exponentially mixing, i.e. exponential decay of correlations for observables. This measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the strong stable and the unstable computation, it is ergodic and mixing, and its metric entropy equals @ xmath6 (note that we use a normalization for the computation in which we differ from the one in xcite). recently avila, gouzel, and yoccoz have shown that the lebesgue measure on the moduli space of _abelian_ differentials is even exponentially mixing, i.e. exponential decay of correlations for all observables. a sufficient large subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 and for @ xmath37 let @ xmath38 be the number of periodic orbits for the teichmller geodesic flow on @ xmath4 of period at most @ xmath39 . 1 . The critical exponent of @ xmath32 is the minimum of all numbers @ xmath32, and the critical exponent @ xmath32 converges @ xcite . 2 . . for a fixed point @ xmath30 and a number @ xmath33 the poincar series of the mapping class group with exponent @ xmath32 and a base point @ xmath33 is defined as the series @ xmath36. Moreover, theorem 3 is an improvement on a recent result of bufetov @ xcite, with a different proof. For a compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 and for xmath37, let  == the number of periodic orbits for the teichmller flow on @ xmath4 of period at most @ xmath39 . The order of the paper is as follows: a review of the properties of trains and the geodesics necessary for the next chapter . . . Section 2 - the arithmetic curve of @ xmath0 shows that a hyperbolic flow is in a topological sense . . . a geodesic lamination of a complete hyperbolic structure on a finite volume is a compact subset of xmath0 which can be foliated into simple geodesics. a geodesic lamination of @ xmath0 is called minimal if each of its half-leaveds is dense in @ xmath19 . thus a simple closed geodesic is a minimal geodesic. in section d. we compute the critical exponent of @ xmath48, and section d. 8 is dedicated to the proof of the second part of the equation. in section d. we examine the properties of railway tracks and the geodesics needed for the sequel. In this section, we summarize some results and constructions from @ xcite, which will be used in the remainder of the paper (see also @ xcite). Let xmath0 be an oriented surface of genus xmath1 with xmath2 punctures, and where xmath3 is the average width of xmath3. a geodesic lamination is called complete if it is maximal and can be approximated in the hausdorff topology by simple closed geodesics. a geodesic lamination fills up @ xmath0 if its complementary regions are all ideal triangles or once punctured monogons. a geodesic lamination fills up @ xmath0 if its support fills up @ xmath0 . the space @ xmath5 of all geodesic laminations on xmath5 equipped with the weak xmath51 topology is homomorphic to xmath5 . a measured geodesic lamination fills up @ xmath5 if its support fills up @ xmath5 . . . a continuous symmetrical pairing exists at xmath5 , so-called _crossing_ , which extends the geometric intersection number between simple closed curves. a geodesic lamination that fills up @ xmath5 fills up @ xmath5 if its support fills up @ xmath5 . . . a geodesic lamination is called complete if it is maximal and can be approximated in hausdorff’s hausdorff topology . . . . a geodesic lamination fills up @ xmath5 if its support fills up @ xmath5 . . . a maximum generic railway or a geodesic lamination Xmath59 is carried by a railway or a geodesic lamination Xmath58 if there is a map of class Xmath57 of class Xmath57 that is isotopic to the identity and maps xmath59 into xmath58 in such a way that the differential of xmath61 to the tangent space of xmath59 vanishes nowhere; note that this is quite natural since a railway has a tangent line everywhere. . . . we always identify train tracks that are isotopic (see xcite for a complete account of the trains). . . . a _ transverse measure_ on a maximal generic railway railway railway railway railway is a nonnegative weight function on all branches of xmath61 satisfying the _ switch condition_: for every branch of xmath64 that is to be connected, the sum of the weights for all branches of xmath64 is required to coincide with the sum of the weights for all branches of xmath64. The train is called 'recurrent' if it contains a transverse measure which is positive on all branches. We call this transverse measure 'positive' and we write 'xmath66 ' - a tangential measure - xmath63 for a maximally generic train path - xmath58 attaches a nonnegative weight to every branch of xmath58 , such that for every complementary triangle with sides - xmath69 we have - xmath70 . a tangential measure - xmath63 for a maximally generic train path - xmath58 gives every branch of xmath58 a nonnegative weight - such that for every complementary triangle with sides - xmath69 , a indices are given modulo three . a branch - xmath74 in a complete train path - - large if each of its two half-branches is large; in this case - xmath67 is necessarily incident on two different switches - a branch - xmath67 in a complete train path - is called - large if each of its two half-branches is large; if the single line of class - xmath57 containing - xmath75 in its interior passes through - xmath74 . . . . a corner - xmath74 in a complete train path - is called - large if it is obliquely connected to a switch - xmath75; if it is essential that @ xmath75 is positively linked to every branch - xcite . . . Yes, yes, if @xmath58 is complete, then the same is true for @xmath78. Note that the transverse subordinate branches of @xmath78 are “winners” of the split, and that the transverse subordinate branches are “winners” of the split. note that there is a natural bijection of the transverse subordinate branches of @xmath78 on the transverse subordinate branches of @xmath78. note that a transverse subordinate branch is a polar compass, and that the transverse subframe of @xmath78 is a polar compass, and not a polar compass compass. if xmath78 is complete, the same applies to xmath76. And if xmath78 is large, then we can tranverse @xmath77 by right or left, as illustrated in figure B. Note that a polar compass is uniquely determined by the angle of @xmath0 and does not depend on the angle of @xmath78 . note that a right polar compass is naturally bifurcated by the number of branches of @xmath78, and the number of branches of @xmath79 is a separate difference . . . the polar compass by @ xmath78 is a rectangle , the branch xmath80 is a rectangle , the branch xmath81 is the winner of the split . There is, in our surface of xmath0, no exception; the curve Graph of xmath84 is connected. As a matter of fact, if the surface of xmath0 is nonexceptional by assumption, then the Graph of xmath84 is connected. by bers theorem, there exists a number Xmath86 such that for every complete hyperbolic metric of xmath0 of finite volume there is a 'flat decomposition' of xmath0 consisting of xmath87 simple closed geodesics of length at most xmath88 . , it is a non-empty series of all simple closed geodesics on xmath0 of length at most xmath88, bounded from above by a universal constant depending on xmath90 (and on the type of xmath0) . as in the introduction, the signifies the bundle of quadratic differentials of area a over teichmller space . . . . by enlarging our constant xmath86 as in the preceding paragraph, we may assume that for a given number xmath89 the diameter in xmath84 of the (non-empty) set of all simple closed geodesics on xmath0 of the length of at least xmath88 is bounded from above by a universal constant that depends on xmath89 and the topological type of xmath0 . . . A quadratic differential is defined as an area, for which the horizontal projective measured geodesic lamination of xmath15 corresponds _to a square of xmath15_. The map of xmath 106, if it be other, a simple closed curve of xmath79, of xmath79, at most xmath88. by lemma 2 , if xmath93 is another, we have a map of xmath94 for all xmath13, where xmath29 is the distance function on xmath84 . . . . by the discussion of xcite there is a constant xmath96 such that xmath97 allows xmath98 to be the canonical projection. . . . the map of xmath106, which includes a quadratic differential, the horizontal projective measured geodesic lamination, is inherently homeomorphic, which is the result of a homeomorphism of xmath102 on the open contractible subset of xmath53 of all projective measured geodesic laminations. . . . , we have a family of distance functions on stable manifolds in xmath4, such that there is a set of quadratic differentials in xmath4, which has a full mass with respect to the natural lebesgue of xmath4 @ xcite, and each @ xmath124 has a constant @ xmath123 such that each @ xmath123 has an open neighborhood @ xmath122 in xmath122, which is homeomorphic to a product @ xmath123 and which the following holds. The manifolds of @ xmath124, @ xmath125, @ xmath125, the same number @ xmath133, such that we have . . . . [ a] hyperbolic ... , e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e. . . , e. . . The veech from veech showed that there is a family of distance functions in stable manifolds, in xmath11, such that a set of quadratic differentials with full mass, which has full mass, with respect to the natural lebesgue measure, in xmath11 If there are no coefficients, it is still the coefficients of the curve graph math147. The total mass of math148 is bounded from above and below by a universal positive constant, and the diameter of math148 subset math148 is uniformly bounded. therefore for every math148 the number of essential simple closed curves math32 on math0 whose hyperbolic length math139 (i.e. the length of a free homotopy representative of the hysterical class) does not exceed math145. for math149, define a distance math154 on math149 by math155 – this is clearly math155 dependent on math155 ... for math150, define a distance math154 on math148 by math155 ... if xmath168 the horizontal measured geodesic of xmath169 is _essentially ergodic _, that is, it is a distinct transverse measure, and its support is minimal and fills xmath170 , i.e., it is a topological disc, punctured by xcite . - remember that the gromov boundary of xmath148 of xmath84 is a set of all — unmeasured — minimal geodesics of xmath19 which are filling xmath19 , i.e. which decomposes xmath0 into topological discs and once ruptured ... - theorem 2 of xmath168 is the absolute boundary and a "|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||d||[16]] and a ceaseless Distance Function ... . In the case of xmath189 the function of xmath190 is a quasi-geodesic function in xmath84, which is dependent on xmath160 only, we obtain the resulting family of xmath190 from the intersection of xmath184 with the strong stable manifolds. The resulting family of xmath190 of metrics on the intersection of xmath184 with the strong stable manifolds is invariant under the action of the mapping class. It is concurrent in the following sense : if xmath185, and if xmath186, then xmath187. For each xmath189 the function xmath190 is a quasi-geodesic function in xmath84, where xmath160 only depends on xmath157, we get hyperbolicity of xmath84, definition of the metrics xmath144, lemma 3 . , if xmath190, if xmath190, then xmath195. 1 , 2 . 2 . and inequality ((pitchchitz)) above the existence of numbers xmath197 only dependent on xmath157, such that the flow Xmath5 satisfies the following expansion property . As a mapping class which preserves a train track of xmath208 as well as a numbering of the branches of xmath208, let xmath208 be the canonical projection, the map of xmath217 is open. Let xmath208 be the canonical projection; the map of xmath218 is open. , he considers a fixed area of xmath215 as a partition of unity; he considers a distance of xmath49 on xmath215 by xmath225. Xmath224, then, is a partition of unity for this covering, and he considers a distance of xmath49 on xmath215 by xmath225. It is very easy to see that if xmath234 is not the identity, then the natural division of the complementary components of xmath58 by a series of numbered shifts causes a combination of complementary components that is not a trivial permutation. The action of xmath11 on the combination of numbered classes is free. , we have to show that xmath234 is the identity , for that is to say that, since xmath24 can be obtained from xmath24 by a sequence of numbered shifts, there is a natural bijection between the complementary components of xmath24 and the complementary components of xmath24 , there is no natural bijection between the complementary components of xmath24 and xmath24. so, if xmath24 is not the identity, then, for the natural identification of complementary components, xmath24 induces a nontrivial permutation of the complementary components of xmath24. Let xmath231 be a numbered complete line, and let xmath232 be such that xmath24 is contained in the numbered class of xmath24. Let sent> be the numbered class of sent>, so that sent> is contained in the numbered class of sent> , the map sent> preserves the large and the small branches of sent>, and therefore sent> is the identity and the manifesto . thus we can define a numbered combinatorial type to be an orbit of a numbered class, under the direction of the corresponding mapping class. So, by definition, the numbered combinatorial type equals the quotient of the numbered classes under the direction of the corresponding mapping class.  and so a numbered combinatorial type is an orbit of a numbered class under the direction of the mapping class group. if the complete train track @ xmath76 is obtained from the complete train track @ xmath58 by a single split, then the numbering of the branches of @ xmath58 naturally causes the numbering of the branches of @ xmath76, and thus the numbering of a numbered split defines a numbered split. if the numbered combinatorial type defined by a numbered train track @ xmath58 is contained in a subset @ xmath237 of @ xmath237, then we say that @ xmath237 is _in_ xmath238 and write @ xmath239. A complete trainline is at this point complete. recall from @xcite the definition of a trainline in the 'standard form', if it satisfies the following properties . . . the combined trainline consists of a long narrow trainpath xmath251 of long length xmath251 consisting of a large branch and a small branch . . . we say that a numbered combinatorial type is a set of numbered, complete trainlines, such that for every numbered trainline, a numbered trainline can be obtained from a shift xmath246 by a single numbered split. - for every numbered trainline, a numbered trainline is obtained from a shift xmath246 . . . so the union of all numbered, numbered connectors in a trainline is the decomposition of our rebar. a railing carries a complete geodesic lamination whose bare elements are the 'girdle curves' of xmath0 and which, every pair of our decompositions, contain precisely three leaves of xmath0 spiraling about mutually distinct boundary curves. For every train track of @ xmath59, in some standard form, for some segment of @ xmath0, there is a numbering of the branches of @ xmath59, such that the resulting numbering is contained in @ xmath238. Let @ xmath259 be any numbered train track that contains a twist connector at xmath79 consisting of a large branch at xmath77 and a small branch at xmath67. . . . So, let @ xmath259 be the large branches of @ xmath77, and suppose that the numbered train track from @ xmath257 is obtained from @ xmath257 by a numbered split at xmath77 with @ xmath67 as the winner, is contained in the numbered class which is obtained from @ xmath257 by exchanging the numbers of @ xmath77 and @ xmath67. the numbered combinatorial type obtained from the numbered combinatorial type of @ xmath58 by a full numbered split and obtained from the type of @ xmath58 by a permutation of the numbering . . . . that is, the following. The individual permutations of the numbering of the xmath58 are clearly a group, so that the train track of the same numbered combinatorial type as the numbered combinatorial type can be connected to a train track of the same numbered combinatorial type as the numbered combinatorial type xmath58 by a full numbered splice-and-splice sequence. - the subset of the xmath268 is the 'subset of finite type' - let xmath263 be the cardinality of a set of xmath253 as in lemma [numbered type], and ... the number of the elements of xmath264 is ... , and the fourth property of xcite follows from xcite. the second property of xmath268 is the same as that of xmath268. The phase space of this shift is the set of biinfinite sequences, xmath270, with the property that if and only if @xmath270 is ... for all @xmath110 , the train track - xmath270 is connected with the same numbered combinatorial type as xmath266, - - otherwise . If a sequence of points @ xmath281 is allowed to be permitted, then @ xmath271 for all @ xmath110, then @ xmath273 equals the number of all possible sequences of length @ xmath46, connecting @ xmath110 to @ xmath266 . let @ xmath284 be arbitrary. The following observation is inseparable from the definitions. the following simple lemma will indicate that the shift defined by the numbered splitting and shifting sequences as in the above lemma is topologically mixed. Suppose, for example, that there is a finite sequence of points @ xmath281 of the finite alphabet @ xmath290 and a transition matrix @ xmath268 , such as @ xmath293 and @ xmath268 and such like. if there is some @ xmath276 such as @ xmath280 for all @ xmath284 , then @ xmath266 is topologically mixing. Xmath284 " By means of Xmath265 we conclude that Xmath297 is, on the other hand, based on Xmath300 also based on Xmath268 , and thus @ xmath305 is satisfied with Xmath268. However, these numbered train tracks are shown in figure c. In this section we relate the subshift of finite type Xmath26 constructed in section b. in particular, every large branch of a train track in special standard form for some frame of xmath0 is contained in this configuration (see xcite, h06a) . . . in this case, the subshift of finite type defined by the set Xmath238 of numbered combinatorial types of complete numbered train tracks on xmath0 is topologically mixing . . . [249] by means of lemma [22] we conclude that , on the other hand, from xmath300, it follows that also from xmath300 . In this way, by lemma [22] we find some numbered combinatorial types, such that our transition matrix of xmath 268 satisfies xmath268. . . . By the definition of an ergodic sequence, there exists a distinct, unique measured geodesic lamination whose support @ xmath19 fills up @ xmath0 and admits a unique transverse measure to the scale . . . Let xmath270 be the set of all ergodic sequences . . . if xmath270 is any numbered division, then xmath312 is well defined and non-empty. . . . note that if xmath257 is rotation equal to xmath286, then the maximal weight that xmath63 disposes on a large branch of xmath257 is one . . . . if xmath312 is a numbered division, then xmath312 is well defined and non-empty . . . therefore, by the considerations in section 4, every division of xmath270 determines the orbit of the action of xmath11 on the space of compact subsets of xmath53. sent> xmath324. (As a consequence of the definition of the topology of our space it suffices to show that there is some @ xmath322 such that @ xmath323 is such that @ xmath323 when @ xmath323 is such that @ xmath323 is such that @ xmath323 on any large branch of @ xmath323 equals one. In other words, @ xmath323 is a function defined on @ xmath324. by definition, @ xmath323 is the logarithm of the maximal weight which @ xmath323 presents on any large branch of @ xmath323 equals one . . . . . and, therefore, the space @ xmath327 of all transverse measures for @ xmath323 equipped with the topology as a family of weights on the branches of @ xmath323 coincides with a closed subset of the set of all measured geodesic laminations which are equipped with the weak xmath51 topology. . . . And the value of xmath49 on the intersection with xmath320 of the cylinder @xmath340 for xmath315 is accounted for in xmath315 . This means that the value of xmath39 on the intersection with xmath320 of the cylinder @xmath340 is contained in xmath314 . Therefore, there is some xmath339 such as xmath339 for xmath315 . . . . and we must show that there is a number xmath345 such that xmath346 for xmath315 . . . to show the first inequality, choose a numbered, numbered series of slashing and revolving (xmath270) that shows xmath270 . . . we have to show that there is a number xmath345 such that xmath346 is a value of xmath346 for every xmath315 . . . As for every transverse measure of xmath329 on a complete train track of xmath58, the maximum of the maximum of the @xmath329-weights of the branches of xmath58 is assumed on a large branch of xmath360, then this branch is in the category of branches of xmath360, so let the #xmath359 branch be in the category of branches of xmath348. For every branch of xmath348, which is the cross-section of xmath360, then it is likely that this branch is in the category of cross-sections of xmath360, so let the #xmath348 branch be in the category of cross-section. The weight of the measured geodesic lamination, if it fills up xmath347, is of maximum equivalence. Then, let the names of the branches in xmath349 be indicated, as well as the names of the branches in xmath346. Therefore, the number of the crosses in xmath347 is not greater than the number of the crosses in xcite. And, if xmath346 is a branch of special geodesic lamination that fills up xmath360, then the @xmath63 weight of the branch in xmath346 vanishes, and so the @xmath344 is the maximum if the support of the measured geodesic lamination is maximal. As the definition of xmath238 is being made and the numbered nature of Xmath 288’s model is being proved, it makes the following Xmath 367 ‘strict’ if for each (and henceforth every) numbered splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath368 we consider a natural carrying map @ xmath369 that ties each branch of @ xmath288 to @ xmath288 . This forms the basis for the proof of the second part of our emma. by Xcite, the number of consecutive splits of @ xmath286 in this particular case is bounded from above by the number of branches on that side. This is complete proof of the second part of our emma. by the definition of @ xmath238, by lemma (numberedtype), and by the considerations in section 5 of @ xcite, tight, perceptible sequences exist. , so that the maximum of the weight of a transverse measure on a complete train track @ xmath58 is assumed on a large branch, our function of @ xmath49 is uniformly bounded. We call a bi-infinite sequence @ xmath370 a normal sequence if every finite sequence occurs in @ xmath371 infinitely often in the forward and backward direction. if a railway track is obtained from xmath246 by a single split on a large branch, xmath77, then each measured geodesic lamination xmath19 which is carried by xmath245 defines a transverse measure xmath378 on xmath245 and a transverse measure xmath379 on xmath246 , then for every xmath110 a natural linear map xmath376 is a natural linear map Xmath376. [regular] let Xmath270 be normal and let Xmath374 be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence that realizes xmath274; then Xmath312 consists of a single projective measured geodesic tumult . . . we have the ... if xmath81 are the losers of the partition connecting xmath246 to xmath245, and if xmath82 is the diagonal branch of the partition, then xmath380, i.e. the convex cone ... xmath381 of transverse measures on xmath245 ... and if xmath82 is the diagonal branch of the partition, then xmath380, i.e. the convex cone ... xmath382 of transverse measures on xmath245 , i.e. the convex cone ... Xmath389 can be equated with the projective linear map of xmath394 (see xcite). The intersection of xmath394 is of a single point xmath19. Moreover, for each xmath110 the point xmath19 is contained in the interior of the convex polyhedron xmath391 and so the transverse measure defined by xmath19 on xmath246 is positive on all branches of xmath246 (the beautiful argument cited above). In this case, the jacobians of the projective linear maps of xmath402 are bounded from above by a number xmath403 that is independent of xmath266. In general, the intersection xmath477 is composed of a single point xmath19 . Moreover, the maps xmath406 are uniformly quasiconformal, and therefore their relative dilatations tend to zero (see xcite). The compass of this map is bounded from above by a number xmath403 which is independent of xmath266. Moreover, the maps xmath406 are uniformly quasiconformal, and therefore their pointwise dilatations tend to zero (see xcite) . The space xmath416 of the complete geodesic laminations carried by xmath246 is a compact, non-empty subset of the compact space xmath417 of all complete geodesic laminations on xmath0 (compare xcite). Therefore, if xmath419 does not fill up xmath0, then there is a simple closed curve xmath79 on xmath0 which intersects a complete geodesic lamination xmath420 in a finite number of points . . . and if xmath419 does not fill up xmath0, then a simple closed curve xmath79 on xmath79 intersects a complete geodesic lamination whose support is contained in a lamination from the set xmath36, so that math419 is ergodic . . . for that a geodesic lamination Xmath19 is maximal and if xmath19 can be approximated in the hausdorff topology by simple closed geodesics. say> the X-ray is hyperbolic, and since the distance between the curves X-ray and X-ray 82 is uniformly bounded in X-ray 82, this implies that the diameter of the image under x-ray 431 of the moving and sizing sequence in X-ray 82 is _ finite_. ent> the X-ray 82 is the convex cone containing all transverse measures in X-ray 82. . . . from Section 2 it was shown that the graph of x-ray 82 was normal under the assumption of all others, and that the graph of x-ray 82 was made up of subsequences whose images under the map of x-ray 82 were unparametrized quasi-geodesics in x-ray 84 with end points at an arbitrarily large distance. . . . it is an inverse . . . it is a contradiction, and indicates that x-ray 82 is filled up with x-ray 82 as in the previous paragraph. Remember from Section 2 that the contour of x-ray 82 is hyperbolic, and that the distance in x-ray 84 between the curves x-ray 79 and x-ray 424 is uniformly bounded by x-ray 84, which means that the radius of the image centered under x-ray 431 of every moving-point, is a _indefinite_ geodesic ... This is a contradiction and merely signifies that the support of x-ray19 fills up x-ray “Limitation” is a double-specific ergodic transformation if @xmath270 is unique as defined above, and if, besides, there is a single, and thus every numbered, shifting sequence, which realizes @xmath270, the intersection at xmath440 is a unique point. “Each normal sequence, if @xmath270 is normal, and let @xmath270 be a numbered numbering sequence, which realizes @xmath270, there is a single, uniquely ergodic projective measured geodesic lamination which fills @xmath480 efficiently.

(Rafi RAO reported) that for every quadratic differential of area, one on the riemann surface corresponding to xmath33, the lengths of the short-sleeved curves of this short-sleeved decomposition (i.e. the lengths of the corresponding short-sleeved geodesics) are bounded from above by a universal constant, @ xmath468 , for every @ xmath321 there is a constant, @ xmath469, such that if @ xmath33 is contained in the „ xmath157 thick part“ @ xmath470 of all marked hyperbolic metrics without closed geodesics of less than @ xmath5 , then the metric and the @ xmath468 metric are @ xmath468 bilipschitz equivalent (see e.g. @ xcite for this well-known fact) . . . and for this we have . . . . . we have . . . a small curve. . . . . and in the space of the shrouded riemann surface corresponding to xmath33 the lemma in question gives information on the curves that are short for the quadratic differential metric and long for the hyperbolic metric. a certain piece of line of measured geodesic lamination, that is, as measured by the elevation @ xmath475 of @ xmath476, which is determined by @ xmath476 , and a number of poles on @ xmath476, which is defined by @ xmath476 , is an irrational number, and therefore we have irrational number irrational number irrational number irrational. by means of the results of xcite, the number of poles on the complete train path irrational is uniformly bounded. Because a chain runs through every branch of @ xmath476 at most twice, the intersection irrational number irrational in xmath477 is one, and so the total weight of the tangential measure irrational on all branches of irrational @ xmath476 is uniformly bounded. now irrational and hence by choice of irrational, this total weight is uniformly bounded. as we have now xmath477 the maximal weight disposed by xmath477 on a large branch of irrational @ xmath476, is one, and thus the total weight of the transverse measure on irrational @ xmath486 is uniformly bounded. And since the space of @ xmath66 of transverse measures on irrational @ xmath478 is surrounded by the rollers, there is a decomposition by @ xcite, where @ a bidding and haggling circle, and there a triangular and a bounded point of the teichmller flow. Then let xmath495 be the subgraph of xmath286 of all branches whose weight, for the measure of xmath63, as a whole, is equal to xmath496. Let xmath488 be the numbered array of one-hundred-split and numbered recurrences, for which xmath475 would be the lift of xmath15 defined by xmath475. In this way, let xmath495 be the extent of a line of xmath286, in which there is an aggregate of @ xmath264, whose weight, as a matter of fact, of xmath490 is at least xmath496 . . . So a continuous series is required, and for that, let xmath475 and xmath490 . . . , the imaginary measure @ xmath329, defined by the vertical measured geodesic lithosphere of @ xmath16, is @ xmath499, and therefore @ xmath498 is symmetrical . . . In this sense, the relationship between @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 is very small, and @ xmath17 is very small. this remark demonstrates our assertion . . . by the above analysis and the results of @ xcite, the assignment of @ xmath17 is an * xmath17 quasi-geometric . . . if the orbit of @ xmath17 is periodic, then for sufficiently small @ xmath321 it does not cross the subset of the teichmller space of hyperbolic metrics whose systole is smaller than @ xmath157 . . . but then the minimum of all @ xmath17 is very small. . . . . in other words, if @ xmath17 is small, then the minimum of all @ xmath17 of the @ xmath17 lengths of @ xmath17 is very small. - math511 and math512 in math84 is at least three. In this section, we will apply the results of Section 5 to construct a finite number of, however, complete numberings of continuous lines of groupings. - And, in particular, by consideration of the Lemma [7] there is a universal constant math468 with the following property. Let math514 be any kind of number, and let math329 be any measured geodesic, which is carried by math288 and which is at least a measure of one - then the maximum weight disposed by math329 on a large branch of math58 is at least math515 . Moreover, the measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the stable stable and unstable foliation. In this section we will make use of the results of section 5, to construct an innumerable family of math5invariant probability measures on math4 . This measure is invariant, ergodic and mixing under the teichmller flow, and it gives the full measure to the space of quadratic differentials whose horizontal and vertical measured geodesics are unique ergodic and fill up math0. The maximal weight of math329 on a large branch of math5 is at least math515 . I think it would be very good to use this ‘extreme’ formula in the next section. Note that ‘extreme’ = ‘invariant’ = ‘invariant’ = ‘invariant’= ‘invariant’ = ‘invariant’ in ‘xmath449 – assuming there isn’t an ‘invariant’ mean formula for ‘xmath449’. To do that, suppose the metric does not exist . . . that is, to assume the opposite, that this formula exists. Moreover, the above equation may be explained as follows. ‘Come by means of masur ‘xcite’, for every ‘xmath423’ there is a number ‘xmath523’ which means ‘xmath524 for every ‘xmath525’. note that the ‘invariable’ mean ratio for ‘xmath4’ is uniformly bounded and essentially positive, and every ‘xmath278’–invariable logarithmic probability measure on ‘xmath449’, which gives an entire mass to ‘xmath464, equates to a finite invariant logarithmic probability measure on ‘xmath449’. This is a contradiction to the rule. A measure of probability measures on xmath273 which transfers to xmath538 the full mass of xmath464 into the space xmath538 of xmath538 all teichmller geodesics. we have. We have . . . we have . . . we have . . . because xmath538 is a compact metrizable space, the space of all probability measures on xmath537 is compact . . . because xmath538 is a compact metrizable space, the space of all probability measures on xmath537 is compact . . . since the pair of endpoints of teichmller geodesics is known to be dense in xmath538, the set of teichmller geodesics has been known to be dense in xmath538, we only have to show that when xmath534 in xmath532 we have . . . but that only means that for every continuous function . . . on xmath4 we have . . . that is obvious because . . . . . . . Yes, let @ xmath264 be the cardinality of the set @ xmath238 of numbered combinatorial types, as in lemma [numbered]; let @ xmath545 be any matrix with non-negative numbers @ xmath546, such that @ xmath547 if and only if @ xmath548 (where the matrix @ xmath268 is defined in the paragraph preceding Lemma [shift]) . Moreover, the support of @ xmath63 is contained in the preimage of the closed orbit of @ xmath15, under the map @ xmath28 . it is shown the lemma. In our example, let the word 'miscellaneous' be the cardinality of the set 'miscellaneous' of numbered combinatorial types as in lemma [numberedtype], and let 'miscellaneous' be any matrix with non-negative entries @ miscellaneous_ and that @ miscellaneous_ is defended by @ miscellaneous_ (as the expression 'miscellaneous_) . " Hence the axial ratio @ xmath115 at xmath119, -, which corresponds to the second ratio @ xmath110, will be the measure of the generalised counter-current @ xmath109. Thus the counter-current @ xmath110 is, in the resulting equation, a measure of the provability of the sub-intercept of a normal point at xmath109. Then, combining the mathematical representation @ xmath110 with the stochastic matrix @ xmath252 we have a probability measure @ xmath329 which is, under the effect of the sub-intercept, invariant, and gives full measure to the sub-intercept of a normal point. For the support of every bernoulli measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath109 is all of @ xmath109, and @ xmath109 is invariant and ergodic when the sub-intercept is applied to xmath278. The resulting probability vector @ xmath168, along with the stochastic matrix @ xmath252, imposes on the sub-intercept an invariant probability measure on @ xmath109 in a finite-type that is invariant during the re-intercept and gives the whole set of normal points. We call this bernoulli measure for the teichmller geodesic flow a bernoulli measure for teichmller geodesic flow Xmath5 . . . with this enumeration the teichmller geodesic flow acts on xmath573 via xmath576 . . . let xmath569 be a borel set of all horizontal and vertical measured geodesic laminations on xmath0 which are unique ergodic and whose support fills xmath0 and denote by xmath570 the diagonal in xmath575 . the set of quadratic differentials in xmath5 with uniquely ergodic horizontal and vertical measured geodesic laminations which fill up xmath0 is (non-canonical) homeomorphic to xmath576 by choosing a borel map which associates a pair of transverse projective measured geodesic laminations in xmath577 with a point on the teichmller geodesic determined by the pair and extending this map in such a way that it is connected with the natural - xmath575 actions. xmath330 by replacing xmath330 with the function xmath588 for sufficiently small xmath337 guarantees that there is a subset xmath589 of full xmath589, so that the rise from xmath590 to xmath10 is well defined and continuous on the lines in xmath538 . the radon measure xmath530 on xmath530 is exactly continuous with respect to the product of xmath530 . in a sense, since xmath537 is ergodic under the teichmller geodesic flow, the measure xmath530 is ergodic under the action of xmath530. and so on, there is a continuous function xmath334 on xmath4 with compact support and xmath549, so that xmath549 does not converge weakly to zero as xmath586. Therefore, if xmath538 is locally of the form xmath598, where xmath599 is a measure in the space of projective measures . . . . Assuming to the contrary, Xmath538 is not mixing . " In Xcite, we define xmath607 by absolute continuity, the set xmath608 has full measure with respect to xmath580 . Thus, if xmath601 are typical points for xmath63 on the same strong stable manifold in xmath4, then xmath602 for a suitable choice of a distance function @ xmath29 on xmath4 . as a consequence, there exists an xmath11-invariant subset of xmath548 whose mass is so full that for every xmath605 and every xmath606 the function xmath590 is constant almost everywhere along the strong stable manifold in xmath17 and the strong unstable manifold in xmath102 . as in xcite we define xmath607 by absolute continuity, the set xmath608 has full measure in respect to xmath580. a pair of xmath610 is a unique geodesic . Such neighborhoods are well known to exist . . . choose a quadratic differential whose horizontal measured geodesic lamination @ xmath614 makes up @ xmath615 and a cross-ratio function @ xmath616 is the cross-ratio of @ xmath615 . There is a natural action of the group @ xmath633 on xmath10 where the diagonal subgroup of @ xmath633 acts as a geodesic flow. Thus the value @ xmath630 is continuous and satisfies @ xmath630. Thus the @ xmath633 orbit through the above quadratic differential identifies two embedded lines containing @ xmath617 in their interior, so that the restriction of the function @ xmath638 to @ xmath638 corresponds to the restriction of the usual dynamical cross-rank on the space @ xmath639 of oriented geodes. Note, for each @ xmath634 the orbit through the line stub stub stub of the above quadratic differential identifies an embedded line in stub 635, and the orbit through stub stub stub stub stub is contained in stub 636. So, for every stub stub, the orbit through stub stub through stub stub stub is an embedded line in stub 635, and the orbit through stub stub stub stub stub is contained in stub 636. We obtain a constant return time for a length of the Teichmller geodesic flow @ xmath5 on @ xmath5, which is typical for a length of the Teichmller geodesic flow @ xmath5 on @ xmath5 that is at all times @ xmath590. In other words, the function @ xmath590 has arbitrarily small periods, contradicting our assumption that the length of @ xmath590 equals @ xmath595 for some @ xmath596 . [22] the following observation is a variant of theorem 2 of theorem 2 of theorem 2 . 15. Our solution . . . can we take the following explanation? . . . [22] the return time to a particular compact subset of @ xmath4 for a flow of the teichmller geodesic flow @ xmath5 at @ xmath5 there is a number @ xmath647 and a constant @ xmath648, such that @ xmath649 , phi  s ,  epsilon t . . . (By extension, this observation, in consequence of which the corollary is that our window-shaft balance, xmath49, on xmath567, is equal to a semi-conjugated fluid , - a semi-conjugated fluid is uniformly bounded.) Let xmath665 be the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations carried by xmath664 and let xmath666 be the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations which hit xmath664 efficiently and which are such that - xmath658. Then let xmath63 be any measure of bernoulli measurement on the space of xmath26 . the equation now follows from this observation and from the fact that our borel suspension, semi-conjugated to the teichmller stream, is uniformly bounded . let xmath665 be the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations that are carried by xmath664 and let xmath666 be the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations which hit xmath664 . — the relationship between the branches of @ xmath674 and the numbering of @ xmath674 is given by an interpolation. For @ xmath674 the intersection @ xmath675 is constituted by a hyperplane of @ xmath53 (which is, in contrast, a piecewise linear structure, which defines the Lebesgue measure class) and hence has a lost Lebesgue measure. Note, for @ xmath674 the synergistic type of the numbered track is given by the corresponding computed function of @ xmath672 (@ xmath672). Note that we have @ xmath677 for both @ xmath64 and @ xmath681 . In the mapping class group, the shift invariant measure @ xmath63 is given on the subshift @ xmath684 of finite type with alphabet @ xmath238. Hence the railway tracks @ xmath678 which were obtained from @ xmath672 are numbered . . . as the compass of the numbered train stations at @ xmath684 is set in a hyperplane of @ xmath53 (according to the natural piecewise linear structure which defines the Lebesgue measure class), and hence it is called the vanishing Lebesgue measure. That is to say, the set of novel geodesic laminations with full Lebesgue measure has a finite sequence @ xmath687, with @ xmath688 for all @ xmath110, and a number @ xmath551 such that for every full, splitting, and shifting sequence @ xmath654 which converges with @ xmath414 in the above sense, the sequences @ xmath689 and @ xmath690 are tight, as described in the lecture about @ xcite . * .. as for the proof of @ xcite. .. . . . . the poincar series at xmath30. the equation of @ xcite and the main theorem of @ xcite . . . in this section we continue to apply the assumptions and notations of Section 2 and 6 . . . namely, we show that the critical exponent of the mapping class group equals @ xmath6 . . . . but even though a priori it is not clear whether our sub-wave of finite type is topologically mixing or transitively, we can apply the same principle as above . . . So let Xmath72 be the image under the map Xmath701 of the Lebesgue measure Xmath702 of the solid unstable manifold Xmath102 . . . let Xmath72 be the closed ball of radius Xmath723 about Xmath33 . . . , let Xmath723 be the set of all projected, radially shaped geodesic laminations determined by xmath724. . . . . By xmath722 the canonical projection of the lines of the teichmller flowing with horizontal laminations in the class Xmath329 . . . . for xmath11 there is a number Xmath37 which means that the images under the elements of xmath11 of the ball of radius xmath713 about xmath33 are in opposites. But let us suppose we have at least a number of each xmath715, that is, at most a number of the number xmath715 . . . so that for every xmath715 there is a number of numbers, in the order of xmath725; and for xmath727 there is a family of all pairs, at least a family of some xmath719. By the property of 3 . . . a closed set of xmath726, derived from assuming that all the points xmath738 are in at least one set, each point xmath738 being contained in at least one set. In consequence the family xmath739 forms a foundation for xmath736. . . . there is a number of xmath120 which means that for all xmath715 we have a number xmath716. . . . by reason of 0684 we have a number xmath725 which is a countable set Xmath725, such that the set xmath726 is mutually disjointed, is contained in Xmath728 and covers xmath726 – almost all xmath728 . The set @ xmath749 @ xmath750 forms a foliation of the dimension @ xmath754 and the same is true for the set @ xmath752 for some fixed @ xmath128 . for @ xmath757 and @ xmath746 let @ xmath758 be the set of all points of radius @ xmath39 which project into the closed ball of radius @ xmath39 about @ xmath33 . [321] in other words, the poincar series diverges at the exponent @ xmath141 . [5] inductively we conclude that @ xmath745 for every @ xmath746 . . . . The same way is followed. Let @ xmath743 be the conformal density of dimension @ xmath754 in the lebesgue measure class . Let @ xmath749 be the set of all unit area quadratic differentials projecting to @ xmath735. Let @ xmath748 be the set of all unit area quadratic differentials projecting to @ xmath735. , the ratio - xmath759 - xmath776 - is bounded from above by xmath768 - and therefore - xmath778 -. if xmath775 and xmath776 are bounded by xmath768 - that is, if xmath769, we claim that if xmath766 and xmath766 were bounded by xmath768 - then for every xmath321 we have - xmath768 , which is our lemma . - we claim that if xmath778 and xmath776 are in a row, their number does not exceed a universal constant times xmath780 . As for Xmath769, let xmath769 be such that xmath776 and xmath768 are in a row - as a direct corollary of 'divide' and 'converge' - we get . . . But if we consider an unbroken subset of xmath37, let Xmath38 be the cardinality of the collection of all periodic orbits for the teichmller stream of period at most Xmath39 , if Xmath37 is followed by an equal number of large subsets of xmath39, we have Xmath791 . . . and consequently, a critical exponent is not greater than Xmath747 . . . . a preprint appeared, athreya, bufetov, eskin, and mirzakhani, which contains a precise set of asymptotics for the Poincar series . . . a veech of xcite showed that there is a number xmath42 , so that . . . . . Let xmath37 be the number of periodic orbits for the Geodesic flow of period at most xmath39 . . . to xmath37, let xmath37 be the number of periodic orbits for the geodesic flow of period, at most xmath39, which intersects @ xmath36. Xmath59 is contained in the xmath11 orbit of xmath805. For xmath806 a thin transverse and a tight transverse sequence connects xmath814 to xmath814. Xmath805 extends a transverse and a slight transverse sequence connecting xmath815 to xmath817 , thereby linking xmath817 to xmath818. So the distance between xmath 806 and xmath 806 is bounded from above by a universal constant. Xmath806 is contained in the xmath11 orbit of xmath805. Besides, by the results of xcite, the element xmath821 is pseudo-anosov, and its axis passes through a fixed compact neighborhood of xmath 802 . Moreover, by the results of xcite, the element xmath821 is pseudo-anosov and its axis passes through a fixed compact neighborhood of xmath 802. Therefore, there is a number xmath508 . . . write Xmath 811, and for each xmath812 choose a tight transverse and transverse sequence connecting xmath815 to xmath814, by the transverse and transverse sequence connecting xmath814 to xmath818. the extended geometrical axis is now a closed geodesic whose radius is a function of a function of a function of xmath-36 . . . therefore, if by @ xmath21 we denote by @ xmath-45 the preimage of xmath-844 under the natural projection, and if we define by @ xmath-45 the number of all xmath-844 , then we have @ xmath-46 since, by corollary - exponent - the critical exponent of the poincar series equals @ xmath-56 , then we conclude that @ xmath-48 as argued. Similarly, we have @ xmath-832 by the definition of @ xmath-113 and the choice of @ xmath-843. Alternatively, we have a point @ xmath-843 by the definition of @ xmath-113 and by the choice of @ xmath-833. For example, let @ xmath-81 be a pseudo-anosov element, which is projected by its axis to a closed geodesic @ xmath-328 in moduli space, which intersects with @ xmath-328 . . . for a point @ xmath-823, let @ xmath-833 be a point which is not fixed by any element of @ xmath-328 . “Hence, we will conclude that the length of the geodesic arc @ xmath860 , if at least xmath861 , is at least xmath861 . Hence, let xmath860 be a steep curve of xmath863 with respect to the hyperbolic metric @ xmath864 is xmath861 . . . Therefore, let xmath860 be an essential simple closed curve of @ xmath859 , of length @ xmath856 . Thus, let xmath860  to  rm mod  (s) $] be such a closed geodesic parametrized to arc length. Therefore, let xmath860 be a rise of xmath3 from xmath6 to xmath9, which is the axis of the pseudo-anosov element @ xmath806, and let xmath79 be a minimum closed geodesic on xmath859 of length xmath86.0 . It is an expression of the type of self-defined anosov, so that the curves of the xmath79 and the xmath79 converge. Let xmath746 be the diameter of xmath881 . . . by virtue of quoting the compactret, there is a number Xmath321 such that for every closed geodesic Xmath372 in the moduli space of length at most Xmath39, there is a point Xmath176 of a distance of at most Xmath883 to xmath33. By quoting quoth631 the rule “Quantum” has been overturned, and quoth634 has been overturned so that quoth78 and quoth79 are the same. It's the same thing for the four other numbers. Let @ xmath80 be a point, which projectes to a point in @ xmath36, and let @ xmath89 be such that @ xmath893 . Let @ xmath90 be a closed geodesic in moduli space of @ xmath840 . Let @ xmath80 be a closed geodesic in moduli space of @ xmath840 . let @ xmath890 be the compact subset of moduli space of all hyperbolic metrics whose systole is at least @ xmath90 . if @ xmath806 is such that @ xmath890 then @ xmath888 . . . by the triangle inequality and the choice of @ xmath45 , there is a constant @ xmath120, which is not correlated with @ xmath3 and an element @ xmath892 such that @ xmath916 is the same as @ xmath817 . . . if @ xmath818 is such that @ xmath887 is such that @ xmath888 . . . so if @ xmath817 is such that @ xmath817 is @ xmath818 . [difficulty] there is a number of letters, # xmath902, that is, at least @ xmath904, of which @ xmath902 has a length of at least @ xmath904 ; so, after xmath907 moves, we have a line, # xmath907 on # xmath909, whose distance to @ xmath79 in the curve graph is at most @ xmath264 and at most one , for a reference to @ xmath907 and to xmath909 in a complex of curves, in the "facility of a gromov line" (ed.) , london math. lecture notes 111, cambridge university press, cambridge 1987. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ********* * * * * * **** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * **** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * **** * *
