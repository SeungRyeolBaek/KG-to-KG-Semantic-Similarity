I have already argued that it is a rife that a massless field propagates in a black hole space. The analysis of price was carried out by other authors . . . In the first analysis, bik. . . bik. .. bik. . . studied the dynamics of a scalar field in a - charged - reissner - nordstrom space . gundlach, price, and pullin. , the inverse power-law decay of the field was also proved by the early evolution of radiative fields at future null infinity and at the outer horizon of the black hole. . . . physical, these inverse power-law decays are associated with the backscattering of waves from the effective curvature potential at a distance of xcite .. The analysis of price was extended by others . . . , it is well known that the dominant late-time behavior of massless fields propagating in black hole spacetimes is a power-law tail. . . . In a brilliant work, leaver. . . . demonstrated that the late-time tail can be linked to the existence of a branch of the green function for the analysis of waves. The purpose of this paper is to find an analytic expression for the highest order corrections, which "contaminate" the known inverse inverse inverse, in a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse. The calculations of these higher order corrections are also important from several points of view: the bik_xcite and gundlach et. - And so the distorted part of the late-time inverse is contaminated by higher order terms, which become more and more pronounced as the aveliable time of integration decreases. The precise power index is expected only at infinitely late times. Moreover, the calculation of higher order corrections to the high-order law is of utmost importance; this is especially important for the calculation of the power index from numerical simulations. The calculation of the higher order corrections is also of paramount importance, especially important for the estimation of the power index from numerical simulations. The interpretation of these higher order terms is important from several points of view: bik, gundlach, et al., showed that the leading-order power law tail is universal, in the sense that it is _non-responsive_ to the black hole electric charge (i.e., the power index in a charged reissner space was identical with the one found by price___ for neutral schwarzschild black hole). Thus, in practice, the limited time of integration introduces an inherent error in the calculation of the power index. The calculation of the higher-order terms of the leading-order law tail is also important; especially important for the calculation of the power index from numerical simulations. This metric is given by the reissner- nordstrmmetric of xmath5 , it is the radial coordinate of the black hole, where @ xmath13 is defined by the tortoise coordinate @ xmath7, and for @ xmath14 is the potential curve potential eq . . . . . a static external observer sees that all processes on the surface of the star are  [ advanced] by time . . . . The wave equation, that is, for the scalar field in the black hole, is @ xmath12, where @ xmath13, for the tortoise coordinate, and for @ xmath14 the potential curvature potential eq . The first two terms in eq. ( [ eq.] represent the zeroth-order solution of the function (with xmath25). The inverse, @ xmath22, is the derivative of the xmath23th, and negative-order derivatives are interpreted as integrals. The sum represents the forward-scattered waves. (On the contrary, it is the strongest and strongest back-scattered waves.) We confine ourselves to the region at xmath42, xmath43. The recursion relation between xmath37 and xmath37 is @xmath39. So the solution for @ xmath44 is @ xmath46. comparing eq. ([X][7] with the initial data for @ xmath41 eq. ([X]] we find @ xmath47, where @ xmath47 we can extend @ xmath49 to late times, and similarly to @ xmath50 . that is the dominant backscatter of the primary waves. Therefore, in eq. [10] [10], the dominant term is @ xmath32. With this formulation of characteristic data for @ xmath41, we will next consider the asymptotic evolution of the field . . . the diameter of the black hole is equal to @ xmath66, which corresponds to the freedom to multiply the coordinates by an overall length scale. So, we conclude that @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 are equal in their late-time growth. In order to examine the contamination of higher-order terms (eq14), we use the idea of the local power index . . . @ xmath69 , we have taken into account the value of eq. (Eq14) and thus we find that the late-time growth of the field of xmath59 is to xmath70, and - ,  = xmath70  and  Ends,  and , aligned . . . > The late-time evolution of the scalar field is independent of the form of the first data used. We have, however, used a modified version of the numerical code for the determination of eq. (eq. 14,) which is essential for the extremely high accuracy required for the computation (see xcite for details), which can be used to develop the late-time evolution of the scalar field. , the numerical result - xmath78 (independent of xmath7) - is in excellent agreement with the 'observational' result - xmath79 - see eq. eq. - eq16 - - the most accurate experimental method for determining the power index applies to the concept of the local power index - - eq. - eq. - (Eq. - 16) . it must be noted that the value - xmath81 used in this figure is - -81 rather than the theoretical value - -82 . - the slight deviation from the theoretical value is expected, by the corrections of order - -83 in the expression for - xmath81 eq. - (Eq. - 16) . Besides being - theoretically important - the result - eq. (Eq16) is also of - practical importance. - the dominating power law tail is a leading force - - and it is a consequence of the relatively large contamination that occurs at the beginning of the evolution . "Pray be your book. "(46) We take Xmath93 as Xmath95, and for Xmath96 we take Xmath94. * This gives us the equation Xmath101, which is @xmath103. * In a word, we assume that the solution in the Xmath98 region has the same late time Xmath75 dependence as the Xmath14 solution. We will, therefore, discuss the field at the edge of the black hole. For Xmath87 we shall assume Xmath94 to be a constant, and with no loss of generality, we may choose a zero . . . the first attempt to calculate the higher order corrections to the dominant law of the tail has been made by andersson. The asymptotic power law is apparent at late times (top panel) . . . the asymptotic value @ xmath113 is in excellent agreement with the analytically predicted behavior of xmath79 at late times. This (prevention) result is caused by the fact that the terms of order @ xmath105 (and smaller) were completely ignored by the inverse curvature potential in xcite. the asymptotic value @ xmath107 is inexorably in line with the boundary of xmath108, as a consequence of the fact that the inverse curvature potential in xcite does not take into account the exaggerated term of order @ xmath105 (and smaller) that appear in the exact curvature potential. The temporal evolution of the scalar field, estimated at xmath67 in a schwarzschild spacetime with xmath66 . the power index is a close relative of the well-known asymptotic value at xmath111. The asymptotic value @ xmath78 is in excellent agreement with the analytically predicted behaviour @ xmath79 in the late hours.
