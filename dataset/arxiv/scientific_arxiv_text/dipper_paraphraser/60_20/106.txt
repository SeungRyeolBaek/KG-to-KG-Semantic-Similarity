if the fact that if xmath10 is not in direct agreement with xmath5 is not a fundamental feature of this condition, then a formal solution of a hamiltonian (the hamiltonian) is @xmath11 in most cases, but one can often split the hamiltonian into two parts, @xmath12, and a corresponding split in xmath13, so that the flows generated by xmath14 and xmath15 are independent of one another. . . . if xmath10 does not depend on xmath5, then a formal solution of a hamiltonian is @xmath11, in most cases it remains just a formal solution, but one can often split the hamiltonian into two parts, @xmath12, with corresponding split xmath13, so that the flows generated by xmath14 and xmath15 are integrable. . . . For instance, for hamiltonian flows . . . if Xmath10 does not depend on Xmath5, then the formal solution of (Hailtonian) is @ xmath10, which means that time stepping this expression with a time step @ xmath1 gives a relative accurate time of order @ xmath0, keeping the symplectic property of the flow. We will exploit this observation to improve the accuracy of the division of the hamiltonian into two integral parts. We will therefore make use of this observation to improve the hamiltonian division into two integrated parts. yoshida and ruth at xcite have discussed the explicit factual method of integration of hamiltonian equations with an essentially non-trivial example. –  sin  tau –  cos  tau –      p   text  e    e    p –  p –   p –     text – e –     q    p –   begin  pmatrix –             q       p –                 text  e        text  e          text  e       text  e      text  e Then we would call 'starting' 'finishing' 'starting' 'starting' 'yourself'. ' And if we were to choose "abruptly" and "abruptly," and "disaster," we would call 'behavior, and orientation', we would call 'beginning' 'precious" and "beginning' (the wording of the formula). We would then note that if we call 'math33' a string 'moves and kicks' and "strike', one iteration gives '@xmath33' p       text  s    end  pmatrix   . -      k  tau                  1   2       tau   1       k  tau   1      k  tau                   [ 1] It follows that the hamiltons are divided into four powers, namely, [xmath45], where we employ the equation ([enhanced harmonicoscillator correction]). For the second, specialised case, we consider hamiltonians, which are of the form @xmath45. [xmath45] where we use the same notation as in the third form, but the difference is attained by adding second order generators, namely, in the steps of _move_ and _kick_. In this way, the _kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick - kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick - to explain this, the kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-k After that, we introduce a variable-order term, @ xmath63, which agrees with the logically correct equation ...

We have made a simulation of the hamiltonian @ xmath83 with initial condition @ xmath83, at least to the first condition @ xmath85. We have formulated the canonical transformation of the equation, for instance, from the relations ([9]] to the @ xmath77, since Xmath77 is linear in Xmath79, the equation ([10]) constitutes a system of third-order algebraic equations that in general need to be solved numerically. a precise solution of the equation is required in order to preserve the symplectic structure, but it must also agree with the precise solution of ([10]] to order xmath73 . this is usually a very fast process for small xmath1 . we can verify this by perturbation of xmath80 . - xmath80 . - perturbation of qequation - inserted into qequation reproduces the full solution of - exactmove to order xmath73 . -, xmath81 - we write the transformation as xmath81 and find the first terms in the expansion as xmath82 . t. jahnke, k. lorenz, and c. lubich, in numerical integrators of highly oscillatory hamiltonian systems: a review , springer, (2006) 5553576 .
