I consider that, the main reason why the jet-conveying effect, observed in colliding nucleus nucleus with rhic energy, abutments of the nucleus nucleus, has been found to be the originating mechanism of the jet-conveying phenomena. Thus, we consider the parton energy loss from the gluon-radiated radiation, which is predicted to depend on the properties (gluon density and volume) of the “medium” formed in the collision and on the characteristics (color and charge) of the “parton” parton. [c] . [x] . [l]) . . [c]—*6 . * a) In this process, the parton energy loss from the gluon-radiated radiation depends on the properties (gluon density and volume) of the “medium” formed in the collision, and on the properties (color and mass) of the “parton” parton parton. “We find here the weights of light and gluons in @xcite and for heavy quarks in @xcite. Then we derive from the records the attributable parton-averaged energy loss. Then, for the two lines of electrons, the nuclear modification factor of single electrons is about 0.5 and a half times greater than that of light-color hadrons. In this case, the power of the calculations is not inconsistency between theory and experiment, nor does it represent a mass hierarchy. Therefore, electrons are subject to the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss. This, however, is not at all a reliable, solid and data-validated baseline for the parton energy loss. The state-of-the-art perturbative predictions (fonll) we use as our baseline, show that in pp collisions, charms dominate the electrons xmath4 spectrum to about 5 Gev Xcite . However, there is a great uncertainty on the positions in xmath4 of the xmath13-discharge / xmath14-discharge intersection; according to the choices of factorization and renormalization, this position can be anywhere between 3 and 9 Gev Xcite . Moreover, the calculation tends to underpredict the non-photonic electrons measured in pp collisions xcite . We must note that the disturbance in calculating the xmath13-discharge horizon is equal to the intrinsic uncertainty of the determining @ xmath13 and _______ quark masses (a band associated with the @ ____ curve) @ xcite . We have the results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of our results for the heavy-to-light ratios of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons. This is a ratio of the nuclear modification factors of @xmath18 mesons to that of @xmath19 mesons. . . . . @xmath19 . . . v. [Fig. 2] [xmath] (lines) show the calculation of the symbols of @xmath18 and @xmath1 mesons. We present the results for @xmath11 and @xmath13 for the dead’s separation of charm and beauty. [v.] that is, the direct comparison of the attenuation of light-savoury jars, @xmath0 and @xmath1 by calculating the nuclear modification factors of @xmath18 and @xmath1 of the light-savoury jars (@xmath19) . In our test we find that the mass effect is small and limited to z>22, whereas for @xmath1 jars a large augmentation can be expected. As a result, it may be possible to compare the z1 attenuation with the colour-charge dependence of parton energy loss (thin curves) . Our experiments in this respect are equipped with instruments that are designed to separate the charm and beauty decay vertices.
