Once upon a time, one of the oldest problems in algebra was the solvability of an equation over a given algebraic structure. Today, many such classical problems are taken up in a new way, that is, by examining their complexity. the equivalence problem – a finite group – a question of whether or not two group expressions – i.e. products of variables and elements of – a certain amount of substitution – can be reconstructed by a substitution of a group expression over a group – a problem of whether there is a sufficient substitution of a group expression. the equivalence problem – over a finite group – asks whether or not two group expressions (i.e. products of variables and elements of – a certain amount of substitution – are equal over – a group – – that is, whether or not – the same function is determined over – – One horvth, lawrence, mrai and szab @ xcite confirmed the conjecture that if a group Xmath0 is nilpotent or Xmath4 is the dihedral group for odd Xmath5 , then the equivalence problem for Xmath0 is polynomial. However, the complexity of the equivalence problem for Xmath0 is still not determined. They conjectured that the equivalence problem for Xmath0 is in polynomial time if Xmath0 is solvable, and c-complete otherwise. horvth, lawrence, mrai and szab @ xcite confirmed the conjecture for Xmath6; where Xmath7 and Xmath8 are abelian groups such that the exponent of xmath7 is square, and c-complete . . . This still seems less known about the equation-solvability problem. Of the smallest groups, for which this complexity is not known, the smallest is xmath14, xmath14 and a non-commutative group of order xmath16. Goldmann and russel have proved that if xmath0 is nilpotent, then the equation-solvability problem over xmath0 is solvable in polynomial time for certain groups, Xmath17, where Xmath19 or Xmath20 or Xmath21 and Xmath13 is commutative. note that all the results for both the equivalence and the equation-solvability problem for solvable, not nilpotent groups are for groups @ xmath22, where xmath23 one of the groups of small order, for which the equation solvability problem is unknown, is the group of @xmath24 . [pp. 238] The main result of the paper is the following. We cite a definition of pattern groups from @xcite , we call a group @xmath22 a semipattern group, if @xmath23 is a subgroup of the group of upper triangular matrices, and @xmath13 is a subgroup of the diagonal matrices. the group @xmath24 is isomorphic to a special subgroup of the upper triangular matrices over @xmath27. We give the precise definition of semipattern groups in section [SPCS]. The equivalence and the equation solvability problem for this group are solved in polynomial time. The main result of this paper is the following. I'll be discussing this more below, because the complexity of these questions was completely defined in the proof of the theory. We assume that the equation solvability of the input equation over a matrix group over a finite field is solvable in polynomial time. And so the equation solvability of the system of equations over the same field is solvable in polynomial time too. Then, from theorem [fetetel] the equivalence of semipattern groups is also solvable in polynomial time. The equivalence problem of a finite circle around xmath30 asks whether or not two polynomials are equivalent over xmath30, that is, whether they are similar in their application to xmath30. Then, the results are presented for the finite circle around xmath30. Therefore, we present here the results over ring circles. The proof of Burris and Lawrence reduces the satisfiability (sat) to the equivalence (indeed, the coexistence) by a reduction of the length of the products of sums of variables. In the following two decades, Hunt and Stearnes and Burris investigated the equivalence problem for finite commutative rings. They proved that the coexistence problem for xmath31 is solvable in polynomial time if xmath31 is not nilpotent, and conp- complete otherwise. This inspired Lawrence and Willard to develop the sigma equivalence and sigma equation solvability problems, wherein the input polynomials are given as a sum of monomials. Nevertheless, if we extend this polynomial to a sum of monomials, then the length of the new polynomial becomes exponential in the length of the old polynomial. In the last two decades, hunt and stearns He confirmed the conjecture of the commutative ring. He proved that the conjecture of the commutative ring was a conjecture of a commutative ring. In particular, from the argument of Szab and vrtesi, we have here a proof that if the factor by the jacobson radical is not commutative, then the sigma solvability problem is np-complete. Thus, the sigma solvability problem is completely characterized. Most of the results for the [sigma] equation solvability problem follow from the result for the [sigma] equivalence problem. a particular result is drawn from the arguments of burris and lawrence, who give the effect that if the ring is not nilpotent, then the problem is np-complete. horvth, lawrence and willard in xcite proved that if this factor is commutative, then the sigma equation solvability problem is np-complete. He formulated a number, xmath32, based only on the ring xmath32. He proves that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting xmath33 into all but xmath32 – many variables . . . however, this number xmath32 is tremendously large in the size of the ring. – p> we . . . that is, xmath32 is bigger than xmath37, where the height of the tower in the exponent is the nilpotency class of xmath31 . . .

In -80 adequacy is defined by -85 adequacy of semipattern groups in the equation fotetel . In -80 adequacy is outlined in terms of the preliminaries and a few examples.

In particular, in -90 adequacy we show that we can solve the equation solvability problem on special matrix rings as well as on semipattern groups in the equation fotetel. . . . in a totally independent way krolyi and szab have discovered a way to decrease the exponent @xmath32 in -90 . . . . .

It is an objectively feasible condition if there exist for the sake of substitutions @ xmath72, @ xmath72, math75 math79, math79, so that on this substitution both polynomials will be equal: @ xmath81 math81 math54 math81 math81 math54 a pair of convex bases.

WILSON_@ xcite - xcite characterizes finite nilpotent rings with prime power characteristic. - let xmath31 be a finite nilpotent ring with characteristic @ xmath99, and let xmath101 be an independent generating set consisting of xmath100 generators of @ xmath101 . . . , the proportion of the individual matrices is the multiple of xmath - . So @ xmath31 is a homomorphic image of a ring of matrices over @ xmath101, where every entry on the main diagonal is a multiple of @ xmath. . . . But let Xmath106 be a polynomial over Xmath107 and let Xmath95 be any polynomial over Xmath104 whose factor by Xmath108 is Xmath106 . This way, Xmath111 is solved over Xmath107 if and only if Xmath110 is solved over Xmath104 for some xmath111 . . . so that a factor of xmath112 is added to the running time . . . . . . . , and so we can be treated as we are with the semmipattern groups. In this section we consider the semmipattern groups. We first characterize the multiplication of matrices from xmath41, and then we have in our algorithm, for every xmath117, let xmath118, let xmath118, let xmath119, and for every xmath120, we have, and in particular, a polynomial in xmath125. Here we apply the idea of the proof that we have already presented in section [3]. We also take advantage of the principle of the algebra of the semmipattern groups in this section. Let n be a natural number .. But instead of giving a technical proof of the solution, we will explain how to get this formula. The first term is the index @ xmath122, the second term the index @ xmath122. The matrices @ xmath125 are upper triangular, therefore the index of every term of each product is less or equal to the index of the ... xmath127 ... xmath132 ... (in the notation the index @ xmath127 is referred to as the last index ... ) - a word of the form @ xmath132 or xmath133 follows the word of the form @ xmath132 or xmath134 ... I have given the equation, for the given equation, the equation xmath-133, an equation xmath-133, a product which is obtained from the product of the terms in which the index of the first term is xmath-133, a product of the last term, xmath-136, a subtraction of the Index of the next term; a subtraction of the Index of the next term equals the Index of the next. c) Thus the equation xmath-133 in the matrix xmath-133, the subtraction of the Index of the middle term is Xmath-134, the product of the first term is Xmath-134, the index of the last term is Xmath-143; and the Index of each term is the Index of the next term. c) Notice, that each xmath-133-term product is uniquely determined by those terms where the index is different from the index of the column. c) Well, the length of each product is @ xmath125, so we have to calculate the number of products. Thus, we have the length of the formula. It is a sum of products. Now, we will calculate the length of the formula. The length of every product is @ xmath125, so we have to calculate the number of products. So the length of the formula is @ xmath125, so we need to calculate the number of products. Notice, that every product is uniquely determined by the column indices of the terms. So we need only to know the column indices of the first term, namely, of the last term, namely, xmath136. Thus we need to select the elements from the set math148, such that the repetitions are allowed. I give a semipattern group: let xmath60 be a semipattern group , let xmath157 be a polynomial on xmath60 , let xmath160 be a polynomial on xmath60 , so that xmath160 can indicate a constant or a variable on xmath60 , if xmath162 is a variable, then xmath163 is a variable, which we can replace with xmath56, and xmath165 is a variable that we can replace with xmath39 , if xmath162 is a variable, then xmath163 is a variable that we can substitute with xmath56 , and xmath165 is a variable that we can substitute with xmath39 , if xmath160 is a variable, then xmath165 is a variable that we can substitute with xmath39 . The rewriting of xmath171 over xmath60 into xmath180 can be done with a single mathematical procedure as Xmath173 . It is a system of equations over xmath39, where the polynomials are given as the sums of monomials. This is a system of equations over xmath39 in which the polynomials are given as sums of monomials . . . so , over xmath46, the polynomial xmath174 can be rewritten to the trigram ‘xmath173’, in which xmath174 can be substituted for a substitution if and only if xmath176 attains xmath51 ( xmath176), and xmath177 attains xmath52 for the same substitution (xmath122) . By lemma mxszor, we can decide whether this system has a solution in xmath184 time. Let xmath124 be a ring of xmath184 matrices over xmath87, where every entry below the main diagonal of each matrix in xmath104 is a multiple of xmath103 . let xmath185 denote a monomial in xmath104 . . . if xmath187 is a variable, then xmath188 are variables, which we can substitute from xmath87 . . . . furthermore . . . if xmath187 is a variable, then xmath188 are variables that we can substitute from xmath87 . It is the first form of a polynomial, and is a sum of monomials over xmath101. There are at least @ xmath197 monomials in every polynomial over xmath195 according to the usual multiplication of the matrix. Thus, every non-zero monomial is of the form @ xmath199, where @ xmath200 and @ xmath201 have the same properties. Note that @ xmath202 is also present. ... There are at most @ xmath199 terms in every non-zero monomial, that is, @ xmath199, where @ xmath200 and @ xmath201 ... this makes the length of each monomial about xmath125. I will consider xmath207 as the measure of the length of a nonzero monomial. Therefore the multiplicity of any nonzero monomial is, in general, approximately xmath205. And so xmath207 . . . if xmath214 is the sum of xmath213; many polynomials xmath213 are needed for xmath216 . . . So xmath217, as xmath110 and xmath100 depend on the ring xmath31 . . . the polynomial xmath171 is a sum of at most xmath212 monomials xmath213; thus xmath220 is solved over xmath220 . "The numbers of equations are @ xmath226, which do not depend on @ xmath212, but only on the ring @ xmath104. The rewriting of @ xmath171 into the ring @ xmath223 is possible in @ xmath224 time, and @ xmath225 time . This is a system of equations over @ xmath222, where the polynomials are given as the sums of monomials. By the ergodic principle, we can decide whether this system has a solution in @ xmath227 time. Finally, we explain how this result can be used to determine whether an equation @ xmath34 is solvable over an arbitrary, nilpotent ring @ xmath31 of characteristic @ xmath228 . Let xmath104 be the matrix ring as in the ergodic principle , and let xmath22 be the matrix ring , as in the ergodic principle , and let xmath22 be the matrix ring , See, that the characteristic of xmath31 in the equation [will] is @ xmath230. Thus, if xmath95 is given as a monomial, then xmath240, and one can decide xmath241 over an arbitrary nilpotent ring @ xmath31 in xmath242 time . . . so, if xmath95 is an arbitrary polynomial over xmath31, then after rewriting, - As a sum of monomials we have a sum of xmath243, and this gives an extra xmath244 factor in the exponent . . . mikael goldmann and alexander russell . . . the complexity of solving equations over finite groups . . .
