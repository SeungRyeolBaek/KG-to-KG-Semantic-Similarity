This team of petty blunderers (as the name suggests) is a sociable compact group, whose equilibrium is complicated and disturbed by a series of interactions and couplings. The fundamental element of the group is the primary shock, as remarked by the 20 cm radio continuum. The high velocity (>345 ms @ xmath510000 kms @ xmath13) collision of the intruder galaxy, ngc 7318b, with the medium of the group, xcite, is believed to be the cause of the heating of the gas. The main elements of stephan's quintet are shown in Figure 1. The main element of the system is the primary shock, as indicated by the 20 cm radio continuum. The main element is the primary shock, defined by the 20 cm radio continuum. This interaction has created a large-scale intergalactic shock wave, first seen as a narrow filament in the radio continuum, and later found in the x-ray . The peculiar extranuclear star formation region, known as the "sq a - a - a - a - a - xcite", lies to the south at the farthest edge of the main shock wave. The nc7318a (east of nc7318b) is also a strong interacting member of the group, and nc7317 is located further away from the core. The new modeling of the sq a - a - a - a, - has been proposed, and which was based on collisions between two inhomogeneous gases, which creates spherical h - xmath9 from spherical gas and an efficient cooling channel for /sent>. warm, hydrogen-rich hydrogen was detected with a line luminosity exceeding the x-ray luminosity of the shock . . . . . Compared with x-ray fusion, several other systems exhibiting the same strong x-ray fusion were discovered. in a large scale (about 30 kpc) of the supersonic shock have been found.

This last work, from the research team, will be presented in detail. We will describe our measurements and the data reductions that we used. In addition, several other papers will be prepared by our team on the relationship between the ultraviolet and the uv. , we will examine the relationship between the ultraviolet and the uv. in this work, we will present our observations and models, and in the following sections we will show the significance of our results. We shall also talk about the structure of the group. In fact, we shall consider a flux of h @ xmath17 for the whole group, which means a distance of 94 km with h@ xmath17 . . . In addition, several other papers are being prepared by our team which will discuss the relationship between the ultraviolet and the uv and the dust. Observations were carried out in low resolution, using the short-high (@ xmath19 ; @ xmath20) and the long-high (@ xmath21 ; @ xmath22) modules, and taken on january 11, 2008 and december 10, 2007 , respectively. figure 1 displays the outlines of the areas observed superimposed on a composite image of the group. the primary reductions were carried out by the ssc-pvd pipeline, version s17.1 . 4 . and s. on board _spitzer_. The sl mapping consisted of two separate, partially overlapped maps, centered north and south, on the x-rays of the shock . . . the map was constructed with 23 steps of 2 . . 8 (0 . . 75 @ xmath2 ) perpendicular to the slit, and one parallel step of 7 . 2 . the analysis consisted of 60 integrations with 5 cycles per step. The results of the examinations showed that the observed stray light corrected images (that is, the probable increase in radiance from the peak arrays to the sl spectral apertures) contained certain wavelength-dependent opacity corrections, which, interpreted as being a result of the high background of cosmic rays during the sl portion of the mapping, were due to a high background of cosmic rays, but which, in the context of the sl portion, could be removed by the use of the field , which were not corrected for stray light removal. Therefore, the alternative flat fielded images, which are available from the scientific pipeline, which are not corrected for crosstalk and stray light removal, were used. . . . but because the background subtraction was done with a dedicated off-source data, which was taken by the same observer, soon after the mapping. , in the case of sl, where, for scheduling reasons, the off off' observations were too far away to be optimal, backgrounds were generated from observations on the periphery of the map that contain no spectral line signatures. , the spectra were assembled into spectral cubes for each module using the software cubism. , one dimensional spectra were further extracted from the spectral cubes with matched apertures. For all the modules individual frames of each pointer were median - merged and plain - bad pixels were replaced with customised software that allows for manual average pixel removal . . . - . further pixel removal . . .

If you could only enter the exact number of characters in the fourth column, I would have to enter the first, then add a straight line of metric measurements.

The ratios of the rotational h-i-i-i-i-r-pa-yl-xm-r2 are not a particularly useful diagnostic tool for recognizing the various mechanisms, because all three mechanisms can lead to very thermally limited distributions of lower-level rotational states. although these equations cannot be used as direct shock diagnostics, in stephan s quintet the distribution of large-scale x-ray and radio emission, together with optical detection, provides strong evidence that the large-scale filament observed in figure 1 is the result of a strong shock. In the above two tests, the upper transitions 0 to 0 and 3 to 5 tend to trace warmer gas, while the lower transitions 0 to 0 and 1 to p to p are sensitive to the “coolest” warm h-i-i-f. In Appleton et al. (2006) this fact was used to show the surprising relationship of the observed h-i-fe-eq with the shock. However, in this study, we can more precisely establish the relationship between the h-i-fe-eq and the shock by means of spectral maps. The contours showed a strong and widespread emission, running north-south along the shock ridge. As shown in figure 1, the sl observations were concentrated on the main shock to provide high signal to noise (s/n) measurements. As we have seen, these contours do not cover all the rows in sq-a or ngc 7319 . as a result, these contours do not fully cover sq-a or ngc 7319 . . . the s (0) and s (1 ) lines were mapped by the ll modules, while the s (2 ) and s (5) transitions were mapped by the sl modules of the irs. as a result, these contours do not cover all of sq-a and n-n . . . We will talk about the agn-like mir emission line from ngc 7319 in the appendix a. figure 2b-d shows a new structure, from the main 'shock ridge', as follows: ' bridge.' (fig. 2a-d) This structure is faintly observed in the chandra xcite and xmm xcite x-ray images and in the x-ray images by xcite, but is not strong in the radio continuum. In the above figure, a new h @ xmath5 structure has been obliquely observed in the 'chandra' xcite and xmm xcite x-ray images and is detected faintly in xcite, but weakly in the radial continuum. Observed in figure 2a and d, there is a new h @ xmath5 structure east of the main  mi,' vna. Figure 2a, d, show a large clump of h@ xmath5 a few arcsecs from the nucleus of ngc 7319, ngc 7319 et> et> net>. In a little detour towards the north (especially in the s.1 map, which has the highest s/n) . . . the s (two) and s (five) lines clearly show that the warm h @ xmath5 is clumpy in the shock. In section [spec] we will present the spectra of selected regions of the emitted particles and discuss a global emblaze diagram of h@ xmath5 (appleton et al., the work is in progress) . . . . a full coverage of the sl2 module (as a result of its irregular   off-observation ), so the s (5) line shows that the h@ xmath5 emission is also clumpy. Despite the limited coverage compared to the ll map, the base of the   bridge is visible, and the square a is partially covered. . . . as the warm mnemonic hydrogen is distributed along the length of the main north-south (ns) x-ray shock ridge and along the bridge '* () , which is evidenced by the extraordinary coexistence of the hot x-ray plasma (10 @ xmath28 @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 t @ xmath32 k) , although the h @ xmath5 looks to follow the xray, there are some subtle differences in the h _ xmath5 . But the area of most recent shock heat, as reflected by the stronger x-rays, seems to correspond to the higher j-j transitions, possibly suggesting a causal relationship. In the radio continuum, Fig. [Fig. 1] a and b we have a similar picture; the s (0) line has the strongest correspondence with the main shock, but the strongest trace of radio emission is in the north, where we find more weakly-reddened signal. The s (3 ) line has a more close relation to the x-rays, particularly at the centre of the shock, where the peaks are very sharp at both wavelengths. the radio emission is quite sensitive to the most compressed regions of the shock, where cosmic ray particles are accelerated more strongly, whereas the brightest x-ray patches are probably due to the most energetic regions ... . . . The two pulses were not pronounced distinctly in the x-ray, but only weakly or absent at radio continuum wavelengths. This evident difference was likely due to the fact that the conditions that gave rise to the strong synchrotron emission in the main shock did not exist in the bridge.

((162]) a pair of contours, which exhibit ionization potentials of 41 ev, are shown in Figure [242]b, and correspond to the shock ridge, and which corresponds closely to peaks seen for the h – xm5 – s (3) line . “Recent observations and spectra of q @ xcite have confirmed that there are certain regions of star formation associated with the spiral arms of the intruder galaxy ngc 7318b . in the present section we will consider how these regions, which have a different spatial distribution from the gas which has been blown, are correlated with the distribution of pah that we detect in the spectra of q. in this section. In figure [Fig. 9] we show the distribution of pah on a near-uv image from q. galex-xcite, which maps the uv emission from hot stars that are associated with the weak star formation of the system. In fact, this correlation suggests that the atoms of the q. are excited by the formation of stars. The q. [11] represents a similar pattern of 9 and 11, which is submerged in a layer of X. in a layer of hot dust, (i.e. the 8.7 ] ” Again, it is clear that there is a good correlation between the temperature of the dust and the thermal dust, most of which seems only incompletely correlated with the ridge. Again, we note that there is a good correlation between the radiance of the pah and the thermal dust, most of which seems to be only not properly correlated with the ridge. in the figure (fig) , the hot dust is not sufficiently bound up with the ridge . . . In the figure (fig) , a scanty dust is not seen from the ridge of the shock. [3] This is important because it suggests that the gas which was injected by the shock was not sufficiently strong enough to stimulate star formation. . . . the presence of dust is required for the model of Guillard [4] . this is important because it is possible that the gas which was injected by the shock was unwarranted and energized. "Recently guillard et al. (2010) showed that the ir emission was very faint, because dust being heated by a low-energy uv radiation field, and calculated the density of the swarms of pah and vsg in this region. Despite the briefness of the main shock, the m map of 24@xmath25 provides a new result that is not yet obvious from previous studies. So the faintness of the swarm could have been caused by destruction of very small grains (vsgs) or by the decomposition of larger ones (see section 6, section 7). guillard et al. (2010) explain that the ir of the swarm is faint from the heat of a low-radical uv ray field, and to investigate the pah / vsg perception of the region. The north region is the well studied W— a, but the south (we call it W— a) is also very strong, and both are located at the ends of the shock, as defined by the h—xmath5 distribution. In a word, the dominant regions of the formation of stars in W— lie not in galaxies themselves, but in two strikingly powerful and almost symmetrical regions on both sides of the shock. . . . swarming of warm molecular hydrogen in stephan s quintet follows the x-ray distribution in the main shock and in the -bridge. (see fig., dust) , it can be assumed that the warmth is in the x-ray direction, and that the light from the various shook filaments is at least three times greater than the x-ray luminosity of the shook filaments, so that we cannot conceive direct x-ray excitation from the shock. The spectra of this spectra were taken from the cubisms which were constructed from each irs module and joined together to form a continous spectrum. Figures a, b and c signify the various spectral peaks of the main shock, a sub-region of the shock and the characteristic part of the bridge . . . and the sub-region consists of the inversions of xmath5 and of the flares of 718b and 193b . What’s more, the mirror, like the main, is slightly more teeming than the sub-region, which contains the faint spectrum of the cool dust, and as a result the more powerful emissions of a hot dust, probably the result of contamination from star formation in the incoming shock. The spectra for these extractions are shown in Fig. [Fig. 9] a, b, and c. each of these spectra, being dominated by a mass of molecular hydrogen. For example, if the bright star, by an extended spiral arm of the ngc 7318b, has contaminated the spectrum of the shock, as shown in figure 8a and /sent> /sent> . . . in the north-central part of the shock, it is in the interest of regions contaminated by the star formation in the emitting part. The bridge exhibits a similar limited radiating range compared to the shock sub-region. These are useful for the study of the conditions of the shock, especially star formation (see Section 6 As a result of the previous interactions with the tidal energy, multiple shock-thru-actions might have been involved, i.e., we shall discuss this later. It is striking to see the spectrum of the Mid-IR spectrum, and in the region of the ‘Darkness’ region in the image of the Interstices (fig. : “dust”) of the irac image (fig. ) (fig. : “Darkness”), the aurora of this area is significant. It can also be argued that the observations made in the Mid-IR spectrum extend to the entire range of the main-ir field and to the “Darkness” region. In other words, it appears that this “Darkness”-subject of the light is a small group and that several small shocks have taken place in the space of the ir field. This may be the result of previous tidal interactions and could be a multiplexing of the main-ir field. The weaker radio spectrum is noticeable at this location. “Fluxes for all the h  xmath5 and metal lines in the spectra discussed above are presented in table [Tableh     ], and in table [Tablemetal  ] . . . this represents the x-ray, which is visible in the X-ray, and in the line 10_ and [2] .

As a matter of fact, it is possible that in reality many different temperatures are present in the shock, and the three-temperature calculation is only an approximation. In other words, we can make an estimate of the total mass of warm h  5 of 5 . 0 @ xmath4210 @ xmath43m @ xmath44 . however, it is possible that, in reality, many different temperature components are present in the shock, and the three-temperature calculation is only an approximation. In the following, we will describe a two-dimensional map of the h  25 sphere in four dimensions, and will consider the different shapes of the entrainment along and around the shock. Fig. e21 and e25 show that the h  255555555 and p4  955210510101010164512,  710(p2 551/e5r> [P25h4 ] The results show the remarkable dominance of the h @ xmath5 line luminosity over the main shock x-ray gas . . . [21] For the main shock, the flux of bolometric x-ray bolometric 'bolometric ' xmath5 corresponds to 2 . . . [23] The first redet, he who introduced a second redet, is the 'extension', a measure of the x-ray flux. " . . . that is, if we did not, omitting the contribution of the wider x-ray component to the main shock, the coefficient of h (h @ xmath5) is the lower limit. We did not attempt to take away the contribution of an extended x-ray component on the source of the shock. That is to say, we can draw the value of l (h @ xmath5) / l @ xmath45 = 2 . 5 . This is an extremely significant result, reversing the traditional view that x rays always dominate the cooling in the later stages of evolution in compact groups of galaxies. This ratio can be calculated for other regions for which h @ xmath5 spectra have been extracted. For instance, in the "bridge region" (which has many of the same characteristics as the main shock) l (h @ xmath5) / l @ xmath45 = 2 . 5 . The fine structure fluxes (see table [Table of metal oxides]) can be used to examine the conditions in the extracted regions of h . . . I will explain this in the following way: a larger range of emission can be produced, such as thermal excitation by x-rays (xdrs), shocks, etc. . but it is not sufficient to make the ratio of Xmath10siiii@xmath11-33 33 very high compared with, for example, normal galaxies (@xmath6 1... 2) and agn (@xmath6 2... 9) in the pure sky (@xcite) . . . however, this large aperture is contaminated by star formation (@xmath6 4... 9) and the intruder galaxy (@xcite) . - - - - - the xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] - - - - in the bridge's 16 structure we can find a ratio of @ xmath50 which is quite outside the range of normal star-formation. - The ratio of @ xmath51km in the main region and subregion (as @ xmath6 - 0) is in agreement with values of @ xcite for their sample of snr., @ xmath6 - - -. - - - a is @ xmath61 , only slightly higher than the average of @ xmath6 - " Xmath10neii@xmath11, but this ratio is characteristic in the high-reflecting regions of stars in the sings sample. Its result is that the xmath10neii@xmath11 ratio has a low significance in the north-east. In star-forming galaxies the xmath10neii@xmath11 ratio is only xmath55, showing that the North-Central Region is dominated by star-formation. In star-forming galaxies, the xmath10neii@xmath11 ratio is also comparable. In the main calamity of the field, we find a value of xmath52, which would be considered typical in comparison with that of stars, which are from xmath53 @xcite, and in supernovae ranging from xmath54 to xcite . How can this ratio be calculated in the shock of xmath6 4 . . 54 . Nevertheless, in the main shock, the ratio corresponds to a shock of xmath13 of about 100 km/s (using preshock densities of xmath56 and the magnetic parameter xmath58 = 1 and 3 . . . 4 . 54 . So the ratio for the intensity of the shock is given in a ratio of xmath6... [5]... 5 . . . 5... and Xmath10neii... xmath11... ] . . . The average electron density is calculated from the Xmath10siii @ Xmath11 (one line of the same ionization state) ratio .. . In general, i.e., the above-mentioned ratio corresponds to an electron density of Xmath59 . . . , which corresponds to a high-energy density of Xcite for both, i.e., in the low-energy limit for this diagnostic xcite . . . our observations have shown that the electrolysis and the xray rays seem to follow a similar distribution, and we have concluded that this is a consequence of xrays heating h . . . because the h . . . is the main luminosity. ; therefore, the hot x-ray and the cool x-ray gases are mixed in a dense cloud, the cooling x-ray gas forms at a slower temperature. This solution of the puzzle of how this high-speed (up to xmath60 @ xmath61 kms @ xmath13) shock can lead to both x-ray and very strong molecular line emission is shown in a model by xcite.  the high-speed collision of the ngc 7318b with the filament (embedded in a multiphase medium) leads to multiple shocks passing through and compressing the denser layers (which are dusty nucleation sites for h    ) which are reduced to low temperatures. Thus, the h  math5 form in denser layers which experience slow shocks. Therefore, the h math5 forms in denser clouds, which are subjected to slower shocks. xcite is an ideal example of the accelerated h @ xmath5 excitation which is a natural consequence of the multiphase medium of the fanned material. . . . . Precipices of the intermediate precipices and the high temperature of the fanned h @ xmath5 induced by the earthquake, whose density was eight hundred kilometers at xmath13. Both these measurements confirm the results of the high-resolution spectrometer measurement of @ xcite, and the velocity center of the warm fanned fanned fanned fanned fanned fanned fanned gas (by using new spectral calibrations, see Appendix B), where the gas is at the intermediate velocity between the intruder and the group igm. Evaporation was attained by the higher density of the clouds, and the hot gas obtained by the swelling of the hot gases, the resonance being produced by the large kinetic energy of the shock. As a result of this mechanism, proposed for sq-a by @xcite, this mechanism could also apply to 7318b – south . this mechanism, as outlined above, can be understood in terms of a spectrum of repulsions in the region of the shock, whose repulsions are a spectrum of velocities. The most rapid repulsions (@xmath64 km @xmath0) are associated with the lowest density pre-shock regions and the post-shock x-ray infrared infrared . These are fast repulsions @xmath34, represent a remarkable change of hydrodynamic variables and often dissociative .. . . but, if so, it would have to explain why two such repulsions were at the extreme ends of the current repulsion an unlikely coincidence . . . the largest repulsion ( @xmath64 km @ xmath0) occurs at the lowest density pre-reduction, and the post-reduction x-ray from the x-ray emitting plasma . You can find the equivalent line ratios in the theory of shocks that do not include a radiative precursor. Besides, the xmath10feii @ xmath11 – ev values are the same for silicon and iron, which have very similar first and second ionization potentials. The first and second ionization potentials for fe and si are lower than for hydrogen, while the second ionization potential is higher. [445] Similarly, the Xmath10feii and Xmath10sii – ev ratios are at their highest point. , the neo-ion is not very negligible , it is only ionized ne. At the top, with the level of a @xmath10neii @ xmath11 $] (@xmath66m), the highest ratio of the line is at the mid point of ir. (See section 5). By the way, in the example, the high @xmath10neii @ xmath11 $] (@xmath66m) and the low @xmath10neii @ xmath11 $] (@xmath66m) line is very high critical density (@xmath69@ ) of the line. Because the high @xmath10nei @ xmath11 $] (@xmath66m) line has a very high critical density (@xmath69 @ ), which indicates that math10nei @ xmath11 $] is the dominant ionization state of ne in the square-shock. At the onset of the shock, in the case of Xmath-80, a shunt line is noted, as is Xmath-80, at Xmath-27 . . . As we have seen, Xmath-80 and Xmath-81 demonstrate that the gas has been ionized. The emission of methylene, as compared with xmath-70 and Xmath-57, is as if the ionized gas was condensed into a haze . . . The ionized gas's height scales with the oxygen content of the ionised gas.

A pool of cold h @ xmath5 associated with the warm gas observed in xcite would be important to understand the conditions in the subgroup medium. . . . In Figure [Fig. 2] co (1 – 0) and the h @ xmath5 line emission will raise the depletion of fe and of si, and thus the depletion ratio of fe and of si, because non-ionizing shocks do not produce the h@ xmath11 line emission and the fe / si depletion ratio, because non-ionizing shocks do not produce the fe / si depletion ratio. . . . . a reservoir of cold h @ xmath5 associated with the warm gas is vital for the study of the intragroup medium. The co curves of the known star formations seen at 24 and in the nuv (see section sf) , particularly 7318b and 7318b, indicate that the population is concentrated in two regions. as observed by xcite, the population of the co around ngc 7319 is concentrated in two regions: the dominant complex lies north of the nucleus, and it is bound to be contained in a dusty tidal feature. In a future paper (guillard et al. 2010), – p. /sent> in a forthcoming paper (guillard et al. 2010) – esent>, the co distribution does not correlate with the location of warm h @ xmath5 emission, especially around ngc 7319 – particularly around ngc 7319 – i.e. the h@ xmath5 complex is clearly offset by the concentration of warm h @ xmath5 – a. esent> even the s (0) emission line (see fig.

This Hüsss Huhuang, we call huang, a long and pervas – in the spectra of the main shock and of the subregion (Fig. 4, spectra) – the bands of hua220p, hua231 and hua231 are far weaker than those of the 11 . 3 bands, which when strong are produced by neutral atoms of hua220p ... - is an analog of hua220p emission. In the subregion, i.e., a subregion, chosen to avoid star formation in the intruder galaxy, but which may be subject to contamination in these regions. section - [f] (Chapter - F) : section - Sf examined the main zone of the main shock, and noted that there was very little evidence for star formation in the zone of warm hua220p emission in the disturbance. The mr:sp emission is a classical tracer of star formation, but the molecules are fragile and easily destroyed in hard radiation. The proportion of mucin (q) - -xmath74 wm-q, and the fraction of -xmath75 wm-q in the seven- or-node bands is approximately 0; the intensity of the dew point in the upper part of the slucin at the low end of the slucin at xcite is very small, compared with the median value of the sang-sys sample of 3 . . . -xcite' (2013) ; the suppression of the 7- or -node-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah ratio has been observed in low-darkness environments (e.g., low-light agn in the singsys sample of ? . . ) and is in general more massive and neutral in the shock, producing greater 11 3-pah emission in comparison with the smaller pah-pah molecules. “Take a look at this graph. It will give you a measure of the amount of star formation, so far as math80 and math82. math81 and math82 are given in the relation of math79, and we will get a sfr of math290. math83. “We calculate a flux of math80 in this region, a low spectral luminosity, and a spectral luminosity of math78, a spectral luminosity ( @ math78), of math79 . math80 can be combined with the measurement of math81, a relation of math82 to math80, and we conclude that math80 is also a result of a shock - excitation, cite and must be considered an upper limit for the measurement of m. “Pah strength. ” Using the relation of @xcite derived from the starburst samples of @xcite, we can make use of the RELIGHT OF STREAK. The corresponding value of RELIGHT OF STREAK is 0.0.73 mjy, which corresponds to a sfr of @xmath84, in agreement with our previous calculation, but also an upper limit, because some puffs of puffery are contaminated by known star formation regions in the group. The low sfr in the slam of the slam is typical of the stars in the sings, and so indicates that both measures of stellation are low, but self-evident. comparing the @xmath85 ratio to the galaxies in sings, we find that the value of @xmath86 is typical of galaxies in stellations, and that this measure of stellation is also low but self-evident. Hence the great supply of cold gas from the mhd shock is for the purpose of dissipating a significant fraction of the energy in high-speed shocks . . . because the jeans mass increases with the gas temperature and turbulence and shearing occurs in the disintegration, the cold gas clouds might be too short or too short, causing a lowering of the cloud and generating a large number of stars. We can observe, for example, the whole group in all ds, that is, the three neighbors of the shock, and the converging shock. As you can see, the temperature of the converging shock is critical for the clearness of the clouds, as discussed in section “co”. . . . to show the scale of the group, and to show you what it might look like when it is crowded in a single beam, we have extracted a spectrum, i.e. from the whole group (that is, the whole group and the shock) from Figure 2 (fig. 7). The luminosity of the rotational h@ xmath5 lines is so high that it is now possible to detect it at high redshift with future far-infrared and sub-mm instruments, like sp When a galaxie is nearing the high redshift, its clumps will be more pliable and more clumpy (e.g. conselice et al. 2005; Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2005) . Indeed, bournaud & Elmegreen (2009) say that the instabilities of massive gas clumps are essential for the formation of disks of xmath, and favor a considerable portion of the clumps to be formed in a smooth influx, such as dekel et al. (2008). See Appleton et al. . . . However, does the formation of galaxies depend on high-speed shocks? There is growing evidence that galaxies at high redshift are largely turbulent and increasingly clumpy (e.g. conselice et al. 2005, elmegreen elmegreen 2005), but it is not yet known whether these disks are really smooth or not (the medium will probably be multiphase). In a more basic picture, gas flowing into the more dark halos is bound to experience high shocks, especially in an inhomogenous medium (e.g. greif et al. 2008), so it is then worth considering how important h at xmath may be in these different cases. It is generally assumed that in gas which forms the first major structures (e.g., bromm et al. 2001; santoro and shull 2006), that molecular hydrogen is, as it were, a minority coolant in the gas that forms the first major structures (e.g., bromm et al. 2001; santoro and shull 2006). However, our observations indicate that even in the highest metallicity conditions, even in the most metallic atmospheres, molecular hydrogen can be extremely powerful, and in this case, by a factor of ten, molecular hydrogen can be dominantly dominantly over the usually strong (at least in the most active) at xmath10siiii@ xmath1134 m line in strong shocks. If there are situations at high redshift when the strongest shocks spread to a clumpy, multiphase medium, our observations suggest that molecular hydrogen cooling cannot be regarded as negligible. A few points are to be drawn from our five main conclusions: the mighty h@xmath5 emission observed by @xcite actually represents only a small fraction of the very wide warm h@xmath5 (a light-body mass of @xmath89 and up to an enthalpy of 290 kpc 285 265 560 kpc 259  289  265 xmath75|11] that dominates the middle infrared radiation of the system. Here we present our five main conclusions: * the strength of the h@xmath5 emission of the system seen by the xcite surprisingly only constitutes a small fraction of the group’s warm h@xmath5 (with a lower limit luminosity of  xmath89 and a layer of 263 kpc  xmath7|111|) that dominates the mid-infrared spectral spectrum of the system. The spatial variation of the h@xmath5 ratio of the 0—0 ratios suggests the difference in temperature and energy between the awed system and the agn – this will be explored fully in the paper ii. xmath92, xmath62 . . . Observed earlier, from the above table, of the infrared line ratios in the optical physics, the experiments confirm that the h @ xmath9 lines are a stronger coolant than x-rays over the structures, and suggest a new cooling path, on a large scale, in the new Immanuel – Stream. /sent> the results imply that the h @ xmath9 lines are a stronger coolant than the x-ray emission over the shock structures, and suggests a new cooling pathway, on a large scale, of a single sphere . . . that is, that the dust does not destroy the shock. The comparison of the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ”, @ xmath10sii @ xmath11 $ ” and xmath10feii @ xmath11 $” line intensities, indicates that both silicon and iron are deposited on the dust . . . This new feature in the “sea bridge” feature . . . - in sp, we see the projected coexistence of - xmath10siii@ xmath11, - in sp we see /sp_2 and _xmath5 emission by - xmath6200 km - xmath0 and - xmath620 km - xmath0 velocity shocks, respectively. To find the central cooling mechanism in sp, one must have a characterization of lines and spherical processes at all wavelengths. Our study is in agreement with the model of a multiphase postshock medium produced by a wide collision in a galaxy - wide collision . We hope to understand more fully this chemistry, and to study the distribution of cool dust, by means of the facilities of the space telescope of herschel.2 Moreover, we cannot rule out a strong uv line-cooling. The interaction of h with xmath5 and the contributions of a line such as xmath10oi@xmath11 can be significant . . . aaaa allen, m. g., groves, b. a., dopita, m. a., sutherland, r. s., kewley, l. . . “Astro2010 – astronomy and astrophysics of the Year 2010,” science white papers, 2010; 2 appleton, p. n., charmandaris, v., horrelou, c., mirabel, i . f ., higdon, j . l . , lord, s . , 1999, 527, 143 bournaud, f., elmegreen, b . . 2009, 610, 610, 610 brandl, b . . . . , tbp., bb. ; lb. , m., b. , b. , b. , b. g., b. , b. , c., b. ; b. et al., in press (short letter: Astro - P. . . 2821) black, j. h., elmegreen, b. g., b. g., 1990, 322, 412 bournaud, f., elmegreen, b. g., 1993, 699, l689 brandl, b. g., 2000, 319, 969 brandl, b. g., 2001, 328, 969 buchananan, c. , gallimore, j. f., odea, c.p., baum, s. a., elitzur, m. , elvis, m. 2006, 132, 401 calzetti, d., et al. 2007 , , 630, 122 dekel, a., sari, r., elvis, m. 2006, , 663, 143 dale, d. a., elvis, m. 2006, , 633, 29 dale, d. a., elvis, m. 2006, , , 666, 471 draine, b.t., roberge, w. g., dalgarno, a. 1983, , 264, 485 draine, b.t., roberge, w. g., dalgarno, a. 1983, 264, 485 draine, b.t., roberge, w. g., dalgarno, a. egami, e . . rieke, g . h . fadda, d . , hines, d . a. 2006, 682, 76 genzel, r . , et al. 2006, 682, 77 fredet, 79 groo, y . , xu , c . elmegreen, b . g . elmegreen, d . m . 2008, 688, 59 guillard, p . . . boulanger, f . . cluver, m . , appleton, p . n. . 1993, 415, 93 hewitt, j. w., rho, j. , andersen, m., & reach, w. t. 2009, 671, 323 ho , j . . , luynbach, d . . , bb, e . -2006, 696, 666 ho , l . c . , bicay, e . - 2004 , 694, 1266 ho , d . , mckee, c . f . , fabian, a . . . , bb, bb, bb . . . . , bb, c. . . , c. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2010 , , 466 , 561 martn-hernndez, n . l., vermeij, r., tielens, a . g . g . g . g . g . g . , van der hulst, j . m . , peeters, e . . 1998 , 410 , 275 pietsch w . . trinchieri, g . . arp , h . , sulentic, j . w . 1997, 466 , 563 neufeld, d. . . , hollenbach, d. . . , kaufman, m . . , snell, r . l . , melnick, g . . , bergin, e . a . , sonnentrucker, p . . .

As a result, we see an interference between the peak of the h  55555 in ngc 7319 and the seyfert nucleus, which suggests that the  5555 bridge is not excited by the  555/5 bridge. In figure v - fs - , we have made a graphic representation of the  5555s* of the h  55557255//555n.

That is to say, if there are more than one component, we will aspire to overestimate the temperature of h @ xmath5 by fitting a straight line to the points. We may also add, as a guide, the temperature of h @ xmath5 @ xmath96171 @ xmath97 k, that the gas is in thermal equilibrium, resulting in a ratio of two – four. – Hence, to calculate the temperature of h @ xmath5 @ xmath96171 @ xmath97 k, we may expect to overestimate the temperature of h @ xmath5 by summing it up with a straight line. (It was said that if a warmer component were present, it would decrease the temperature of the 0 – 0 line, and in turn the mass of the cooler component would increase.) However, in order to provide a reasonable guide to this, we calculate the temperature of h @ xmath5 at xmath96171 @ xmath97k (assuming the gas is in thermal equilibrium and thereby having an ortho-para ratio of 2 – 6) and a total h @ xmath5 mass of 3 – 0 @ xmath210 @ xmath99m @ xmath4 – a factor of 1 “The new temperature spectrum from the center of the shock in s is derived from the latest calibration of the instrument of the ssc pipeline version s17.
