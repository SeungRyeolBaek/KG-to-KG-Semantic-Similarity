, the scattering of light on surface waves is a powerful tool to probe the properties of the surfactant film at fluid interfaces, and many systems have recently been investigated with this method (see refs @ xcite, and see also cicuta and hopkinson @ xcite). a solid-state composition of the surfactant film induces preferred emulation of the nematic director. adsorption of chemical or biological molecules in this manner will be preferred emulation, enabling the detection by an imaging system of xcite . a promising new direction for the sensing of chemical and biological molecules has recently arisen, which uses the properties of surfactant films alone on the interface between water and a nematic liquid crystal. This is manifested in the behaviour of the interfacial waves, induced either externally or by thermal fluctuations. The presence of a liquid crystal as one of the fluids complicates the task of probing the interfacial properties by studying the properties of the surface waves, and a variety of systems have recently been studied using this method (e.g. refs @ xcite, see also the review by cicuta and hopkinson@ xcite). The scattering of light on the surface waves is a powerful tool for analyzing the properties of surfactant films at fluid interfaces, and a number of systems have recently been studied using this method (e.g. refs @ xcite, see also the review by cicuta and hopkinson@ xcite) . . . if there is a small amount of analyte in the water, it may be adsorbed at the surface of the gel, provided the gel molecules have the appropriate chemical properties. . . . but a change in the density of the gel will only affect the properties of the elastic and viscous properties. Therefore, sensitive experiments which are able to detect the interfacial properties will give a much more detailed insight into the properties of the interaction between the gel and the analyte, and experimentation on surface waves is a possible technique. After the 1970s, many theoretical and experimental developments have been made, and the systems of which are still under investigation, are still a question. . . . this study is based on the model for the anisotropic curved interfaces by rey. It takes into account the enlarging and bending properties of the gel. . . . , the adsorption of the gel will result in a change of the elastic and viscous properties of the interface. The main features of such interfaces are (i) the adhesion of the gel to the gel, (iii) the curvature of the gel, (iii) the reduction of surface tension due to the gel, and (iv) the anisotropy of the surface viscoelasticity. . . . The results of this study showed that the spectrum of surface waves is more complicated than in the isotropic case, and this allows the experimental investigation of nematic interfaces. The expression ‘Solution’ is expressed in appendix ‘Dispersion’. In this section we enumerate the synthesis of the isotropic and isotropic interfaces of the body of a liquid with a nematic liquid crystal. In this section we use the sloping reibuism model, rey, and the well-known hydrodynamics of isotropic liquids and nematic liquid crystals. We rely on the study of the isotropic and the isotropic interfaces of a fluid with a certain isotropic structure. The symmetry of the film is likely to be broken in the presence of the bulk liquid-crystalline bulk phase, but the film remains isotropic. Hence we avoid the complications associated with the fluctuation of the nematic and the surfactant order parameters and the divergence of viscoelastic parameters near the transition. The present paper assumes that the film of the substance is in the most symmetrical phase (isotropic two-dimensional fluid) , the film of the material can exhibit rich phase behavior, and the form of the stress tensor depends on the symmetry of the underlying crystalline structure. However, this is not very much determinating for the dispersion of the surface modes compared to the isotropic case . . . . in this case the film of the substance gives rise to a homeotropic (normal to the surface) inclination of the nematic director, which is usually true for the nematic director . . . and this is the simplest and most important case, and also the most important for biosensing applications, where the direct change We assume that the surface of the nematic liquid is insoluble and newtonian. we take into account the fact that the barrier of the nematic liquid is an insoluble, newtonian liquid. The central equations of the present paper are the equations that govern the balance between the force and the bulk. The explicit form of these equations depends on the chosen macroscopic model, and the rest of this section is devoted to the formulation of the model presented in the present paper. The system is therefore used in the case when the difference between the amount of the water at the interface and the bulk fluid at the interface is small, and the relaxation of the orientation of the molecules is rapid compared with the relaxation of surface waves. This means that the model is suitable for systems where the exchange of the surfactant molecules between the interface and the bulk fluids is insignificant, and the relaxation of the orientation of the molecules is quick compared with the relaxation of surface waves. we also assume that the fluid has been insoluble and newtonian. Other details of the geometry that are contained in the present paper are summarized in the appendix - geometry -. - - Eq. ([248]). In the following subsections we will present the equations for the surface stress tensor , xmath5, and the surface torque tensor , xmath13. - Rey considered the interface with the helmholtz free energy per unit mass - xmath20, where xmath21 is the surface mass density - xmath22 is the second fundamental tensor of the interface ( see Appendix 3). - in this and the following subsections we summarize the equations for the surface stress tensor, xmath5 and the surface torque tensor - xmath13. the elastic contribution to the surface torque was written as xmath32, where xmath33 is the surface couple stress, xmath32 is the surface gradient operator, xmath32 denotes the variational derivative with respect to xmath11 . - ' The entropy production equation is a hydrodynamic equation higher than linear and, therefore, cannot be ignored in the linear treatment. In general, the presence of the material at the interface complicates the form of the entropy production, since there are more degrees of freedom within the material and anisotropy within the adjacent nematic liquid, while the entropy production of the materials from the interior is not linearized, and therefore cannot be neglected in the linearization of the entropy production. – This is the case we are dealing with, and we will adopt the form of the entropy production ( eq. entropy production) in our model, and take advantage of the viscous contribution to the surface stress tensor derived from rey @xcite, which is given by @xmath55, – @xmath55, @xmath55 are nine independent surface viscosity coefficients corresponding to each other . . . However, if the surfactant film is in its isotropic phase and favors the homeotropic positioning of the nematic liquid, the resulting anisotropic terms in the entropy production introduce corrections to the hydrodynamic equations of higher order than linear, and therefore may be neglected in the linear treatment. We need only the expression for the rotational viscosity: @ xmath66, which consists primarily of the units ft> and the tangential component of the capillary vector ft> (eq. t-xi, t-xi) , the tangential component of the tensor-box vector ft> (eq. t-xi) , the tangential component of the capillary vector ft> (eq. ftxi) , and the bending moment tensor ft-m ) , a non-zero resistance f  xiy  5 xiy (eq.  dxi-  tzovy tjzdvcirlvlvso ascribed to the original rapini-papoular form of the free energy density of the anchor, and - Xcite, - it can be said that the definitions of the strength coefficient are opposite: - - The term math87 guarantees that the curvature energy of a flat surface (at xmath88, at xmath89) is zero. We shall extend the description of the dependence of the interfacial tension on the concentration of surfactant, as provided by buzza sijsijsijsi to other parameters of the interface (surface tension math73, anchoring strength math79, bending math84, bending math84, slack math85, spontaneous math86, surface viscosity math66 math92) to other parameters of the interface (surface tension math73, anchoring strength math79, bending math84, bending math84, slack math85, spontaneous math86, surface viscosities math66 math92) . if we cast the surface velocity math46 as the time derivative of the small surface displacement math96, we get the following equation eq. (Eq. continues): we give the material parameters of the interface as math99, math100, math104, math106, math106, math106. If the magnetic field at xmath110, in the isotropic and nematic regions, satisfies the Maxwell equations, at xmath111, and the incompressible nematic liquid crystal, at xmath115, at xmath119 the magnetization of the isotropic liquid is, at xmath117, where the magnetic permeability of the isotropic liquid is, at xmath119, the magnetization of the uniaxial nematic liquid is, at xmath119, where the difference between the longitudinal and transverse magnetic permeabilities of the nematic liquid: at xmath131 the non-flip boundary condition for the density of the bulk fluids at the interface is, as the gap between the two mass fluids, at xmath130, in which the entanglement of the bulk fluid is not transverse, and at xmath130, is non-disintegrable. we assume, without having magnetic field at the interface, the magnetic field at the interface is satisfied by Maxwell equations at xcite, and in the region of the isotropic and nematic.

With the aim of discussing the effect of the two modes, discussed in Section 3, of the continuum of surface light, that is to say, of the 'in-plane shear' and 'in-plane shear', the dispersion law for the zones of disturbance in the longitudinal direction, caused by the anchoring of the nematic director at the interface, is well represented by the equations ([239] omegan] and (233] omegas] , in that dependence of the real (solid) and imaginary ( dashed) parts of the frequency of the 'in-plane shear' of the 'in-plane shear', normalized by @ xmath304 (see eq. (233] omegan) , in that dependence of the anchoring strength of xmath305, calculated at xmath306 @ xmath265 in the absence of gravity . . . but as the anchoring strength is diminished, other mechanisms emerge, as can be shown in Figures - xanchoring - yanchoring . . . . in this section, we have explained the surface modes, described in Section - s: modes, which were described in Section - s: modes, the corresponding values of eq. . (eq. qkappa) , is related to wavelengths close to atomic scales, and curvature energy is often neglected in typical surface light scattering experiments. The frequencies of the modes 1 and 2 (as defined in Figure (fig.) - a) on the magnetic field, determined at xmath303, at xmath305, at xmath310, and at xmath310 the frequency of the mode is sensitive to the orientation of the surface, since the director tends to be oriented along the field, and not to be advected by the nematic liquid . It was shown that the change due to magnetic field in the mode governed by a 'stem' was negligible. The analysis of the numerical solution of the dispersion equation in the presence of magnetic field, shown in figure (fig.) () () shows that the noticeable change in the mode governed by a 'stem' is determined to be negligible. . . . . The effective effect of magnetic field on surface waves is therefore limited, because, at short wavelengths, extremely large magnetic field is needed, and at long wavelengths gravity dominates (eq. - omegag) , and therefore, a separate study is needed to calculate the magnitude of this effect. and the two frequencies at the same wavelength. The equation of dispersion is very small, and the direction of the external field is very small, and there is little influence of gravity on the transversal mode (eq. qg) at the small wavelength, and at the smaller wavelength, a full dispersion relation must be applied. A dependency of the dispersion wave by the parameters of the interface suggests the scattering of light on a fluid-filled, nematic-isotropic interface as a potential test for determining the properties of fluid-filled, nematic-isotropic interfaces, and as a potential candidate for a chemical or biological sensing method. Other possible developments, which may increase the range of accessible systems and conditions, are the extension of the results to a wider range of states of the fluid-filled, and the study of the effects that may be induced by the phase transitions in the fluid-filled and the bulk liquid crystal. eq . q . qg . . . . and eq . . . ) .
