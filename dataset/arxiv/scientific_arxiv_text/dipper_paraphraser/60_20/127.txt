- where i is the moment of inertia of the neutron star, i is the speed of its rotation, i is the magnetic moment, i is the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment, c is the speed of light. This equality is usually used to calculate the magnetic inductions of pulsars, assuming that i is for all objects . in some of our works (malov & nikitina, 2011a, b, 2013,) some methods for calculating the angle i was derived and applied to some catalogs of pulsars (keith et al., 2005) contained the same angle i as i. Instead of i. , i. , the rotation time i. i. , the angle ii. - the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment, i. c. - the speed of light. For standard parameters of neutron stars ( i.e. mass of the solar mass ( i.e.) and radii of ru of order of i. m. , we can add i. i. - the magnetic moment at the pole, i. xmath9 is the magnetic equator. As we have seen in the article on the basis of the constant polarisation of the same pulses, we can determine the corresponding distance at a fixed point at a fixed point, i.e. @ xmath19. This corresponds to the maximum proportion of the pulse angle . . . Hence, from (9) we have at xmath19y  2 + 2c (d-b-c -2) y  2 d  2 b  2 - b - b - b - b - b - b - b - b - b - b - b - c - c - b - c - a 2 = 0 . From the three equations we obtain 222 by the least squares method 24 426 Then we can calculate 22 by the least squares method 22 from the equation 5, 5, 7 (malov & nikitina, 2011) : 22 - we can get from the dependence of 2 on  p, and determine the lower boundary in the corresponding diagram - 2 2  = 0 . a. If the ratio of the intensity of the pulse in the centre of the pulse to the maximal intensity of the beam is zero, then a. . . for a. . . . for a. . . if the ratio of the intensity of the beam at the center of the pulse to the maximal intensity of the beam is zero, then a. . . if a. . . c  2 ( 1 + d  2),  2 ( 1 + d  2) -  right - c  2 ( 1 + d  2) -  left - c  2 d  2 d  2  right                end            end  array      end  array There is a formula for calculating the angle  = xmath0 of the rotational axes, - since, for example, - in a survey of the pulsars, - the average characteristic age is xmath53 years. The distribution of these values reflects the predominance of the small inclinations of the magnetic axes . . . . (for the pulsar j1410 - 7404  = 880 , width = 453 ) . 2 . The average characteristic age for our sample of pulsars is xmath53 years. However, we must note that the angles calculated by method * (episode 1) are the lower limits of this parameter. Our method, using a modified version of the table, determined the average value of  xmath54 in 376 pulsars . 2 . . the distribution of the calculated magnetic inductions can be described by gaussian with a maximal value of xmath55 and a width in the logarithmic scale almost 1.
