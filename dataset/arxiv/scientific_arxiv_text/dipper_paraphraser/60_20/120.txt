During the last decade, many results have been made in the estimation of a range of neutrino oscillations, and a phenomenological extension of the standard model was proposed, which contained three distinct subatomic mass states, over which the three subatomic species distributed. Despite the successful predictions, this can be taken as an extension of the standard model and does not deal with the fundamental questions, e.g., small masses and large mixing angles compared to the quark sector, and has stirred a large debate about other possible unexpected properties of neutrino nuclei that may contribute to a more complete understanding of neutrino physics. Several recent experimental results on the nature of neutrino-nucleus cross sections have been published in the past decade and are planned for the near future. The argoneut experiment has proved the validity of this experiment and, thankfully, new results will be published in the future. the argoneut experiment has recently reported on the muon neutrino charged current (cc) flux, averaged differential cross section, in an energy of up to 50 gev . Nevertheless, the argoneut measurement has proved the reliability of this experimental method and, hopefully, new data will be available in the future . The analysis of differential cross sections is necessary for the complete kinematical determination of neutrino-nucleus scattering and the elucidation of neutrino-nucleus reactions is necessary for the analysis of experimental measurements . He has presented much information. There are a great many examples of these in the light of various experiments. At the lowest level, though, quasi-elastic (qe) electrostatic calculations @xcite, which have been able to successfully describe a wide number of experimental data, can serve as a useful tool for studying the interactions between the nuclear reactions. , and is able to contribute, if not to a certain extent, to add to the theoretical formulations the number of nuclear interactions and of some non-nucleonic contributions. In general, the experimental cross section is usually underestimated by the relativistic fermi-gas theory, and by the more sophisticated qe-based models based on the impulse approximation, or if the nucleon axial mass of the nanometer has been significantly increased in proportion to the average world value of 1 . 03  / xmath4 . Besides, any model that aims to describe the neutrino-nucleus cross section must first be tested against electron scattering data in the same kinematic region. Moreover, any model designed to study neutrino-nucleus cross sections must first be tested against the electron scattering data of the same kinematic region. However, there are some indications that the reaction may have significant contributions from effects beyond the impulse approximation (ia) in some energy regions where the neutrino flux has still significant strength . In the relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation (rpwia), fsi are neglected; in other approaches fsi are included in the dwia calculations where the final nucleon state is examined with real potentials, either retaining only the real part of the relativistic energy-dependent complex optical potential (Rrop), or using the same field potential which was used in the determination of the initial nucleon state (Rmf). In this different estimation of fsi, different ways of defining fsi have been used. In fsi analysis, the equations of the first and second states are used, the changes of the total flux are retained and the total flux, although redistributed among all possible channels, is preserved. Therefore, a different treatment is needed of fsi, in which all the last states are preserved and the total flux, even though distributed among all possible channels, is preserved. In other ways fsi have been included in dwia analysis, where the final state is assessed with the corresponding physical potentials, either holding only the real part of the relativistic energy dependent complex optical potential (rrop), or by using the same relativistic mean field potential which is used in describing the initial state (rmf) . in the rgf calculation the components of the nuclear response are written in terms of the single particle optical spectral model of green s function; its spectral representation, which is based on a biorthogonal expansion in terms of the non-hermitian optical potential and of its conjugate form , it can be exploited to avoid explicit calculation of the green s function and obtain the components of the hadron ten In addition, because of the analytic property of the optical potential, it fulfils the coulomb equation @ xcite. In this paper, the results of various relativistic descriptions of fsi for cc_str_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ , but in a proportion to which the calculations of the new nuclear laws might contribute to the stronger apprehensions of nanotics involving nuclear reactions, which would not be included in the studies investigated here. The results of these two comparisons, based on relativistic descriptions of fsi for cc - xmath8--Na-cqe-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr--and for a comparison of fsi-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-enstr-in-c- In all the calculations referred to in this book, the bound states are regarded as symbolically consistent dirac- hartree solutions, derived from the lagrangian containing xmath16, xmath17 and xmath18 mesons @ xcite, with low-bound parameterizations of the vertices of the meson - nucleons that are more directly related to the underlying microscopic description of nuclear interactions @ xcite. We note that all these three parameterizations are global ones, for they were obtained by fit to elastic proton-spattering data over a broad range of nuclei, and as a result, they depend on the atomic number @ xcite, and on the more recent democratic (dem) and undemocratic (undem) phenomenological ops of @ xcite. In all the calculations presented in this book, the bound states are taken as self-contained, dirac-faucet solutions, derived from a lagrangian with xmath16, xmath17 and xmath18 mesons @ xcite, with the meson vertices being very close to the underlying microscopic description of the nuclear interaction . . . A comparison of the rgf results with the edad1 and the edad1 potentials may give us a good idea of the degree to which the predictions of the model are subjected to uncertainties in the determination of the phenomenological op. , for instance, the cross-sections of the rgf and the edad1 potential are generally larger than those of the rpwia and the rmf, but they are in general, in general, significantly lower than the data, but for the rgf - dem and edad1 potentials, in general, are slightly lower than the data. In rgf, the imaginary part of the optical potential redistributing the fluxes of all the final-state channels, and, in each channel, the flux lost towards the other channels is compensated by the flux gained by the other channels. Compared with the rgf results obtained with the edad1 and the dem potential, one can visualize how the predictions of the model are affected by uncertainties in the determination of the phenomenological op., and how the rgf cross-sections are calculated, the rgf cross-sections are generally larger than the rpwia and the rmf, but in general they are generally lower than the data, except for the rgf-deg and rgf-deg cross-sections. In contrast, the real term is identical for different parameters and yields the same results. the differences in the rgf lie in the difference between the results of the dem and the undem potentials, and they are related to the same dataset of elastic-strengthening But the rpwia and the rmf result is lower than the experimental data, while the rmf result is larger and better compatible with the data. In general, the estimated cross sections in Figs. CSTETA and CSMU are generally lower than the experimental data. In addition, the rgf can be useful in the estimation of ccqe and ccmins at xcite . . . . But the results in Figs. CSTETA and CSMAU are generally lower than the experimental data. . . . in the ccmins exclusive and inclusive electron scattering of the nucleus, the ia has succeeded in describing ccqe and cmins at xcite . . . . but in figs. . . . . . . the nucleus - scattering, at energies greater than a few gevs, all the models neglect the important contributions of reaction which can be incorporated into the experimental cross sections . . . but in figs . . . . . the calculation of the second term, which is entirely due to the imaginary part of the op, is a hard and time-consuming numerical task, requiring integration of all the eigenfunctions of the continuum spectrum of the optical potential. In this regard, we consider two additional sources of errors: the rgf results presented here contain the contribution of both terms of the hadron tensor in eq. (25) of the op of xcite. in the interval of xmath13 and xmath30 covered by the argoneut kinematics, the two errors are usually small and neither the rpwia nor the rmf cross-sections can reproduce the experimental data within the error bands. Moreover, the calculations of the second term, which is entirely due to the imaginary part of the op, are quite accurate, and, from many calculations in different kinematics, the uncertainties are very low. in the case of the rmf, two additional sources of errors are introduced. The rmf-demotion, which we present here, is derived from the equation of eq. (25) of xcite . . . the band in the figure is these two errors multiplied in quadrature. the fractions of rpwia and rmf cross sections are in the rmf and the fractions of rmf, we have checked that our results do not depend significantly on the multiplied function. In the rpwia, fsi are neglected; in the rmf they are described by the same relativistic mean field potential that is used to describe the initial nucleon state; in the rgf the whole complex op, with real and imaginary parts, is used to account for fsi. In this paper we have compared the predictions of different relativistic descriptions of fsi for cc neutrino-nucleus scattering in the argoneut kinematics. however, the results of this study indicate that the rgf, as well as the other models based on the ia, generally underpredict the argoneut data, but they are able to reproduce the shape and the correct order of magnitude of the experimental cross-section. Moreover, in the rgf the contribution of the reaction channels, which are often neglected in other models, e.g., the depolarization of the nucleon, when it leaves the nucleus, or the excitation of the non-nucleonic excitations that can arise during the nucleon’s dispersion, or also multinucleon processes, is translated, to some extent, into the inclusive rgf. The rgf describes very well the Nm data in the q region, and it can also describe both the cm and the nce miniboone data. oh, our results show clearly that ia-based models reproduce the correct order of magnitude and shape of the argoneut data, but they generally underestimate the experimental cross sections, in particular for the lower value of @ xmath30 and for the value of @ xmath13, which is generally lower than @ xmath39. ... /bs) ...  , (beg) . . . - 011001 - ccl, (b) - cl - ccl - ccl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - cl - ain't,' says 'to find the detachment of all those suckers,' says he, 'to find the detachment of all those who call themselves miners, 't - at x,' but they're 'to find the detachment of all those who call themselves miners,' 'and so on'; 't - miners,' 't - miners,' 't - miners,' ' t - miners,' (135) - miners, 'noop-miner,' 't - miners',' 't - miners', 't - miners', 'j' - ', 't - miners - miners', ' et - miners' - avga - 1002/ epjc - s10052 - 1826 - y [* *, - () - s10052 - y [* *, - () - avga - w [* *, - () - vga - vol .
