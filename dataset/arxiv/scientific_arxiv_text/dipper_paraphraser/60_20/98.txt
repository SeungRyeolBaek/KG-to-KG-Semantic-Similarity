These polymer brushes are found in many important uses, e.g., as lubricants, colloid stabilizers, tuning of adhesion and wetting properties, improving biocompatibility of drugs, protecting coatings against adsorption of proteins (= contaminating), in a biological milieu, or microfluidic chips for biomolecule separation @xcite, etc. , etc. meanwhile, in many of these interesting situations, free polymer chains will also be interposed with the polymers of the brush. In this way, you will have very little interaction between the chains in the melt and the free chains in the brush, even if their chemical nature is the same (= wetting autophobia) . , etc., etc. In contrast, scaling theory, self-sufficient field, and simulations, have predicted partial penetration of free chains in moderately dense brushes, with the same chemical nature, when the monomer volume in solution is close to that of the brush, and this has been confirmed experimentally @ xcite. . However, in many applications, free chains also are introduced into the solution, in some cases, on a particular basis (e.g., with a dry polymer), a big of interest, though not much was known, apart from the case of a brush interacting with a dense polymer melt. This is interesting to know in view of the general situation in which the grafted and free chains are of different chemical nature. . . . and the boundary conditions in which they are drawn are likewise referred to in the article, in particular, as compared with the material grafting and the membrane grafting. These conditions, particularly when the grafted and the free chains come into contact, as illustrated by a 'blue wing', of the length xmath24. The numerical results are given in the section ( results) in which the sections (summaries) contain a summary and discussion. . . . in which a second problem arises (traditionally characterized by the introduction of a 'blue wing' - parameter xmath1 - of xmath) between the two types of chains. Thus it is interesting to consider the more general situation in which the grafted chains and the free chains are of differing chemical natures. . . . then there is no reason to assume that the length xmath23 of the grafted chains and the length xmath0 of the free chains is equal . . . . the grafted chains are tethered to grafting sites, which form a triangular periodic lattice on the substrate, where the closest distance between the chain and the other is a maximum of xmath32. The size of the grafted chains is xmath32. The effective bonded interactions between the brush and the free chains are described by the morse potential, Xmath32 - 2 exp [ alpha (r-r  min )] ; , ] , the thickness of the container is xmath32. so the equilibrium bond length of the nearest monomers is xmath32. We consider in our present study, in general, xmath43, xmath44 (i.e., in a good solvent condition, with only small and insignificant interactions) the free chains are absorbed in the brush, while for xmath46 the polymer brush ejects them into the body. The system of grafting chains is a grafting-site which forms a triangular periodic lattice on the substrate, and where the closest distance between the two groups is xmath43, is xmath41. Note that in this study we describe the compatibility parameter xmath1 only as xmath47 and not including the coordination number (which is done when one is based on lattice models Some of our simulations have been carried out on brushes made of chains of several hundred or more atoms, in which the number of free chains of length xmath0 is assumed to be proportionally equal to xmath59 , whereby the total number of free chains in the container is multiplied by the number of free chains in the interval xmath58, to the extent that the volume fraction of free chains in the container is varied by a variable number of atoms in the interval xmath61. for example, we can calculate the statistical averages of the monte carlo-wise mathematical method from the number of atoms per monomer that we can expect. in our models we use chains of polymers, of a few atoms effective monomers, while the number of free chains of length xmath58 (where xmath0 spans the interval xmath59) is taken to be at xmath58. , whereas the concentration of free chains at the same interval xmath60 is varied. , . . . that is, the volume fraction of the free chains varies between xmath64 .

For grafted chains, the corresponding initial density is given by the following equation: xcite, where xmath107 is the non-equilibrium local chemical potential, and the dimensionless time is defined by xmath19, where xmath109 is the mobility coefficient. . . . for grafted chains, the grafted density is calculated by: xcite, where the step size at the coordinate xmath69 is taken to be 0 . . . . , the ddft equations were solved simultaneously and derived the density of free chains for a given set of interactions. The above procedure yields equilibrium density profiles for free chains for a given set of interactions. The above calculation determines the equilibrium density of free chains for a given set of interactions. Moreover, the kinetics of the adsorption of free chains into the brush were studied. The intensity of the interactions between free and grafted chains was compared with that of the strong compulsion between free and grafted chains. In order to make the results of the ddft approach agree with kinetic mc data, we set the mobility coefficient @xmath109 equal to unity and adjust the conversion factor between the ddft dimensionless time and the kinetic mc number of steps for a particular set of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath26. These comparisons, however, are conducted with the same relation, taking @xmath109 to be inversely proportional to both @xmath0 and @xmath117 . . . . the fact that the ddft method propagates @xmath105 by a continuity equation guarantees the conservation of the number of segments in the system, which is a consequence of the simulation method . . . . and a further goal is to further investigate the thermodynamic aspects of the adsorption process. . . . in order to further clarify the thermodynamic aspects of the adsorption process, we have also performed a self-common-placed field-of-physics (scft) calculation of the structural properties by the interaction strength between the slits of the brush and the free chains (the interaction of scft is characterized by the parameter @ xmath1 calculated in the standard way from the corresponding potential well-depths: xmath119). The density of the free chains is obtained in a similar manner. The hard core potential @ xmath124 is independent of the type of the segment and serves as a multiplier for the uncoupling effect, ensuring that the lattice space is completely filled and there is no overlapping of segments. The density of the free chains is also calculated. As a matter of fact, the equation for obtaining the density of the free chains is a bit like this: @ xmath120 where the normalization constant @ xmath121 is obtained from the density of the grafting density @ xmath102 and @ xmath122 from xmath123. [f] The density of the free chains is shown in Fig. [f] [f], in which the density of the free chains is calculated as follows: @ xmath120 where the density of free chains is given as parameter @ xmath130, where the density of the free chains is given as parameter @ xmath130. thin solid lines in a and b denote the results of dft calculations.

In the example given below, the density of the long polymers in a (a), is parallel with the amount of the free chains, a length of (a), (b), and (d), which corresponds to the minimum percent of (a), at two different densitys: a) at a = xmath132 and a = xmath26 (instead of the absolute particle concentration @ a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = a = b, b = d = a = a = a = a = a = a = b, d = d = a = d = d = a = d = a = b, d = d = a = a = a = b = d = a "[a] " a" denotes dft results.

"" fens nobst fig. " c, d. . It should be noted that the good agreement between simulation and dft results is quite striking. In the very dense brush xmath138, the profile shows the usual oscillations near the grafting surface, which suggest a layering immediately opposite the grafting wall - Fig. - f, d. Nevertheless, the inhomogeneity of xmath128 near the wall xmath139 does not affect xmath128 near the wall, whereas the flat part of xmath128 between the brush and the confining wall - fig. - c, d. - however, the inhomogeneity of xmath128 near the wall at xmath139 has no effect on xmath128 in the region of the polymer brush; the flat part of xmath128 between the brush and the confining wall at xmath139 is wide enough to eliminate any finite-size effect associated with the finite linear dimension of the simulation box in the direction of xmath140 - - . . . . In Fig. , fig. dens nobst fig - c, d. Then, with increasing grafting density and with increased free chain concentration, the agreement between dft and mc deteriorates somewhat, with the theory underestimating the degree of penetration of free chains into the brush (see discussion of fig. [Ads_ amount ] below) , which is likely due to the simple and straightforward tarazona’s weighting function, a weighting function that is derived from the fundamental measure theory .

A fully filled block of numbers corresponds to a full block of numbers. This is the relative absorbed amount, that is, the number of polymer-strands located in the region of xmath152, where the cutoff value for xmath152 is such that there are ninety-nine percent of the polymer-strands in this region xmath152. [[9] ] next, we show mc and dft results for the absorbed amount of chainlets, as a function of the polymer-structure and concentration. [10] The above formula is used to describe dft results for the absorbed amount of chains as a function of the thickness of grafting. In a word, in a smaller diameter, the free chain absorbed is at xmath133 for xmath61, and two grafting density, xmath27 (arcs) and xmath130 (squares). Next, we present the dft results for the absorbed amount of chain as a function of the degree of polymerization and concentration of grafting . . . . . . “ - dft-_; dft-_ fig , title = “so rg-_ fig ,” 194b. (a) absorbed fraction vs. xmath133, b) total number of absorbed monomers against xmath133 , the adsorption fraction vs. xmath133, the second absorption fraction, and the third absorption fraction against xmath133, show particularly interesting in this respect, Fig. dft-data (to be again shown for lower density) falls below the mc results at higher concentrations, which in turn demonstrates the adsorption diffraction principle. The elasticity of the absorbed chains in the brush practically does not change with respect to the conformations of the free chains in the bulk-structure; the scaling of the parallel and perpendicular components of the end-to-end (squared) distances @ xmath157 and the radius of gyration @ xmath158 is shown by straight lines, whereby the value of the float-intensity @ xmath159 decreases slightly from the linear average of the axis. , there is a marked increase in the total number of absorbed monomers, and the relative absorbed amount decreases. [ Fig. ], the general effect of these results is that for higher density the total number of absorbed monomers increases with concentration, while the relative absorbed amount decreases. What’s more, all energy values are multiplied by xmath168 for better vision. In the image below, the density of the free chains is displayed at the critical value of the brush-bed’s strain–resistance (for mc simulations and for scft calculations) . While the results of the simulation and the theoretical calculations are quite different, the qualitative difference is striking. The density profiles of free chains are indicated in a graphic form as in the figure below, wherein the distance between them reaches a pre-determined extent (in the side and the outside of the brush). Fig. 1As a remarkable feature of polymer absorption in a brush, we find a critical compatibility between the grafted and the free chains. "Resent! b) the absorption time of free chains. Here xmath169 is the measured time of the filling of polymer chains with different size xmath169. The absorption time is constant. There is a distance of xmath169 from the grafting plane, where the local concentration of polymer solutions is independent of the polymer length xmath169, if xmath169 is constant for all xmath169, then the value of xmath172 depends on the concentration and size of the grafted chains . Here, here is the simulation and the theoretical study of polymer adsorption / desorption into or out of the brush. Here, we find that the value of xmath172 increases as xmath175 with increasing free chain concentration xmath133, and decreases as xmath176 with increasing length xmath177 of grafted chains (in the latter case, the grafting density is adjusted to such an extent that the typical scaling variable for grafted polymers xmath177 is constant) . The inset illustrates the absorption times for various lengths of free chains, illustrating three distinct classes, i (@ xmath9), ii (@ xmath17) and iii (@ xmath180) — a colored dotted area — c . absorption time at xmath19 against polymer length at xmath0 displays three distinct classes, i (@ xmath17) and iii (@ xmath180) (darknessed areas) . This, as is shown in adducting kinetics for 101515 and mc1 , in a proportion to the length of grafted chains (advertise in xmath23), adsorbate is emitted from the brush at an instantaneous switch off of the interaction between brush and free chains. It is also shown in Fig. Fig. , title = “Fig. ” Fig. , Fig. c1 Fig . . . as was expected, the expulsion of the adsorbate from the brush after an instant switching off of the interaction between brush and free chains proceeds much faster than the absorption kinetics. Fig. . . . the absorption time math19 against polymer length math0 for math27 shows three distinct regimes i ( @ xmath9), ii (@ xmath17) and iii (@ xmath180) The log-log plot shows that xmath154 grows by the power law xmath185. The measured slopes of xmath183 are plotted in the top row against the number of free chains with xmath58. . . . and compared with the measured slopes of xmath186 and xmath185 the exponent of xmath187 (bottom row). The calculated slopes of xmath184 are plotted in the bottom row against the number of free chains with xmath58 . . . non-resistant, for both values of xmath23 there are clearly three different regimes in the dependence of xmath19 on xmath0 . . . the first is the rapid growth of xmath0 and, consequently, the second is the slow growth of xmath19. Moreover, the time of xmath0 (and consequently xmath11) increases beyond the aforementioned values, one enters the second regime, where, though almost linear, the growth of xmath19 is markedly slower. In a looser medium (an active carbon) a gradual degradation of the absorption kinetics was observed at xmath3 and xmath133. There was, in fact, an effect of this sudden reduction in the absorption kinetics in xmath3 and xmath133, for which the free chains were sliced. (xxii) Xcite is a water-soluble medium, and resembles in some respects the polymer brush . . . as you can see, the elastic property of the braid in xmath3 increases with increasing concentration of free chains, which is relatively similar to the effect of crystalline carbon . . . . , so the absorption kinetics underline the special compatibility between the brush and free chains. . . . . in a further section . . . ens fig, we show the change of the amount absorbed for the critical attraction amh197. The time is given in logarithmic coordinates. (a) The time of free chains with time at the polymer brush compared with time. In the left panel, one can see two ridges  , in   , in   ., which are first angled in the bulk above the brush, as they move into the chamber, while another ridge    is located near the opposite wall, but gradually disappears   in the bulk. [Enclosed ] the polymer brush is located at   199. The time is given in logarithmic coordinates . . . from the right panel, we can see that, for the higher concentration (     ) it is more prominent inside the brush and at shorter times (which explains the higher slope       in fig. [     ][      ][  ] [   ] in fig. . . . . . . This was due to the fact that we have simulated, by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations, and thus have extended the range of lengths of the grafted chains to @xmath13 in order to test more comprehensively our results. However, the most important and unexpected properties of linear chain absorption in a polymer brush we found were: (1) the dramatic increase in the number of adsorbed chains with the increasing length of the chain, (2) the considerable reduction of the absorption kinetics with increasing concentration (i.e. the increase in the gradient in density) of the free chains. Here, too, the percent of absorbed chains is largely preserved, as we have seen in quantities like @xmath203 and the monomer density profile _@xmath104_, in different lengths, in different concentrations, in different strength of attraction to the grafted chains. The most interesting and unguessed characteristic of linear chain absorption in a polymer brush is that: * the dramatic increase in adsorbed tidal amounts in the chain length, - and * the significant slowdown in the absorption kinetics with increasing concentration (i.e. the increase in the starting gradient of density) of the free chains, besides this dynamic and static property of absorption in a brush, we find that the absorbed macromolecules and the brush itself are largely intact, as we see in the amount of xmath203 and phlogin density, - phlogin density, - phlogin density, - phlogin density - phlogin density - phlogin density - phlog Once again, we emphasize the importance of the three unique types of absorption of free chains as regards the length of the free chains at xmath0. In the first category, the characteristic time for absorption at xmath19 increases rapidly with the length of the oligomer, so long as the small size of the oligomer remains smaller than the separation between grafting sites. In the second category, the first rate of absorption decreases with xmath0, and is fairly linear at xmath209. Finally, we have identified the three-phase kinetics of absorption in which the size of the free chains is concerned. The first, the characteristic time of absorption at xmath19 increases quickly with the length of the oligomer, as long as the length of the grafting-sites is less than the separation between the grafting sites.
