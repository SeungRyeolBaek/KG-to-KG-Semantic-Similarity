If we look at actual experimental results, it is necessary to recall that the majority of the true materials of the world are either heisenberg-like or ising, because in a heisenberg-like case the random magnetic anisotropy is considerably weaker than the isotropic exchange interaction (although, see ref. 5) the random magnetic anisotropy originated from the dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction, or from the dipolar interaction, often one or two magnitudes weaker than the isotropic exchange interaction. . . . in the case of sulfism-glasses, much work has been devoted either formally or theoretically to the properties of sulfism in the presence of magnetic fields . . . unfortunately, our understanding of these properties has remained unsatisfactory. . . . However, in the experimental setting a rather sharp transition occurs. This transition is related to the hotly debated question whether the order of sulfism in the absence of magnetic fields entails a symmetry breaking (RSB) or not. But, as regards a true thermodynamic sulfism, we must remember that many of the real sulfisms are in fact heisenberg-like materials, in the sense that the random magnetic anisotropy of the dzyaloshinski-moriya interaction or the dipolar interaction, are often one or two magnitudes weaker than the isotropic exchange interaction. The sulfid transition, which is essentially the sulfid-type in the world of spin glasses, which consists in the dipoles, on ‘It is true that the true 'heat' - temperature transition, although possible in the infinite-range heisenberg - model, is not possible in the more realistic finite-range heisenberg - model, so that, when one observes the real 'heat' - temperature transition in the magnetic field, it is quite possible, if we do not take into account the weak random 'heat' that is reflected in the experiment, it is possible, though in a less realistic finite-range heisenberg model, that the apparent success of the mean-field model in explaining the experimental phase diagram should be taken with some reservations. Thus, the question of the true nature of the experimentally observed 'hg' transition in the magnetic field remains unsolved. Recently, one of the present authors has proposed a scenario, called spin-chirality decoupling-recoupling, which aims to explain some of the puzzles of the experimentally observed hg transition in the magnetic field. in this scenario, chirality, which is a multispin variable which represents the sense or handedness of local noncoplanar spin structures induced by spin frustration, plays an important role. Fig. (Almeida)—thereupon, the so-called de almeida—de-almeida—thouless (at) line @ hc @ hc@hc@hc] in the weak – field regime, where the chirality is important, and the gabai – toulouse (gt) line @hc@hc@hc@hc@hc]. This chirality, according to the equation ( chidef) is a pseudoscalar in the sense that it is invariant under global xmath8 spin rotations, but it changes its sign under the spin reflections (or inversions), which can be viewed as a combination of reflections and rotations. In a fully isotropic heisenberg sg, in particular, the chirality scenario of ref. xmath8 and ref. xcite – it was found that the critical properties associated with the chirality of the sg were different from those of the ising sg, and that the chirality of the sg was not a paramagnetic sg. [14] The chirality of ref. xcite is defined as a vector product of two adjacent heisenberg sgs, ref. xcite – xcite – is expressed as a vector product of two adjacent heisenberg sgs, ref. xcite. Note that the chirality defined by eq. (chidef) is a pseudoscalar in that it is invariant under global rotations, but changes its state under reflections or inversions (which are a combination of reflections and rotations) – in particular, the chiral glass transition of ref. xcite (remark that the chiral glass transition was more novel than the isotropic heisenberg sg) in that the chiral glass transition of ref. xcite (as seen at ref. xcite) took place based on the chiral glass transition of ref. xcite, the chiral Moreover, we argued that the chiral-glass transition was an equivalent of the zero-field transition. , and that the chiral-glass transition was not the chiral-glass transition of the fully isotropic system. It was said that the chiral-glass transition was the chiral-glass transition of the fully isotropic system, not the chiral-glass transition of the fully isotropic system, which has been separated from the chiral-glass transition. In our present paper we have introduced our model and give some details of our numerical method. In our simulations we have reported on the results of large-scale monte-carlo experiments on the fully isotropic 3d heisenberg sg , a new simulation in which we have analysed the chiral-glass transition in the magnetic field, in particular by means of large numerical tests, and we wish to explain in detail how the spin and chirality order in applied fields is determined. In our simulations, various physical quantities were estimated and explained in the following: the quadratic dependence of the chiral-glass transition line is only regular, whereas that of the gt-line in the sk model can neither be regarded as such. here, it was observed that the chiral-glass transition line (eqn: phaseline) had a form similar to that of the gt-line in the sk model. The object of the present paper is to provide the result of a large-scale simulation of the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg , and to suggest the significance of the chiral-glass transition in the applied field . . . but we note, however, that the physical In this section, we present our model and give an account of the recent experimental results on canonical sg. Our numerical results are discussed in terms of recent experimental results on canonical sg. : the model we consider is the classical classical heisenberg model, on a 3d simple cubic lattice, called xmath14, where xmath14 is a three-part vector, and xmath17 is the intensity of magnetic field in xmath17, according to the distribution of xmath24 , and the spin glass order perpendicular to the applied field. the chiral-glass ordered state is quite durable against magnetic fields, while the chiral-glass transition line in applied fields has the characteristic of the gt line of the mean-field model. This section introduces our model and gives some details of our numerical technique. To confirm that this has been done, we add the value of the chi-squared ratio, ,  mcs, , , , , , ,  , , , ,  and  are obtained by the statistical determination of the scale between two independent systems ( replicas, ) and an overlap of the chi-squared ratio at the maximum and the minimum temperature, and verify that the normal cooling of the water bath is quite fast at the very highest temperature, which is , ,  , and  = ,  , and this allows us to sample different parts of the phase space at each  cycle of the temperature exchange process. In this section we will describe the different physical quantities that we have calculated in our Monte Carlo simulations. The following chiral variables are defined by the local chiral variables defined by the scalar  , , where  is the thermal average and   the average over the bond disorder. The error bars of physical quantities are estimated by the statistical fluctuation of the observations in the analysis of the interaction of samples. we can consider two independent systems ( replicas ) described by the same hamiltonian ( hamil), and we can specify an overlap of the chiral variables. The analysis (mcr) is done in the usual heat-water updating process without the temperature-changing process, while the starting spin configuration at mcr54 is taken from the equilibrium spin configuration generated by our temperature-changing mc-runs. . . . but, to account for this short-range order, we also consider the lower chiral-glass order parameter @ xmath46 and the lower chiral-glass-strain ratio @ xmath47 by dividing @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 by appropriate powers of @ xmath36,  xmath50 the chiral-glass ratio  @ xmath52  . . . (# 1 ) in order to study the equilibrium dynamics of the model, we also calculate the autocorrelation function of the chirality defined by @ xmath53  . . . . . . if it is in a self-averaging ordered state, it vanishes in the state when the order parameter is self-averaging, and is therefore unable to be used as an unambiguous indicator of non-averaging @ xcite. Moreover, the * xmath56 parameter could take a nonzero value in a self-averaging ordered state, and so this parameter cannot be used as an unambiguous indicator of non-averaging @ xcite . . . . in the case of the chirality it is also possible to define a function for the heisenberg spin. . . . the , , , ,  , , , , ,  , , , ,   , ,  ,  , , , , ,  , , , ,  ,  , ,  , , , , , ,  , ,  , , ,  , , , ,  ,  ,   , , , , , , , , ,  ,  , , ,  ,  , , ,  , , , , , The relevant part of the study is described in the following way: ref. xcite. For the purpose of illustration, we refer to ref. xcite here, and we introduce the proposed transverse-spine-obtuse distribution function @ xmath79, defined in terms of the diagonal overlap @ xmath80 which is the trace of the tensor overlap @ xmath82, @ xmath81 the distribution function @ xmath79 is symmetric with respect to @ xmath82. For high temperature, each @ xmath62 ( @ xmath83) is expected to be gaussian distributed around @ xmath84 in the @ xmath85 limit, and so is @ xmath80. in applied fields, @ xmath76 might well behave differently from @ xmath72. the description of the vertical portion of the graph follows. In this analogy, we take account of its transverse component, namely the radial part, namely, the line-width modulus, which is the line-width modulus, which is the trace of the diagonal intersection of xmath82 and whose amplitude is not less than Xmath82. meanwhile, a direct look at the spin pattern reveals that this noncoplanar spin configuration of the 3d heisenberg sg is certainly noncoplanar, which guarantees that the system sustains the noncoplanar chirality. In a word, the chirality-related quantities are explained first. In fig. [fig.] (a) (a) , extrapolation of @ xmath92 to @ xmath93 gives non-zero values, as long as the field intensity is not too large, i.e., @ xmath94, 0 . 295, 0 . 308 , 0 . 260, and 0 . 0 for @ xmath95, 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 0 , 0 . 0 and 5 . 0 respectively. Besides, the most important observation here is that, as long as the ordered state has a finite transverse sg lro, the diverging peak should be accentuated in @ xmath79 at @ xmath91, as is evident in fig. 5, --,  . . . - in Fig. . . in Fig. . . - gx2 , we show the size dependence of chirality of xmath102 for the fields a) @ xmath24, and b) - in Fig. . - qx2 , we show the size dependence of xmath99 for the field a. - xmath24 , we show the size dependence of xmath36 for the field a. , and b) for the field b. , as you can see from the figures, xmath103 has a negative dip, and with increasing xmath27 tends to deepen and shift to lower temperatures . . . a. , a. . , - gx2 , we show the ratio of the chirality - glass order parameter - xmath100 for the fields a, a, b, xmath101 , and b, - xmath101 . in fig. . . . . . . . We compute the absolute temperature of X-math109 versus X-math110 for the fields X-math24 and X-math101. Our data are fairly straight. (B) in fig. . . . [Phoenix,5] . . .  Fig. 5.4 , we plot the average of the negative-dip temperature of X-math109 versus X-math110 in the field X-math108. , and (c) at X-math101 , in the figure [Phoenix], we find that the ratio between the two fields (x-math-112) is known, and that it is known, as shown in fig. if we consider the situation of Xmath121 in the figure, he gets Xmath122 and Xmath122 in the figure, we get Xmath122. Our analysis is also applicable to the figure Xmath121. It is the same as the calculations for the size a , a , b , xmath122 .. And just at xmath122, the linearity of the power-law decay is seen. Nevertheless, our observation that Xmath120 has a downward curvature below Xmath119, tended by a nonzero value of the static chiral ea parameter Xmath129, means that the state of chiral ea is not rigid but a nonzero long-range order. . . . Therefore, our data indicates that the chiral - glass transition takes place at Xmath123, in agreement with our previous assessment based on Xmath105. Besides, our observation that Xmath120 has a downward curvature below xmath120, tending to a nonzero value corresponding to the static chiral ea parameter xmath129, therefore, our data indicates that the chiral - glass transition takes place at Xmath123, in agreement with our earlier estimates based on Xmath105. . . . as explained in ref. . . . in ref. . . . @ xcite, in the zero-field, such peculiar features of xmath139 may be related to the - one-step - like rsb . . . in fig. Fig. . - , we show the temperature and size dependence of the xmath144 and xmath145 parameters for the field xmath101 at a temperature of xmath135, well below the chiral glass transition temperature, @ xmath143 . , we note that our data of xmath143 are also compatible with the continuous plateau between math142 and math142 at a temperature of xmath135, very below the chiral glass transition temperature, - xmath143 . we note that our data of xmath142 are also compatible with the existence of a continuous plateau between math142 and math145. This is also correlated with the math -step - like rsb - . . . . according to ref. math101 , such peculiar features of math139 are likely to be related to the _one-step - like rsb - . "Fragmath101" . . . in fig. [Fragmath-f] and [Fragmath-f] , we show the connections between the longitudinal and transverse components of the spin of the fields a, b, and b. in fig. [Fragmath-f] and Figmath-f, we show the weighted ratio of the longitudinal component of the spin of the fields a, b, and b , respectively. in fig. [Fragmath-f] and Figmath-f, we see the weighted ratio of the longitudinal component of the spin of the fields a, b, and b, respectively, at all the temperatures. This observation, according to the fact that the longitudinal component of the spin exhibits a net magnetization in the direction of applied fields at any finite temperature. The lower bound of the girdle at xmath-f increases monotonously with increasing @f] and stays negative at all temperatures. For the field b, the magnified figure is shown in the innermost part of the graph ... in fig - gsl , we show the coupled girdle ratio of the longitudinal component for the fields a, b, and b , Fig - gsl , we show the connected girdle ratio for the longitudinal component of the spin at the _fool_, at the same temperature, and ... in fig - gsl ... - here, below, we have calculated the critical equivalences for the chiral-glass transition. - in the resulting analysis, we will first estimate the chiral-glass capacity from the slope of the log-log plot of the field xmath. - we first compute the chiral-glass resistance factor xmath156 from the asymptotic slope of the log-log plot of the field xmath, as calculated above. This equivalence does not contradict the kosterlitz-thouless (kt) condition , but as shown in the inset, the "shoulder" is suppressed with increasing xmath27, "without a divergent behavior '.  in this subsection we determine the static and dynamic critical factor associated with the chiral-glass transition. For the field xmath24, we have observed similar suppression of the shoulder as above, at temperatures as low as xmath152. We conclude that this critical-glass transition does not accompany the standard transverse sg order, at least above the chiral-glass transition. As can be seen from the figure, the data lie on a straight line. (b) Log-log plot of xmath160 versus xmath27, for the field xmath101 at xmath175 .            ,      ,      ,                                      ,       ,            ,     ,  ,                              . ,       .  ,     ,   ,          ,   , , , , , , , We also draw here the critical properties of the chiral glass transitions of the 3d ising ea model of Xcite. We add the critical properties of chiral glass, and this is the case for the chiral glass transitions of the 3d ising ea model of Xcite. In fig. [fig.][11] we show the standard finite-size scaling for the chiral glass order parameter @xmath48, based on the relation –Sg. we note that this is consistent with the chiral system of refs. in fig. [12] –Chilling, we show the standard finite-size scaling for the order parameter @xmath48 based on the relation – A-Chilling. In fact, this analysis of exponents and @xmath119 is based on the chiral autocorrelations and we utilise them in our scaling. Hence, we have, as a rule, checked the values of the exponents and @xmath119, and have done the following: we use the @xmath185 value that we have already given, - xmath186, and extrapolate the temperature of the dip of @xmath105, @xmath109, to xmath187 (see the dashed lines of fig. [ fig.] . as we have just seen, this extrapolation yields the whole temperature of the chiral glass transition, @ xmath151, @ xmath192, and @ xmath188 (@ xmath101 ) The existence of such significant finite-size effects has also been suggested from the behavior of the binder ratio and the diagonal transverse spin order of xmath106. Such a lack of a complete scaling of xmath104 results in certain degrees of uncertainty in our estimation of xmath159. Suppose, however, that xmath104 itself scales at xmath124, at least just below xmath124, with a re-weight of one exponent at xmath124. Nevertheless, within the range of sizes studied here xmath191 there is no such scaling of xmath104. Then, in a truly asymptotic critical regime, xmath104 itself scales at xmath124 with a one exponent adjustment at xmath103. In the case of a vertical scale, like the one of the vertical scale, one would have to account for a proportion of one minus one exponent at xmath104. In the case of the vertical scale, the measure of xmath104 is the same as if it were an exponential function, and the modulus of yaw and yang of the linear scale. In addition to the inward scale, one would have to take into account the actual scaling of xmath134 in a completely asymptotic dependent case: to grow the angle of xmath104 to xmath124 with the addition of one exponent at xmath104. The function of xmath106, whereby we converge by a certain period, viz., at xmath124, would have yielded at xmath192 a For the field xmath101, we have an example: we have (a) @ xmath197, and (b) @ xmath199. Look at them: both fits are equal to each other, if we do not adjust the exponents in the right way. We consider, however, that this is not the case for the following reasons. First, as already seen, there is an important difference between the behavior of the chirality and the chirality, and in a diagonal chirality - xmath79 , assuming (a) @ xmath197, and (b) @ xmath199. We assume (a) @ xmath197 and b) @ xmath199. On a log - log plot, we examine the dependence of the two order parameters on a log-log plot,   - in fig. . . [a] @ xmath197, - b -  , - , assuming (a) @ xmath197, - b - a - @ xmath199. That is to say, the observed behavior of @ xmath86 is consistent with either, (a) the beginning of the kosterlitz-thouless transition at a finite temperature below which the detachment-glass correlations decay algebraically with a power law, or (b) the gradual growth of the detachment-glass correlation length @ xmath124, which exceeds the investigated system size @ xmath121 close to xmath119 . Secondly, we add that a critical-ordered transition must exist at xmath104 if it is accompanied by a critical-ordered transition at xmath105. In general, it is difficult to distinguish between the two possibilities from the data with @ xmath104, fig. . . . In the first case, there should be a sufficiently defined finite transition temperature at which the critical-ordered transition takes place, while in the second case there should not be a thermodynamic sg transition at a finite temperature. First, we note that the critical-ordered transition is not supported by our data of @ xmath105 in fig. Fig. gst. Of course, the spatial calculation of these two parameter points is of relatively low degree, and the line connecting the two data points of the chisel is drawn at each temperature. However, we must note again that this disguised criticality in the spin domain is only a short-term phenomenon. For example, in the case of the chisel sg, the chisel sg is a continuous figure: its definition is that chiral is by definition always independent of the spin, about the square of it (@ xmath210) as expected from the naive power calculating. Hence, the chisel sg values in the sg sg parameter and the sg correlation function may well reflect the critical singularity associated with the chiral sg, i.e. the chiral scvincing relationship, at least, on a certain length and time scale. Note that these values are not very far from the values that we obtain from the finite-size enumeration of figs. In such a case, the obvious (not true) transverse    spin glass exponents (not true) would be (not true) @ xmath211 and @ xmath212, which would be derived from the short-scale relation, @ xmath212. and, assuming the simultaneous occurrence of the spin and the chiral transition, this would certainly have been the case, particularly at a certain length and time scale. As you can see, we have made a large-scale equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation on the isotropic heisenberg sg based on the present simulation. Our calculations are even not inconsistent with the coefficient @xmath14 in eq. ([eqn] phaseline], which is a tad bit negative, so that at first @xmath216 rises somewhat with the increment of @xmath17, though it is difficult to establish a precise conclusion, due to the scatter of our estimated value of @xmath216. Our data are even not incongruous with the coefficient @xmath14 in eq. ([eqn] phaseline), being slightly negative, so that at first @xmath216 rises somewhat with @xmath17, although this incongruity is difficult to establish due to the scatter of our estimate of @xmath17 . [73] The chiral state of glass remains quite resilient against magnetic fields. [72] The chiral state of glass is, as we have seen, quite robust against magnetic fields. This chaste - glass transition line in the xmath17-xmath19 plane has been found to be almost vertical to the temperature axis, and in the order of the order of the order of the chiral - glass it seems that the chiral - glass ordered state is extremely strong against magnetic fields. Furthermore, in the real sg magnets the spins are not necessarily locked on a cubic lattice, nor do they interact with other spins by the nearest neighbor - neighboring one , etc. , in spite of these obvious limitations it is a useful task to compare our current magnetic realism with the experimental realism of heisenberg-like sg magnets. But the chiral - glass realism turns out to be quite close to the experimental realism of canonical sg such as agmn. This somewhat surprising property, probably, has to do with the fact that the magnetic field couples directly to the spin, and not to the chirality, and therefore the effective coupling between the field and the chirality is rather weak. We have also created a magnetic equivalence of the sg magnet, i.e. the 3D heisenberg sg model. Moreover, in real sg magnets, chirality does not lie on a simple cubic lattice, and does not interact with other chirality by the chirality's proximity, oblique coupling, etc. .. Fig. 1 : In this fig. we will show the experiment of the experimental phase diagram of the canonical sg aufe from ref. Xcite. the field intensity is then translated into the field intensity in the standard unit @ xmath224, and this is translated into the field intensity in the standard unit @ xmath22 by the relation @ xmath224, the effective bohr number: in the case of aufe, @ xmath225 was experimentally estimated to be @ xmath226, where @ xmath227 is the bohr magneton @ xcite . so that the Fig. fig. Fig. , after that, our present estimate of @ xmath22 indicates that the sg boundary of aufe can remain almost vertical up to the field of @ xmath228. . . to evaluate the validity of the chirality theory, it would be interesting to perform such finite-field simulations for the anisotropic 3d heisenberg sg model. . . . for review of spin glasses, see e. g. , [p. 58] ( 1986) 830; b. . . fischer and j. . . hertz: “ Spin glasses and random fields” ( cambridge university press) ; c . . . mydosh: “Schippen glasses” taylor & francis (1996); d. . . . mydosh: “Schippen glasses” taylor & francis (1996); d. a . . . . . : phys. b. 58.
