Finally, a great deal of development has been done to enhance the sensitivity of ligo and improve its chances of detecting gravitational waves in compact object bundles. To circumvent this limitation, ligo uses analytical models, like phenomenological models, or effective one-body models, xcite. - with the help of phenomenological models xcite, we will focus on the phenomenological b (phenomb) waveforms, which were developed by xcite. This waveform family consists of bbh systems of various masses and of different spins (i.e., non-precessing binaries) , the whole phenomb family, and is therefore cheaply built in arbitrary positions in the frequency domain. Unfortunately, the location of the template bank generally requires many thousands of templates (e.g., @ xcite) for mass and spin, and which cannot be done with the current numerical relativity waveforms. We use svd to set up a template bank made from an analytical wave-form family, and construct an orthonormal basis over the wave-forms, and then we project the nr wave-forms onto this basis and add the projection coefficients, so that arbitrary wave-forms can be produced, thereby creating a new wave-form. This is done in a novel way and uses both the analytical phenomb wave-form and the nr hybrid wave-form, as we do so in the study of equal-weight, zero-weight binaries. We then compare our nr hybrid wave-forms to the phenomb wave-forms and show that a mass-bias exists between them. This paper is divided into sections: we begin by defining the key terms used in our paper; we then present our svd accuracy boosting technique and show that it improves the accuracy of the original wave-form family. Our svd accuracy boosting method is applied to the case study of equal-weight, zero-weight binaries . for our purposes it suffices to take xmath11 as the first ligonoid curve, whereas the advanced ligonoid curve would only serve to complicate our analysis by allowing the resulting waveforms to extend over the low frequency domain. eq. a resemblance between the two waveforms is made obvious by defining Xmath16, where xmath17 is the standard complex inner product and the norm of Xmath18. Note that Xmath19 is a resemblance between Xmath19 and Xmath14. This resemblance is made apparent by using xmath10, where xmath11 is the ligonoid curve, and xmath12 is the fourier transform of . In our work, we shall call these ligonoid curves the initial ligonoid curve. This is performed in frequency space by the @xmath10, where xmath11 is the ligonoid curve and xmath12 is the fourier transform of . . . . the time-dependent resemblance is shown by , and the phase-dependent resemblance is an automatic consequence of the modulus. The whitened time domain-frequencywaveform is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of . . . the paper is reprinted with 'As A Whitened Waveform, 'As A Wave Refreshed'. So for the purposes of this study, we have chosen the G-Wave – equal-mass, equal-mass, equal-swap (effective-swap) waveform described in G-Wave – above – (see also fig. 9 of G-Wave –). Here we apply the general geometry of the T-Wave – equal-mass (M-Wave) waveform to the hybrids of the Tylort3 and Tylort4 (both of which have the same surface), as described in G-Wave – below – at – 35 – and at – 35 for – 36 – and below – 37 for – 35 – and – 35 for – 35 – . that is to say, a Tylort3 hybrid is much like Tylort4 at 3.0 – see in –14 – and –31 in Figure 12. in Section 2.13 we also use the numerical equations, a’roiling, ‘an equal-mass’ ‘Phon-Newtonian’’ ‘(et al.) ’ . These ratios, for higher ratios, have a greater error due to the pre-newtonian waveform in Tylort3. For higher mass-ratios the non-pn-nr hybrids have an increase in the error of the Post-Newtonian waveform in Tylort3. However, the error-bounds on these hybrids are much less than those arising in the study presented here, so that we conclude that our results are not influenced by the error of the applied Tylort3–Nr hybrid waveform. As our procedure for constructing an orthonormal basis begins with phenomb waveforms, we shall now investigate how well these waveforms approximate the nr waveforms to be interpolated. We will be analyzing the faithfulness of the phenomb family by calculating the mismatch xmath49 as a function of mass. This calculation is a dashed curve in the top panel of figure [Figure 9] . , which is a smaller mass than the mass xmath48 of our nr waveform     , over almost all the parameter space we consider. The phenomb waveforms, we can try to interpolate, have a short and sharp gradient of ratios, almost straight lines, a large degree of ratio structure . . . since the orthonormal table begins with phenombs, we now examine how well they model the nr waveform  . The solid line in the bottom panel of figure                                            ,           ,  , , , . , . the combined mass    ,  , ,  , , The first step is to construct a model bank of phenomb waveforms with focus on the equal-mass, zero-skinned binaries. We shall take advantage of this arrangement to create a orthonormal basis by the svd of a bank of phenomb waveforms, and then, in addition, to overlay the coefficients of nr waveforms, to generate a waveform family with an improved nr faithfulness. - First, in a first step, we shall construct a model bank of phenomb waveforms, containing the binaries called 'phenomb' and labelled 'eighth-seventh-sixth-sixth-sixth', and correspondingly containing 'eighth-sixth-sixth-sixth-sixth-sixth-sixth'; for 'eighth-sixth-sixth-sixth-sixth-sixth-sixth' the line of the concentric template banks can be reduced to 'eighth-sixth', but we have not investigated the degree of this in. We would like to create an orthonormal basis by the svd of a bank of phenomb waveforms, and then interpolate the coefficients of the nr waveforms projected on this basis to a waveform family with improved nr faithfulness. and when applying the strategy of omission of each cell, a multilayer of phenomb waveforms may be detected, and the trial will be settled at the same level as xmath71, and the average length of each trial is assigned a It has a duration of xmath83 and is uniformly sampled at xmath84 (a sample frequency of xmath85) . the lower mass was chosen to obtain a fairly large template bank containing xmath82 waves; to push it down to xmath50 it would result in more than double the number of templates. xmath87 is the result, with the help of svd, of the equations of xmath86 where xmath86 and xmath90 are orthogonal matrices, and xmath90 is a diagonal matrix whose non-zero elements along the main diagonal are called singular values . the svd for xmath86 is uniquely defined, as long as the singular values are arranged in descending order along the main diagonal of xmath86 . this can be exploited to reduce the basis of xmath92 into an orthonormal basis , which spans the space of a template to a fixed width . . . for instance, suppose we want to reduce the basis by only considering the first Xmath96 basis modes, while we might choose to reduce the basis by examining only the first Xmath96 basis modes , and thus bring down the proportions of xmath94 into a proportionate proportion , which is 12110 , for instance, if we want to reduce the basis by considering only the first Xmath96 basis modes, and then taking into account the singular value , Xmath95, taken from the main xmath95 element along the main xmath91 diagonal . It was shown in xcite that the mismatch expected by reducing the basis to this way is Xmath100 given by Xmath91, and if we make it a difference, then the number of basis waveforms, Xmath101, that are needed to represent the original templates for some predicted mismatch Xmath102. In order to examine the accuracy of the system, however, we must compute the mismatch explicitly for each template waveform. It is worth considering the mathematical concept of orthonormality (and the orthonormality condition), and it is easy to prove from it that the mismatch between the template and its projection can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of projection: @xmath104 this quantity is minimized continuously over time and discretely over time in integer multiples of @xmath25 . - in order to investigate its accuracy, however, we must be sure to compute the mismatch for each template waveform. we, of course, are of course more interested in how well nr waveforms can be represented by the same reduced basis of nr waveforms. a general waveform, a general, a general, a general, a general waveform, can be represented by the reduced basis. - and thus the phenomb waveforms can be represented in a high degree from a reasonably reduced basis. a similar solution is described in Figure [3] , in which we remind the reader that we always minimize the difference between continuous phase changes and discrete time periods of the two waveforms. we see that the nr waveforms can be represented in a reduced basis with a mismatch less than xmath115 over most of the dividing line of the template. In this case, mismatch increases as we move away from the one to which we are moving and falls down as we approach the next. We see that nr waveforms can be represented in the reduced basis with a mismatch less than xmath35 over most of the boundary of the template bank. This is evident from the thin dashed line which traces the mismatch of nr waveforms over the dividing line between the discrete templates. The line varies smoothly in the weight range and does not show any special features at the dividing line. This is evident from the thin dashed line which traces the mismatch of nr waveforms in the reduced basis, which, in contrast to the thin solid line, traces the mismatch of nr waveforms evaluated between the individual templates. In this case, mismatch increases as we move away from one template, then falls back again as we approach the next. This, in the figure : in trunx we see that the number of nr and phenomb representations measured by the same set of masses , as we have described, follows at xmath115 , this number is constant and decreases as the tolerance is reduced. A new wave-family would be provided by numerical interpolation of the projection coefficients of the waves that are contracted to a reduced basis. Such an approach is to sample the projection coefficients of the waves that are contracted to a reduced basis, at some set of locations, at xmath119, and then to make an interpolation to obtain the continuous function, @xmath120, which is in any direction. Thus we define this space, @xmath124, as the space of constant overlap in the wave-forms. a moment that passes through this space is equal to the difference between the two templates. In this space we find the real and imaginary components, @xmath125 and @xmath126, of the complex projection coefficients, oscillatory functions which roughly describe the sum of the two frequencies. and this is the more obvious pattern which is exhibited in the plot of the basis-waveforms, the higher they get. They are more complex, but their aggregate values are smaller, so they are less important in the representation of the waveform. Hence a suitable space to measure is the space of constant waveforms. the new waveforms are expressed numerically in the form of a relationship, @xmath140, where the subscript intp – reminds the reader that this is computed from an interpolation of xmath98. An interpolation of the total mass @xmath44 can be compared to the original nr waveform (which we consider to be the true signal) where the latter is expressed as @xmath141 and @xmath142 denotes the part of the total mass which is orthogonal to the svd basis (i.e. orthogonal to all phenomb waveforms in the template bank) . An interpolation of the total mass @xmath44 can be compared to the original signal, which we consider to be the true signal, where the latter is expressed as @xmath141, where _xmath142 denotes the part of the total mass @xmath143 which is orthogonal to the svd basis (i.e. orthogonal to all phenomb waveforms in the template bank) . . . It is arranged in this way as follows: ‘The part of the ’xmath148 is orthogonal to the part of the ’xmath109. But, for the sake of simplicity, we have left out the last term: ‘Let’s see: ‘The fracture  1  2                                   ,  , At first, interpolation becomes increasingly more difficult for the higher-order modes because of their increased complexity. In this regard, the lower-order modes are much smoother and thus easier to interpolate, but their amplitudes are a great deal larger, so that interpolation errors are augmented with respect to the higher-order modes. In the case of perfect interpolation, for which @ xmath166 is derived, and reduce to and respectively, the total mismatch is simply the representation error of the reduced basis. Figure [Impact] shows the total mismatch between our interpolated waveforms and the true nr waveforms for various masses. This demonstrates the efficacy of coupling svd with nr waveforms to create a _ faithful _ waveform family with improved accuracy over the phenomb family that was originally used to create templates. This shows the efficacy of combining svd and nr waveforms to create a _ faithful _ waveform family, with improved accuracy over the phenomb family which was originally used to create templates. * in the case of perfect interpolation, for which @ xmath165=1 , and below that @ xmath166=1, then the total mismatch is only the representation error of the reduced basis. “We calculate a template bank of phenomb waveforms which contains a list of phenomb waveforms xmath167. To this range we use a method which consists of combining the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the svd basis of phenomb waveforms, and interpolating between these by means of a numerical set of waveforms that can be evaluated for any arbitrary parameter. This is a method for analyzing the full set of imr waveforms for this population of xmath167. this method is based on a process of converting the complex-valued waveforms into 32 real-valued waveforms. the goal is to find the coefficients of nr waveforms projected on the svd basis of phenomb waveforms, for which nr data exists, and then interpolate amongst these to create a numerical waveform family that can be examined for arbitrary parameters. in this way the construction of a waveform is no longer as straightforward as it was before, because of the increased degree of freedom that vary with nr. In this section we consider a method for the evaluation of full imr waveforms for mass-ratios which have not been simulated. in this method we find at xmath169 templates that are necessary to satisfy the minimal match of 0 . . . the waveforms are sampled for a total duration of xmath170, uniformly spaced at xmath9, so that @ xmath171 of memory is required to store the contents of xmath87 if double precision is required. The middle panels show the same thing, except for the nr waveforms compared with the weights, @ xmath184 . “The third function” in xmath184, in a diagram of the proper ratio of xmath184 and xmath186, is taken from xmath178. For the old conventions of waveforms, the complex phase at xmath178 is inapplicable to the application of xmath178; for the propagation of the waveforms, the modulus of the waveforms is always optimized over the phase change . . . however, the calculus of xmath178 will not be taken from the projections, but if a function has a coarse structure, he will be taken from the projections by xmath180. The transformation of xmath178 frees up the ambiguity of @xmath177, by selecting it as @xmath182; this choice ties the complex phase to the physical variations of the @xmath183 coefficient, and therefore eliminates all unphysical phase variations on finer scales. . . . if there is one suitable way of generating a family of nr waves with a svd boosting technique, the possibility of obtaining such a family remains open as more nr waves are produced. Fig. 2 is a variation of the Coeff2d method, asymmetrical geometry, the 5 mass ratios can be appended to the 5 mass ratios along the nyquist axis. In this way, though the current data for nr waves are not yet feasible, the possibility remains open as more nr waves are generated. In the phenomb projection coefficients of the phenomb and of coeff2d, the linearity of the structure of the expression is the same as before: the most smooth shape is shown, while the highest complexity increases. Hence, while it is not yet possible to get an interpolated waveform family from nr waves, the possibility remains open as more nr waves are produced. Taking the left and right panels of nr, it appears as if this is not possible, considering the limited number of nr waves. , this approach was adapted to the phenomb model of the no-weight binaries. kc, jde and hpp thank the support of the national science and engineering research council, the Canada Research Chairs Program, the Canadian Institute of Advanced Research, and Industry Canada and the province of Ontario through the Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation . the method of interpolation was to enclose the coefficients of nr waves onto the phenomb model. . only a minor error was introduced by the interpolation, and the new waveform family provided a more faithful representation of the true' nr signal compared to the original phenomb model. in the meantime, however, this method is not possible, for the mass-ratios covered by the nr simulations are unable to sample the coefficients with the Nyquist frequency.
