And so it is with some particulars that the former proposal for a stabilization of the electroweak scale, consisting of a compact extra dimension and a non-factorizable anti-de-sitter (ads/cft) metric, is the rundall-sundrum (rs) model, which, by virtue of the ads / cft correspondence of ad and cft, makes two quadratures the boundary of the warped extra dimension. In particular, the gauge hierarchy, i.e., the instability of the electroweak scale in response to radiative corrections, has stirred the imagination of many theorists and led to the development of a great many models of physics beyond the sm, that envisage new phenomena that are, and not far above the tev scale. Despite these successes, however, the sm is not a perfect model, because it has various theoretical imperfections. “This makes a 'slime" criterion in the scale of energy, so that the natural scale at one orbifold fixed point (the ultra violet (uv) brane) is much larger than at the other (the infra-red (ir) brane) , @xmath8 . in rs he tries to overcome the 'slime' criterion by gravitational red shifting. Besides, rs he can build models of electroweak symmetry breaking in ads @xmath8 . This is because, in the original proposal, all sm fields had to be located at the boundary of xmath8 and the gauge group was assumed to be @xmath10, it soon became clear that allowing the gauge group and matter fields @xcite to spread in the ads @xmath8 not only avoids dangerous higher-dimensional operators suppressed only by powers of xmath11, but it also makes possible a natural explanation of the flavor structure of the sm@xcite by geometric seclusion. This solution of the gauge hierarchy is thus solved by gravitational red-shifting . But in spite of the rs-gim mechanism, the cp-recking effects in the neutral kaon system xcite, and corrections to the electric dipole moment xcite, are generally too large in such models, and push the new-physics scale to at least 10 tev. The more favorable developments of the p-components encapsulating the deep part of the heavy k-baron field, on the uv brane xcite, imply the possibility of reducing the tree-level corrections to the xmath14 vertex xcite and its flavor-changing counterparts xcite . the harmful contribution of the xmath1 parameter can be satisfied elegantly by extending the bulk hypercharge group to xmath12 and breaking it to xmath13 on the uv brane xcite. . . . in order to maximize the precision of the most low-strength, cp-reducing fcncs , a technique called rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-rs-rs-gim-rs-rs-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-gim-rs-li-gi and cc- saving fc-nc-couple-goals-under-price-and-doctoring the upper-most-chelse-button. the physical interpretation of /sent> would be a great deal easier than with the large cern collider (lhc). this approach is not only more elegant, but also offers several advantages over the perturbative approach. Compared with the latter approach, the corresponding converging fields are treated as perturbations in the existing literature and, in particular, they are directly solved, under appropriate boundary conditions (bcs). in this way, the profiles and masses of the various sm particles and their kk excitations are computed precisely. , so that in the aggregate, for the case of the lean-sm, the proportions of the two perpendicular groups are evenly distributed and are necessary for the protection of the perpendicular vertex . In addition, the exact formulation also permits the mixing of fermions between different generations in a completely general way, making the dependence on the exact realization of the matter sector explicit. In this article we will discuss: - submeter gauge - decomposition of the aggregated fields in the presence of the brane localized submeter gauge, working in the covariant - submeter gauge. We also show how to compute sm values of the resulting gauge and -submeter gauge - interactions with the sm fermions. in our approach, we show, in part, the reducible sources of symmetry breaking, which are visible from our perspective, while it is somewhat hidden if the couplings of the aggregated fields with the submetre is treated from the beginning as a perturbation. In a later paper, we will work on the derived results to a tree-level quality, violating the submetre and submetre processes of the quark sector. This article is divided into sections. After recalling important definitions and notations, we discuss in section submission: gauge the decomposition of the bulk gauge fields in the presence of the brane-localized submetre, working in a covariant * xmath20 gauge. It is firstly given to the theory of gauge-boson interactions with sm fermions, and then to the theory of the higgs-boson couplings with matter. The article concentrates on the main contributions to the observables, omitting the effects of the localized kinetic terms of the redox and localized fermions. In this article, we concentrate on the principal contributions to the observables, omitting possible effects of brane-localized kinetic terms. In the first case, we give analytic formulas that show the prerequisites for the custodial protection of left-handed @ xmath2 boson couplings and on the second, which are the terms that are necessarily at the risk of protection . Besides, we assert that there is no protection mechanism in the charged-current sector . . . in the second case, the exact dependence on the realization of the fermion sector of the higgs-fecund couplings is calculated. , it is not certain the uv dynamics is given, but it is natural to assume that these terms are hidden from the loop, so that they can only be ignored in the first order. In the following appendix we give details of the derivation of the ir bcs and the higgs boson fcncs in the presence of both yukawa and odd yukawa couplings, the input sm parameters, and the explicit expressions of the form factors necessary to calculate the production cross section and the branching ratios of the higgs boson in the rs model. The most important phenomenological implications of our results are described in section [Second page] . we begin by examining the constraints imposed by the precision measurements of the pseudoobservables of the bottom-quadark, which include all the tree-level corrections that do not suppress the protection. We proceed to the phenomenology of rare top-divisions in the extended rs model and compare it with that of the minimal formulation. Xmath22 , the matrix of a variable, constant, constant, metric Xmath23 . , the fourth dimension is an  xmath26 orbifold of size  xmath27, labeled  xmath28 . The fifth dimension is an  xmath27 orbifold of size  xmath27, named  xmath28 . a ratio of the warp factor and the curvature of  xmath32 corresponds to an inverse energy scale in the 4d theory, and a tamed metric exists at xmath32 . In this section we build the kk decomposition in the gauge sector, and we find exact solutions for the bulk fields, including the effects of an ir brane - localized higgs. , it is necessary to diagonalize infinite dimensions in order to reduce them to a minimum, including only one (or a few) kk excitations. This leads to the necessity of diagonalizing infinite dimensions, which need only be truncated, and which are not bound by the mass eigenstates, but subsequently a need to study them systematically. . . . , it is sometimes convenient to introduce a coordinate @ xmath40 that equals @ xmath41 on the uv brane and 1 on the ir brane . . . . . We now have enough definitions and notations for this discussion. It is for this reason that we present a model of the model of rs with guard against truncation after the first mode. Moreover, we will see that the sum of the entire tower received a second contribution, which was lost by truncation. As the sum can be equilibrated in closed form, it is convenient to work with the whole sum and then to extend the obtained expressions by the powers of xmath43. We will take a general example of the perturbative method containing truncation after the first mode, which can be found in xcite. on the ir brane the symmetry breaking pattern @ xmath45 provides a custodial symmetry, which protects the xmath1 parameter . the additional @ xmath3 symmetry prevents the left-hand side-brain coupling from being very large corrections from xcite . . . on the uv brane the symmetry breaking pattern @ xmath47 makes a sm gauge group. - the 5d action of the gauge sector takes the form @xmath49, and the gauge-kinetic terms @xmath50 are called @xmath50, where @xmath50 denotes the 5d metric. - the - fixed lagrangian, @xmath53, will be explained in the next section . the bi- doublet, responsible for breaking @xmath55 up to the diagonal subgroup of @xmath56 on the ir brane, transforms into @xmath57, and explicitly reads @xmath58. a simple prescription of how to deal with @xmath53 is already presented in @xcite, and we postpone a refined treatment to the next section - fermkk . a simple prescription of how to deal with @xmath53 already has been given in @xcite, and we postpone a refined treatment to section - fermkk - . the gauge fixing lagrangian, @xmath54, will be explained in the next section . “In a word, we have introduced the 4d-gauge couplings ... , where we have introduced the “4d-gauge” couplings ... . an explicit calculation yields ... xmath66 ... —- three mm ... —> phantom ... xx — [1] ...  phantom ... xx — , —  phantom ... xx —  phantom ...   phantom ... ,  phantom ... _ Xmath64 ... , — cohiggs ..., which is subsumptuous in the sphere of ...  – to a scalar field, @  ,  ,  nonumber  end ... to be a converged mass matrix, ... — — to  ,    — - also the field-set-up of xmath81 and xmath82 can be reconstructed to the photon-set-up of xmath83, and we write xmath84, because it is a linear combination of xmath86 and xmath87.

This is done by means of the new fields @ xmath74 and the dirichlet bcs to @ xmath75 and @ xmath75 of the uv brane. As follows, we will call these fields the uv and the ir basis. In the following, we will refer to these fields as the uv and the ir basis, respectively. In the figure [Fig. ] base, we recall the symmetry-breaking patterns of the branes. The photon is in the form of individual and source-free neutrons, and therefore the zero mode remains massless. Note that only one mass parameter is entered into the ir bcs, in contrast to the two parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94, which are, as a matter of fact, in the minimal model. Note that the photon has the same, individual, and source-free neutron bcs at both branes, and therefore its zero mode remains massless. The action of the theory still contains mixed terms between gauge fields and scalars, which may be removed by an appropriate lagrangian . (see [Item 11] bcs of the gauge fields in the ir basis.

We consider the higgs fermions to be decaying to a final state at xmath259, and only rescale the decaying times of the two fermions to xmath153 and xmath276. we have already set the necessary xmath263 parameters for the decay of the -body into a pair of -body fermions, top or bottom fermions. The relevant xmath263 parameters for decays into two fermions, top or bottom fermions, have already been given in [eq.: kappagg] and (tbratios) . This effect is small and so that we neglect the corrections to the three-body decay -body, which, relative to the two-body mode -body, is a correction of 1 % in the sm. The amplitude of @xmath275 interferes violently with the contribution of the quark @xmath276. The decrease in amplitude at @xmath278 is due to @xmath279. The formfactor name for the formfactor, @xmath275, is given in appendix [App: formfactors] . The first, second, and third terms of the numerator describe the effects of the virtual heavy quark, @xmath153, and kk - exchange of quarks, respectively. . . . . . The corresponding one-log graphs are shown to the left, in the bottom row of figure hprodec, and in the center plot of figure hkkcontr. comparing these numbers with those for Xmath276 quoted earlier, one can observe that the xmath153-boson contribution to the decay amplitude is always dominant below the threshold. , but if the density of these effects depends on the exact realization of the region of the k is not known, it is possible to determine the relative sign and size of these effects. (Kapikamma) we emphasize that in the equation of a triangle diagram involving k leptons, one can replace kleptons with k leptons. if k leptons are k leptons in the right way, one can see that, in the case of k leptons, the k lepton amplitude is always the dominant sub-smolarity below the threshold . The approximate value of xmath293 may be calculated in the decoupling limit. A method of estimating the effect of a xmath292k addendum in the estimation of xmath293k is described on the right in figure [fig. hkkcontr] . . . according to this method, we suppose that the omission of a kk amplitude in the calculation of xmath293 is only a small numerical impact on the obtained kkkkkprth . . . . . . . . . . . “,  frac  21  8 ,  delta g h  h  w  left ( 1   cal o   left ( 1 /  tau n  w  right) To compute the last missing decay channel, that is, @ xmath299, we use @ xmath300 in - gammahtof - , where the result is @ xmath301 and @ xmath302 for @ xmath303 .  xmath294 and @ xmath295 ,  eq : hbosoncoupl , we use math301 and math300 . in order to find the last missing channel, namely xmath299, we use math300 in , math300 in , math303,  end  split  ] . . . . . . it is obvious from the plot that the fraction of the Boson Triad to Top Quarks always decreases in the custodial rs model in comparison with sm. . . . on the other hand, the fraction of Xmath314 rises from around Xmath310 to Xmath311 between Xmath312 and Xmath219, and then decreases to approximately Xmath313 in the limit Xmath283 . . . . . . In contrast, the relative motion of Xmath320 and Xmath217 is larger than the sm value, but the numerical effect is negligible in the sense of custodial safeguard. Therefore, we will set Xmath319 to 1 in our numerical analysis. In the second term of (kappagammaz) we calculate the contribution of the Xmath217 transition to the Xmath153 –Case of the Bosons on the Quadrangle. As for  cal o (v  4 /  mkk                 /   mkk           cal o (v  4 /  mkk    ) , we shall reduce    to 1 in our numerical analysis. The expressions for @ xmath325 and @ xmath326 which are necessary to derive these results are as follows: expprof, and veca-a [eq : veca-a]. In this same way, it is also readily observed that all quartic gauge - boson vertices first vary by order @ xmath328 in the rs model, even though it is in the gauge group . in this case, the virtual exchange of the virtual exchange of the triple gauge - boson to - kappagamaz is simply given by the combination of @ xmath329, which up to the different form factors resembles the corresponding expression in -kappagamaz . “This exponent of the ‘kappagammaz’ indicates that the contributions to the amplitude of xmath242 are due to the virtual exchange of kk quarks. As the innards of ‘kappagammaz’ are not sufficiently practical, we resort to a numerical calculation of the kk sum, using the method described in Section II, ‘Hists.’ Here, in the sub-branched of ‘up’ quarks, we find ‘up’ quarks, where ‘up’ means the relative strength of vectors of the [xmath2] and ‘down’ quark modes, as analogous as ‘kappaiv’ and ‘down’ quark modes. p> p> p’ in the corresponding one-branched diagram is shown in the middle of ‘up’ quarks. The analog expressions of ‘kappagammazu’ apply to ‘up’ and ‘down’ quarks. (Section 4.iii). The corresponding coefficients for the real part of @xmath335 are in Table 3 [Click here to see the kappas.] The figures, which represent the best fit of the form Xmath338, are shown in this column (Page 5], where the numbers xmath335 and xmath337, as well as those of @xmath338, are @xmath338 and @xmath337. (Click here to see kappas.) The contributions of kk-epton triangles are again not incorporated in the calculation ([kappagamma ] ] [p. iii.]. The imaginary parts of xmath349 are, in contrast, tiniest, compared with the usual dimensions, in xmath338. The point was already explained in Section : “Suzsla”[2]. - eq - nugammazu ) . in the case of the extended xmath3 symmetry (eq - extendedplr ), it turns out that for the down-type and the xmath334 quarks the result for xmath354 is the electric charge and the third component of the weak isospin of the involved fermions, while no such formula can be obtained for the up-type quarks. - Xmath352 denotes these corrections by xmath350, it is simply necessary to replace xmath351 with the simple replacement of xmath351 , so that we can obtain the normal size of xmath350, we find - xmath352 , we find - xmath352 , Xmath356 - xmath350, where the expressions for xmath353 can be found in (eq: delta2) At xmath365, for example, from the number of the fit coefficients in table (tab: kappas), we can see that this relation is for an accuracy of about xmath359 . it follows that in the decoupling limit, @ xmath357, one has @ xmath358 , from the numbers of the fit coefficients given in table (tab: kappas), we can see that the relation reaches an accuracy of about @ xmath359 . . . in the form of a kkleptonsin/sent> couple with universal strength to the vector part of the boson girders. kk- fermion effects in the down and @ xmath334 types of quarks that contribute to @ xmath360 and @ xmath361 are universal in that they can be derived simply from each other by the proper replacement of the vectors of the external fields. kappaaz] , for instance, we can estimate the result of the equation @xmath368 as follows: the real part of the relation ([eq] sumlkk) evaluates to xmath368 (= xmath370) if the effects of kk leptons are excluded (included) . Thus, we conclude that the absence of kk leptons in our analysis of @xmath242 (which is, of course, very difficult to study at the lhc) will not change any of the conclusions that follow. the coefficient @xmath372 in ( [Kappaaz]] is approximated as @xmath366 where the last term of the right-hand side is the effect of kk leptons, and to obtain the numerical value we inserted the relevant elemonic quantum numbers and derived  xmath367 . Since the first term in the sum of (eq: nugammaz) is already suppressed by a factor of @xmath43, the calculation of @xmath372 to this order does not require the knowledge of the overlap integral (eq: iwwz) to zeroth order in the ratio of the weak over the kk scale. we obtain @ xmath377 again a most useful approximation to the loop function @xmath378 in the infinite mass limit @ xmath379 in which the form factor approaches @xmath380. note that the prefactor in the second line of the above formula corresponds to the choice  xmath376 . He derived the absolute corrections of xmath387, xmath388, and xmath389 from xmath217 (left) and xmath390 (right) . These curves represent the rs results obtained from (eq. hbosoncoupl) and the relevant fit formulas with the values of the coefficients collected in the table [tab. kappas] . In this way, we obtain xmath387, xmath389, for xmath390 ( @ xmath390) . . . while the behaviour of Xmath387 has already been explained in Section [sequence] : It follows that the partial decay width at xmath389 in the custodial rs model is basically unchanged for the sm. lower than the xmath280 threshold, the amplitude of the boson amplitude dominates the sm amplitude at xmath289, and the contributions to the sm quarks and xmath153 bosons interfere constructively with the sm gauge rs curve. for xmath400, the mass dependence of the sm amplitude becomes less pronounced and the rs prediction is almost constant. xmath388, which is, on the contrary, a non- trivial function of xmath388 . the strong rise of xmath388, visible at higher values of the higgs mass, is ... I believe that if we assume a custodial rs model, the branching ratios of xmath406, xmath404, and xmath408 are not disturbed, but rather do not surpass the levels of xmath404. The dashed lines depict the predictions of rs based on the results of xmath404, and the curves for xmath404 are shown in Figure ...kappas ... and the rounded lines depict the branching ratios of xmath410, based on the results of xmath404, and on the curves for xmath405 in Figure ... - in addition to the contributions of k quarks, a very large correction has been received for xmath404 ... for xmath410 the experimentally cleanest signature for the discovery of xmath 4... the experimentally cleanst signature for the discovery of the Xmath 4... and the smtak (cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-cd-e-cd-t-can-t-w--m--about-that-to-d--cg--in-collections of - At the lhc is its golden oxidation to four elliptic elements, @ xmath411. - At the lhc the most striking effect is at the xmath414 and @ xmath414, the corresponding maximal values are at xmath418 (@ xmath41). This effect is milder than that of @ xmath417 (@ xmath41) . - As the branching fraction is essential sm - like sm - like sm, the decomposition of the cross section @ xmath228 will make observation of the boson in the golden channel more difficult . - in the relevant ranges of the mass, the modifications in the branching ratio amount to around @ xmath413 ( @ xmath414), and @ xmath415 ( @ xmath255) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath255) for @ xmath217 , the most pronounced effects are found for @ xmath416 and @ xmath289 . He made a similar calculation for @ xmath424 for @ xmath428 and, for @ xmath429, and a decay of $xmath431 for $xmath427. The effect of these variations on the tests for the higgs boson in $xmath489 will be explained later. But, in view of the downgrading of the branching factor to @ xmath425 (and the quoted maximal branching fractions) we obtain the values of @ xmath423 (@ xmath424) , the decay of $$429 is simply calculated from $bdlc, where the following equation is multiplied by $, which is a scale, @ xmath425 (for higgs masses above xmath427) and arises at xmath427. This equation suggests that the naivety of the discovery of the higgs boson in $306 can be enhanced by the custodian rs model for the low kbs. Although the density of the branching fractions of the higgs boson is such that it is extremely sensitive to other free parameters, these results are quite insensitive to the fact that the upper and lower limits of the yukawa are slightly below the lower limit of Xmath433. We have also proved that omission of the z-laser effects has no significant effect. note that our results for the branching fractions of the higgs boson depend most on the value of the k-str metric, and are also rather sensitive to the free parameters of the model. Unlike the other physicochemical studies where the yukawa has always been compared with the yukawa yukawa, our results do not strongly depend on the precise localization pattern of the fermionic bulk fields. The tree-level changes in our model were studied in the previous work in Xcite . I have therefore introduced, in a completely general way, the kk decomposition of gauge fields in a covariant @xmath20 gauge within the matrix of mass eigenstates, by constructing precise solutions to the masses equations of motion, augmented with the appropriate boundary conditions. By extending the low energy spectrum and the gauge coefficients in powers of @xmath43 we have developed analytic formulas that allow not only a numerical treatment, but also a transparent and explicit understanding of the model. Besides, this analysis of the interstices between the gauge fields and the matter has been performed in the same formalism and involves the mixture of fermionic fields between different representations and generations in a completely general way. We have shown that our approach is not only more elegant, but also offers some distinctive advantages over the perturbation of the interstices to the substellar sector. If the gauge-mantle corrections to the yu xmath3 couplings are invoked, we have pointed out all terms that are void of custodial protection and identified them with the irreducible sources of yu xmath3 symmetry breaking derived from the different boundary conditions of the untwisted and the twisted yu xmath3 symmetry breaking arising from the different alternating symmetry of the untwisted and the twisted gauge-mantle profiles on the uv brane. In the case of the bending-current /sent> process, we have shown that the symmetry of yu is explicitly broken by the mass of the yu xmath61 parameter, the singlet fields of which are odd if their values differ from the ones of their yu xmath61 counterparts. We have thus interpreted the results in physical terms in all dimensions. And the distorted current /sent> mechanism of the pskin – takeuchi parameter and the left-hand – yuan fields of the quarks . . . We have at last returned to the problem of the misalignment of fermion zero-mode masses and yukawa couplings, and compared our own analyses of the structure of the flavor-changed higgs-bosons to the case of the rs case with custodial protection. a detailed analysis of the constraints imposed by the precision measurements of the bottom-quartile pseudoobservables facilitated our phenomenological investigation. We have proved, in contrast to the minimal case, that the prediction for the correction of the @xmath205 vertex in the rs model with extended @xmath3 symmetry is substantially independent of the left-quartile bulk-mass parameter of the third-generation quarks. This feature significantly extends the bounds resulting from the precision measurements of the left-quartile mass parameter of the third-quartile quarks, and there is a strong motivation to protect the latter vertex by a proper embedding of the bottom quarks. Moreover, we have noted that irrespective of the scale of the bulk gauge and excluding an unnaturally large quantity of the bulk-mass parameter , there is no reason to interfere with the custodial protection in this case. The fact that the right-hand side quark is the quark of the highest order, it is necessary to obtain the proper mass and the right-hand side quark . . . so that the normal mass of the booby is in the range of a factor of 0 tev (which is naturally expected in models with a brane-localized mass) leads to a good agreement between theory and data. A direct explanation of the anomalous forward-backward asymmetry of the bottom quarks is therefore particularly difficult in a warped extra-dimension model, in which the left-hand side quark is in the same multiplet . . . a general theory of the anomalous forward-backward asymmetry of the bottom quarks seems, therefore, to be extraordinarily challenging in warped extra-dimension models in which the left-hand side and the top quark are in the same quadrant. Yet a heavy higgs boson would need to be adjusted in the control of custodial symmetry, since the shifts of @ xmath439 in the parameters @ xmath165 and xmath1 are not compensated by rs tree levels, and so the slightest corrections to the oblique loop would need to be made in order not to spoil the global electroweak balance. In the first place, the experimental prospects for observing xmath440 and xmath441 are much more favorable in the extended than in the light-modes spheres. In the second place, the cross-section and branching fractions of the higgs boson completed our phenomenological investigations. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we have performed the first complete calculation of all higgs boson production and decay channels relevant to hadron colliders, incorporating all effects related to the extended electroweak-gauge boson and fermion sector. As for the main higgs boson production modes at the tevatron and the lhc, we proceeded with the upstream and downstream units of @ xmath442 and @ xmath443 respectively. In particular, for the lower mass of the kk gauge a boson mass below xmath442 can be accounted for by the lhc. We find that they are all suppressed in the custodial rs model relative to the sm. The analytical and numerical results obtained in this article are presented in accordance with the scientific and mathematical results of the article. As the fluctuations in the production cross-section are high in relation to the combined experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the reduction of the higgs events predicted in the rs model may be observed at the lhc. The possible enhancement of the branching ratio for xmath228 may however lead to a higher statistical significance and a faster lhc discovery of the higgs boson, if the mass is below xmath280. In addition, the reduced xmath228 production cross-section makes the observation of the higgs boson with a mass above the xmath444 threshold by means of the golden channel' - the atom-chariot channel - more difficult for the eye, because the xmath448 branching fraction remains essential sm, as in the custodial rs model. “We have given the very best thanks to a. azatov, m. toharia, and l. zhu for advice on flavor-changing molecules in the common room. a detailed phenomenological study of the potential new physics effects in neutral–meson mixing and rare decays of kaons and xmath445 mesons, which includes inclusive and exclusive processes, is to be included in the future.
