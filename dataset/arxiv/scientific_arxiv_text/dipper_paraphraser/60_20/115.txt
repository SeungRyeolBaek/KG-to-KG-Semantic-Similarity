The main point of this study is the basis for the study of the limits of write-limited memory. In our opinion, we have come to the conclusion that the storage of write-limited memory is enhanced by the multiple rewritings and the rewriting of a lock and key system. Using these two mechanisms we will discuss the limits of the type of rewriting and the costs of rewriting. We will presently consider the following methods: - the biggest number of rewrites between two erases. - The number of erases is increased by the state of the block, the value of the charge of all cells; - the length of time and energy consumed by the memory system will reduce . this is so that it is necessary to design efficient rewriting schemes that maximize the number of rewrites between two erases. the last method is to erase the whole block (i.e., to set the charge of all cells to zero) and reprogram each cell. In Xcite, the authors consider a model of the bead-once memory (wrap) . an asymptotically optimal modulation code, which is universal over an arbitrary, i. d. input distribution, is analyzed in section [Section ]. The theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that this is a much better algorithm than other asymptotically optimal modulation codes. The paper is concluded in section . . . . an asymptotically optimal modulation code, which is universal over an arbitrary i. d. input distribution, is analyzed in section [Section ] . . . the retention efficiency of this asymptotically optimal modulation code is analyzed in section [Section ] . the storage efficiency of this asymptotically optimal modulation code is also analyzed in section . . . an enlarged modulation code is also analyzed in section [Section ] . . the paper is concluded in section [Section ] . . . . but we will concentrate on modulation, and will not be interested in the noise and the design of ecc for the moment. In the past, the practical systems were relying on the error-correcting codes (eccs) as outer codes, and the modulation codes as inner ones. " The process of erasing a block is such that it will cause a complete and utter loss of that block . . . Although the programmer knows the state of a cell, it will learn the current state of the cell. As the level of the cell can only be increased during the erasure of a block, there will always be a need for erasing the whole block. The text of a block consists of a single cell at the time of writing. - in a more abstract way, we call the variable at time of writing a cell at xmath8 an integer modulo at xmath6 (that is, we call the integer modulo at xmath6 the set of integers modulo modulo at xmath6) (the encoder of a block increases some of the levels by a factor of two, as the current level and the new value of the quota modulo) remind us that only in the rewriting can the levels be increased. Moreover, although writing, reading, and erasing can also introduce noise into the memory, we disregard this and assume that all writes, readings, and erasings are noise-free. We permit the maximum number of block-erasures to be xmath10 and assume that after xmath10 block-erasures the device becomes unreliable. In the past, in modulation codes for flash memory, a certain amount of information is stored for each rewrite, and a certain number of rewrites for each erasure. This is equivalent to maximizing the average (at the level of the variable distribution of the cell) of information stored per rewrite, and a certain number of rewrites is expected, so we call the number of rewrites "superior". In the previous work, e.g., Xcite, Xcite, Xcite, Xcite, the duration of the memory, as a rule, is optimized, and the time elapsed, is preserved. Hence, the authors in Xcite have considered the worst case number of rewrites, and the authors in Xcite consider the average number of rewrites. In this paper, we have taken the last approach, determining the number of rewrites for each rewrite, and maximizing the number of rewrites for each erasment. We shall call this 'sequence efficiency'. As 'example' is defined in the 'example', it is defined as the average number of rewrites, and as 'extend' is defined as the number of erasures in the lifetime of a flash memory. In other work, e.g., @xcite, the number of rewrites for each erasment is set at the worst, and the authors of 'Xcite' consider the average number of rewrites. . . . . . ” means that the maximum charge level of the input variable is, as a rule, i. i. d. as a rule, the -middle- bound of the "dialog i" is a linear arithmetic, that is, when the input variable is uniformly distributed over -math39, each rewrite stores -math40 bits of information. . . . So the problem - xmath45 is equivalent to the following problem, - xmath42k  log  2 l , which is a clocked bounded ct by -math36k, where math36k is the number of rewrites between the -math40-th and the -math18-th erasures. note that the upper bound in (eq: total _information_ ub) is obtained by an equal distribution of the input variables, i.e., if the input is uniformly distributed over -math39, each rewrite stores in -math40 bits of information. And the exact time of a decomposition is defined by the i . i . d . , which is the root of the mixed expression, is an error in the distribution. This error is expressed in the expression: The time when the erasure of a decomposition is required is defined by the i . i . d. to the max (f, g, int)  int  left (n  t  right), the expression follows, as follows: The estimation of a block-erasing must take place when the maximum allowed value of a cell is reached. So the problem (eq: Opt2  ) can be expressed as: The Optimization Problem (Eq: Opt2) becomes the following Optimization Problem (Eq: Opt2): Thus, by the assumption that the input is i . i . d. over all the (at xmath5), the indices, it is easy to see that Xmath52 = ne  left [ t  right] , [ d  x     max  f, g  in  mathcal  q   int  q   q   int     q                   x  mbox  d    x  mbox  d  x , we can see that there is only one xmath4 – cell per block . that is analyzed by xcite . if the data set is only a single variable that has been changed once, the average amount of information per cell can be bounded by xmath72 because there are quite a few xmath72 possible new values. So the optimality is not determined solely by xmath7, but also by xmath70 when xmath7 and xmath70 are large, it is more logical to consider the worst case performance . Nevertheless, we will also consider a load-balancing approach to improve the performance of practical systems when xmath0 is large. In this case, the error rate of an xmath4 cell is xmath72. As a result, it can be shown that xmath77 for fixed xmath4 cells is only one xmath4 cell per block. if the number of rewrites is equal to xmath74, it will be possible to derive from math74 some new values , so that the optimality measure is not only determined by math7, but also by math70. so that the optimality measure is not only determined by math7, but also by math70 , it is more sensible to consider the worst case performance, while math70 is larger than math70 , it is better to consider the average. oh80 for the first case and oh79 for the second. oh79 oh78 for the first case, and oh79 for the second. Therefore, in the remainder of this paper, we assume an arbitrary change in the number of rewrites and the number of xmath71, i.e., the whole block is used as a cell for xmath71 oh, to increase the efficiency of oh. this rewriting method can be seen as an extension of the one in oh-m-m-m-m-m-m-m. - 191>.

The code for the rewriting of the cells is as follows: The 'self-rewn' code achieves at least @xmath101 rewrites, with a high probability, as @xmath102 for any arbitrary [xmath103] and i ... i ... d. ' The 'self-rewn' code achieves at least @xmath101 rewrites with high probability, as @xmath102 for arbitrary @xmath103 and i ... i ... d. ' There is a self-repeated modulation code which takes into account the values of the variables at each value, and it also creates an xmath5 variable for each value, as the difference in the coefficients of the xmath5 variable is rounded to the nearest one. The deterministic term xmath105 is known to both the encoder and the decoder so that the encoder is able to produce xmath105 uniform cell indices, and the decoder knows the accumulated value of xmath105, he can subtract it, and recover the data correctly . Note that the random term xmath105 is a deterministic term, which makes xmath100 look random in time, in the sense that there are equally many terms for each value. Moreover, xmath105 is known to both the encoder and the decoder, so that the encoder can generate xmath103 uniform indices, and the decoder knows the accumulated value of xmath105, it can subtract it, and recover the data correctly . He goes on to observe that the optimality of the self-randomized modulation codes is akin to the weak robust modulation codes presented in the xcite code. By comparing the number of cells in the xcite code with the number of possible messages in the xcite code, the number of cells in the xcite code is not nearly enough for the asymptotically optimal modulation codes. In this sense, the extra cell allows the possibility of asymptotically optimising the mapping between the value of the message and the cell index over time. Here, we are first analysing the efficiency of the self-randomized modulation codes when the xcite code is not sufficiently large, and then we propose an enriched algorithm, which improves the rewriting process in a significant way. Observe that the optimality of the self-optimised modulation codes (e.g., the codes in xcite, xcite, xcite, and the self-optimised modulation codes described in the next section (sec. 2, another rewriting algorithm)) consists in a requirement for xmath1, while the asymptotically optimal modulation codes (e.g., those in xcite, xcite, xcite, and the modulation codes described in section (additional section on another rewriting algorithm) are predestined to be asymptotically optimal , compared to the number of cells, xmath4, xmath0 is not quite large enough for asymptotical optimality to be sufficient. Moreover, the different asymptotically optimal codes can be misinterpreted in this case. (a) To define the magnitude of balls in a bin , what is the maximum magnitude of the total mass of balls in a bin? Taking the results of the equation 1, we can now go back to the ball-in-a-bin approach, and thereby arrive at the following theorem: if the bin xmath129 is loaded with @ xmath132 balls, @ xmath133, @ xmath134, with high probability (@ xmath135 ) as _______ (@ xmath138) , the bin Xmath140 has balls, @ xmath139, @ xmath140, with high probability (@ xmath131), as @ xmath145, _______________, which ___________ : ________________________________________ [1] , the maximum number of balls in a basket is @ xmath130, and : if xmath131 the maximally loaded basket has @ xmath132 balls, @ xmath133, @ xmath134, with high probability (@ xmath131) as @ xmath136, and at high probability (@ xmath136) as @ xmath136 , if xmath142, the maximally loaded basket has @ xmath143, @ xmath144, @ xmath145 and @ xmath The results of the equation 1 of xcite are different from those of the equation —the random loading —because the random loading — holds with probability at xmath168; while theorem —the random loading — holds with probability (at xmath168). . . . Note that theorem —the random loading — does not show the upper bound on the maximum load at xmath130. note that the number of cells of a cell in question is usually large and that it is not large enough in practice. Hence, it follows that, when xmath0 is not large enough, the optimality is not achievable. Thus, instead of assuming a large number, we shall assume a smaller number, Xmath0. The asymptotic optimality is achieved by reducing the number of cells of a cell by one and ensuring that all the cells of a cell are fully utilized when the erasure is performed. He did not give any example of how to get that balance of balls at the point where, say, the number of balls in the box, the total number of balls thrown in it, the number of balls, the square root of the square root of the square root, he was able to solve for square root xmath182 , it was the constant @ xmath180 , it is the constant @ xmath178, and it is the same for square root xmath180 , if square root xmath178 is the optimum value of square root xmath180, so the traps are of square root xmath185, if square root xmath184 , you see, are of square root xmath182 , the idea is, let’s suppose, that, given the given bar, we obtain the bar xmath198, where @ xmath198 is the universal constant. With the result in the law of gamma - this is a theory - the property is that when the bar is of square root xmath198 the maximum number of balls in any given box satisfies @ xmath195, and @ xmath196 is an independent variable, so that the bar xmath198 is of square root xmath198 - in which case the bar xmath198 is an independent constant, and by definition the bar xmath198 - by definition the bar xmath198 - and the bar xmath198 when the bar is larger than @ xmath193 , in which case the bar xmath198 is an independent variable, the bar xmat " Xcite. Theorem 1 in Xcite gives the general answer when we take the two random choices of xmath., we are especially interested in binary variables with two random choices or xmath209. - and in general - in a given binary variable with two random choices, or xmath210. in detail, the strategy is, that each time we pick two bins, uniformly and randomly, and throw a ball into the less-loaded bin - in this way the super-loaded bin has roughly xmath204 balls of high probability . The information loss allows us to write the same value - this makes it easy to avoid sequences of writes that increase one cell level too much. - Theorem 1 in xcite gives us the general answer when we look at xmath204 random choices. Fortunately, when xmath204 is greater than xmath201, the maximal load can be reduced by a factor of about xmath201 by using the power of two random choices - the value of xmath204 is called 'power of two random choices' - . . . if @xmath26 and @xmath91 are, then the encoding algorithm will be the same as the random loading algorithm with a random selection of the elements. . . . if @xmath27 and @xmath91 be, then the first arbitrary value will be a ‘Little Eight’. . . . Note that the state vector of cell @xmath85 has been initialized to @xmath229, and therefore @xmath87. . . . . . Step 1: read the cell state @xmath27 and decode it to @xmath221 and @xmath96 . . . Step 3: calculate @xmath218 and @xmath219 . . . step 4: calculate @xmath227 . . . The encoding of the above method is identical to the random loading of the ball on an arbitrary threshold. . . . If xmath227 and xmath237 are different, then the affine permutation of xmath235 with probability 1 - xmath228 is . . . “If the values are “xmath” and “xmath” , they are “xmath”247 . . . thus, for the purposes of the comparison, let’s add ‘xmath249’ for both codes. . . . as if @ xmath177 were the highest value, @ xmath242; the probability of @ xmath168 would be “xmath168” . . . so the product of the loading and disabling codes are a better unit than the self-adjusted unit. . . . “Thus the real numbers, the real numbers, and the like can be computed with an infinite number of cells. [226] and so on. In this state the self-adjusted unit is no better than the self-adjusted unit by utilizing twice as many cells. We present in this section the simulation results of the modulation codes referred to in s. . . [24] If xmath177 and xmath0 are constants independent of xmath4, then the efficiency of the self-adjusted unit is @xmath249 for the self-adjusted unit, and @xmath249 for the load-adjusted unit. So if xmath177 is higher than xmath174, the maximal energy is @ xmath174. At xmath254 we find that the self-randomized modulation has the same xmath254 as random modulation with one random choice and the load-balancing modulation has the same xmath254 as random modulation with two random choices.
