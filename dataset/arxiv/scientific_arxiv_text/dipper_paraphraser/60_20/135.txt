Basically, astronomical measurements are performed by electromagnetic waves . . . because the propagation of photons and gravitons may be different in fundamental ways, gravitational waves that have come from cosmologically distant – – space time, like coalescing pairs of massive black holes, could serve as valuable new probes of physics at the cosmological scales. Therefore, the current generation of accurate gravitational waves within the next decade or so would be an important development for astronomy. In particular, since the propagation of photons and gravitons may be different at the fundamental level, gravitational waves emitted by cosmologically distant – space time sirens, such as coalescing pairs of massive black holes, may serve as valuable new probes of physics on the cosmological scale. black holes with masses @ xmath0 are present in numerous nearby galaxies (e.g. ? ? ? ? ... Fig. 1, in which lisa s orbit corresponds to a single-phase angular plot.  5  3  f   2  d  l   d  l    propto  left  [ 5  f   11  ,   end  positioned   ]   5  3  f   2    d  d  l      dot f  d l   ,   propto     propto &  propto &   m  c  right    5  3  f   2                             , It's possible to translate the precise luminosity distance measurement to a cosmology. The same localization which makes the distance to a source accurately can be used to find the host galaxy of a pair of merging black holes seen by lisa. This allows very accurate measurements, e.g., distances with errors @ xmath12 at xmath12 , typically @ xcite , masses are independently determined to very high accuracy (usually @ xmath12 , e.g., @ xcite ) to the host galaxy of a pair of merging black holes seen by lisa . At first, it was considered unfavourable to find the host galaxy of a pair of merging black holes because of the large number of candidates in the lisa sky error box (e.g., *? ; * ? ; ? ; ? There are various ways in which this conversion of redshifts is carried out. The figures indicated herein are representative of the binary universe based on the redshift of the gw source . . . [ fig. 2] for a representative binary of equal mass, as a function of the gw source redshift . . . but it would probably be more advantageous to use a pre-merger technique to locate such a statistically rare object after the merger. The newly-merged pair of black holes would make it a good host galaxy for the newly-combined pair of black holes. [ fig. 2] [10] for a representative equal-mass binary, in terms of the Gw source redshift . . . in which most black hole sources will be found, the weak optics, resulting from the uneven average cosmology, are the main constraints in the determination of the redshift in which the host galaxy should be located. It is possible, by using this precise and precise data on the localization of the sky, together with the accurate timing of the excitation, to determine before long where in the sky the merger is located. This could lead to a distinctive signature and permit the identification of a unique host galaxy. In fact, this could be achieved by combining precise gw information with accurate timing of the merger to predetermine before long where the merger is to be found. One could, for example, recognize the host galaxy of a pair of coalescing black holes seen by lisa. , a variety of mechanisms exist by which disturbed gas in the vicinity of black holes and its environment provide an electromagnetic pulse, with typical recoil velocities of xmath16 km/s. The order of the gw signal to the sky is related to the light wave modulating from the detector's revolution and change of orientation when the constellation orbits around the sun (fig.) . because of significant cross-correlations between gw signal and distance errors, it turns out that this argument is largely valid for gw distance errors at xcite. Moreover, in the case of a black hole, the errors on the angular scale have been shown to be quite high, and there is a significant delay in their development. Figure 3 shows the pre- merger time evolution of gw and angular sky localization errors for a representative black hole pair. Figure 3 shows the observable time evolution of the angular localization and angular sky localization errors for a representative black hole pair. I will show you that the numbers of these binaries will be as small as their total mass and redshift. In addition, the wide-field of view, which will be acquired by lisa by astrophysical astronomical instruments for weak gleaming and supernova studies, will make it interesting to estimate the time before the lisa spotting overlaps the fov of that instrument. When this happens, it is possible to monitor the areas which are in the path of co-consolidation systematically until the final coalescence. This possibility would result in significant improvements on the errors during the last days and hours before the coalescence. With the expected availability of astronomical astronomical instruments for weak gleaming and supernova studies, it would be interesting to see how long the lisa sky localization remains in the fov of this instrument . . . Figure four shows the plots of representative equal-mass binaries as a function of their total mass and redshift. There are, finally, several possibilities to which we refer for our reader’s interest, and we therefore refer the interested reader to Xcite and Xcite for further discussions. From the black hole masses, spins and binary orientation, all accurately computed by the gw signal, we could study the physics of the extinguishing accretion on the remnant black hole xcite with unprecedented accuracy . . . the eddington ratio of the extinguishing source, the extinguishing and the absorption geometry, and perhaps the jet phenomenology. Finally, by measuring the dispersion between various host galaxies, together with the black hole masses, which we know from the gw signal, we could essentially map the evolution of the xmath24 relationship with cosmic time, at least for such transitional objects as the host galaxies of extinguished black hole pairs. Thus, by studying the galactic host, we can learn about the nature (dry and wet) and the timing of the galactic merger that resulted in the extinguishing of the black hole binary combination . . . ... One of the main interests of a gravitational swarm is the exclusion of the usual determinants of electromagnetic measurements. A gravitational swarm, which is based on gravitational distance measurements with self-calibrated sources, is not subject to any substantial bias from absorption, scattering, and reddening of gws. Moreover, a gravitational swarm is not susceptible to any significant bias from absorption, scattering, and reddening of gws. The value of such a swarm is, however, limited by line-of-sight inhomogeneities, which result in the weak lensing uncertainties of gravitational swarm measurements (see fig.). Nevertheless, the value of such a swarm is limited by line-of-sight inhomogeneities, which result in weak slanting uncertainties on the gravitational swarm measurement (see fig.2). Thus the extent to which lisa events can be used to draw a meaningful Hubble diagram is, therefore, strongly dependent on the actual distribution of massive black hole mergers at redshifts, and on the identification efficiency of host galaxy identifications. The possibility that the accelerated expansion of the universe is the result of a failure of general relativity has been the subject of much theoretical research during the past few years. . . . Since building a satisfactory theory of relativistic gravity is a formidable task, any insights gained by direct observation of the linearized gw regime are not to be omitted. - ; - . - lisa, with its ability to measure the gw signal from cosmologically distant sources, is perhaps a suitable source for precise cosmology. a relativity is introduced for the increase of the universe, and the normal sphere. It is possible that with the extreme sinking of the gravity in dgp-like circumstances, distant gw sources appear dimmer than they really are, from the loss of gw energy flux to the extra-dimensional bulk. This dimension is well defined by dgp gravity, a braneworld model with an infinite extra dimension . . . our best probes of altered gravity on cosmological scales . . . the best probes of the altered gravity on cosmological scales . . . if you consider that, in the presence of enormous gw leakage, the gw amplitude scales with the distance @ xmath32 from the source, which is equal to @ xmath33, where @ xmath34 is the total number of space-time dimensions that can be occupied by gravity . . . this is indisputable for @ xmath35. It can also be observed that the phase of the gw signal deviates from the general relativistic expectations over cosmological distances . . . In this respect, the possibility to time the gw relative to an electromagnetic signal underlying a black hole merger, can thus provide unique diagnostics of large-scale altered gravity. This is only one of several possible gw spectra in the gws of cosmologically distant sources . . . xcite . The availability of this spectra for measuring the arrival times of photons and gravitons from the same cosmological source. The host galaxies, by contrast to the purely electromagnetic spectra, are not subject to this recurrence. Another class of gw spectra, by contrast with the two transverse quadrupolar (@xmath7 ) modes of general relativity, can give unique diagnostics of large-scale recurrence. By way of comparison, it may be possible to match the energy spectrums of the electromagnetic and gravitational signals at the source. It would be easier to calculate the ratio between the excitations of the gravitational and electromagnetic signals.  For instance, it is possible to calculate the proportions of the electromagnetic and gravitational signals. This may be overcome by knowing the time and frequency of the cosmic and gravitational signals. before the formation of the black hole, the gas which is present in the vicinity of the black hole will be gravitationally perturbed in such a way that it will emit a variable electromagnetic signal of the same period as the leading-order quadrupolar perturbation that is emitted by the coalescing binary (see fig.5 ) . this would help in defining the electromagnetic counterparts of certain Gw events. . . . the events that are reported in Fig. 5 are illustrated in Fig. 5 with respect to a great deal of detail. For example, if the graviton is a huge one, resulting in a measurable velocity (e.g., . . . ? ? ? . . ) , this splintering effect is illustrated graphically in Fig. 5 . interestingly, while lorentz invariance has been extensively tested in the ordinary models, lorentz symmetry in the gravity sector could be violated, especially in the cosmological dimension (e.g., ? ? ? ? ? ? , ? ? , ? ? ; ? ? ? ? , ? ? , ? ; ? ? . The consistency demanded if lorentz symmetry is satisfied in the gravity sector can be directly tested on cosmological scales. To have any chance to perform such new experiments of gravitational physics, one must firstly identify the electromagnetic counterparts of the combined pairings of massive black hole binaries —this may be one of the strongest motivations for ambitious efforts to localize rare and transient events before their final separation. as before, a great many sources are required to turn the gravitational diagram into a high-precision tool for cosmology. The aim of the lisa mission is to detect gws emitted by compact objects captured by massive black holes (a so-called emris), thereby giving rise to the gws emitted by these compact objects (the so-called extreme mass ratio inspirals, or emris) . Moreover, these authors have shown that the sky localization errors for these events (@ xmath37 steradians at xmath37 ) are high, and that the steradians at xmath37 The overall object is a white dwarf, very low density. This type of dwarf suffers from complete encirclement around a non-spinning black hole, of mass in the order of xmath39. Alternatively, partial (or complete) breakdowns of the lower density outer layers (e.g., ? ? ? ? ) are comparable to the event of the binary mergers of black holes. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of finding the electromagnetic counterparts of this subclass of lisa emris and using them for precision cosmology has not been discussed in the literature. Among the low density white dwarfs (wds), some level of partial (or total) shedding of the outer layers (e.g., ? ? ? ) can be expected in such an emris. All these arguments point to the possibility that electromagnetic counterparts may exist for a subset of all lisa’s emris (the one corresponding to the wd inspirals) . . . just as black hole binary mergers may be carried out by emris with unique counterparts and host galaxies, so that a gravitational hubble diagram can be drawn with the advantage that, at redshifts as low as xmath41 xmath42, any weak lensing due to line-of-sight inhomogeneities would be negligible or negligible (fig. . . . and that the xmath2 xmath9 trine relation at xmath43 is pronounced strongly sensitive to the dominant dark energy. a tidally triggered detonation of the wd is yet another possibility @ xcite. - I can see how - as I pointed out by @xcite - if cosmic microwave background anisotropies are measured by planck, then at xmath4 the sensitivity of Xmath4 is precisely known, and the low redshift (@xmath45) of the measurement provides the best means of establishing dark energy parameters. Direct gravitational measurements, gravitational jargon, and comparisons between the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational signals provide fundamentally new ways to examine physics at cosmological scales. However, the various advantages that we have already outlined point to the need for a thorough investigation of the potential use of wd emris for precision cosmology with lisa. It remains to be decided how the lisa sky localization error becomes more frequent in the pre- merger or pre-disruption period and what electromagnetic counterparts exist . . . for a detailed account. . . .
