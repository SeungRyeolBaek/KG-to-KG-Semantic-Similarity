A relatively small non-gaussian fraction @xcite has been observed recently and will be well known by the Sérieplanck Surveyor Satellite . . . in the future, as observable data become more and more plentiful, it is necessary to understand the non-gaussian component expected in a broad range of models and to predict how early physics may be arrived at by a rapid detecting of non-gaussian fractions. In this paper, we present a novel method for determining the genesis of the substratum from the superhorizon of the xmath1 subspace, by a mathematical equation of the kinetic function and the slow roll approximation . in the short run, we make an ordinary differential equation which produces the moments of this distribution. It is for this reason that we can predict the time of the abyss and the skewness. The method is based on the real space distribution of the inflationary field, on a flat surface. It is a probability density function whose growth is determined by a form of the fractureless Bolzmann equation . We apply an ordinary differential equation, which produces ordinary moments of the distribution. These moments are related to observable quantities, such as the dimensionless bispectrum measure of the x-math1 data. The paper is based on the actual space distribution of the inflationary field, on a flat surface, and is thought of as a density function, whose evolution is governed by a form of the collisionless Bolzmann equation . The traditional method of estimation of the super-horizon value of the field, has already been tried and found by many methods, but the one we are discussing has some advantages . A second advantage of our method is that it requires the solution of a number of differential equations, which are, as we shall see later, polynomial (or in some cases, even linear) with the number of fields. Thus the background equations must be solved to a great extent, since any small error has a great deal of room to propagate. In the future, it seems clear that calculations of complex models with many fields will increasingly rely on numerical methods. This formalism has been known for some time, particularly in the context of the xmath0 framework, but only for very specific selections of the potential xcite or of the hubble rate xcite . This formalism is dependent on a numerical integration algorithm that is very efficient, for finite differences must be extracted between perturbatively different initial conditions after xmath3 e—five stages of evolution . . . our method requires the solution of a number of differential equations that scales polynomially (or perhaps even linearly) with the number of fields, it does not rely on finite differences and therefore is much less susceptible to numerical noise . a third advantage, which we hope to revisit in a later publication, is that our formalism yields explicit evolution equations with source terms . . . This section introduces our new method of computing the non-gaussian parameter xmath1 , that is, the formula for the curvature perturbation, xmath2 in terms of the values of field values on a spatially flat surface; expressions for the derivatives of the number of e-folds, xmath6, as a function of the values of field values at the horizon-end; and a prescription for the transformation of the field distribution from horizon-end to the time when we require the statistical properties of xmath2 , the last two ingredients are given in eqs. in sys-sep-world we study the basic equations of the point functions of the inflaton field. We therefore present the results of our method to xmath1 in a few two-field models, and find good agreement between the methods. In this section we introduce our new method of computing the non-gaussian parameter xmath1 . this method needs three main ingredients: a curve perturbation formula xmath2 in terms of the field values on a flat surface; a number of equations for the derivatives of the number of e-folds, xmath6, which is a function of the field values at the end of the sphere - e and - at the end of the sphere - and , which are found at the end of the [ss - - universe] and s - inverse [ss - n] . rigopoulos, shellard and van tent (@xcite) worked with a gradient expansion, rewriting the equations of the field in the langevin form. The noise term was used as a proxy for the initial conditions at the boundary of the horizon. Next we introduce a collection of spacetime volumes whose mutual scattering will dominate the mire background anisotropy on a given scale. a precise prediction is a function of the paths followed by all the volumes in the collection, taken as a whole. Next, we introduce a collection of parallel spacetime volumes whose mutual scatter will dominate the microwave background anisotropy on a given scale. It is not possible to calculate the exact geometry of the flux between volumes; each volume follows a path, which we shall call its position in the future, at a certain precise moment. In its perturbative form, this method has been employed by lehners et renaux-petel to obtain numerical results. We mention in passing the expression "just one" in the meaning of "just one" in the form of the numerical example referred to above. It is the proper property of a successful prediction that we need to consider the characteristics of a curve perturbation which an observer would measure. , ignoring spatial gradients, each volume will follow a trajectory in the field that is slightly displaced from its neighbors. The scatter between these paths is caused by initial conditions set at the horizon entry, which are governed by promoting the vacuum fluctuations to the classical perturbation. These initial conditions are determined by the initial conditions set at the exit, which are obtained by applying the vacuum fluctuation to classical perturbation. There are many variations of the curve, the most common being the strain caused by a dip in the superhorizon, whose radius is calculated in the form of e-flutters in the hypersurface. There are many such variations of the strain caused by a dip in the superhorizon, which by definition does not include any gaussian fluctuations, but only an uncanny converging phase, the excitation of which is covered in eqs. , there is, however, one particular converging phase which we will call the complete separate universe picture. The following is the relationship of our calculation to the conventional perturbation theory, as we formally differentiate it from eqs. although our calculation is formally perturbative, it is not necessarily equivalent to eq. , but in the event that all terms of the power series are preserved, they are formally equivalent. if our calculations are formally perturbative, however, they are not directly equivalent to eqs. with respect to xmath15 it is sometimes convenient to expand xmath15 by means of a power series in the value of a field, whose axis is called evf, whereas for xmath16 if eq. is used to evaluate the xmath12, we refer to the 'internal' picture. . . if the quantity @xmath26 is, as a rule, the number of e-folds between the initial slice and the final co-moving hypersurface, where @xmath27 identifies the types of light scalar fields. in fourier space, either prescription is automatically enforced after dropping disconnected contributions, again leading to eq. . . in the conventional approach,  @ xmath8 is taken to cover several e-folds, when our collection of spacetime volumes passes beyond the causal horizon. Here the coefficient @ xmath22 in eq. is the convention   . . and we proceed to . . . for the given, the example of maldacena, and later lyth & rodrguez @ xcite, are adopted as a definition of  . . in real space, the coefficient @ xmath22 is the value of the convention  . . more generally, it is based on the definition of  . . . in a fourier space the separation of the consecutive steps is enforced, again leading to eq . . . We will then deduce from xmath1 the appropriate gauge transformation between the values of xmath36 and xmath2 . and - it is therefore necessary to be aware of the relation of xmath36 and xmath2 in the form of eqs. . . the role of the @xmath0 formula, eqs., is to represent, and - only - the gauge transformation between xmath36 and xmath2 . Unfortunately, it also obscures the physics that determines xmath35 . and therefore it is hard to infer from eq. only those classes of models in which xmath35 is always large or small . - for this reason it is difficult to infer, from eq. alone, from all classes of models in which xmath35 is always large or small . in ... transport ... in  - derivative - n below, we will show how to develop the - equation of the field value between xmath3 and xmath3 , equator is a rational term , - should be allowed for - diagonal terms ... the idea of - is dynamically allowed ... After defining the elements of each part, we must find those elements of each part, and this relates to the numerics. Once the numerical form is in place, we can assign them to the respective parts of the element. The parameter 1 is a derivative of the function, a non-linearity derived from the non-linearity which arises by means of non-gaussian recurrences of the field fluctuations, and the 2 term is an integral of the non-linearity which can be obtained from the transformation of the gauge to 222, in this way it is possible to obtain the non-linearity parameter 1 . As a result, when we consider the indices of symbols such as 222 in numerical order, he will likewise apply the three-point function to the two-point function of 222, which decompositions into two contributions 12 and 22 and 2 are made, as we will see in the next section : . . . That is, it is, the simplest form of refs. xmath60 for our specific choice of a two-field model, where the integrals are evaluated on a single spatial hypersurface. in an xmath60 field model, one would get a set of numbers that correspond to the conserved number of vernizzi and wands for xmath60, where xmath55 and xmath56 are the field values evaluated on xmath56 and xmath53 respectively. in an xmath60 field model, one would get a set of numbers which are conserved in the xmath60 case with the conserved number of vernizzi and wands @ xcite. note that this is applicable to an arbitrary @ xmath59 which need not elongate with the sum or product of potentials for the individual species. @ xcite , for the specific choice of a two-field model, it is the form @ xmath62, where the integrals are tested on a single spatial hypersurface. @ xcite . it is not conserved for general potentials, but the variation can be ignored for infinitesimally separated hypersurfaces. ‘ ‘So that the first derivative of a coefficient is at least, in any case, a second derivative of the coefficient, as follows: ‘a- v-’  v-’ , 2  v-‘ , 12   v-‘ , 2   sin  4  theta –’ – ‘so that the second derivative of a coefficient can be obtained, and we obtain . ‘2         – ‘a-‘ – ‘a-‘ – ‘a-‘ – ‘a-‘ – ‘a-‘ ‘‘ – ‘ – ‘a-‘ – ‘a-‘ – ‘a-‘ – ‘a-‘ – ‘‘  – ‘a-‘ – ‘‘ – ‘      – ‘   –     ‘a-‘ – ‘b-‘ ‘– ‘a-‘ – ‘  – ‘b-‘ – ‘   – ‘b-‘ – ‘‘ – ‘‘    cos –  2 – ‘theta –’ – ‘ ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ – ‘w’ — xmath77 , we seek a distribution with centroid @ xmath79, variance @ xmath80, and thus define the third moment @ xmath76. remember that we are working in real space, with a collection of volumes of a somewhat different expansion history, and the variation in these histories determines the microwave background anisotropy. In the case of the one-field system, there are not many remarkable features but they have been recurrent in this one-field system. It has the subtle difference between the statistical mean and the background field field, and the hierarchy of the moment evolution equations. The structure of the moment evolution equations is very similar to that of the two-field case. Among these features are the subtle difference between the motion of the statistical mean and the background field value, and the hierarchy of the moment evolution equations. In the language of probability this is the skewness, which we call Xmath8 . We have set out to find a distribution with centroid @ xmath79, variance @ xmath80, and so on. Moreover, the structure of the moment mixing equations is similar to that of the two-field case. We take the first-order distribution of @ xmath79, the second-order distribution of @ xmath79 , and we are dealing with the corresponding coefficient of elasticity, the percentage of flow corresponding to xmath79, a statistical mean, a quantified value of the mean, and a hierarchy of moment evolution equations. in the language of probability, this is called skewness zero, and in the world inflation generally predicts that the skew is small. , it is a well-known function, and is known in many respects, and its application to cosmology is very similar to that of taylor and watts [249] , it is, however, a result of the best of methods. The density function given in eq. is well known and has been used in many respects. It is a solution to the problem of estimating a nearly Gaussian distribution whose moments are known. eq. is defined by the usual rule, and a probability density function has properties, which do not depend on the approximation that xmath42 is small. However, for large xmath42 the density function becomes negative for some values of xmath77. Thus, we do not fear whether xmath78 has an honest probability density function in the strict mathematical sense. Putietietietietie a series (eq. e) is in fact the first two terms of the gram charlier series, also sometimes called the hermite series. We have chosen to use the e-flipping time, the e-flipping time, which means that we are expanding the distribution of the field on hypersurfaces of uniform expansion. So, we do not assume that the velocity field is universally well-defined by a quadratic Taylor expansion, but that it is well-defined in the vicinity of the instantaneous centroid. in principle, this expansion can be done directly. It is also well known, from the study of starobinsky's diffusion equation, which is the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation, that the choice of time variable in this equation is significant, with different choices depending on the choice of a temporal gauge . Hence, we do not suppose that the velocity field is universally well-defined by a quadratic taylor expansion, but that it is well-defined in the vicinity of the instantaneous centroid. in principle, the answer to the equation is directly solvable , eq. can be solved directly. For example, from the study of starobinsky's diffusion equation, which forms the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation, we know that the choice of the time variable in this equation is significant, and that there are different choices depending on the choice of a temporal scale. if we are in a situation like xmath105, the wings of the density function will move faster than the center, so the velocity of the centroid will be larger than one might suppose, by restricting ourselves to xmath79. Moreover, the second term illustrates that the centroid is also influenced by the wings of the probability distribution as they probe the nearby velocity field. The influence of this is not captured by the background equation of motion. Moreover, the second term shows that the centroid is also influenced by the wings of the probability distribution, as the wings of the density function probe the nearby velocity field. Hence, by extending our pdf to the third minute, and our velocity field to quadratic, these effects are measured by the second term in . , the values of which correspond to infinitesimal transformations in the flow of xmath93. Therefore, when we expand our pdf to the third minute, and our velocity field to quadratic, we will see the results. In this case, when we expand our pdf to the third minute and our velocity field to quadratic, these results are to be measured. For this purpose, these terms account for the jacobians of the infinitesimal transformations induced by the flow of xmath93. . . . if the xmaths are fixed, the index will be expressed in the form of xmaths. . . . In this case, we assume that our equations can be generalized to any number of fields, we only conjecture that we have explicitly constructed them for a two-field system. To obtain the hierarchy of moments of development, we made use of the expansion we took in the article, and argued that orthogonality of the hermite polygon was not to be found in the single-field system. In the two-field system, we are presented with a two-dimensional velocity field @ xmath111, defined by @ xmath111, where we again use the number of e-folds @ xmath6 as the time variable . 10 ] before defining this explicitly, it is helpful to note the complication inherent in the equations . . . in this equation, @ xmath118 defines the center of the distribution, @ xmath119 defines the covariance between the fields . . . . In the example, the index of @ xmath110 is at xmath114. . . . . , we then define the non-gaussian factor, which encodes the skewness, and, to be, @xmath133, in these variables, we find @xmath134. . . . and @xmath132. In order to eq. be useful, it is necessary to express the skewness associated with the physical variables of @xmath137 in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath127 . . . if desired, the expansion can be advanced to the higher order. Next, we have the moment hierarchy, which governs the evolution of the moment of @xmath118, @xmath140, @xmath121 and @xmath40. The relations of @xmath139 to the moments of @xmath118 are time dependent, but for clarity we will usually suppress this in our notation. . . . We define the rank ‘@xmath148’ of each coefficient ‘across’ @xmath148 . We define the rank ‘A’ of each coefficient ‘across’ @xmath148 by ‘across’ . This is because the total probability is systematically conserved as the distribution evolves. We end the eq. expansion by putting higher terms in the eq. expansion and this results in non-zero coefficients for the first five seconds. We deduce the moment hierarchy . . . and then we define the rank ‘A’ of each coefficient ‘across’ by ‘across’. These equations are written in the form ‘across’ . . . but if they are written as covariant covariants, they can be expressed in a surprisingly compact form. One useful feature of the eq. expansion is that the rank ‘A’ coefficients give evolution equations for the first three seconds . . . the first term ‘across’ reflects the non-variable motion of the centroid , which is coincident with the background velocity field of eq. . the second term explains how the wings of the probability distribution sample the velocity field at adjacent points . . . We also study two models of the distribution of the non-gaussian signal, which are already known in the standard form of xmath0 , in which we study the ratio xmath127. , the ratio xmath127 refers to the direction of the velocity field, the span of xmath126 , the path of xmath125 , a second point describes the first origin of the non-gaussianity of the lines of the probability distribution, a sensitivity to the wings of the probability distribution, in a similar way to the term , the coefficient xmath130 is responsible for the ratio matrix xmath124. In this case, we show the new method, and compare it with results obtained with xmath0. Generally, all moments of the density function mix, so it is always necessary to stop the expansion at a predetermined order, in the cumulants and in the fluctuations of the density. the higher the ranks, the higher the evolution. In our case, the order is sufficient to generate evolution equations, containing both the first order behavior of the moments, that is, the first terms in equations, and the first corrections in these equations , for each case, we solve numerically. We introduce the basic equation of Xmath1 to a finite difference method and calculate the derivatives of Xmath6. As we have already shown in . . . ref. 102, we derive the initial conditions of Xmath166 from the initial conditions of ref. 102 and the fiducial path has coordinates of Xmath168 and Xmath169. This equation clearly shows that the principle of moment transport separates the contributions to Xmath1 from the intrinsic non-gaussianity of the field fluctuations and the non-linearity of the gauge transformation to Xmath2 . in the double quadratic model, Xmath1 is always small . However, recent research has shown that in the double quadratic model Xmath1 is always small . It is remarkable that xmath1 initially grows in complete opposition to the gauge transformation to xmath2 , to which it is not obvious. It is shown in fig. 1 that the maximum is xmath166. . . . the peak is in fig.   . . . The present data contain interesting constraints on the coefficient of sway, and in the course of the next several years the survey satellite planck will make these requirements even more strict. We conclude that the coefficient of sway remains perfectly accurate throughout the entire evolution. In this study our aim was to propose a new method for the analysis of non-linearity. Here we are comparing our new method with the outcome of the numerical equation of sway - which is defined by the principle of sway - which is defined by the principle of sway -. This conclusion applies equally to the other large-scale sway - which is described in ref. fig. . The figures fig. 1 and fig. 3 show excellent agreement between our new method and the outcome of the numerical equation of sway - we conclude that the slow - roll estimate remains broadly accurate throughout the entire evolution . This experiment is used to find in all the data the first order of skewness of swaying, and for a few years in the future we expect that the Planck survey of physics will become even more rigorous in these constraints. This Fig. 4 shows an excellent agreement between our new method and the outcome of the numerical equation of swaying. In this model the contribution of the second order of swaying, swaying, is overwhelmingly driven by the contribution of the second order of swaying, swaying, swaying, swaying, swaying , although we do not claim that this is a general phenomenon. - And thus the equations for lower-order moments are as renormalization group equations for the couplings at the level of xmath177, to resumming potentially large terms before they spoil the theory. Thus the equations for @xmath177 at a given point in the moment hierarchy are just the equations for renormalization group equations for the couplings at the level of xmath177, so that they reshape potentially large terms before they destroy the theory . this property is shared with any formalism such as xmath0 which is non-restrained in time evolution, but it may be an advantage over perturbative ones. we also note that although xmath0 is non-restrained as a point of principle, practical implementations are frequently irresponsible . . . the contribution from intrinsic non-resolutions of the field fluctuations, as measured by the skewnesses @ xmath40, is negligible. We also note that although xmath0 is non-reliable in time evolution, practical implementations are often irresponsible . . . the methods of Vernizzi et wands @ xcite and battefeld et wands @ xcite are limited to quantities conserved only to the leading order in @ xmath178, and may lose accuracy after xmath178 e-folds. In such cases, the formula for @ xmath1 is obtained by approximating the distribution of the field inverse to an exact gaussian.
