. . . if that is the case, the gravitational waves generated by smbh coalescence are a chief target for detection by the 'Leibnitzer space-absorption' (lisa, folkner et al. 1998, flanagan & hughes 1998, hughes et al. 2001) . if this is so, the gravitational waves (gws) generated by smbh coalescence are a main candidate for detection by the 'Leibnitzer space-absorption' (lisa, folkner et al. 1998; flanagan & hughes 1998; hughes et al. 2001) . . . . the early assembly of smbhs, in the context of a hierarchical cosmology, suggests that smbh coalescence is an frequent event. , with the present - smbh coalescence are - even by a density of xmath3 m xmath1 ( fan et al. 2001; fan et al. 2003) , quasars, that are detected at redshifts as high as xmath4 (fan et al. 2001; fan et al. 2003) are estimated at xmath5 m xmath1 (see e.g. shields et al. I’ll explain why. In the following sections I’ll explain how the lisa detection rate of smbh-related mergers is determined. Using the same, more intelligible, gw signals, we’ll examine the limits of the detection range (wyithe & loeb 2003) or have estimated the number of detectable events by comparing the sensitivity curve with the total gravitational wave background due to the coalescing bbhs (see snr) [19] and conclude with a conclivity of [23]. Previous estimates of the rate of smb-related occurrences have used characteristic, rather than time-dependent, gw signals to estimate the limit of detection (wyithe & loeb 2003) or have estimated the number of detectable events by comparing the sensitivity curve with the total gravitational wave background due to coalescing bbhs [20][19] [23] [24] . . . . ; whereas lisa estimates the rate of smb-related occurrence as a function of xmath6[24][26][26][27] and a primordial energy spectrum with slope of xmath[26][28][28][30][29][30][31][31], and have in this work a base_unit_[30] of smb-related powers, (i.e., of the primordial power spectrum, with slope of xmath[28][28] [28] [29][30] According to the numerical simulation of the bbh walk through the star field (due to the 3 - body interactions with stars), it becomes more and more apparent that the star’s angular momentum is low enough to pass near the bbh, resulting in a deficiency of stars that can draw energy from the binary system (see yu 2002). - The deceleration of the hardening rate is increased by the preferential depletion of stars in the loss cone (area of angular momentum - low enough for stars to pass near the bbh) , and thus, for the bbh, the star’s energy losses are reduced - yu (2002). - The integral energy loss decreases in turn, and the three-body interactions with stars, that pass within xmath20 of the bbh center of mass (the losavljevic c & merritt 2001) make more intense. Two-body systems relaxation is expected to put some stars back into the bbh (Boardard & Hernquist 1997; milosavljevic c & merritt 2001; It is possible to combine the gravitational wave-dominated portion of the bbh coalescence into three main phases. The dynamical aspect of the bbh coalescence can be divided into three main phases (Hahhes 2002). The bbh coalescence of the bbh can be divided into three main phases (Hahhes 2002) . the binary begins in the 'inspiral' phase, with the smbhs gradually spiralling into tight orbits, from which the energy of the bbh is lost. The bbh becomes relativistic, and the bbhs violently tumble into a single object (Fleet). The snr for the matched filter detection (Fleet) is the ratio of the coherently folded signal and the noise power: femu26 where femu26 is the fourier transform of the dimensionless strain, femu28 is the spectral power of the noise . the snr for a matched filter detection (Fleet) is defined by the ratio of the coherently folded signal and the noise power: femu26 where femu27 is the inverse of the dimensionless strain, femu28 is the spectral power of the noise . , the equilibrium of the binary is disposed to a collision kerr . With a cosmological redshift of the source, this frequency is directly related to the measured frequency (@ xmath43) . . . (Hacker et al. 2001) . . . as the orbital separation of the binary squints decreases, the amplitude and frequency of the inspiralling strain increase. As a general rule, @ xmath43 is required for a confident detection of a signal (hues et al. 2001) . . . the spiral energy spectrum can be derived from the quadrupole approximation of gravitational wave luminosity (fh98) @ xmath49, where xmath9 and xmath46 are the individual bbh masses corresponding to a reduced mass @ xmath47 and a total mass @ xmath48 . numerical simulations of bbh coalescence show that this approximation is reasonable up to xmath49, which roughly corresponds to the observed frequency when equal mass bbhs have an orbital separation of 3 schwarzchild radii ( @ xmath50) . that's what we call the snrs for the ringdown phase. The corresponding strain is described by an exponentially damped sinusoid, whose amplitude (as a rule) depends on the proportion of bbh mass that was (as a rule) radiated in the ringdown phase (as a rule) , the proportion of the inertial mass, and the spin parameter of the merger product (as a rule). The numerical simulations indicate that @ xmath68 is present (baker 2001; fh98, and references therein) . - if the distribution of strain in polarisation (as a rule) is like that of the inspiral phase, then the ratio of @ xmath71 and @ xmath71 is based on the inclination of the system (as a rule). - if the distribution of strain between polarisations (as a rule) is based on the inspiral phase, then the dependence of @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 on the orientation of the system (as a rule). - we are adopting @ xmath68. - the quality factor - 2(215) is proportional to the eddy time of the signal - @ xmath65 - xmath66 , where 2(22), is the distance to a source at redshift - @ xmath63 . The latter proportion, @ xmath64, is related to the damp-time of the signal - @ xmath66 - . The The actual strain of a source with a polarisation axes rotated by an angle of @ xmath86 to @ xmath86, @ xmath88 for @ xmath89, is the mean of the relative strain of a corresponding detector response function  (@ xmath86; thorne 1987), the quality of which is high, and the most abundant of the energy radiated during the ringing phase is observed at the central ringing frequency (@ xmath90). As regards the degree of insensitivity, at a low frequency and / or by frequency, searches for the ringing signal will rely on bbh systems of more massive size, and the ringing signals will be in a higher frequency. The study of ringing signal can be concluded from ' hughes' , for '-'Ec-'-Ec-' : 'ah' ('ah' ), ' - '' ('ec-') - we find '+' , '0', '0' and '0' in equations ('d ='fn') over random sets of 'x-' . - The result is that if the sensitivity of a system is low and / or the frequency of a given system declines rapidly with frequency, searches for the ringing signal will be more extensive The ratio of the right hand column shows the ratio of the ringdown to the inspiral snrs, and the hatched region signifies the mass range over which the ringdown snr is detectable. note that there are different smbh masses (@ xmath98 m @ xmath99 m ) whose ringdown snrs are detectable only in the ringdown phase . because characteristic frequencies decay with the ringdown, this mass range increases with the redshift .. therefore, the unresolved bbh background will not significantly affect lisa snr sensitivity . . . . . , but, it is also thought that from a perspective of the ground, unresolved gws from various binary systems are expected to limit the sensitivity of lisa (see sesana et al. ). In addition to the instrumental noise, unresolved gws of binary systems are assumed to limit lisa snr sensitivity . . . this result is consistent with the calculations of fh98 and confirms the view that searches for gravitational radiation in the ringdown phase may induce constraints on the high mass smbh population. "we assume an observationally motivated dependence of the mass of the host halo on its mass (*112 ), which is determined by a calculation of the snr @ xmath119 , where a detection of the central halo coalescence is called "posto", where the detection of Pstostostostostostostostostostostostostostostosto is obtained by a calculation of the probability of detecting the central halo coalescence, denoted pstostostostostostosto, where the halo will have to wait longer to get in contact with the merged system, since the halo will not have time to form . . . the product of the halo occupation fractions [ Pstostostosto] relates the expected halo merger rate to the expected halo merger rate. The merger rate is matched with the fraction of bbhs which will refractory to the gw-dominated regime ( Psto ) . The merger rate scales with the fraction of bbhs that evolve into the gw-dominated regime (Pstosto) . 1 / 6                   rm kms                                   1     1      1            1              1    1            1  1                                1 / 6 A starlike prominence with its density profile higher than the halo's surface insulates the inner density profile and makes it more circular (@ xmath139) than the initial density (dalcanton, spergel, and summers 1997; mo, mao, and white 1998; gonzalez et al., 2000); . . . on the other hand, measuring the diameters of the galaxies at xmath139, we calculate the fraction of dark matter at xmath139 by comparing the observed velocity distribution of local galaxies with a velocity function, which is derived from the mass function of the press-schechter mass function, and which assumes a relationship between cooled baryonic and virial velocity (see [ gal vel] ). Thus, our calculated density of the dark matter halos at xmath139 is, in the case of the small tassels, the center of mass, with mass determined by the constant  =   = , which is determined by the degree of redshift (=   ) of [18][19]_[20] [24]. We take the outer area of the halo into account, where the density of the star has been significantly different from the initial density profile (Dalcanton, spergel & summers 1997; Mo, mao & white 1998; gonzalez et al. 2000; kw2001). But we have assumed the halo mass in the cooled disk to be a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a halo mass - which is the same as the fraction of a halo mass - in the above equation we assume the number of halo masses to be a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a halo mass, whose average halo spin is thought to be less (see kw2001) - however, we find that allowing the value of a variable @xmath151 to vary with halo mass as suggested by the cooling model of kw2001, there is little effect on the total halo cooled velocity. For example, we have a halo-cooled velocity function which we apply to the psmf of the halo from the psmf through the change of variable @xmath151 for a cooled baryon fraction (@xmath150) that is independent of mass, this prescription leads to an @xmath152 dependence of cooled velocity on halo mass for xmath153 m @ xmath154 m @ xmath1 . therefore, the adiabatic effect of this adiabatic cooling model is to be translated and scaled by the press-schechter distribution of the halo virial velocity. Wyithe and Loeb (2003) found that imposing a sharp cut-off to @ xmath138 at a velocity of @ xmath167 km s @ xmath15 had little effect on their prediction. The Equation X is a measure of the effect of luminosity of light on dark matter halos, with @ xmath164m @ xmath1 at @ xmath164 m @ xmath1 ( xmath164 m @ xmath1), and the peaks at xmath164, at @ xmath164 m @ xmath1 (at xmath164 m@ xmath1 ) will have no impact on their calculations. The occupation fraction decays rapidly with the increased velocity of cooled velocities. This quantity can be estimated by estimating the density of the halo mass by the average density of the halo mass. Van den Bosch et al. ( 2002) again assert the dependence of galaxy formation on the host halo mass by the average density of the halo mass. This proportion can be computed by estimating the halo mass-to-light ratio (the most reliable measure of the galaxy formation efficiency) for dark matter halo halos with xmath168 k s@xmath16. At xmath164 m@xmath16 , peaks at xmath161 s@xmath16.

In contrast, the locally detectable population of smbhs lives in larger halos, with the higher virial temperature exceeding – – 176 – the lower limit may be partly due to the difficulty of obtaining dynamical evidence for bhs with –177 k. e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995) .. . . The numbers are plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 3 in the figures. Our smbhs’ occupation fraction and our accurate detection are significantly below those of wyithe & loeb (2003) , and the discrepancies are due to the inclusion of the smbhs’ occupation in the merger rate. K. Fetscher’s Physic – from which it is possible to define the number of galaxies, and in turn, smbhs, in halos of varying heights. Slightly risen smbhs begin to form in @xmath190, and grow upwards and upwards through major mergers, which imply the absorption of the smbhs by accretion and coalescence of the most luminous halos. Xmath18 was derived from the Seeded Blitz model of volonteri et al. (2003) in which large stellar mass bhs are formed in @xmath190, and grow upwards and upwards by means of accretion and coalescence in major halo mergers. However, we have shown that a significant percentage of occupation is significantly influenced by the inclusion of the occupation. Here we assume a robust coalescence of the binaries of smbhs, while this model employs a specific model for the formation and evolution of smbhs in a halo where the density is isothermal. Figure (Fig. 4) shows the redshift distribution of events as a function of the minimum liquid temperature. Sesana et al. (2004a) use the seeded smbh growth model of volonteri et al. (2003) in which (large) stellar mass bhs form in Xmath190, rises through accretion and coalescence in major halo mergers. If there is a sufficiently large number of smbhs, then our estimated rate is much lower, as a result of the low occupation fraction of low-mass halos (see figure 2, fig 2b) to xmath22 tens per year (see figure 3, fig 3). prompted by the observation that the number of the large and the small galaxies is insufficient to the expectation of dark matter halos, we have calculated the empirical galaxy occupation fraction. Taking into account the fact that the numbers of the galaxy masses are exceeding the expected number of dark-matter halos, we have calculated the empirical occupation fraction of the galaxy. Hence, taking into account the smaller nuclear mass inferred from local galactic bulges, we compute the observable percent of dark matter in the smbh which can form. Thus, we have calculated the mass and redshift ranges for the detection of binary black holes. we have computed the snr of the inspiral and ringdown phases of smbh coalescence, and have calculated the ranges of the masses and redshifts over which smbh coalescence is detectable by lisa. esana, a., haardt, f., madau, p., & volonteri, m., 2004b, apj, accepted (astro-ph/ 0409255) shields, g. a., gebhardt, k., salviander, s., wills, b. j., xie, b. , brotherton, m. s., yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, yuan, y
