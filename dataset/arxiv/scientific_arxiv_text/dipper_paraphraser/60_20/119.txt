What is meant by / is that the information in a qubit can be used for communication by the quantum web or in mathematical computation. However, to use the full potential of the quantum computing, the information must be kept in the quantum systems of the universe. The quantum information encoded in a qubit can be made a mathematical state in the sphere of the earth, and the sphere of the earth, and the sphere of the air. The sphere of the earth is very fragile, so the state of a qubit can be changed by the influence of the environment or by some arbitrary error. one (very inefficient) way to protect the quantum information encoded in a qubit is to measure it. A certain parameter is Xmath4, where Xmath5 and Xmath6 are the basis vectors of the 2D space of the qubit, and Xmath7 and Xmath8 are the basis vectors of the 2D space of the qubit, and Xmath8 is a normal function. – so that a qubit in an unknown state is entangled with a number of qubits in a particular reference state (that is, @ xmath5), so that the symmetric state of @ xmath9 of @ xmath9 is [xmath11] , 0 , 0 + 0 + 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 + 0 , 0 , 0 + 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 Asymmetric qubit state of Xmath19 is isomorphic to a single qubit state . . . but in this case the information is scattered among entangled qubits - the original quantum information is "disaggregated". . . . " The average fidelity of the state of Xmath20 and the state of the original qubit is, d ( ), j ( ), j ( ) . . . and for this fidelity we find the expression '0'. " . . . " Where xmath22 is the invariant measure of the state of the original qubit (i.e., we assume no prior knowledge of the pure state of Xmath21) . . . . - x-math-rg1 in the larger x-math-rg1 state have no information about the original single-quad-quad state . . . so how to extract the information from the x-math-rg1 symmetric state . . . as in the form of a disentangler, there are several possibilities: 1) optimally measure the x-math-rg1 qubit state, and based on the information obtained, make a single-quad state. . . . but the perfect transformation is impossible, there are some means by which we can concentrate the information from the x-math-rg1 symmetric state back into a single-quad state. . . . In this symmetric state, it is also possible to have a perfect universal disentangler, which can perform a unitary transformation, like the disentangler of xcite . . . , and lastly, we have devised a probabilistic disentangler in which, when a specific measurement is made over an ancillary frame, the desired single-quadbit state is created. (They also observed that if [30] is found for certain values of the parameters [14], then this will be better than for others ... this is because, for certain values of the parameters [30], the results are better than for others. In what follows, we shall consider all these possibilities. They analyzed two different operations, the first, which takes the state of a bipartite system and transforms it into a state of the product of the density matrixes of the two subsystems. The second, which is an extension of the first, starts with a state of the bipartite system, and maps it into a separate state, which has the same density matrixes as the original state. We consider the fact that the qubit system that we are considering isomorphic to a single qubit , e.g., we use the fact that the qubit system prepared in the state of xmath18 is isomorphic to a single qubit. we consider a scheme based on a projection technique, and a set of specific projection operators. Here we consider a strategy based on a projective measurement, using two projectors Xcite and Xmath31 , the angles Xmath35 and Xmath36 are randomly chosen, if no-one has any-before-semester information about the measured xmath10-quadbit state. . . . At xmath37 the result of the measurement is positive for xmath37, then the single qubit is prepared in xmath37, then the single qubit is prepared in a 'tie' state. ' j = 0  1 | j = 0  2 | j  j = 0  j = d  j   j  j  j  j - j = 0  j  d  j ,  d () ,  j ,    j   j ,  j ,     j - d  j ,  j ,    j -  j ,  j ,  j ,   j - j - j - j - - In fig. 7 we see that the fidelity of the estimation of the state of a single quart-bit is decreasing in the fidelity of @ xmath10, and in the fidelity of @ xmath45 we find @ xmath46, which is the fidelity of a _parallel_ guess associated with a binary system, such as the two projectors whose fidelity is being questioned. The estimated density operator (see Fig. 6) is simply equal to @ xmath47, which is understandable because, as we have seen earlier, the @ xmath10-qubit state is approximately in the [ ]/sent> state. We will assume, therefore, that it is a premonition that our - xmath10 - flint (*) qubit is prepared in a symmetric state (*) with unknown parameters @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 associated with a single - flint state (*) . We will compute the Integration Measure on the State space of the flint and the corresponding prior Probability Distribution of that State space is constant. We shall now be looking for an upper bound on the Average fidelity, which can be achieved by a wide variety of measurement-based disentanglement procedures . . . let's suppose that it is known beforehand that our flint qubit is prepared in the symmetrical State (*2) with unknown parameters @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 connected with the Single State (*) . . . so that we have almost lost all knowledge of the original, the information of which is almost 'lost' . We shall leave the conditional probabilities of @xmath64 unspecified, for this will permit us to consider a wide variety of possibilities. Here we shall compute the fidelity of the output from this method, and then we shall compute the fidelity for a particular input state and average for the input ensemble of @xmath65. Where @xmath66 is the normalized joint probability distribution, and if @xmath68 is the sutra, & ... s/1 . q . 1 . In the last case we have the fixed variables xmath71 and xmath72. Then xmath72 and xmath73 are taken over by the primes. xmath72 is taken over by the primes, and the above and the above are taken over by xmath75. In order to calculate this upper bound, we must find explicit expressions for xmath74 and xmath75 . in order to calculate this upper bound, we must find explicit expressions for xmath74 and xmath75 . Moreover, as we have already said in the introduction, quantum mechanics does not permit you to construct a perfect entangler that will transform it ([7] ). As a result of this assumption we are considering the disentangler at the level of xmath76 which is a quantum system constituted of a hilbert space in the realm of xmath78 (@xmath79) . (23) As a result of the disentangler it is always prepared in a state Xmath80 and in a state Xmath10 qubits - in this state xmath10 - is . . . and . . . . (24) At the end of this disentanglement we want to disentangle the ancilla qubits of xmath1 from the original qubit, so . . . . . . We are looking for the 'optimal' disentangler which will disentangle the information with the highest fidelity. Using these two conditions, we have found the unitary transformation which realizes the 'optimal covariant' disentangler, that is, the disentangler which disentangles the qubit-state @ xmath29 from the 'qmath10' state, and the original qubit is thrown (swappled) into the entanglement between the original qubit and the disentangler itself. So, in tracing the disentangler, we expect to find the best possible disentangled qubit in the state @ xmath81. This universality of the disentangler would therefore ensure that the information from the symmetrical state (i.e. [3] would be obtained for all states equally. This disentangler is described by the transformation: n, 0 , d , 0 & n- 1 , 0 , + the basis vectors of the disentangler. in the limit of xmath26, even an optimal quantum disentangler gives us a totally random outcome. in the limit of xmath26, even the optimal quantum disentangler gives us a completely random outcome. We see that xmath23, for xmath23, the fidelity at xmath86 is input-state independent and equal to xmath85. so in this limit, even the optimal quantum disentangler gives us a totally random result. [15] We can prove directly that the fidelity at xmath84 is input-state independent and equal to xmath85 . [15] “ ... we have found the optimal universal (covariant with respect to rotations of the input qubit) entangler. This is one of the most important results of our work. The optimal covariant quantum disentangler is better than the information distilled from the synthesized state ( [3]). This is because, @ xmath8 , we can easily add the information from the symmetrized state to the optimal measurement. ” ” This is why it is not surprising that the quantum scenario works better. If we want to create a state ([3]) from a qubit in an unknown state and add qubits in the known state, then again two possibilities are possible, measurement based and quantum based. Here we have found the optimal universal entangler, covariant with respect to the rotations of the input qubit . . . this is because the average of rotations is not able to extract information from the state ([3]). , the quantum entangler of the first transformation: 0 – n – 1; 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – 0 – e – basis of the quantum entangler, @ xmath89 is its initial state, and the parameters @ xmath90 and @ xmath83 are given by eq . - and the universal entangler, the transformations - given by the transformations: – 0 – n-n – 1 – e – and that the input to this entangler is input-state independent (i.e., it does not depend on the parameters @ xmath92) and equals @ xmath83 . I am assuming that the device itself is Xmath95, and that the ideal output state, to which the actual output should be compared, is Xmath96. Then we will calculate the average fidelity for this process, which we shall call Xmath98, from Xmath99 note that we are assuming a specific ensemble of input states; the probability of the one-quibit state Xmath100 is assumed to be constant on the broad sphere. The calculation of the average fidelity is given in the appendix and is not given in detail.        , and This implies that the final state is only the product of the state of the particles and of the entangler, so that these entangler states can be discarded from the problem. Therefore, the transformation which maximizes the average fidelity is simply a type of state-swapping transformation. The average fidelity is given by xmath103, where the coefficient xmath43 is given by eq . . . [6] , whereas the average fidelity is smaller than the fidelity of the optimal universal disentangler (see fig. [8] . . . - [9] . - - [10] . - - [10] Let's consider a simple quantum network which takes as input the @xmath10-qinyabbit state. , we take the xmath109-qinyab c-n-n; xmath107 is the c-n-n-n, and xmath12 is the target c-n-n. , which, in fact, is larger than the fidelity of the saber-dependent entangler . . . Let us now take p-n-n: 0 & 0 | n - 1; 0 & n - 1; 0 - p-n-n; 1 & & - n-n; 1 & - n-n; - n-n; 0 - p-n-n; - 1 & - (n-n) - n-n, 1 - n-n; 0 - 0 - In eq. (#13) we have introduced two orthogonal vectors of xmath1 qubits. xmath112 We have measured the first xmath1 qubits to make sure they are in the state Xmath113 or Xmath114. The measurement is done on the first xmath1 qubit to determine whether it is in the state Xmath113 or Xmath114 . . . so, we conclude that the widest range of possible outcomes depends on the process that we are analyzing. . . . we have studied a number of different methods of obtaining /sent> constant . . . in eq. . . in eq. . . the probability of this outcome is given by pv . . . . .

We shall take the ideal quantum disentangler, which acts as close as possible to the ideal transformation (see Figure 4) , where the vector xmath116 and xmath117 are two entangled states and the corresponding vector xmath119 are two entangled ones. The very process of dividing the space in question by the vector xmath116 and xmath117 is a process of entanglement. We shall consider a transformation of the following form, which is to say, the following form: xmath120 where xmath80 is the initial state of the disentangler, which is to be the same for all inputs, and xmath121 where xmath121 is the state of the entangled state formed from that state and a known state . . . - Xmath123 - is the unitary state of the disentangler - vectors . . . our task is to determine those vectors. - Xmath123 - is the disentangler transformation (a. 1), we can now use the result of the transformation (a. 1) - is - (eq. ) @ xmath127 we define the output fidelity as @ xmath127 - the output fidelity is given by xmath128 - where @ xmath129 is given by eq. - d. - (3 ) - ( d. ) -    . -  -  Alpha -  ast - beta - langle d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d  - d - d - d - eqnum  a.  nonumber   & + & ( alpha      ast )  2   beta   2   sqrt  n   langle d  2   rangle d  2  rangle d  2  rangle d  2                  end  aligned              end  aligned The first step is to note that by combining the results of eqs. (a. 9), and (a. 10), we have a ‘’ and ‘’ whose first thing is that we can recalculate the parameters of  and  and find that  and   are constant for  and  . ‘ (a. 9),’ (a. 10), we can find that  and  are equal for  and . ‘ Having established  and  with those imposed by unitarity, we conclude that  and  and . and  and , imposed on the inner products, we find that  and  and  and the universal /element is clearly defined by ’ (a. ), and . ‘ In order to obtain an optimal input-state dependent disentangler we use the explicit form of the transformation (a. 1); such that the averaged fidelity at xmath154 (see also at xmath141 given by eq.

(a. 19) [20] [2], this is the mean fidelity of the input (state disentanglement by the corresponding state-swapping transformation described by eq. ( 18a). it follows from xmath168 that @ xmath169 is the optimal state-dependent disentangling transformation, which is true. (It is, hereby, proposed to prove.)
