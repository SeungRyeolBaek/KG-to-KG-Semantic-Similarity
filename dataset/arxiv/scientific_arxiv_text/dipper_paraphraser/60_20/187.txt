One of these objects may be neutron stars with very strong (@ xmath0) surface magnetic fields, or they may be accreting from a self-accretion disk. These objects may be isolated neutron stars with extremely strong (@ xmath1 g) magnetic fields, or they may be colliding with a -accretion disk (see, for example, Brazier & Johnston 1999). Several similarities are found between these two models. clccccccc, age & @ xmath3 – source – kpc – yr – source – kev – – refs – refs – – axps, 5 U 0142 – 60, was recently identified and shown to have peculiar optical colors (hulleman et al.). The x-ray spectra of the rqnss and the axps are similar (see, e.g., chakrabarty et al., for a recent review) . We used the So-called Sloan Adapter, which has the following central wavelengths (Fukokugita et al. 1996): At xmath7 = 3540; At xmath9 = 4770; At xmath10 = 7620; And at xmath11 = 9130. * - mnras , 303 , l1 bignami , g. f., caraveo , g. a., & mereghetti , s. 1993 , apj, 389 , l67 garmire, g . p . garmire, g . g . garmire, a . b . , te . . - - aj , 111 , 1724 - fukugita , m . et al. 1996 , aj , 111 , 1748 fukugita, m . et al. 1996 , aj , 111 , 1724 - garmire, g . p . garmire, g . p . apj, 239 , 107 . . . sent> 781 tuohy, i . . & garmire, g.
