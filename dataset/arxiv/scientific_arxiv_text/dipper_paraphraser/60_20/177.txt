If we consider the equation below as a series of two complements, then if we add together the two complements, then if we want to find the laplacian of the circle in the circle, then the square root is defined by the Fourier transform. This formula may be extended to the circle of Xmath7. The main object of tomography is to establish the structure of an object without destroying it, and thereby to obtain the results of these methods. This information is obtained by means of the interaction of the object with various probes, including x-rays, electrons, and so on. It can be obtained by exploiting the interaction between the object and the probes, which cause it to form what is called a projected distribution or a tomogram, as we call it , see fig. Fig. fig. tomography . . . if you look at the Mathematical Problem in a different way, the following is what you want to do. We want to find out the unknown function by the knowledge of the appropriate family of integrals. . . . and let Fig. a beg for the integral of Fig. Fig. , . . . The function Xmath3 is called the radon transform of Xmath3 . It can be defined in the following way: for given data Xmath14, it is necessary to find Xmath3 from the equation xmath15. There are many problems that are a result of the instability of the reconstruction process: the first reason is the lack of exactness of the reconstruction: in order to arrive at a precise estimate of the unknown function, one must have an extremely precise knowledge of its tomography . There are some significant generalizations of the radon transform by john , gelfand , helgason , strichartz , . . . for a review of the modern mathematical aspects of classical and quantum tomography, see the   . vda of va of va and va of va . . . the radon transform of wigner function . . . in quantum mechanics the radon transform of the wigner function . . . in experimentally applied experiments with different particles and in different conditions . . . and in physics the radon transform of the wigner function . . . and, in this connection, with all the classical systems and classical dynamics, the symplectic transform , a deep relationship with classical systems and classical dynamics, the formalism of the star product quantization . . . and on the study of corners along curves that are not straight. (*) it is obvious that one must abandon the request for uniqueness in the use of tomography. Thus, due to the lack of uniqueness in the reconstruction of the density distribution, and to the loss of uniqueness in the inversion process, a regularization method must be introduced to stabilize the inversion. The main motivation is that, in many practical applications, one is not only interested in the reconstruction of the density distribution, but also in the extraction of some special features or patterns of the image . . . for instance, the determination of the boundaries of inner organs . . . in the section - radon - the radon transform, the dual map, the inversion formula. It is important that one should abandon the request for uniqueness in the application of tomography. The article is structured as follows. The first result of the ms function is available in this domain, but there are many interesting open problems and promising results in this area, as we will see in the second part of this article. . . . - - ms function , which we can simplify not only by reducing the ms function, but also by its sharp contours. a strong point of view is that, in many practical problems, not only is one interested in the reconstruction of the density distribution, but also in the extraction of certain specific features or patterns of the image . . . an example is the determination of the boundaries of inner organs. It is defined by the radon transformation of @ xmath3 by eq. (* ) where @ xmath26 is the Euclidean measure on the euclidean measure on the euclidean measure. The mathematical model of the above set of equations is as follows: given a smooth function @ xmath23 on the plane, @ xmath24, and a line @ xmath12, consider its tomogram, given by @ xmath25, where @ xmath26 is the Euclidean measure on the line @ xmath12. From the second ray of the same direction, one can determine the value of the integral value of the density on the line. In this way, we have defined an operator @ xmath27 that maps a smooth function @ xmath3 on the plane, @ xmath24, into a function @ xmath10 on the plane, @ xmath28, the manifold of all lines in @ xmath1. We ask the following question: if we know the family of tomograms @ xmath29, how can we reconstruct the density function @ xmath3? , it will be slenderly larger than xmath59 . . . - â€“ xmath37 - xmath36 is the unique probability measure on the compact set xmath37, which is invariant with the group of rotations around xmath38 . . . so - the equation of the hyperplane of xmath12 is xmath43 , xmath43 - , which is an euclidean inner product of xmath45 . - , resisit , - - ; then , xmath59, which is the set of xmath59 satisfying xmath59 , and we take a moment to work in the schwartz space @ xmath50 of complex-valued rapidly decreasing functions on xmath9 . - So - - - is a double covering of xmath30 . - ent> - which sent sequence - is a unit vector in xmath39 , scaled to 0 % . At the last action of @xmath76, the function of @xmath3 is recovered from its radon transform @xmath10 by the application of the dual mapping (* ) of @xmath10 to the radon transform. [5] Notice that the potential of a point charge is always the inverse of the dimensions @xmath7, and that only for @xmath69 . . . Note that the only dependence on @xmath7 is in the strength of the elementary charge @xmath65 . . . [6] the proof of theorem [7] can be found in @xcite. . . . a physical interpretation of lemma[5] is the following: if @xmath3 is a charge distribution, then the potential of the charge at the point @xmath38 generated by that charge is exactly @xmath68, see fig. . . . When we set @xmath81 to xmath92, we find the inversion formula ([eq.] radoninversion], which radon Inversion originally found by radon Inversion ([eq.] radon inversion ] which was originally discovered by radon Inversion @ xcite. radon-inversion _____ is a linear mapping of @xmath50 to @xmath84, where the space @xmath84 is defined as follows: if and only if @xmath85, and for all integers @xmath87 the integral @xmath88 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree _xmath89_ in @xmath90 ____ . . . and for this reason, the radon operator ____ can be extended to a continuous operator from @xmath83 and @xcite. (The following theorem ___________ contains the characterization of the radon linear operator _____ and the extension of @xmath___ to the space of square integrals of the square functions __________. The radon transform _____ is a linear one-to-one mapping of @xmath50 to @xmath84, and the space ________________ is defined as follows: if and only if @xmath85, and for any integer @xmath87 the integral ________ is homogeneous, of degree _______ In general, @ xmath100 is not a continuous operator. It is important to specify a good regularization parameter. To simplify the problem, we introduce the concept of a regularization of @ xmath100. If the solution depends continuously on @ xmath100, then _xmath107_ is as _xmath108_ as _xmath108_. so that the number @ xmath112 is a good approximation to _xmath112; let _xmath112 be such that _xmath112 is good approximation to _xmath112; let _xmath112 be such that _xmath112 is good approximation to _xmath112; if _xmath112 is good approximation to _xmath112 ; if _xmath112 is good approximation to _xmath112 , then _xmath112 is close to _xmath112 , therefore, _xmath112 is close to _xmath112 , thus, _xmath115 is near to _xmath112 , if _xmath112 is near to _xmath11 . I will call it the mumford-shih variational model. This is one of the most important models of reshaping an image. a given image, for instance, would be a unitwise smoothed image, with an abrupt set of abrupt discontinuities, the unitwise edges of math121 . . . a segmentation problem is a joint smoothing / edge detection problem. Given an image, math122, one seeks simultaneously a unitwise smoothed image, math124, math123, math124, math124, math125, math125, the distributional gradient of math126 ; math124, math124, math123 ; math124, math126 ; math125, math124, math123, math124, math12 , math12, math12 - math12, math11 - math11, - the original xcite - the above-mentioned function is the same as the mumford-shah functional: . . . center: contours of the image in the model of mumford-shah (edges @ xmath126). . . . . as xmath126 grows, y . . . the averaging parameter @ xmath132 is the factor for how much the geometrical representation of xmath126 can vary, if @ xmath126 is small, one can vary a great deal of the geometrical representation, while as @ xmath126 grows, the segmentation becomes coarser. . . . it is worth mentioning that in this model there are two unknowns: a scalar function @ xmath126 and a list of its discontinuities . . . For this reason this category of problems is often called the non-duality problem.' In this model there are two unknowns: the scalar function @ xmath126 and the set of its discontinuities. In the figure at the right - the contours of the image in the model of mumford - shah (edges @ xmath126) . . . As we have said, in addition to the reconstruction of density of xmath3, we also wish to reconstruct the singularity of xmath120, that is, the set of points where the solution of xmath120 is discontinuous. . . . (For example, in medical practice it is often good to limit the reconstruction of densities to which a partition is fixed, as the tissues of inner organs, bones, and muscles have an almost constant density.) Here we will review the results of ramlau and ring @ xcite concerning the minimization of the mumford-shah functional ([2,3]: jms.), and then we will discuss a few interesting open problems. As we have already explained, in addition to the reconstruction of density, we are also interested in the reconstruction of its singularity set @ xmath120, that is, of the points where the solution to xmath 3 is discontinuous. The only difference between the functionals @ xmath134 and the functionals @ xmath139 is the first term, i.e. the fidelity term, that is, the information that assures that the reconstruction for xmath3 is close enough to the solution of the equation of xmath140, while the other terms play exactly the same role explained for the functional @ xmath134. as usual when dealing with inverse problems, we have to assume that the data in question is not completely known, but that only noisy measured tomograms, @xmath103, are given of an exact data set @ xmath14 with a measuring point at xmath149. . . . we also use the notation math156, for the boundaries of math155 of math155. math155 for some math150, for all math151, where math152 denotes the measure of the lebesgue in math9 . . . , if we restrict the functional math160 to functions in math141, then we find that the second term (involving derivatives of math3) disappears, so it remains to minimize the functional math159 over math141, with respect to the functional math160 (a vector of math142 components) and the geometric math161 (a partition of the domain math55 with at most math152 distinct regions satisfying the non-degeneracy condition math155) , â€˜Expressedâ€™ is an abbreviation of â€˜Jâ€™ as â€˜   (all mathematics) â€˜Aâ€™ (if youâ€™re after some important syllables) â€˜ In â€˜Jâ€™ (any, but no more), if you take the example of â€˜Jâ€™, you have â€˜Jâ€™ (a â€˜Jâ€™) â€˜ . . . if you take the example of â€˜Jâ€™, you will see that â€˜Jâ€™ is â€˜the objectâ€™ of â€˜Jâ€™. For â€˜Jâ€™, for â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™ denotes â€˜Jâ€™ and â€˜Jâ€™. Let Jâ€™= â€˜Jâ€™ denotes â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Jâ€™, â€˜Kâ€™, â€˜Lâ€™ and â€˜Kâ€™ are the parts of the approximation. Then, â€˜Jâ€™ is the equivalence of the function â€˜Jâ€™. Assuming, for example, that there is a regularity of the function â€˜Jâ€™,â€™ there is a limit of jâ€™ 174. The third result is that there is a stable dependence of the function â€˜Jâ€™ on the error level @ jâ€™166. Then there is a convergent subsequence of @xmath189 , moreover, for each convergent subsequence with a limit of @xmath192 the function @xmath193 is a solution of the equation @xmath194 with a minimum perimeter . . . moreover, if @xmath195 is the unique solution of this equation, then the whole sequence converges at xmath199 when @xmath197 . . . in this section we confine our attention to the dimension of @xmath199. we observe that all these problems are very natural and have been completely solved in the case of the scalar normal mumford-slim functional at xmath134, in the (defn: jms) *4 , see, e.g., xcite . . . Finally, let us present some open problems in this context: â€“ is there a nondegeneracy condition (nondegeneracy-cond) necessary? â€“ can one find an a priori optimal value for the number @ xmath198 of different values? â€“ is it possible to estimate the norm of the solution, which is the maximum principle? â€“ finally, it would be extremely important for applications to prove the existence of minimizations of the functional xmath139, not restricted to the piecewise constant functions xmath3 . So it is that   frac  1   2 (  mathbb    f  )  2    nabla    mathbb    f                              mathbb  r From the electrostatic understanding of the radon transform, we can prove that the fidelity term in the functional in the functional xmath139 is really very weak, because the electric field generated by the electric field in xmath3 must be close to the  measured electric field. . . . therefore we conclude that the term xmath221 is a fidelity term in this weaker sense. We add here a new functional based on a vector function xmath222 and a set xmath120, and we add the fact that xmath226 is a conservative operator. We also add here a special case based on the minimization of the blake-zisserman function xmath230 among admissible triplets xmath230. We see that the functional xmath227 is a second order functional for a vector function xmath222, which has the measure of the set xmath120, which is the set of discontinuities of xmath3 and therefore is the set of discontinuities of xmath228. Using this property, by means of the electrostatic interpretation of the tomographic reconstruction, we can try to obtain some appropriate functionals in new variables xmath222 (electrical potential) or xmath223 (electrical potential) and calculate the corresponding xmath3 (charge density) . You might call the blake-zisserman functional â€˜alteredâ€™. It is a scalar function; xmath238 is a scalar function; xmath239 is the distributional laplacian of xmath233; xmath239 is the datum (the intensity of the grey hue of the given image); xmath240 are parameters; xmath129 denotes the hausdorff measure. We refer to xcite as motivation and analysis of variational approaches to image segmentation and digital processing. The blake-zisserman functional allows for more precise segmentation than the mumford-shah functional in the sense that the curve of the original picture also approximates the curve of the original picture. We refer to xcite for the existence of a minimizer and xcite for the counterexample to it, and xcite for results concerning the regularity of a minimizer. The fact that the vector function xmath22 is not present in the functional xmath225 is because we assume that the concentration of the charged layers in the functional xmath22 does not concentrate on surfaces or on lines. A positive result of the reissue of the charge can be used to describe the electric field. Suppose, for example, that an interesting result should be obtained by confirming the strong hypothesis on the X-math247 datum that the electric field does not exist at all. - as a result of the dissolution of the electric field - the problem of re-reprovision can be re-defined by the electric potential - the fidelity term is in a weak sense. - a positive and negative. In a general dimension - x-math250 the situation is very different because the inversion formula for the radon transform combines (to a perhaps fractional) power of the laplacian. * in order to avoid this constraint, one can reformulate the reconstruction problem in terms of the electric potential - x-math223 (at x-math248) obtaining a third-order functional, where the fidelity term is x-math249, where the potentials are given by ([eq] potentials ]. the problem of resolving the charge field can be translated into a resolving problem for the electric field. * in this case, the electrostatic description of tomography of this section is not correct. in this case, the electrostatic description of tomography of this section fails. â€˜Eternal Inventionâ€™ (Idiot).
