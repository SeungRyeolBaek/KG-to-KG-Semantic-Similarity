‘While it has been known for some time that inflation consists of flat spatial hypersurfaces ( Gott 1982; guth & weinberg 1983) attention was initially directed to models in which there are very large numbers of folded squares in an inflation model, and the result is almost flat spatial hypersurfaces for the observable part of the universe (Gott 1982; Guth & Weinberg 1983), and in that sense, attention has devoted much of its attention to models in which a cosmological constant, @xmath17, is assumed. but for a very large number of folded squares in an inflation model, one would have to have a small dimensionless parameter (Kazanas 1980; sato 1980a and b) which would need an explanation. also, in the simplest flat-flat-flat-flat model, one assumes a scale-invariant (harrison 1970; peebles and yu 1970; zeldovich 1972) primordial power spectrum for gaussian adiabatic energy-density perturbations. Nevertheless, it seems necessary for the inflation model to have a small dimensionless parameter (Kazanas 1980; also see kazanas 1980; sato 1980a, b) , which would require an explanation. as we have seen that these models are also compatible with current observational constraints (e.g., s. , s. ) gaussian adiabatic open-bubble inflation models have been compared with the current observational constraint (rp94; kamionkowski et al. 1994; grski et al. 1995, hereafter grsb; liddle et al. 1996a, hereafter llrv; ratra et al. 1995; rp94). Such a gaussian adiabatic adiabatic open-bubble inflation models have been found to be within the current parameter of the present observational constraint (benchmark, benchmark, et al. 1992). such a gaussian adiabatic open-bubble inflation models were also demonstrated to be concordant with the observational constraints (rp94; kamionkowski et al. 1994; grski et al. 1995, hereafter rp94; liddle et al. 1996a, hereafter llrv; ratra et al. 1995; ratra et al. 1995; ratra et al. 1995; ratra et al. 1995, grsb), investigated the magnitude of the angular anisotropy of the open-bubble inflation model (rp94) and compared this dmr-normalized model to the observational data of the cosmological model (smoot et al. 1992), if the inflaton potential of the bubble is reasonably flat (cv.), if the bubble encirclement is sufficiently flat (cv.), then the gravitational potential of the bubble should not be too large, The study of this cosmogony is given in the section xmath22. Using dmr data, we analyze various open- and closed-up models. We give an estimate of the dmr quadrupole anisotropy amplitude in relation to xmath21 , and we give an estimate of the dmr estimate of the cmb rms quadrupole anisotropy amplitude at xmath21, as a function of xmath1 . In the simplest open- and closed-up models, the initial epoch of inflation smooths away any preexisting spatial inhomogeneities, and simultaneously generates a quantum mechanical fluctuation at a bare-line level. In the first epoch of inflation, the bubble's interior becomes an open- and closed bubble, and for a small nucleation probability the observable universe is contained in an open-air inflation bubble. The tunneling amplitude is larger for the most symmetrical solution (and deviations from symmetry lead to an exponential suppression) and so it is generally assumed that the nucleation process (the mechanism (the mechanism)) does not lead to a significant decrease in the volume of the world, so that it is often assumed that the nucleation process (that mechanism) does not lead to significant inhomogeneities, and so the net result is that the particle of cosmic radiation ( mechanism) elicits small inhomogeneities, and that the only universe observable is inside an open inflation bubble. - This is because the fluctuations induced by this epoch affect only the smallest part of the energy-distance modulation power spectrum, which is insignificant for the observable values because of the shrinking of the length scale of the spatial curvature. Therefore, the observable predictions of the simple closed-form inflation model are almost entirely insensitive to the details of the first inflation, which is for the range of xmath1 . Besides the open-form inflation model, a number of other alternatives have also been considered. These are the predictions of the usual flat-form, invariant spectrum in an open-form model (w83; abbott & schaefer 1986; gouda, sugiyama, sasaki 1992, kamionkowski & spergel 1994, sugiyama & silk 1994; cayn et al. ) , in this case, because the fluctuations in this period affect only the smallest wavenumber of the energy-density perturbation power spectrum, which can have no substantial effect on the observable quantities due to the linearity of the eigenvalues of the disturbance, due to the dispersion of the spatial curvature length of the universe (e.g., w83; abbott & schaefer 1986; kamionkowski & spergel 1994; cayn et al.). In addition to the observable spectra, various other alternatives have also been considered. Hexagrams of elasticity coiled around the walls of the bubble. In certain situations, such as in a symphony, it may happen that the variation of the symphony, the changes of the wall, the variation of the substrate may affect the accuracy of the observations. However, it is reassuring that, if we add the constant quantum mechanical changes that take place inside the bubble, it is not a significant effect on the observable predictions of the single-field, open-gate inflation. (Symphony), for example, an effect which is quite variable at xmarch, which is to say, to make the ratio xmath28 smaller by xmarch, if we add the xmath25, we must change the xmarch by xmarch. Moreover, it is reassuring to note that, as long as the quantum mechanical fluctuation of the bubble walls is small (e.g., rp94), it is enough to be able to obtain observational predictions for single field open-cell inflation models. This is in no way an absolute proof that there is a square-degree space before the bubble can erupt. These computations, however, do demonstrate the important point that the space-depth of a closed universe (e.g., rp95) is quite sufficient to determine whether the changes in the bubble-wall can be expected to have observable effects. For instance, the effect of a finite-cell expansion of the bubble, at the time of its ejection, is merely a small change (yamamoto et al. 1996; cohn 1996). there are 3881 surviving pixels in the geographic coordinates of the sky and 3890 in the ecliptic. For this simple test of cosmological contamination, we compute all quadrupoles, both in Galactic and in Earthly terms. We omit all pixels where the galactic signal dominates the surface. The geometry of this cut has been determined by taking the density of the deepest-radiometric (Drake, 1995) paper on which the cosmological signal is mapped, as described completely in the banday paper. This extended coverage of the sky has had the greatest effect on the cosmological result (Gresky et al., 1996). The spatial morphology of the galactic synchrotron, free-free and dust, is well described by a descending power spectrum (Drake, 1995) which declines as the angular size declines, so that the cosmological signal is most often compromised at the largest angular scale. The complexity of the cut has been compared with the depth of the orbits of the sky, which can be calculated at all angles except the observed quadrupoles. As a simple test of this elevated spatially variable emission, we perform all computations at each of the altitudes, including the observed quadrupoles. the interference of the spatial structure of the galactic synchrotron, free - free and dust, is incomparably expressed by a high spectra (no. 34 kogut 1996a, g96) the cosmic signal is most fragile at the largest angular scales. One might have criticized either technique; in that case, we consider the quadrupole component to be of less importance than the quadrupole component, which in this case might be the quadrupole component; thus the result may be that the conclusions derived by our method may be weaker, for statistical uncertainties will become larger, and at the same time the precision of the galactic corrections cannot be completely obtained. Thus, we present four open-line energy-deficiency power spectrums: (1) the open-line inflation spectrum, which accounts only for the fluctuations produced during the evolution inside the bubble (rp94); (2) the open-line inflation spectrum, which also accounts for the usual fluctuations during the first phase of inflation (bgt, yst); (3) the open-line inflation spectrum, which also accounts for the usual fluctuations in the first phase of inflation, and the contribution of a non-square-line basis function (yst) ; (4) an open-line inflation spectrum with a flat-scale, invariant spectrum (w83); and, (4) an open-line model with a flat-scale, invariant spectrum (w83). In all cases, we have left out the possibility of slant or primordial gravity waves, because it is unlikely that they will have a significant effect in valid open models. In all cases, we have ignored the possibility of tilt or primordial gravity waves, since it is unlikely that they can have a significant effect in the present model. The likelihood analysis is then performed as in grsky ( 1994) . It is premature to draw conclusions about the open cosmogony from the version obtained by bw ... . and if the prediction of the open cosmogony is taken in isolation, a predictions from the special energy-density spectrum - one of xmath45 types, above - one is asymptotic, and math46 type 4 is a subset of the spectrum of xmath45, math46, in which the spatial curvature, that is, the spatial curvature of a gaussian model, is explained by the angular perturbation spectrum, math55, expressed in terms of the math55 aggregate, math56 the math55 generalized spectrum, i.e., eq. w83 , in an open model the predictions are indistinguishable. The energy-density spectrum of math48, which is above, is math50, and in this case, e.g., math48 (w83), but, due to the spatial math55 cutoff "in an open model, the predictions are essentially indistinguishable. a factor of 2—and a factor of 4—for the elasticity of the image from a viewpoint (one that encompasses the x–= position between 0 . . . and 1 . . .) of the cmb anisotropy angular spectra for a ranging period of time (X–=) from 0 . . to 0 . . 0 . . et cetera, et cetera. These values of x–= were chosen to reflect the current nucleosynthesis requirements (X–==0 . . . 0 . . . ) of the dmrs. (Dmrs. ratra et al., 1995, and this paper) of the gb anisotropy spectra. (Habitat-Length, Mamma-Ratra, 1995) that is, the value of x–============================================================================================ ========== I want to discuss a little of the question: the accuracy of the two-year data of the Dr. Dr. Dr. Sp. by making use of a relatively broader range of the (Hash0, HiHa, HiHa) parameter space. This way we can improve our earlier analysis of the dmrsp data (gsb) by taking into account a more encompassing range of (Hash0, HiHa) parameters. The specific parameters of the three classes of energies and density in the appropriate range of energies (Wave numbers) in the various models, are a result of three main effects: (A) of the shape of the energy–density density perturbation angular spectrum in a low-wavelength range, (B) the exponential suppression of the spatial curvature scale in an open model; and (C) of the interplay between the usual ( fiducial cdma) sachs-wolfe term and the integrated (which are called hereafter sw) term in the expression of the micro-noisotropy. The contributions of micro-noisotropy angular spectrum to the macro-noisotropy angular spectrum are different from xmath66, and are less than xmath66, while the relative amplitude of xmath66 is also different. By its nature, the angular scale of the pulse is quite like the angular spectrum of the pulse of the pulse of the pulse of the pulse, and the dominant contribution is the sw term. The scale of the pulse is less critical at xmath66, and the sw term is more dissipated at xmath66. As xmath66 increases, the sw term increases slightly and then flattens, while the sw term decreases less gradually and then falls (i.e. it has a peak). In the function of xmath66, the function of xmath61 is significantly less important than that of xmath68. The cmb anisotropy spectrum is quite similar to that of xmath69, and the main contribution is the usual sw term. This sw term is an extreme case at xmath67. As xmath61 decreases, the main term still dominates on the largest angular scales down to xmath28. As xmath61 decreases below xmath71, the central term is again influential on the largest angular scales down to xmath28. The main effect of the two terms, as a function of xmath66, is both xmath1 and xmath58 dependent. Then the trades of this “sw” term have been replaced by the increase of the “sw” term, which is nearly as scale-invariant as the fiducial cdm. (Since the sw term has no physical counterpart, this also tends to be more scale-invariant than fiducial cdm) . The sub-terms of the open-bulb inflation spectra (Figs. 2 and 5), which are relatively smaller (at xmath76), are supplemented by the increase of the “sw” term, which is of an almost identical magnitude at xmath77, which is nearly exactly the same for the sw term (in this case, it is more sw than fiducial cdm), . (In a field inflation, for instance, the quantum-mechanical zero-point fluctuations of the first epoch, and in the open-air inflation model are of little consequence. These observations are given in the following work of Cayn et al. (1996). The abovementioned spectral features of the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum, in the field inflation model, are discussed. And the results of the dmr likelihood analyses are presented in Figs. 621 and 621. Both tables have the central value and 1— @ xmath80, and 2— @ xmath80 ranges for spectra of type (1), 3—and 4—averaged from the appropriate posterior density distribution function, assuming a uniform precedence. As you can see, the flat-space scale, open-space-invariant spectrum of the open model, and the contribution of non-split integration of the model, all lead to significantly different results ( compared with fig.). In fig. 6—a few representative variants of the likelihood functions, shown in fig. 7, are shown in fig. 6, 7 and 18. Figure 6 shows those derived from the ecliptic-frame sky maps, ignoring the correction for the faint horizonal galactic emission, and excluding the quadrupole moment. This combines with the range of normalizations that have been derived from our study (the first is the highest, and the latter is the lowest) . . . the entries in table 16 illustrate the different-sized change in normalization amplitudes caused by changes in xmath2 and xmath80. However, the difference in xmath82 between spectra (11) and (2) of table 13 is not insignificant, and, moreover, the difference in the values of xmath2 and xmath80 for the three spectra (see: (1), (2), (3), (5), (6) of table 13 are not entirely insignificant. The differences between the sky map and the ecliptic-clock, and the ecliptic-clock treatment, and the inclusion or de-insertion of the @ xmath82 parameter have little or no effect on the inferred normalization amplitude. The shifts in the normalization amplitude are somewhat sensitive to the differences between the galactic and ecliptic coordinates, the foreground high-latitude galactic emission, and the inclusion or exclusion of the @ xmath82 parameter. Fig. 11 shows the effects of changing @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 on certain ridge lines of maximum likelihood @ xmath21 as a function of xmath1; and fig. 13 illustrates the effect of varying @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 on some of the ridge lines of maximum likelihood @ xmath21 as a function of xmath1; and fig. 13 illustrates the effect of the epoch-meaning of the dmr data on smaller angular scales, where the effect of varying @ xmath2 and @ xmath66 are stronger. It was determined by the analysis of the ecliptic coordinates ignoring the Galactic correction and exempting the -Xmath85 moment from the analysis. Figure 12 compares the ridges of maximum likelihood @xmath21 value, as a function of @xmath1, for four different, 0.5m cubit angular spectra , and fig. 14 compares some of the eqno [5] coefficients of the normal-shaped spectrum of @xmath21 , and Fig. 14 compares some of the average likelihoods for @xmath21 based on @xmath1 in the sense of the maximum likelihood of @xmath21, for the four microspectra based on @xmath1 , the small (but insignificant) differences in the quoted @xmath21 coefficients are small (but insignificant) in the respect of the identical model in the table . . . the flat-scale-invariant spectrum of the ecliptic ... he indicated. We must add that, in our analysis of the value of xmath21 as derived from likelihood analyses, we rely on the actual values of xmath21 that we draw from the likelihood analyses, and not from these exact formulae. a) is present in the middle left-hand panel of their fig. 11 (probably) the likelihood density of the same open-vent bubble model, which is compatible with the projections derived from this same sample. b) and, moreover, in the Garium model, a model which accounts only for the fluctuations generated inside the bubble (here [1] above) are consistent with those derived from the Garium data (Garium data, fig. 3). The marginal likelihood of Garium is shown in Fig. 3 of Garium, and is in general in a concordance with those in Fig. 17 here (albeit again only the p-level high-p-level peak is seen). However, since we only compute down to xmath95 here, only the major peak of the important low-p-level peak (Garium) is visible. Note that now, especially in the case of the quadrupole -containment, the peaks and troughs are prominent (although not exactly statistically significant) . However, if the quadrupole moment is excluded from the analysis, as in Fig. 21b, then the peaks of the open-tube inflation model are at xmath12 (at least in the range xmath14, grsb) and the flat-space-invariant spectrum open-tube inflation model are at xmath11 . The minimal likelihood density for the open-tube inflation model is shown in Fig. 21b. The estimates of the marginal likelihood density in Fig. 21b (which is similar to the models excluded from the analysis), the only conclusion is that xmath9 is the most correct value of the dmr data (at least among those models with xmath14 some of the models have another peak at xmath100 , grsb) . . . Given the shape of the marginal likelihood density in Fig. 1721, it is not entirely clear what to use for the integration range of xmath1 . In Fig. 21 (a) (which is similar to the other excluded cases) the only conclusion seems to be that xmath9 is the most consistent value of the dmr data (at least among models with xmath14 some of the models have another peak at xmath100 , grsb). Fig. 23. The power spectra of the open-bubble inflation spectra (rp94, bgt, yst) are shown in Fig. v. Fig. v. note that these calculations are performed by taking the values given for xmath62 and xmath63, and do not account for the additional uncertainty caused by the allowed variations in these parameters (which can affect the amplitude of the normalization amplitude). Fig. v. You may notice, in fig. v., the good agreement between the open-bubble inflations. Figure 23: e will be observed, and the good agreement between the open-bubble inflations. The most excellent agreement is mainly a reflection of the present numerical accuracy, and the most probable, if not impossible, cause of uncertainty is that of physical forces . . . and for xmath2 and xmath3 its maximum amplitude (see in the table Xmath42) and the normalization factor (eq. . [1] and [2]) for xmath100. The amplitude of xmath95 normalization factor (eq. [1] and [2] for xmath200 can be summarized from the fig. 23 (e) the good agreement between the open-bubble inflation spectra. or m-ctr, or  eqno (10) or no (11) ]  eqno (11) ] [[29] and 2  left-side (assumed) to the left (assumed) [28] , the lower-side (assumed) 6 2 rk t (shear) es, kb dci [29] [29], [30], [33], h-rm sinh (shear t      cosh   (        ,                                ,                                      ,       ,     , We assert that the estimates of the large-scale structure of the models presented here are precisely those which have been derived from numerical calculations. The analytic estimates of eqs. 8 and 11 are somewhat more accurate than those of eqs. 13 and 13, but when compared with the approximate analytic estimates of eqs. 13 and 13 below (sugiyama 1995) they are not as accurate as eqs. 11 . . . However, as was well observed by llrv, the analytic fit of the transfer function to the large baryon fraction is considerably more accurate than eqs. 11 . . . although, as will be seen, the analytic fit of the transfer function greatly simplifies the calculations and allows for rapid demarcation of the favored spectra of cosmological parameter space. ( ) . . . the Squire et al. ( 1986; hereafter bbks) analytic fit to the transfer function using a parameterization of eq. (13), (sugiyama 1995) and numerically determined values for @ xmath42 (instead of numerically determined values) the results are very good to xmath119. [ There is a sum of two hundred factors, each with the intensity of a pixel of the perturbation equation. This sum is quite satisfactory for the modulation equations in the two models which have been examined. In these cases, despite their fixed AT XMATH21, the perturbation equations have been normalized to @ XMATH21 by a normalization of the AT XMATH121 pixel of the universe. In the computation of the pixel, we used the pixel at the xmath80 level. These numbers are computed from the pixel at the xmath131 level, the pixel at the xmath131 level. In the computation of the pixel, we used the pixel at the xmath122 level . . . (as was mentioned above, variations of the pixel in @ xmath2 and @ xmath63 do not greatly affect the amplitude of the amplitude of the normalization.) We are again advising that this is mainly a reflection of the relatively satisfactory numerical accuracy of the matter. ) In the case of the pixel, the numbers in column (Six) and nine are represented by the pixel [18] degrees of xmath248, which are used for normalizing the perturbations in the models considered. " The second set of values in table 13 is the minimum 2 - @ xmath80, or the higher set of values in Table 912 (as it is written in the formulae of table 14, you can interpolate between the values in Table 914 ) we will observe that it is not right that the numerical simulation results should be used only for the reason that they should not be relied upon as the range of the derived parameters in the matrix. " In this section, we shall combine the data obtained from current observations on the global cosmology, with the data obtained from the dmr-normalized predictions, to constrain the range of the corresponding parameter values. The latter have been employed to constrain the maximum value of the dmr-normalized averages of the dmr-normalized ranges of tables 912. The comparison of these two values is thus made at the maximal 2 xmath138, 12 253. Table 13 compares the values of the  13633$ range for the spectra (first) and second (second). Again the ranges in Table 13 are those calculated from the maximal 2 xmath138 range of 1363; also, the means of the 13 xmath1352 - 13mm fitting formulae of table 14 may be used to interpolate the 1519 ranges of 13mm .026 . . . The model predictions depend on the age of the universe, xmath62. In order to reconcile our predictions with the high measured value of the Hubble coefficient, xmath2 we have chosen to study at xmath136 mpc the time intervals at xmath138, which are near the lower end of the ages currently analyzed. For example, peebles (1996) found that the oldest globular clusters have ages at xmath136 mpc (also see salaris, deglinnocenti, weiss 1996; renzini et al.1996), and that it is very unlikely that the oldest clusters are younger than nine. The exact limits of our calculations are described below, where we compare them with the results of other analyses. The general constraints we have identified are described below, where we compare them with those obtained by other analyses. As a result of these estimates, the local estimates of xmath1 constrain the global estimates of xmath1 (for in this case it is impossible to imagine that the free cdm is more homogeneous than the observed baryonic mass). For example, analyses of xray spectra indicate a value of xmath139, with a range of 2 - xmath140 (carlberg et al. 1996 added their 1 - xmath80 statistical and systematic uncertainties to quadrature, and multiplied by two - xmath80). It is also used to give the values of xmath143 in the column “Section 2” of tables 912: those numerical parameters which predict an xmath2 which is inconsistent with the given value. (E.g., kennicutt, freedman, and mould 1995) . . . , baum et al. 1995; van den bergh 1995; sandage et al. 1996; riess, press, & kirshner 1996; but also see schaefer 1996; branch et al. (at a minimum, the observed xmath145he and xmath146li abundances lead to a xmath147, and a conservative estimation of the uncertainties would suggest a 2 - xmath80 range, which is fkot (also see copi et al. 1995; sarkar 1996) . Compared with the standard theoretical predictions of the primordial light element abundances, the observed xmath143 gives a 'xmath148', and the conservative assessment of the uncertainties leads to a 2 - xmath148 range: fkot (also see copi et al. 1995; sarkar 1996). As for the small d abundance observations, the high ones suggest a diameter of a square root of two, a diameter of two, and a length of two, which corresponds to a width of two, and so to a width of two, which corresponds to a form of three massless neutrino species. For the larger ones, a height of two is needed to determine the d and xmath63, a 2 xmath80 dimension, a fkot, a cardall & fuller 1996. As for the large abundance, these estimates correspond to the standard interpretation of the d and xmath146li abysses, and to the standard model of particle physics (with three massless neutrino species); however, it seems that in order to establish the d and xmath153h abysses, they require a modification of the galactic chemical evolution (e.g., fkot; cardall & fuller 1996) ; the large d abundances are not incompatible with the standard interpretation of the d and xmath146li abysses, but seem to require a modification of the galactic chemical evolution to be based on local determinations of the d and xmath abysses (e.g., fkot; cardall & fuller 1996) . “Suppose, for example, that White et al. ( 1993) assuming that the uncertainties concerning the total mass of the cluster are gaussian, adding them in quadratures, we arrive at the 2–20–21–28 range of the cluster baryonic-mass fraction: elbaz, arnaud, bhringer, elbaz, arnaud, bhringer, david, jones, and forman (1996), markevich et al., 1996) to have found that this uncertainty in the 2–20–mass fraction precludes the determination of robust constraints on the other parameters of the cluster. Note that elbaz, arnaud, bhringer, and white et al., 1995) find that the gas–mass error bars are somewhat asymmetrical, and this non-gaussianity is ignored here. We will now conclude that the recent improvements in observational capabilities will eventually lead to tighter constraints on the number of @ xmath63, and so allow for more rigorous constraints on the other parameters of the universe. it would be interesting to see whether the wiggles in @xmath58 caused by the pressure in the photon-bathing fluid, see figs. 23 and 24 can influence the value of @xmath157, especially in large, @xmath119 models. The boldfaced entries in column (4) of the tables 912 indicate the coefficients of the respective coefficients which predict a value which is not in the range of eq. (13). Using an analytic approximation to the @xmath58, they assume that the scaling parameter (eq. [13]) in the exponent of eq. (13) will be reduced slightly, and the numerical values of their constraint on @xmath155 should be lowered somewhat. Thus, it may be of interest to determine whether the wiggles in the @xmath58 due to the pressure in the Photon-Bayon fluid, as shown in fig. 23 , can considerably affect the value of @xmath155, especially in large xmath119 models. [19] By the approximation to the @xmath58, they estimate that the parameter (eq. 13,13) of the exponent of eq. 13, is a dimension (seeing that the scale of eq. 13 is small . . . [26] ) we have assumed that the ecf uncertainties are Gaussian, and in general they are rather low on the value of xmath157 (and so on the value of xmath2 and xmath10) see fig. 13 of ecf. In addition, ecf make use of hydrodynamic simulations of a few clusters in the fiducial cdm model (at xmath69) to calibrate the relation between the gas temperature and the mass of the cluster, and then use this calibrated relation for all the calculations at xmath1 . Note that the constraints of eq. (19) are equal to those required for consistency with the observed correlation function . . . (as discussed in ecf, this is because vl normalizes to the temperature function at 7 kev where there is a rise in the temperature function . . . . ) for the open model at 2 - @ xmath80: @ xmath165, where we have assumed that the ecf uncertainties are gaussian, that it depends in general on the value of @ xmath157 (and so on the value of @ xmath2 and @ xmath10). . . . note that the constraint of eq. 19 is approximately the value required for the consistency of the observed cluster correlation function . . . xmath170 is less sensitive to smaller scales (compared to xmath175), so the observational constraints on xmath17 are more reliably contrasted with the linear theory predictions. These are in resonant agreement with the conclusions made by eq. 19. (31) if the cluster temperature is not redshifting, it might be useful to consider the inverse of eq. 19. (26) as a result of the uncertainty of eq. 19 (13) , in other words, as a consequence of the uncertainty of eq. 19 (13), and the calculations for the calculation of eq. 19 should be based on the estimation of the data by the same means as those of the measured data, in order to give a better estimate of the parameters of eq. 19 (when we take the data from the observed clusters to the actual state of observation), which we could, however, interpret more accurately than the computed value of eq. 19 (3) , that is, assuming that the observed clusters are already at their redshifts of formation , it is a little surprising that the magnitude of the determination of eq. 19 may be a bit different from (lower) the temperature function that it gives (by way of illustration) - for the whole period of observation, @ xmath170 is less sensitive than the xmath1800 in the exponent, and, for example, it is more accurate than the xmath87, which is based on the numerically determined values of @ xmath42 , it is important to compare. The uncertainty of eq. (19) is more constrained than that of eq. (21), so we do not add the prediction for this quantity in this document. Moreover, it is possible to compare the predicted power spectrum of the LDR , eq. (14) with the predicted linear theory of eq. (13) in a further way, having taken into account the uncertainty of eq. (13) (the uncertainty is approximately gaussian, t. kolatt, private communication1996). cole, fisher, and weinberg (1996) analyze the anisotropy of the redshift spectrum of the LDR, from which the eq. (13) represents a strong upper limit, especially at larger LDR, since the dependent parameters are already close to LDR, eq. (13) and the uncertainty in dmr normalization (not shown in fig. 23) . and the uncertainty in dmr normalization (no shown in fig. 23) . in the following discussion of the preferred part of the parameter space we will focus on the open-walled inflation model (rp94). Note from table 13 that the large-scale structure predictions of the open-walled inflation model are not dependent on the perturbations induced by inflation in the first epoch (bgt), and have not significantly depended on the contribution of the non-square-integrable basis function (yst) . In the following discussion of the preferred part of the parameter space we will turn to the open-walled inflation model (rp94) . Note from table 13 that the large-scale structure predictions of the open-walled inflation model do not depend on perturbations induced by inflation in the first epoch (bgt) and do not depend very much on the contribution of the non-square-integrable basis function (yst) . The tightest constraints on the parameter values of the model parameter are the matter power spectrum. The boldfaced entries in the table 912 present the current observations for the corresponding parameters for the open-walled inflation model (spectra 1; 4); and the flat-space-invariant open-walled inflation model (spectra 4). Note from table 13 that the large-scale structure predictions of the open-walled inflation model do not depend on the shocks that have occurred in the first period of inflation (bgt; yst) and also do not depend in any way on the contribution of the non-square-integrable basis function (yst) . In the following discussion of the preferred portion of the parameter space, we focus on the open-walled inflation model (rp94) . if the cosmological baryonic mass fraction is accounted for by the cosmological baryonic mass fraction at xmath178, - so the cosmological baryonic mass fraction at xmath178 is expected to be a smaller xmath1 than that for the observed xmath184 - and this is a conflict. . . . , the constraint on xmath134 (col. 7), is not as severe as on xmath113 -, the constraints on xmath134 ( col. 7), are not as strict as those on xmath113 - . but, however, it is clear that the present observational data do not favor an open model with xmath183, and the observed cluster of xmath184 is favored by a larger xmath1 while the observed cluster of baryonic - mass fraction favours a smaller xmath1 and thus contradicts the observational data. and that is why this xmath177 case fails. [38] table 10 presents the predictions for the xmath178 gyr, xmath185 gyr models. Then, given the observational uncertainties, one might have a few adjustments to the model parameters so that an xmath180 model with xmath181 gyr and xmath182 is just in accordance with the observational data. It is, therefore, extremely impressive that the predictions of the models with @ xmath194 are consistent with the observations, although the upper part of the range is now somewhat incompatible with what is already determined by the small-scale dynamical estimates, and the models are required to be relatively low at xmath1 (though this is not so at the 2 - 3 xmath80 level, but at the 2 - 3 xmath80 level the @ xmath1 constraint only requires @ xmath192) . Table 11 gives the predictions for @ xmath192 gyr, for @ xmath197 gyr. the central observations for @ xmath157, for the cluster baryonic mass fraction, for @ xmath26 and for @ xmath134 - so the agreement with observation is very impressive (though the tanvir et al. 1995 central observations favour @ xmath197) , so the agreement with observation is quite impressive, and the tanvir et al. 1995 central observations favour @ xmath197 , so that the central observational values for @ xmath197 favor @ xmath197, so that the central observations for @ xmath197 favour @ xmath199 , so that the central observational values for @ xmath197 favour @ xmath199, so that the central observational values for @ xmath197 , the central baryonic - mass fraction , @ xmath26 , and @ xmath134 favors @ xmath97, so that the prediction with observation is rather impressive (although the tanvir The greater value of @xmath63 (compared with table 9), eases the cluster baryonic-mass fraction constraint, which requires only @xmath196 ; besides, the cluster baryonic-mass fraction constraint (also at 2 @ xmath80 the cluster baryonic-mass fraction constraint only requires @xmath196 ) is, in a word, very much compatible with the current observational constraints for a similar range of @xmath1. In summary, the open-flow inflation models based on the cdm picture (rp94; bgt; yst) are surprisingly compatible with the observational constraints provided for @xmath202. and a little higher than @xmath120, the increase in @xmath120 is a larger drop in the mass fluctuation amplitude, which makes it more difficult to argue for @xmath177; but the models with @xmath197 seem to be consistent with observational constraints, especially when xmath4 and xmath198 gyr are approximately the same as the observational limits. it is interesting that in this case the central observational values we consider for @xmath157, for @xmath26 , and for @xmath134 prefer @xmath9; however, that for the cluster baryonic - mass fraction (as well as for @xmath2) favors @xmath190 (although, at xmath2 the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint only requires @xmath196), while for @xmath199 open-inflated bubble inflation models with @xmath200 and @xmath198 are in perfect The observations we have used to constrain the value of the parameter values in the previous sections are the most rigorous . . . a good many of the observations we have used to constrain the parameter values of the dmr two-year-old normalized models are (e.g. g96): (e) the slight downward drift in the central value of the dmr four-year normalization in comparison with the two-year-old normalization (g96) ; (b) the full range of the normalizations of the dmr four-year-old data set (instead of the 1 - dmr80 range previously analyzed); (c) the total range of the parameter space with the value of the @xmath205 y-axis (in grsb, we concentrated on the @xmath8 y-axis); and (c) the value of the @xmath62 y-axis (in grsb we concentrated on the @xmath121 y-axis). We emphasize, however, that the part of the parameter space with the @xmath205 y-axis is only favorably favoured when it is large (@xmath206 , @xmath2 is small @ xmath207), and that the small-scale dynamical estimates of @xmath1 are somewhat biased. We therefore conclude that the large-scale flow-function of bertschinger et al. (90) contains a lower 2@ xmath80 limit on @xmath1 which is about 2@ xmath13 higher than that which was found in the redshift - space distortion analysis of cole et al. (1996). . . . however, we strongly emphasize that the central value of the large-scale flow-function of bertschinger et al. (90) does favour a far greater value of @xmath1 than is mentioned in the rest of the data we have considered here. In fact, as discussed in the above section, there is still a certain amount of uncertainty in how to interpret the large-scale velocity-resolutions in open models, particularly given the wide-field variable involved in the measurement of a single bulk velocity (bond 1996, see llrv). In addition, as we have already mentioned, there is some doubt in how to interpret the large-scale velocity-resolutions in open models, especially given the large sample variance which accompanies the measurement of a single mass-resolution (bond 1996, see llrv) . In particular, we draw from the stereoscopic results of kolatt et al. (1995) that for the optically-selected apm galaxies they require a 2— - - x——-; Moreover, the Nicolaus et al. (1996) concluded that at xmath822 @ xmath21 (eq . (22) we can approximate a value of xmath222, since a minimum of xmath22 is compared to a minimum of xmath225 (Eq . (24) , and ratcliffe et al. (1996) insist on xmath218. zoloubi et al. (1996) have constrained the values of the model by comparing large-scale data to the predicted values of the DMR two-year data, normalized on an open-ended model , they conclude that the open-ended model possesses a good description of the large-ended, open-ended data, in which the amount of At xmath222 and At xmath223 is equal to the average value of the observational data of Xmath218. . Since the two-year minimum of the two-year maximum of the two-year minimum is not known, and as for xmath225, eq . (24) denotes a more significant value, whereas the lower part of the range, at the lowest part of the range, is in agreement with the values estimated by the cluster x-ray temperature function, eq . (24), and eq . (23), which corresponds to a higher value than that eq . (23), owing to the steeper decline to the lower end of the range, whereas eq . (23) indicates a greater value than eq . (23), for the reason that eq . . . . the cluster peculiar velocity function provides a new 'general' dimension for the determination of the peculiar velocity field (e.g., croft efstathiou 1994; moscardini et al. 1995; bahcall & oh (1996)), we note that the data from the observational data are also quite accurate, e.g., in the flat-kilometre-kilometre-kilometre-kilometre-kilometre-kilometre model with 226 and 226 = 3 = 2. . so that the observation of the structure of matter is in fact much lower than the dmr data (e.g., ratra and sugiyama 1995) . bahcall et al. (2007) concluded that the observational data is well described by an  177kilometre-kilometre model with 226 and 226 = 0 . . . . . , but this normalization is less than the dmr data (e.g., ratra and sugiyama 1995) . And, in spite of the fact that we have recently discovered a class of galaxies at xmath240 (e.g., francis et al., pascarelle et al.) no major threat to the open-air model, and even if there are still many other X-math235 systems, such as the one at x-math235 (e.g., lu et al., wampler et al., fontana et al.), they may become a serious problem for the open-air model. It is however not yet known whether the open-air model can accommodate a large population of large-scale stars at X-math235 (steidel et al. 1996; giavalisco, steidel & macchetto 1996), and if, after all, there are still a number of such systems as at X-math235 (e.g., lu et al. 1996; wampler et al. 1996; fontana et al. 1996), it is also possible to accommodate, according to the mass, the proposed proto-galaxy. On the other hand, the recent discovery of galaxy groups at x-math240 (e.g., francis et al. 1996; pascarelle et al. 1996) are probably not serious threats for the open-air inflation model, while massive clusters at x-math241 (e.g., luppino et al. 1995; pell et al. 1996) are easily incorporated in the model. This result was quantified by grs, who also compared the predictions of dmr two-year data normalized for dmr two-year (and so it was considered dmr two-year data normalized for dmr four-year data) with the smaller-scale cmb spatial anisotropy observational data. From a preliminary comparison of the predictions of dmr two-year data normalized for dmr inflation models with the smaller-scale cmb spatial anisotropy observational data, ratra et al. (1996), concluded that the range of parameter space for the open-bubble inflation model was inferred from the small-scale cmb spatial anisotropy observational data. This result was explained by grs, who also considered the open-bubble inflation models normalized for the @xmath1351- @xmath80 value of the dmr two-year data (and hence considered the open-bubble inflation models normalized close to the value of the dmr four-year data), figs. 5 and 6 of grs) , it must be noted that these tests are also in agreement with @xmath69 models, and plausibly with a spatially-invariant cosmological constant dominated by the flat model (e.g., ratra et al. 1992; torres et al. 1996) but they are, nevertheless, quite subject to the flat-at xmath18 cdm model This broad range is consistent with the conclusion of spruce-haut (1996) that it is not yet possible to compute the cosmological parameters of a given domain from the data of the dmr. ganga et al.

(Even if we took into account the small systematic difference between galactic and ecliptic maps, we didn’t assume that any of the small systematic differences led to a systematic shift in the predicted values of xmath21; we didn’t take into account systematic shifts in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty.) in particular, we didn’t take into account the small systematic difference between the galactic and ecliptic maps; we didn’t take into account the small systematic difference in the estimated values of xmath21; we added systematic shifts in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty. (Observe that we account for the intrinsic noise, the cosmic variance, and effects (1 and 3), above. (This is because we explicitly estimate all known systematic uncertainties for each assumed cmb anisotropy angular spectrum, and account for them, in the most conservative manner possible, as small shifts. (For the largest possible 2–3–5–7–7–7–7–7–7–7–7 range defined above, the fractional uncertainty varies between 2–5–7–7–7–7–29. I have analyzed the observable predictions of the open-bubble inflation (rp94) and focusing on the variations created in the internal space of the bubble (bgt; yst), and then accounted for the contribution of a non-square integrable basis function (yst) . In our discussion of these theories, I have described a number of specific realizations of the open-bubble inflation that have recently come to light. They are based on specific assumptions about the vacuum condition before the creation of a new bubble. In our study, we have only analyzed the fluctuations created in the inner space of the bubble (rp94), and also included the effects of the fluctuations generated in the first phase of vertical inflation (bgt) and finally the contribution of a non-square, integrable basis function (yst). however, current studies indicate that such effects do not add a significant amount to the fluctuations created during the evolution of the bubble, it is necessary to continue to investigate such findings both to be more exact in examining the robustness of the predictions for the internal space, and to try to find a valid particle physics-based realization of the internal space. The predictions for the internal space in the open space seem to be sound, it seems that only those fluctuations generated during the evolution of the bubble need to be considered. The internal space in the Open Space and its imperfections have recently been under study. It may also be significant that the mild bias in these values is manifested by the necessity of resolving to reconcile these larger values of @xmath1 with those determined from the small-scale dynamical estimates, and by reconciling the smaller dmr-normalized @xmath251 values (for this preferred range of @xmath1) with the larger observed galaxy numbers (e.g., eq. . [18]) . It is also probable that in the case of the low- density cdm model @xmath18 there can be adjusted the value of @xmath1 to accommodate a large fraction of the present observational constraints . . . the large permitted range is partially due to the current uncertainty of @xmath10. . . . it may also be significant that mild bias must be seen in order to reconcile these larger values of @xmath1 with those derived from small-scale dynamical estimates and to reconcile these smaller dmr-normalized values for @xmath1 (for the range of @xmath1) with the larger observed galaxy numbers (e.g. , eq. . .

Those dmr-two-year data are based on a dotted line or on a solid line. Those dmr-two-year data are based on a dotted line or on a solid line quadrupole moment; and these dmr-frames are based on a dotted line or on a dotted line excluding the quadrupole moment. The general features of this figure are roughly in line with that of the dmr-two-year data (cayn et al., 1996, fig. 3). Those are the ecliptic calculations, which include dotted lines or excluding solid lines the quadrupole moment; and those of the galactic calculations, which include (dot-dash lines) or excluding (dash lines) the quadrupole moment.
