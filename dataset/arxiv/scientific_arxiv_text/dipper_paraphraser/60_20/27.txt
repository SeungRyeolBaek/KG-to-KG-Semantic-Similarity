Then came a new theory, derived from physics, that the sky-like energy in the sky-like world is: dark energy. dark energy can even be a phantom and even violate the weak energy condition. In recent years some heuristic models of the observable consequences of dark energy have been proposed, some of which stem from certain physics, others purely phenomenological , they have been drawn up to describe the effects of dark energy on the spheres of the sky-like universe. In general, in various cosmological models the fundamental quantities are either geometrical (if they derive from a spacetime geometry) or physical (if they depend on physical fields). Physical quantities are clearly based on physics, while geometrical quantities are more universal. The spheres of xcite are also either physical (if they derive from a spacetime geometry directly) or physical (if they depend on physical fields)., so that physical quantities are always model-dependent, while geometrical quantities are universal. In a few years past, the bouncing cosmological model was suggested in ref. 379, but it was proposed only at high density in the early universe. Nester and collaborators gave a general analysis of the sphere of xcite with torsion, in which they considered the dynamic pgt-to-pgt connection and the characteristic dynamic pgt-to-pgt coupling, and investigated the possibility that the dynamic pgt connection, which is the nature of dynamic pgt-to-pgt coupling, may be the cause of the accelerating force. A good model must at least reduce the fine-tuning effect as much as possible. “At xmath4, a pseudoscalar mode is naturally driven by the intrinsic spin of elementary fermions and so it naturally involves such sources. Consequently, it is generally assumed that axial torsion must be small and little-effects at the late time of cosmological evolution. In cosmological models with a scalar mode, Xmath6 there is only a time component and it can be expressed as the gradient of a time dependent function. , there is a critical non-zero value for the affine scalar curvature of xmath6 because xmath6 can interact indirectly with non-linear equations. So, cosmological models with a scalar mode offer a situation where dynamic torsion can be observable in the late phase of cosmological evolution. , it is precisely in this manner that it is generally thought that axial torsion must be small and have small effects at the late phase of the cosmological evolution. Hence, the optimal model should limit the fine-tuning as much as possible. It is obviously the fine-tuning problem, one of the main problems in the torsion cosmology . . . and a good model should have a good limit on the fine-tuning problem. The dynamical attractor of the cosmological system has been employed to make the later stages of the model insensitive to the initial condition of the field, and therefore prevent the further drift of the cosmological models . . . In this paper we apply the statefinder diagnostics to cosmological torsion. We find that some characteristic of the statefinder diagnostics for cosmological torsion can be distinguished from the other cosmological models. fortunately, as is well known in the literature on torsion, statefinder diagnostics are able to distinguish a number of cosmological models. Luckily, as has been shown in the literatures, the statefinder diagnostics are capable of distinguishing a number of cosmological models . . . but one cannot distinguish the rapidity of the accelerating mechanism from the other one, for a large number of models may be exactly equivalent to the same current value of xmath10 and xmath11. Moreover, since the evolving course of statefinder is decelerating at early times (and if it is, then we understand why the universe is continually expanding until xmath16. But if the growth of statefinder is decelerating at early times (and if it is decelerating at early times) we can understand why the universe is still expanding until xmath16. The effects of torsion on the expansion rate are often an effect of the instability of the universe, which is even more remarkable and demanding further investigation. The phenomenon of equator on the torsion in the torsion in the cosmology has been already reported for the brane-world cosmology and for the quasi-cosmological cosmology. In fact, pgt with a riemann-cart geometry is interesting because of its geometry and geometric properties. The affine connection of riemann-cart geometry is @ xmath20, where @ xmath21 is the levi-civita connection and @ xmath22 is the torsion tensor. Furthermore, we investigate in advance the relevance of the found governing parameters. pgt based on a riemann-cart geometry allows for dynamic torsion in addition to curvature. In this case, the restricted expression of the torsion can be written as Xcite,  kappa,  trestrct   , where the vector Xcite is the trace of the torsion. A theoretical analysis of pgt led us to consider tendentiously dynamic    scalar mode . . . In the affine relation of the riemannian geometry to xmath20, where xmath21 is the levi-civita connection and xmath22 is the torsion tensor. . . . . – so we have selected the parameters – xmath60, xmath61, and the initial values – xmath62, xmath63, xmath64, which are essentially dimensionless. – the effective force of matter – in the case of scalar torsion, – *, label – torpre –  – end – aligned – – in effect – and the spatial terms vanish. the newtonus limits need only be ‘xmath56’. The corresponding equations of motion in the matter-dominated era are as follows, – Xmath44, where – xmath45, and the energy density of matter – – – xmath46 can be scaled as follows, – xmath48 – xmath48, – xmath49, – xmath49 and – xmath32. The corresponding equations of motion for the matter-dominated era are as follows: – xmath45 and the energy density of matter-component – – – xmath46, where – xmath48 is the present value of hubble parameter and – – – – – – Since the torsion cosmology uses dynamically scalar torsion (a geometry feature in the Riemann-Caran spacetime) the scalar accelerating mechanism must be a critical distinction between it and other dark energy models. Therefore, its statefinder diagnostic is bound to reveal a specific feature. Hence the scalar torsion cosmology cannot be applied to the fine-tuning problem for the magnitude of Xmath65. However, this result depends upon the source of the initial data and the values of the parameters. – the parameter ‘a’ is a continuous parameter, which is present on xmath68. a set of eqs. (Dth), – the matrix of the line in Xmath67 is an unchanging one and xmath68 is a negative one, which means the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The velocity of xmath10 is due to be accelerated at a late date and the value of xmath67 is negative today, which means the universe is accelerating. According to the scale (scale), the value of the hubble parameter is unity. In the following sections we shall examine the state-finder and give an analysis of all the values of the parameter @ xmath0. . . . , the circle  xmath . . . – xmath77  3bh . . . . 6   2 . . . , [6] mu + br . . .

First of all, we consider the time evolution of the statefinders, both at xmath12 and at xmath75, for xmath76 . . . . in fig. . . . in which we have chosen . . . in Fig. . . . . . in a tally, we see clearly that the cosmic uptake is assured by the dynamic scalar torsion of the trajectories, which is swollen by the increase of time. , title = fig: , width = 264 ] and xmath78 planes for the torsion parameter @ xmath84, where we choose the parameters @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 . arrows show the time evolution. , title = fig: , width = 264 ] and xmath78 planes for the torsion parameter @ xmath84, where we choose the parameters @ xmath85 and @ xmath86. arrows show the time evolution . , title = fig: , width = 264 ] and xmath78 planes for the torsion parameter @ xmath84, where we choose the parameters @ xmath88 and xmath89 . xmath84 planes for the torsion parameter @ xmath84, where we choose the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath90 . We can see that the deceleration function is negative, so the deceleration function is negative. We will put the time evolution of the statefinder, as seen in fig. , where we have chosen xmath97 and xmath98. In fig. , we plot the deceleration function in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 planes, where we have chosen xmath102 and xmath80. Obviously, the cosmic amplitude can be accelerated by torsion, since the deceleration function is negative. Moreover, the speed of the universe can be accelerated by torsion, because torsion is negative , e.g. a decrease in the reversal period at the first redshift and a decrease at the first peak, to the end of which a decrease in the time of the expansion at the first redshift is met with less and less, and then by a decrease in the cosmic time. The statefinder diagnostics demonstrate that the universe naturally has an accelerating expansion at the lower redshifts (later) and a decreasing in the early redshifts (early) for the cases of xmath105 and xmath18. We can be quite sure that the evolution of the statefinders, in the form of xmath99 and xmath99, will be identical to that of xmath103, except that they pass the xmath69cdm. This torsion value eq. eq. eq. eq. - ( critical points) - is an autonomous system, and we can use the qualitative method of ordinary differential equations . if the solutions interpolate between critical points they can be divided into a heteroclinic orbit and a homoclinic orbit (a closed loop) , i.e. the heteroclinic orbit connects two different critical points and the homoclinic orbit is a closed loop. Therefore, we will talk about dynamic analysis in the next section. The numerical method is in perfect agreement with the critical points and the stability of the solutions is studied. The solution is divided into four critical points, in the following way: @ xmath111, @ xmath113, @ xmath113 and @ xmath114. The solution with the solution with the critical points, divided into a heteroclinic orbit and a homoclinic orbit, in a closed loop. There are five critical points @ xmath110 of the system, as follows: @ xmath111, @ xmath113, @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 . When tessellations are interpolated between critical points, they can be divided into a heteroclinic orbit and a homoclinic orbit (a closed loop), the heteroclinic orbit connects two different critical points and the homoclinic orbit connects two critical points to themselves. Therefore, we will discuss the dynamic analysis in the next section . . . The linear system (dthphirlinear) has an exact periodic solution in the form of @xmath120, where @xmath121, @xmath122, @xmath123, @xmath124, @xmath125, @xmath126, are first values. The solution is only periodic for the linear system, but there are quasi- periodic solutions near the focus for the coupled nonlinear equations. . . . ” (piaohi] - then eqs . . . (piaohi) . . . . . . The trajectories correspond to the stable focus (see fig. 6), and to the unstable saddles with xmath137. So trajectories reach the xmath-69-cdm point. The heteroclinic orbit connects the critical points in xmath-69 with xmath-132. we take xmath-134, and the initial value of xmath-137. In xmath-134 the total trajectories correspond to the stable focus (see fig. 6). The trajectories correspond to the stable focus (see fig. 6). In the case of xmath-92 there is only a stable saddle @ xmath116, where the effective equation of state @ xmath-114 tends to @ xmath-129. Therefore, the trajectories pass through the @xmath-94 point. In xcite , the authors compared the numerical values of the torsion model with the observational data, in which they fixed the initial values @ xmath48, @ xmath138, and @ xmath139, and the torsion parameters @ xmath0 and xmath32 . , the local lit. it was the light ray ray geodesic equation in the flat universe. ; the ray ray geodesic equation in the flat universe. , the ray of light emitting rays and the geodesic equation in a flat universe. . . . if a particular cosmological model were provided for xmath148, math149 being the model parameters, a maximum likelihood method could be employed to determine the best and the worst fit of the model to the data, and to obtain the optimum fit of the model to the data. At xmath148, the observational data consist of apparent magnitudes math151 and redshifts math152, their corresponding errors math155 and math158, where math158 is the absolute magnitude . . .  It is clear that the absolute magnitude math160 is the point of meeting between the apparent magnitude math160 and the theoretical prediction math140 . . . at xmath150, the apparent magnitude math155 is related to the corresponding luminosity distance math158 by math155 + math158 +  ,  . For the axt_ (@_xmath_172) we find, by minimizing the quantity of @_xmath_172  2   sigma  2    ,     ,    ,   ,  ,   ,   ,   ,   ,  ,  ,  -  ,  -   - - if the wrangle xmath165 is model-independent, it can be used as a consistency test of the data, and one can choose a priori the value of it (and, equivalently, the value of a dimensionless hubble parameter xmath166), or even  -  -  -  - ,  - ,  -  ,  -    -  ,  -  - ,  - ] ,  -  -  ,  -  -  ,  ,   - ,  ,   -  -  - ,  ,  -  ,  - ,  -  ,  , a force has been developed for Xmath139 and Xmath138, and from Xmath138 we have a function of Xmath140 which is said to be obtained from Xmath195 by direct analytic continuation. We have the following function of Xmath140 at different initial values of Xmath139 and Xmath138. In general, we have to consider a succession of power series Xmath195, Xmath198, and Xmath196, each of which is a direct analytic continuation of the previous one. In general, we must have the case of Xmath197 for the essence supernovae data. The 162 data points given in Table 9 of ref. Xcite, consisting of 60 essence sneia, 57 snls sneia, and 45 nearby sneia, we add to the number of 30 sneia detected at the ref. Xcite, as in ref. xcite . the scalar torsion model ( @ xmath208, @ xmath210, @ xmath211) gives a close curve relationship to the one from @ xmath206 ( @ xmath212). , title = “fig: ” , width = 264 ] with the essence supernovae data through the relation between the redshift @ xmath141 and the distance modulus @ xmath54. So, it is clear that the allowed ranges of the parameters @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 favor the case of @ xmath213 if we choose @ xmath214 and @ xmath215. The scalar torsion model ( @ xmath208, @ xmath209, @ xmath210, @ xmath211) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @ xmath206 (@ xmath212) . , title = fig: , width = 264 . The statefinder diagnostic has the advantage over dynamic analysis in that it is quite simple, but the latter can provide much more information. The statefinder diagnostic divides the torsion parameter @ xmath0 into four ranges, which are in keeping with the requirements of dynamic analysis. Thus the statefinder diagnostic is compatible with a number of extremely general models, including some of which, while the idea of the equation of state is not very relevant, the statefinder diagnostic can be applied to a number of models for which the concept of the equation of state is not directly applicable. the most interesting feature of the trajectories is that there is a loop in the case of @ xmath217. The shapes of tadpoles show that they pass through the fixed point @ xmath69cdm; then the statefinder pairs are following the loop and will pass through the fixed point @ xmath69cdm again in the future. the statefinder diagnostics have an important effect on critical points. The statefinder diagnostics show that the universe is naturally expanding with any torsion parameter @ xmath0; but it is dependent on @ xmath0 and on @ xmath32 that there is decelerating expansion before accelerating expansion. this behavior is compatible with the oblique orbit connecting the negative attractor and the desitter attractor. The most interesting feature of the trajectory is that there is a loop in the case of @ xmath217. These calculations resemble the Braneworld cosmology, which he has already studied in a different context by sahni, shtanov, and viznyuk, whose model reveals an overexaggerated value of xmath222. By making appropriate adjustments of the equilibrium parameters and the initial value of xmath224, it is possible to change the quasi-expansion period and the frequency. The difference between xmath222 and xmath226 are inferred from observations of the local matter density, and the difference between xmath222 and xmath226 is based on the present value of statefinder parameters xmath224. , and -es can be found at xmath222. The difference between xmath222 and xmath226 is due to the present value of the statefinder parameters xmath224 , if it is now known, then, of course, the period of the expansion of a universe, the actual value of xmath222, and the quantum flux. - astro-ph - 9805260 - sahni v and shtanov yu 2003 - phys . b - 606 - 7 astro-ph - 9805260 - liu d j and li x z 2005 - phys . d - 59 - 043506 - phys - 9805260 - liu d j and li x z 2005 - phys . . . - rg - qc - g - tu b - qc - g - g - rg - tu x z 2005 - phys . . . . . . . - astro ph / 9805260 - sahni v and shtanov yu 2003 - phys . . . . - a * 22 * 2057 astro ph / 0612738 ; li x z, sun c b and xi p 2009 phys. a d * 79 * 027302 ; arxiv: 0903 ; a d * 79 * 02352 ; arxiv: 0903 ; a d * 69 * 053529 astro ph / 0612738 ; li x z, sun c b and xi p 2009 phys. d * 73 * 023526 ; arxiv: 0903 ; b                                                                                        ,            .   и   .   219 Forsaken ta, burbidge g, narlikar jv, 1993 _ analyz. _ - 0508019 - hehl f, mccrea j d, mielke e w, and neeman y 1995 _ analyz. _ - 67 * 762 - astro-ph / 9810433 - liu d j , sun c b, and sun c b - j e r e 2005 - phys. _ a _ph ... j _ c a , liu d j , sun c b, li x z , sun c b , b , b - e t _  ,   li x z, zhao y,  ,  a ; j _ a _ph ... j _ c - qc - 9412229 ; liu d j, sun c b and li x z 2006 _phys ... _ j ... ph - ph / 9712229 ] - u j, sun c b, li x z 2007 _astron. _
