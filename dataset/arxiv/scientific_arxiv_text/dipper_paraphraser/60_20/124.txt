We have also calculated the following particles, as shown in Fig. - [1]: axigluons @ xcite from chiral qcd (@ xmath7), excited states @ xcite of quarks (@ xmath8), color octet tyrannical fermions @ xcite (@ xmath8), new gauge bosons @ xcite (@ xmath10, @ xmath11), and scalar at xcite (@ xmath13 and   ). Using four triggers from the run 1a and 1b, we derive the density of dijets above a mass of 150 gev / c @ xmath1 , 292 gev / c @ xmath1 , 292 gev / c @ xmath1 , 9 . 52 pb @ xmath1 , 69 . 8 pb @ xmath1 , 1 pb @ xmath1 , 1 pb @ xmath1 , 1 pb @ xmath1 , 1 pb @ xmath1 , 1 pb   , 1 pb  2 ,  , , , , , , , , The noise from the detector is present for the energies of the first, second, third, and fourth elements. The third element is a process of one astrophysics and an experiment of a half-wave, but this astrophysics are unsatisfactory for the spherical elements, for the peaks are large . . . of a certain energy is insufficient to ascertain the mass resolution of the new particle, for the resolution of the second element is predetermined, the length of which is proportional to the length of the two elements. For each increment of the mass of a new particle in fifty gev / c . . . . at xmath26, there are 29,470 events in the data, @ xmath27 events (@ xmath28) in the background, @ xmath29 events (@ xmath30) in the background, and the value of the resonance radius from the fit is @ xmath31 pb (Statistical) . In Fig. . . . . . we notice an increase in eddyings over 300 eddyings , 550 eddyings , 850 eddyings , 850 eddyings . . . The calculations are performed in the lowest order of the qcd code, using partons of the xmath3 and one-circuits of the xmath3 code, and require a total of 30 and 30 % of the qcd code. An additional xmath47 symmetry is introduced to keep the top quark light, while the top quark is heavy; this leads to the discovery of a top-level quark in the xmath4 code. the top-level quark is strongly conceived and decays mainly to the third generation ( @xmath45) with a relatively large natural width ( @xmath46) . , the large mass of the top-level quark indicates that the third generation is special. he assumes that the top-level mass is large mainly because of a dynamical @xmath5 condensate generated by a new strong dynamical coupling to the third generation . . . here the @xmath47 of qcd is a low energy symmetry which is the result of the breaking of an @xmath42-fringed connection to the third generation, and the @xmath43-fringed connection to the first two generations. Here we search for the top-level gluon in the #xmath4 channel . . . The top-level gluon is strongly produced and decays in the third generation (@xmath45) with a relatively large natural width (@xmath46) . c) The precision of this procedure will be increased with the implementation of a new tagging algorithm. [296] As a consequence, if the data can be processed with more accuracy, we can make more use of double b-tagged events, like the one in fig. [296] We start with the search for a dijet in 19 pb xmath0 of Run 1a, and we require that one of the two leading jets be tagged as the bottom quark. the b-tagged data is supposed to be equal to 600  mm / m xmath2 of the cdf eq. pythia calculates that one-fourth of the top quarks are directly detected @ xmath4 and the rest are generated by dissipation and flavoring. From fits to the xmath4 distribution, we estimate that the sample is about 50 % bottom, 30 % charm, and 20 % mistags of plain jets. Fig. 6  Fig. 6  fig. [fig. btag ] we show the btag tagged dijets, corrected for the xmath4 accuracy . - . - adequacies of the topgluons - xcite, with equidistant from normal gluons, were incorporated into the pythias and the simulation of the cdf detector. - Fig. - b-bar - res . . . - the limits of new particle production are shown in fig. - b-tag - . - - - , the theoretical cross sections are lower, and the distribution of the cteq2l is a normal parton distribution. - to find new particles that decay to x-math5 we start with the data of the highest mass measurement @ x-cite. We first use the top decays to w+ four jets, with at least one b-tag, and found 19 events in a background of x-math63, giving the height of x-math64 (score) @ x-math65 (sys) gev / c - x-math1 . I have searched for new particles decaying to dijets, @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we have used pythia @xmath67 as a proximate target. On the left, in fig. ttbar, we have the mass distribution for the monte carlo, on the left the standard model of top production of herwig, on the right qcd w+ jets reflected from vecbos with parton showers from herwig , in fig. ttbar, we have compared the mass distribution of cdf z to sm , illustrating that in this data sample we are sensitive to topcolor z to sm , up to a mass of roughly 600 gev / c . . . , this final analysis consists of a cdf inference. This data set in the dijet channel contains the most significant occlusions yet for the hadronic decay of axigluons (excluding xmath70 gev / c @ xmath1), excited quarks (excluding xmath71 gev / c @ xmath1) . . . ii. iii. iv. t.
