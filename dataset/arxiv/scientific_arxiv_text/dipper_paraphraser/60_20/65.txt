Xcite - us-ov-u and lee were recently able to find certain relation in the vicinity of non-interacting bubbles. " It is the basis for all the statistical studies to estimate the canonical partition of the environment, and in the next section we describe the elements of this study, which have already been reported in the literature. .. ) We illustrate how a microcanonical distribution may be obtained from the atomic one. This paper considers the statistical study of nuclear nuclei during a collision of heavy ions. The role of equilibrium and dynamics has not yet been clearly understood, as many different approaches have been used. The role of equilibrium and dynamics has not yet been fully defined, for a great deal of work has been done on the subject. We consider that there are nuclei which thermalize in a volume of xmath1 much larger than xmath2 and where xmath3 is the polar coordinate. in the following section, we consider the recursive technique of chase and mekjian and review the thermodynamic properties of such systems: excluded volume, coulomb effects and isospin degrees of freedom. in this section, we consider the recursive relation of xcite and remark the thermodynamic properties of this system, some of which have already been discussed in the literature. In the last part, we consider xmath14 to be a 16-mev  5  4 , with xmath17  5   5  4  .  This, in fact, is the most elementary of the equivalences of the model. This formula, and the generalization of this formula to a more realistic case (see later), is what makes this model so soluble. a priori, it seems to be a horrendous problem, but it can be computed recursively by the formula , xmath10 here xmath11 is 1 , then the first part is derived from the kinetic motion of the center of mass of the composite in the volume xmath1 and the second part from the internal structure . The origin of the different terms in eq. ([2]] is the following: xmath18 is the energy of the composite of xmath19 nucleons, and the last term in the exponential comes from the fact that the composite can be not only in the ground state but also in excited states which are described by fermi-gas equations. The recursive formula above gives a great deal of freedom in the choice of partition functions for individual fragments, xmath6. the last dependence, in ref. xcite, is of xmath16 5  5  4 Now we consider a system divided into a large cluster and a few small clusters. To understand this result we have used the usual picture of a liquid-gas phase transition, which results in a continuous difference in the density of the nucleons, not in the volume. to our explanation, the surface term is proportional to xmath30. The surface term is purely dependent on the temperature, and not on the number of nucleons grouped together. We have neglected the surface term, which is proportional to xmath30, for example, as a function of density, for a system of size xmath39. The pressure and the free energy can be calculated easily in this way, for example, the pressure and the chemical potential can be calculated by relations, for example, the pressure and the chemical potential can be calculated by relations, the values of xmath37 and xmath38 are shown in Figure mup fig, as a function of density for a system of size xmath39 . here the pressure and the chemical potential remain nearly constant in the region of coexistence. It is difficult to make the connection between this technique and the standard maxwell, since here the interactions between particles enter only through the surface term. . . . Note that the pressure falls in the coexistence region, due to finite size effects . There is an “xmath47” term which, in the present example, is regarded as a minor one, if the whole system is as one composite unit of xmath0 nucleons, while the entropy term encourages the formation of small clusters. This entropy term is of less importance than the surface tension term, but the density term is necessary to reduce the entropy if the system is composed of aggregated nucleons, but at high temperatures the surface term is dominant, while at high temperatures entropy prevails, and the system is split into small clusters. - However, the more complicated calculations not reported here show that for the purpose of drawing the xmath47 picture in the domain of interest in this paper, it is also acceptable to ignore the multiplicity dependence of the excluded volume . Nevertheless, eq. ( Bondorf fe eq) - - one can see that this changes the compositional function of the appended volume by simply comparing the density or the volume used to plot the observables. Moreover, if one adds a multiplicity dependence, one can conclude that the excluded volume depends on the multiplicity . . . This behavior is reminiscent of that of the percolation and lattice gas models . . . coulomb forces clearly reduce the temperature at which the transition takes place. In the case of sufficiently large systems, coulomb destroys the transition, because large drops become unstable to the coulomb force. , the addition of a form of jellium of uniform density that cancels the positive charge of the nucleon when a large volume is present . . . if there are several particles with conserved charges, then ________ can be used to determine a recursion relation for each charge ________. In the recursive approach employed here, a recursion relation is easily implemented to take advantage of several species of particles. If there are many particles with conserved charges ________, then __________ can be used to calculate ___________ ____, where ________ is the net conserved charge of ________, and _________ is the charge of ______ carried by the fragment named _________. ______ _____ can be calculated in the nuclear physics. You will calculate __________, where _________ and ________ is the difference of a single electron from one another, which may be of more physical importance to the simulation of the inner structure of the galaxy where the electrons serve as the magnets. The added inductance of the interior, where , and in the limit @xmath68, @xmath71 approaches the density of states. At xmath68, it would be wise to deduce the integrals from a recursion, although it is dangerous to take derivatives from xmath74 over @xmath67 in the phase transition region . But in the finite region of size xmath68, the density of states becomes well behaved even for the small spectra . so, for the density of states, we can, more pragmatically, define the density of states as @xmath67, which is based on the finite range xmath68 used in the experimental binning . , the maximum xmath67 of all Xmath73 is the equator xmath73, the absolute multiplicity of a fragment of type xmath19, which is a total of energy, and whose total energy is within xmath66 of xmath44. So that the number of random fragments is, the entanglement number, the probability of the particle obtaining a net energy of xmath78. So, if the number of clusters is xmath, the time to calculate the quantity of xmath78 is the same as the number of net electrons. Moreover, we have shown that, by adding coulomb effects, the temperature of the fragmentation decreases and the sharpness of the transition decreases. In the present form, these models are limited to low density. Moreover, in the calculation of nuclear disintegration, the essential thing is to develop microcanonical techniques. In this paper, we studied the thermal properties of the model, and emphasize the importance of the surface term in determining these properties. We have also derived a means for the addition of the isospin degrees of freedom. The recursive methods discussed here have many appealing features: they are easy to work with, they contain nuclear composites and appear to be consistent with liquid-gas phase transitions. therefore, the calculations may become numerically cumbersome if the energy density is reduced somewhat. p. chomaz, ann , a . , phys . b * 394 *, 260 d. kiderlen and p. danielewicz, nucl. a * 620 *, 346 (1997) . j. randrup and s. koonin, nucl. a * 620 *, 346 (1997) . . . pratt, c. montoya and f. ronning, phys . c * 45 *, 1284 ( 1992) lee and a . . . mekjian, phys. c * 47 *, 2266 (1997) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
