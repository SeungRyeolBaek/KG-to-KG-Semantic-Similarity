a decade ago, galactic surveys showed large numbers of infrared dark clouds (irdcs, qxcite, qxcite) . these are identified as dark patches against the diffuse, galactic mid-infrared background. qxcite (see above), and qxcite , acknowledge that these are very dense, column-dense, and masses (*    rm   cm   - 3  $] , qxcite , qxcite ) . These studies (and qxcite) agree that they have very high density, column density, and masses (* xmath2  gtrsim     rm   cm  - 3   ] ,      cm  - 3  $] ,  qxcite                                  - 3   ] ,  xcite based on more detailed theoretical considerations, section - msf-limits - imposes quantitative limits on this intuitively observed reasoning. Fig. - msf-limit illustrates why the masses of the msf region have to exceed eq . (eq : mass - size - limit) , because they have to obey eq . (eq : mass - size - limit) (and not orion, which violates eq .) . based on the information in section - method , section - msf-limit confirms (with the known msf clouds) that eq . (eq : mass - size - limit) is a true msf limit (section - msf-limit) . figure - msf-limit - shows why the clouds in this region have to exceed eq (eq : mass - size - limit) . The data of solar-distance clouds that do not erupt into huge stars (for example, taurus, perseus, ophiuchus, pipe nebula) are taken from the paper ii (and with references to them) . The data for not erupting massive stars are derived from the bolometer observations: - xcite study fir color-species select msf candidates with cs - they were found to be dense but without radio continuum; - xcite map methanol-masers and ultra-deep hii regions; - xcite study the nearby cygnus - x msf site (we use their  clumps'). - a lower portion of msf clouds ( whose height is indicated by the yellow shading) must be larger than the smaller portions of the msf clouds. – with the interplay of slope, # xmath 7 and intercept, # xmath 9 , such clouds must also be larger than fragments in non-msf clouds. - from bolometer surveys we rely on: @ xcite study fir color-screened msf candidates with cs-typed gases, detected dense gas, but no radio continuum; @ xcite study methanol-masers and ultra-bright hii regions; @ xcite study cygnus-x sites (we use their  clumps’) . it is necessary to harmonize the definitions of mass and size. we assume that dust emission at xmath17 wavelength and optical depth at xmath19 wavelength are related by xmath19. This is a simple and simple mashup, which we show in fig. [2Ms.] to compare. From a dendogram method developed by xcite, starting from a set of local column density maxima, a fixed column density map is drawn with infinitely small spacing, which in turn yields series of mass-size measurements. In fig. [3Ms.] (Comparative mashup) the deformed masses are determined by the contour-seam of the contour and the effective radius, by xcite , in Fig. ; in Fig. (fig. 3Ms.) we substituted the opacity and the aforementioned 1.005 scale factor. Since we combine the dust emission and the visual extinction of the observed, we assume that extinction and extinction of the same scale are related by xcite . we also substituted the choice of dust opacity and the aforementioned 1.005 scale factor. we extract the scaled data from fig. Fig. [Fig. 4] (fig. ]. In the present case, we consider the dust emission at xmath18 and the optical depth at xmath20. In many cases (see Fig. (6): M. 13) the size of a sphere is in no way measured, and so the mass taken for the smaller of the radii has to be scaled by a factor of order of xmath26 (see Fig. (6): well-studied irdcs) must be reduced by a factor of order of xmath26 (see Fig. (6): Missing masses) has to be scaled by a factor of order of xmath26 (see section (7): mass-strength) , lc) approximates the mass-size limit for msf (see Section (6): Msf, the upper limit for msf) . for such sources, the mass contained in the column density contour is only a fraction of the total mass (eq. a 23 of xcite; the area at half-peak intensity is xmath24 2 . . . . ) . . . so we reduce the mass to a fraction, and we take half of the published size as the effective radius. , if a star-forming region contains more than one fragment (i.e., clump, core, etc.) , the most compact fragment (i.e., with maximum @ xmath6 / m -   rm  lim  [ ] ) is highlighted by a circle. - Fig - mass-size-comparison, title = fig-size-comparison , -comparison (section - well-studied - irdcs) - corresponds to a mass-size limit for msf (section - irdcs-yield) (fig-size limit) - approximates a mass-size limit for msf (section - msf-restraint) - and - Compared with eq. (deriving the mass-size limit), -comparison (see) - - comparison - - can be compared with eq. (deriving the mass-size limit) by calculating the mass ratio @ xmath28 (where xmath28 = 870 , m -  - pc -   - pc -  -  - -  - - -  - pc - It is very interesting that this figure, namely, will present an analysis of irdcs . . . but it is the mass-size data presented in fig. [fig.] of the cloud sample. . . . [Fig. 2] presents an analysis of irdcs . . . in general, however, it corroborates the hypothesis that eq. (Eq.: mass-size-limit) approximates a threshold for msf. this is explained in detail by fig. [Fig. 2] on the basis of mass-size data, which we separate and deduce from fig. [3] [4] , the aggregated measurements, at different lengths, to the X-trees. to a large extent, the irdcs have masses, for a given size, equivalent to the masses of solar clouds not forming giant stars (e.g., ophiuchus and perseus), irdcs, on the other hand, have properties between these extremes. This data, which we separately characterize in the X-trees, for all three samples, has the highest compactness of all. In all cases, @x-trees, @x-trees, of all the clouds, are compact at x-trees. This is based on the mass-size data given in fig. [Fig. 2]. In general, though, this analysis confirms the hypothesis that eq. (Eq.: mass-size-limit) is the limit for msf. “One is the average of the two to a given radius; another assumes a smaller radius. For the latter, the same is expected, for the gaussian fits only describe a fraction of the emission. On the other hand, similar biases are present in the data for msf regions. However, before we conclude, we must consider some other problems affecting our analysis. First, @xcite is the method of finding masses by clumpfind, while @xcite uses Gaussian fits. In the former case, paper i pointed out explicitly that the derived masses are, for the radius of our dendrogram, just a fraction of the ones that were obtained by our dendrogram. The latter is the same, since gaussian fits describe only a fraction of the emission. All this excludes irdcs of low mass and density.  second, at xcite, we use the case a 'c' (assuming bright ground), which we refer to as a more realistic case . @ xcite and @ xcite select clouds that are abnormally dark in xmath19 images. All this excludes irdcs of low density and mass. That is, the number of clouds – and the proportion of the number of clouds – and the proportion of the number of clouds – i.e., the fraction of the clouds – and the number and fraction of the clouds – i.e., the number and fraction of the clouds – kpc – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – kpc – – kpc – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – % – The mass, the mass and the density are measured by the axis of gravity and the volume-averaged density, @ xmath52. the set of eqs . . . [fig. msf-limit ] evaluates these limits for a star of xmath58 based on the efficiency of xcite. The typical star formation time is then, that is, within the set of eqs, the star of xmath59 is formed, and if it is formed in a star of a certain mass, @ xmath55, a mass reservoir of larger than @ xmath56 is necessary: , @ xcite, eq. 13, eq. (t) of gravity and @ xmath51 is the volume-averaged density , sent>. In the model, cloud tremor will only lead to the formation of a massive star if it is initiated in the theoretical tremor (see Figure . . . ) , eqs. [fig. msf ] and timescales of the Solar neighborhood clouds. [Although, of course, they will take the weight of the whole cloud and go to the place of the eqs. [Eqs. [Eqs.]] and , as if the cloud is completely collapsed, the largest part of the cloud will remain at the theoretical tremor, e.g., eqs. (Eqs. msf - ff] . , the latter is the case with some irdcs which are not related to msf. The irdc properties which have been mentioned in the introduction (at xmath2  gtrsim   10  5   rm  cm     $]) seem to have only the densest patches in very large and large irdcs. this indicates a new method of quantitatively comparing the structure of clouds with and without msf. The inverse in @ xmath8 does not mean that the msf and the non-msf irdcs are the same in absolute properties, while differences in slopes @ xmath7 imply relative differences in structure, such as deviations in the hierarchical structure of the cloud. The irdc properties referred to in the introduction (@ xmath2  gtrsim   10  5   rm   cm     - 3  $) only seem to characterize the densest patches in very large and massive irdcs. Thus it is necessary to be careful when utilizing the irdc properties to constrain msf initial conditions. However, these caveats are not usually considered in the analysis of irdc properties to constrain msf. This letter tests whether infrared dark clouds (Irdcs) can form large stars. Small, compact clouds, identified ascertaining a common distance, contain more than 50% of the total area-integrated column density of all irdcs. if this assumption is correct, only few irdcs (and not all irdcs, the size of a spherical ccccc) could form most of the galaxy’s gas. However, the general conclusion is far from certain. Most, and especially with regard to the properties of irdcs (see Section 236–338), it is not clear whether they could be made to form giant stars. These clouds are not suitable for msf, but they might well form stars and clusters of moderate mass (like perseus and ophiuchus) . Therefore, if this is the case, a few @xmath1 irdcs (and not all @xmath70: @xcite) might contain most of the star-forming gas of the galaxy. Nevertheless, if this argument is correct, only a few @xmath1 irdcs (and not all @xmath70: @xcite) might contain most of the star-forming gas of the galaxy. Observations of regions with msf (eq. eq. eq. eq. eq. mass-size-limit) are different from those which comply with eq. (eq. eq. mass-size-limit) in mass-size slope or intercept (fig.
