The most recently developed, unconventional electronic properties of monocrystalline graphene have attracted much attention in the experimental investigation, even though these have been thoroughly systematically studied by the theoretical study prior to the actual fabrication. In particular, since the monocrystalline structure of graphene is quite different from conventional metals, it is because its conduction and valence bands touch at the xmath1 and xmath2 points in the brillouin zone, around which the dispersion becomes linear, like a particle of relativity. In the present work, we present a theoretical study of the orbital magnetism in multilayer graphenes. The structure of the monolayer graphene is quite different from that of conventional metals, because the conduction and valence bands touch at xmath4 at the brillouin zone, where the dispersion is linear, like a particle of relativity. The physical structure of the monolayer graphene is quite different from metals, because the conduction and valence bands meet at xmath4 (the compass trough), around which the dispersion becomes linear, like a relativistic particle. The elasticity of the graphene surface is known to be trigonally warped at xmath4 (the point where the junction intersects) and this density disappears there. The chemical analyses were applied to graphite and to few-layered graphenes as a model for the intercalation of graphite compounds. We introduce the hamiltonian and its decomposition into subsystems in sec. [33] form, and present the calculation of magnetization in sec. [34] mag. 1 the length of a layer is given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 by the distance between adjacent layers . . . as a convenience we divide carbon atoms into two groups: atoms of group i are arranged along vertical columns normal to the layer plane, atoms of group ii are above or below the center of hexagons in the neighboring layers. The low energy spectrum is given by the states adjacent to @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the brillouin zone . The discussion and summary are given in sec. . . . a unit cell contains atoms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 on the layer xmath8 . Let xmath13 and xmath14 be the mass functions of the domains of the @xmath1 and @xmath14, respectively, of the sublattices of layer xmath17. It is a decision about whether a matrix has an appropriate basis that does not contradict @ xmath48. We follow the usual order of the matrix in the order of group i and then group ii, that is to say, @ xmath19, @ xmath49, @ xmath50, @ xmath41, ev. Thereupon, if we are looking at the interaction between layer 1 and 2 the matrix element corresponding to the vertical bond is Xmath25. Xmath25. Thus, if we take the Xmath32, @ xmath33, @ xmath41, @ xmath42, the hamiltonian for the graphene around the @ xmath1 point becomes Xmath43 with Xmath43, ev. , the effective hamiltonian for @ xmath2 is obtained by exchanging @ xmath45 and @ xmath46, and replacing @ xmath25 with xmath47. I shall have a relation between the wave functions of the inferred functions @ xmath68 and math69; and the corresponding wave function is also explicitly written as math68; i.e. a word of labeling, eq psi  [227][26] [30] for which the next of math65 atoms is placed in the atoms of math72, to be rewritten with the hamiltonian form ([31]]]. math63 represents the amplitudes of math19, math49, math50, math41 and it satisfies math67. Here the math60 atoms, i and ii, are of the same origin as math62, so math63 is odd when the math5 is even, while math63 is odd when math5 is odd, and therefore math64 is allowed only for odd math5 . I introduce the following two aspects to the description of the band structure of bulk graphite. The parameter 'xmath82' is known as the basis of the sub-math82, and is independent of xmath25 and xmath26, and is equivalent to the hamiltonian of the monolayer graphene. 30 This is similar to the principle in trilayer graphene, without xmath26, where the energy spectrum becomes superposition of that for a monolayer and for a bilayer. This principle is the basis of the hamiltonian matrix, and applies to any system with any number of layers and a trigonal warping. . . . then the subspace in question is closed with xmath78 for each xmath79. . . . therefore the hamiltonian of odd-layered graphene is composed of one monolayer and the bilayer, while the hamiltonian of even-layer graphene is composed of only two bases, xmath79, while a bilayer and not a bilayer. . . . the same idea was also proposed for tri-layer graphene without xmath26, where it was demonstrated that the energy spectrum is superposed of the monolayer and the bilayer. . . . and it is also noteworthy that xmath48-exclusiveness of the basis becomes important in the later sections, since this allows us to write the magnetization as a sum of contributions from sub-hamiltonians, which are independently calculated. At xmath 95 and xmath96, the eigenstate becomes a superposition of opposite waves traveling in opposite directions along the sloping-direction. The relation between the index of xmath63 and xmath100 is obtained by comparing the eigenenergy of xmath60, eq. (123d) to the 3d limit, xmath101, for the reason that, if xmath101 is omitted, the hamiltonian band of xmath108 becomes xmath109, which works on the reduced basis of xmath110, forming a rotationally symmetric dispersion with the effective mass xmath111) with xmath105 and xmath112 . . . . in a table Fig. . [fig. 2] . . . the hamiltonian band (eq. hm.) is obtained by replacing xmath25 by xmath103 and xmath26 by xmath104 in the bilayer. . . . [50] Right panel shows a view from the left. Said: the maximum of @xmath89 is near 2 the more layers of the graphene are multiplied by @xmath119, so that @xmath119 becomes twice as big as @xmath120. It is worth mentioning that the energies of a few layers of graphene are calculated in the density functional model for a few layers, namely, the energy band of a few layers of graphene. Its value is the intensity of the band, and that the maximum of @xmath119 is proportional to the intensity of @xmath119, so that it is very sensitive to @xmath89, while the energy of the higher band, @xmath103, is linear to @xmath89. Figure [fig Fig] shows the band structure around the centre of the Xma-segment in graphene with the Xma-segment axis, while we have included @xma-segment23, @xma-segment25, and @xma-segment26 in our graphene model, the extra parameter was omitted here, which may saturate the electronic structure. And these results differ, mainly, from ours, in that the centre of the xma-segment slightly shifts, depending on the xma-segment, and that a narrow gap opens in the center where conduction and valence bands (in one xma-segment) touch, and where different bands (with different xma-segment) are swept. And the decomposition of the hamiltonian graphene can be made using the general expression, arithmetic, which is based on linear response theory, arithmetic, which is a degeneracy, arithmetic, and a degeneracy of the 10th.12 and advanced by a proportion of the atoms of a sphere of mass.

(chi) - the integration of xmath143 over xmath139 is independent of xmath145. , in addition to Xmath143, the impurity smattering is made independent of the energy xmath142. The theory of a bilayer graphene described by the Hamiltonian is, as he says, a linear one, as he says in sec. [Section 16] . in the presence of disorder, the delta function is widened into a lorentzian with width xmath149 and the same area, xcite, that is, in the present model, having a constant xmath149. In the case of disorder, the logarithmic peak is broadened approximately as xmath164. In the presence of disorder, the logarithmic peak is congealed approximately as xmath164. In the case of disorder, the peak itself depends on the disordered element, and we may be able to use other methods of broadening it in more realistic forms. The susceptibility of a bilayer graphene described by the Hamiltonian (eq hm) was analytically calculated for the case of xmath154. The expression for xmath155 and xmath156 is given by xmath157 with xmath86, where xmath158 is a step function defined by xmath159, the susceptibility diverges logarithmically toward xmath0, becomes slightly positive for xmath160, and vanishes for xmath161 where the higher subband enters. * , the integral of @ xmath141 over the fermi energy is almost constant @ xmath173 as explained in sec. . . . . ; in this view, we calcine the results without the trigonal warping, @ xmath164, in the multilayer graphene with @ xmath169, @ xmath123, and several disorder strengths @ xmath149. The figure below, # Fig. chi, explains the susceptibility of the hamiltonian (« eq hm] in the case of maximum trigonal warping, @ xmath164. Moreover, there is a strong peak around @ xmath4, which is regarded as the result of the linear dispersions around zero energy. we have a figure for @ xmath166, which gives the expression of the negligible energy by absorption of the electron. Figure  [Fig. chi] shows the susceptibility as a function of @ xmath165 with several values of @ xmath149 . The total energy is divided into units of @ xmath164 . Figure   [Zu  Fig. ]: [Zu] , width _2] After that the core in the complex is composed of two layers, namely xmath176, and Xmath149. The diffraction of the band in xmath177 was calculated by a calculation based on the equations in xmath176, Xmath149, and which also has a very large ratio to xmath176. This equation is based on a generalized matrix structure of graphite, one of a multilayer nature, and its structure is basically independent, for in the intercalating layers, a strong electrostatic potential is generated, and there is a consequent redistribution of the charge between layers. For xmath177 the plot shows the contribution of each of the two, the primary peaks of which are made by the bilayer type. Using the known results for the bilayer, we can show that the ratio of the landau levels in the middle pocket increases approximately by xmath177, so that the singularity of the subband possesses a central, logarithmic top, as seen in Fig. [Chi][2] . Using known results in a bilayer, we can show that the order of landau levels in the middle pocket almost becomes @ xmath177. The xmath5 of odd origin always contains a monolayer, which is exactly the same as xmath176 and therefore is not shown in the inset . . . . The result of odd origin always contains a monolayer like band, which is exactly the same as xmath176 and therefore omitted from the inset. Xmath-188 then is a monolayer graphene of xmath-190; for xmath-190 this is a factor of xmath-190 and is the hamiltonian of xmath-190. This is a characteristic property of hamiltonian graphene of xmath-148, and it can be illustrated by the factor xmath-146 (which we have referred to as 'the Mono-layer') ). Using this we get a polynomial equation of xmath-190, and we get the coefficient of xmath-146 (the fine coefficient of a Delta Function, 'the fine'). we get a polynomial integral of xmath-146, but this is quite different from the mono-layer. the quotient of xmath-147 is as large as a single-number 1  xmath-190. This corresponds to the lorentzian with a width of xmath-149 and a volume of the Delta Function, 'the fine function', as long as xmath-185 . The quotient of xmath-146 in mono-layer graphene is the characteristic property common to all bi-layers, in Fig. . . . . . we can change the number of elements to one and the same quantity. For instance, if you substituted the eq. f . explicit ) with the real eq. f . explicit ) with real eq. f . oint (seq. f. explicit ) and replaced eq. f . oint with the real eq. f . oint (seq. f . ) with the real eq. f . oint, we can finally obtain the explicit form of the zero-thinn temperature sensitivity, as in the form shown in Fig. . . and this is evident from the general expression 'eq. chi'. This is an integral of the real function xmath200, and therefore is real. It was also said that the external electric field, which passes through the band, opens an energy gap. Nevertheless, we can prove in the equiv. mass approximation that the equiv. of susceptibility, at xmath165, is independent of all matrix elements without @ xmath121 and 'xmath126, which are responsible for the gap. “Within a hamiltonian’s limit, the integral of XMATH 217 is almost double that of XMATH 218 and, in the case of xMATH 218 itself, we have a bounded function of XMATH 218, a bounded function that gradually decays to zero for XMATH 213 with an ax of XMATH 213 . . . The proportion of the proportion of XMATH 217 to XMATH 218 is a function of XMATH 219. We can translate this into a function of XMATH 214 and @ xMATH 219 [the result of which is the double of the integer][18]. The hamiltonian has a function of removing the orthogonal parameter xmath23 from the equation of xmath375; while xMATH 26 gives an order of magnitude, nearly twice the order of xMATH 219, and the sum of all subsystems in xMATH 5 is approximately xMATH 5 times as large as the monolayer. "Since the absence of a magnetic field there is given by xmath224 a thermodynamic potential in the absence of a magnetic field and - [xmath222 -  2  non-umber                 -    g   rm v  g    rm s   gamma  -   gamma  2        inft     inft     inft     lim   lim  delta  right arrow  0   lim  lim  lim  lim  delta  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  delta   lim  lim  lim  delta  right arrow + 0  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  delta  lim  lim  lim  delta   lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  lim  delta  right arrow + 0  lim And the corresponding curves , like the two curves, are in a clear fashion equiventially paramagnetic (‘Subtle, Bilayer, Low Energy’) with @ xmath229 and @ xmath231, with @ xmath232 and @ xmath232, and with @ xmath235 and @ xmath235 , that gives a ' paramagnetic' curve. In the case of the bilayer graphene, the landau level with @ xmath154 in the region @ xmath230 can be calculated from the Hamiltonian (eq. q. q. mstar ) as @ xmath235 (« eq. mstar ] , ... and @ xmath235 , as is expected. Similarly, but more complicated, the curve is sloping at zero energy (@ xmath236 , @ xmath234), while the spacing gradually becomes constant as @ xmath237 increases. –  f(u )*  f(u           end  matched    end  aligned  ] At the point when a change in the total energy corresponds to a change in the energy of the total mixture, this is calculated as @xmath242 which gives the @xmath243 dependence of the magnetism. This is derived from the appendix 15 bstjsktj, where, in the case of the bilayer, we see that the magnetic spectrum can be derived from a monolayer or a bilayer. For the hamiltonian ( [eq: a bilayer, low energy]) having terms proportional to @xmath244 the susceptibility formula (eq chi ] with (eq f ) is no longer valid, because it was derived for systems in which @ xmath245 converges with @ xmath247, and @ xmath247 is compared with @ xmath242 , which is a constant. Therefore, we can expect that the detection of graphene magnetism is also possible with these techniques. we have examined the orbital magnetism of multilayer graphene by the process of bernal stacking, based on the bernal-level buckling. We have studied the orbital magnetism of multilayer graphene with the bernal-level buckling, and the effective mass approximation. The monolayer band exists only in dense layers, and gives a strong diamagnetic peak at @xmath250 .
