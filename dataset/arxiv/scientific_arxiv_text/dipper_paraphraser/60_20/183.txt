The present study analyzed an innumerable number of agns surveyed by xmm-newton and chandra; it has been concluded that the majority of these instances show evidence for a narrow, unresolved line at xmm-06—7 kev, due to oxidation of neutral iron; recent papers on these lines have been republished, including Gondoin ( 2003, ngc 3227) , page (2003, ngc 896), pounds (2003, mrk 766), petrucci (2003, mrk 841), turner (2002, ngc 3516), obrien (2001, ngc 359), reeves (2001, ngc 205), and many others. There are very few broad lines, however, in xmm data, for example, mcg@ xmath78 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 (gpnat2+). These lines have been found in xmm data, however, as well as in kaspi (2002), kaspi(2002), yaqoob(2002), that there are no changes in the scale of the lines. Here, however, some disagreement is expressed, as yaqoob(2002) remarked that the calibration changes of asca were in no way to affect the line profiles. The narrow line in mrk 509 is obviously ionised. , a baldwin effect is well known in the optical/UV emission lines, and first reported in 1977 that the ew of the civ (@ xmath8 = 1549) line was reduced with a greater uv light. In addition, in mrk 509, the narrow line is apparently ionised. the baldwin effect is well known for x-ray fek lines in the fe k lines observed by _george_ and _chandra_, as if from cold (non-carbonate) matter. This baldwin effect is known for x-ray fek lines, and baldwin (1977) first reported that ew decreased with increasing uv luminosity, and he (1977) reported that ew was stronger than luminosity in 12 of the fourteen lines tested, and that the strongest correlation is with absolute magnitude rather than with luminosity. The effects of baldwin have been well known for optical / uv lines, and baldwin (1977) first reported that the ew of the civ [9] line [10] (=12] in the shape of a string of weak arrows, as far as the inner accretion disc. In these observations, the small ew of mrk 509 is apparently in ion. The narrow ew in mrk 509 was also apparently ionized. The report consists of 53 type i agn ( Table i), which are mainly made up of our proprietary targets and public observations from the online XMM archive. Among these types there are 53 agn (Table ii) , most of which are combinations of our own proprietary targets and public observations from the online XMM archive . . . a literature search revealed four more objects, which contained the relevant data, (ngc 5506 matt 2001, ngc 3516 turner 2002, 1h 0707 @ xmath7495 boller 2002; ton s180 vaughan 2002 and vaughan 2003, private communication). The luminosities were calculated for the 210 kev rest frame and there were 90 per cent errors / upper limits based on the width of the rest frame. The narrow line core decease becomes lower in intensity with the increase in light, but one might conclude that the entire baldwin effect in their data could be attributed to the broad line alone. In this paper, we show and explain the baldwin effect of the narrow fe k @ xmath0 lines measured in _xmm_ data, and demonstrate the x-ray baldwin effect’ . . . The second method employed the slope of the best-fitted line in relation to the log-log of ew versus luminosity, that is, the weighted fit of the log-log, or the power law fit. Using this method, the slope was very similar, and a value of xmath70 . . . 18 . . 0 . in this case, agreeing with the simple spearman rank, the ew - luminosity correlation seems to be the dominant correlation. However, it was found that even after considering only those at z@xmath5 0 . 1 , there was an inverse correlation between ew and luminosity which was inseparable in magnitude (and the slope of 0 . . . 15 . . . , xmath5 . . . 5 per cent if the upper limits were excluded) was found. Therefore, the greater inelasticity of the line was, so to speak, proportionate to the ew. in this case, the ew was very low at the highest redshifts. Furthermore, a possible complication, for the highest luminosity objects tend to be radio- quiet, because the average x-ray radiation from the radio- quiet objects is about three times lower than that of the loud ones (zamorani 1981, worrall 1987). . . . it will be shown in the following table. figure ew-gamma plots the ew against the power law slope, measured over the 210 kev energy band. Hence, it is clear that there is a glare in the opposite direction, and there are more than a few steepest slopes that show the highest ews. Then, in order to show the overall effect more clearly, the figure ew-gamma plot is plotted. For a certain number of light-colored boxes, the squares were calculated as follows: ee=, e =, e = e =, e = x-math – where e = fe k – xmath, e = fe k – xmath, where e = fe k – xmath, where e == energy of fe k edge (here 7 kev for neutral iron) and e == the central energy of the line, both in units of kev – o f – if he – ‘Fe’ – as a result of the blr –– not simply due to beaming , yaqoob – 2001, for the ew of the narrow line in agn, at low optical depths – the following equation: - h – ‘h’, where h’ is the energy of the fe k on the edge (e. – t. ) and h’ is the central energy of the line, It is also necessary to know whether variations in the parameters could explain the observed ew - luminosity correlation. In any case, the size of the ngc5548 line may be too large to be directly derived from the blr, the predicted ew is 36 ev, whereas the measured ew is almost four times larger, 133 ev. however, the ew of the optical / uv lines is found to be low, and therefore it is impossible to explain them directly. Besides, the ew of the optical / uv lines are not reliably calculated, and one can reproduce the ew of the optical / uv lines using only modest values (a few tenths of percent). Moreover, no correlation can be made between the ew of the narrow line and the ew of civ @ xmath (calculated from wang, lu, and zhou) . the ew of civ @ xmath0 is a physical phenomenon different from the optical / uv lines (photoionisation) . however, the ew of civ @ xmath25 is expected to be very high, so that it is necessary to examine the ew of optical and uv lines , for this reason, it is briefly examined whether such correlations exist. These tests are conducted on objects with log_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ the property that the _agn__ of this__________________________—$ ; _____________,_________,_____,_ _______, _____, and ____, _e_________.__. . . , and ___________________________________________________________,______, and_____________.25 [Note 26] [The proportions, following the fashion in which the book is laid out, are compared with those of the netherworld in which dietrich (2002) tested the X-ray Blots of which the X-ray Blots This is a direct comparison with the –ray baldwin effect. Moreover, it is seen that the increase of =elements of =elements, as a result of =elements, is obviated by the abundance effect. Nevertheless, in many of the models for =elements (e.g., radovich & rafanelli 1993, recondo-gonzalez 1997) , the estimation of =elements is, as a matter of fact, hard to prove. The equation above, however, yields only the value of =elements n@22@55730 ; i.e., under conditions of =6 = =+, assuming a dissipating optical depth much less than unity. this is not in keeping with the hypothesis implied by the x-ray baldwin; if the x-ray baldwin is to be explained by a profound induced abundance of blrs, the resulting values are a great difference in scale. To determine the abundance of blrs from the line ratios is difficult, as a consequence of the thermostatic effect of feii (which is a major coolant) . , equidience from ngc 5548 for ngc 5548, which also supports a theory of the deformation of the disc. However, lee (2002) estimates a width of 11 000 @ xmath35 km s @ xmath6 for the unresolved narrow component; this then drops to 3600 @ xmath36 km s @ xmath6 for the “high” flux. but it should be noted that the measurements are all broadly consistent, and thus they indicate an origin in either the outer blr or the torus, but there are relatively few grating measurements of the line, so it is unclear how narrow the core is. nayakshin (2000a) discusses the baldwin effect that can be produced by ionization of the skin of the disc, if the luminosity increases. , the other possibility is that the narrow' lines can really be formed in the accretion disc itself. There is a difference between the nls1 and nls1 of the seyfert galaxy the nls1 shows much narrower emission lines, hence their name. yaqoob et al. (2001) measure a fwhm of 6000 kms s @ xmath6 which indicates that the line is not formed in the torus. ‘It’s an interesting question that the blr might still be an important source of iron repulsion, but one which we can’t fully explain as to why the weakest point of the blr is to be found in a reprocessing matter, indicating that its origin might be a little further away from the central engine.’2 This analysis confirms a possible support for the origin of the disc of accretion (Ptrucci 2002) . ‘ According to the results they show that for a thomson optical depth of 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – the ew of the line is a hundred ev, as if in an unobscured view; for a value of –2 – = 2, this value by one-quarter of a tenth of ev. They also find that as the opening angle increases, the ew decreases slightly.’ 1sent> , as they demonstrate, the line’s form is erratic between two observations, separated by 15 hours, though the variance in the line flux is not great. Although the line, like the prk 841 line, can still be considered a source of iron, it is hard to explain how the line is formed in distant processiving, which reveals that its origin is closer to the central engine. As has been said earlier, the presence of a neutral reflection component would indicate the presence of cool, compton-thin material (guilbert & rees 1988, lightman & white 1988, george & fabian 1991) such as the torus. However, it is not entirely surprising, as most of the objects are at a very low redshift, so that the area covered by xmm should not extend much above xmath1 10 kev, while the compton reflection hump should reach around 3050 kev; however, reflections may not be seen in the present data, but that does not prevent it from being not present. The calculations from krolik ( 1994) and ghisellini ( 1994) were computed at xmath1 141 and xmath1 127 ev respectively. matt, guainazzi et al. (2003) show that for a thin torus with n = 2 xmath22 = 2 xmath33 = xmath23 , the fluorescent line with ew at xmath1 80 ev ev – if this line were thin, no strong reflection would be expected. Such reflection, as we have said before, might indicate the existence of cool, noble material (guilbert & rees 1988; Lightman & White 1988; George & Fabian 1991) . he has known a few qsos, but few qsos are known. 549 A grimy iron line is observed in many qsos, for a matter of fact the ew decreases somewhat with increasing ew. The observation can be compared with the work of mushotzky & ferland (1984), who gave a theory of the luminosity-dependent effect of the torus and the basis for the baldwin effect. This theory is similar to work of mushotzky & ferland (1996), who proposed a contaminant parameter and hence the formic factor to explain the baldwin effect. In this way the increase in luminosity and the subsequent reduction in the formic factor, which in turn reduces the permeability of the torus, and thus, a decrease in the covering factor. The figure of the bluish-green line whose ew is observed is essentially a baldwin effect, in that the bluish-green line narrows out slightly with increasing luminosity. The great squareness of the band swells, thus reducing the diffusional range, leads to a decrease in the thickness of the cladding. This increase in the flux of the torus, which reduces with increasing luminosity, leads to a decrease in the thickness of the band. It is, however, possible that the bluishness of the line is the result of a reduction in the level of the veil. This reduction is in a word, in the same sense as a reduction in the thickness of the line. This decrease is like a reduction in the density of the membrane. The effects of the light-dependent - it would be a matter of some a few hundred m on a few thousand m , so that he could reach a resolution of this question.
