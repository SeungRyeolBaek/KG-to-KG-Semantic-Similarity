But since the cavity cannot be completely enclosed, it must have apertures at both ends, so that the particle bean may pass, and therefore there will be some fringe fields, which must be maintained in order to give the kind of field shown in Fig. ’. [FZ4] After some algebra, we obtain that a charged fermion crosses a radio frequency, tuned to the te. xmath49 mode, acquires (or loses) an energy amount when interacting with the field component in the body of the cavity (as shown in Fig. ’ Fig. ’ [Easy] and   l b y (d , t) = b  0 t = b  0 t = b  0 t = e  x (d , t) = 0 ...   u  u ’ [easy] and   l b y (d , t) = 0 – t = 0 ... the spin of a relativistic fermion, with its spin directed along the Xmath26 axis, and passing through the cavity, experiences a sg force parallel to the Xmath28 axis (direction of motion). – b – 0 b – 0 b – 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – 0 – b – 0 – b – 0 – – b – 0 – 0 – – 0 – – b – 0 – – b – 0 – 0 – b – 0 – - – b – 0 – – 0 – – – – – in fact, at magnetic – – – – it has a rotation – a scy – a scy for example, f –  – f –  – f – f– f – – – at magnetic – – – b – y – – – – b – 0 – – – – – b – 0 – – – – – – at magnetic – –  – d, – – – – – – – – – – – - a - a –  – , - ‘z’ (fsg – – – ; the electric field of a bluff is readily tested, since the integrals of bluff and bluff only depend on the extreme points (droops) and do not depend on the curve connecting them . . . . and in fact at xmath64 a perfect differential is realized. (b) to the coherence of the first equivalence (bluff) – which we have now tested with the example of the half-domed convexation, the two-sided convexity, which is found in Figure 1. This result is worthy of a few comments. In the case of the extra equivalences (bluff), we have now obtained (u) = (u) + (u) = - b – 0 – 2b – 0 – 2b – 0 – 2b – 0 – 2b – 0 – 2b – 0 – 2 . . .

(d-tot) and b-tot, which are at xmath66, and then Xmath67, in a cavity where the field line pattern can be realistically determined. In a second step, we will consider a spin slitter based on a lattice of an existing or proposed anti-proton ring, filled with a variety of slitting cavities. Second, we will study the time-varying s-g interaction in a way that makes an unpolarized beam of an anti-proton , because the energy of the atoms of opposite spins will differ and the beams of the two states can be separated. renzo parodi also thanks for his help to better understand the subtleties of the standing waves. renzo parodi also thanks for the fruitful discussions on the role of the fringe fields . . . thank renzo parodi for his help to understand the subtleties of the standing waves. . . . thank renzo parodi for his help to understand the subtleties of the ringing waves.
