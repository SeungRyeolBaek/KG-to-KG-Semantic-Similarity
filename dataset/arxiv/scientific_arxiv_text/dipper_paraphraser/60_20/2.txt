“The process of lepton decays of a charged pseudoscalar meson, called Xmath7, is of the kind @ xmath8 , where @ xmath9 , xmath10, or xmath11 . Because there are no strong interactions in the final state of a meson, Xmath11, such decays offer a facile way to study the complex and strong interactions that form the initial state meson. The quantity xmath13 expresses the magnitude of the charged meson and the charge. , the mass of the meson, and the charge of the meson ... [29] But these experiments were carried out on various models and on a lattice-qcd , the latter is considered the most accurate and accepted method. The experimental determination of decay constants is one of the most important tests in the area of non-perturbative qcd , it is necessary to determine the decay coefficients of the big mesons and the molars in them, because the large mesons are either less cwm suppressed or favoured. The experimental determination of decay coefficients with the leptonic decay of a large meson is very limited, as the rate is very low, because of the smallness of the magnitude of the relevant element of xmath26. The experiment of calculating the decay constants of the boson within the big meson is very limited, as the scale is quite small and there is a large magnitude of the important element of xmath28 , which is the basis of the existence of xmath12 . the proportions of @xmath36 and @xmath33 could be changed by varying the non-sm features. The ratio of @xmath36 would be affected by varying the proportions of @xcite. Additionally, the mass of the @xmath11 lepton removes the helicity suppression of the decays to lighter leptons. in the final state the presence of multiple neutrinos makes measurement of this decay difficult. The experiments @xcite of    ,   ,   ,   ,    ,    ,    ,   ,    ,    ,    ,        , - this disagreement is particularly puzzling, as the determination of cleo-c from xmath32 agrees with the lqcd of this quantity. . . . and a more recent computation of ccd. we report a new measure of the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay at xmath0 (charge conjugate modes are implied) from xmath1 to which we calculate the decay constant xmath33. a source of data, providing by the Cornell electron-storage ring ( cesr) and collected by the ccd detector in the center of mass ( cm) energy in xmath39 mev, near xmath3 peak of the production Xcite. . . . we have previously reported xmath43 and xmath3 data . . . And to the tiniest part of the reference, the aforementioned article and the accompanying table, a data-set of the same kind as those that was used in the measurement, the cleo-c detector at xcite is a general purpose detector, consisting of a small, circumference-reaching six-layer stereo-wire drift chamber, a 47-layer main drift chamber, a cherenkov (rich) detector, and an electromagnetic counter consisting of seventy-two csi crystals . . . the rich detector covers an area of approximately xmath52 % of xmath47 and gives additional separation of pions and . . . . . a companion article relating to  xcite, . . , with  xcite, showing the same measurements as the ones that are used in this measurement. There is a finite number of electrons in a calorimeter; the flux density of the optical irradiance is xmath53 at xmath54 gev and xmath55 at xmath56 mev. The resolving energy of the photon is xmath53, the ratio of the radiance of the rain (@xmath57) to that of the momentum (@xmath57) . In this way we test the efficiency of the selection of a signal, the background process, and the composition of the background . In physics events are generated by evtgen at xcite, tuned with much improved knowledge of the decays of charm, and the final radiation (fsr) is modeled by the photon model @ xcite. The physics model of the initial radiation, which is shown in xmath3 is based on cross-sections of the initial state radiation (isr) obtained from the cleo-c energy scan at xcite, near the cm energy where we collect the sample. The reconstructed @ xmath61 in the st sample is either primary or secondary to the reconstructed @ xmath62 (or @ xmath63) . The reconstructed @ xmath61 is either primary or secondary to the reconstructed @ xmath63. The reconstructed @ xmath61 is, respectively, the result of a class of @ xmath3 pairs, the reconstructed @ xmath66 is the branching fraction of hadronic modes employed in the st sample, and the reconstructed @ xmath67 is the efficiency of a class of @ xmath63. The yield can be expressed as @ xmath71, where @ xmath71 is the branching fraction of leptonic decay, and the subbranching fraction of /sent>. , math72 , math73 , where math74 is the effective beam efficiency . so that the ratio math78 is almost independent of the most systematic effects associated with the st, and the branching fraction math73 is nearly independent of the efficiency of the tagging mode. By combining the three two-body hadronic decay modes, we can produce an absolute branching fraction of the st decay, without the need to know the integrated luminosity or the number of math3 pairs , math73, where math75 is the effective signal efficiency . . . All of these resonance components are absorbed in the large synchrotron windows (see below) atop the @xmath81 peak in xmath82 and the @xmath83 peak in xmath84. – the effect of the tag bias in xmath88 is represented by the efficiency of xmath74 as defined by xmath89, where xmath90 is the average efficiency, if the recoiling system is a signal leptonic decay with single xmath59 in the other side of the tag. Thus, the effect of the tag bias in xmath88 can be expressed in terms of the signal efficiency in xmath74 which is defined by xmath89, where xmath90 is the average efficiency when the recoiling system is the signal leptonic decay, and single xmath59 in the other side of the tag. . . . we identify a st by examining the invariant mass of the tag Xmath100 and the recoil mass against the tag Xmath101 . . . , it is negligible in our selected clean tagged modes. We rewrite the decay by combining two oppositely charged paths that originate from the same common vertex and which have an invariant mass within Xmath93 mev of the nominal mass Xcite . . . as shown in sec. . . [ Sec. ] , this effect is negligible in our chosen clean tagged modes . . . we need the resonance decay to satisfy the following mass windows around the nominal masses Xcite: math94 mev and math96 mev . . . , the cap to be located within a square root of the function of xmath107, if the initial mass was not within xmath107, if the nominal mass was within xmath108. 002 - The four-phase force of the tag, with xmath105, derived from xmath106, and the nominal mass of xcite within the domain of xmath91. , in order to find the background of our st and dt in the wrong tag (in the wrong tag that happens to be within the domain of xmath109) we use the sideband of the invariant mass of the tag . > . We take the st and dt ratios from the sum of double-gaussian signal function and the second-degree chebyshev polynomial background function, and this is what we get. The tilt-force of the one-band, relative to the two-band, is summarized in table [Fig. 5] . [23] For each of the three modes, the mass distribution is invariant, as shown in fig. 5. [25] The tilt-force of the one-band, relative to the signal diffraction region is shown in fig. 6. [27] The average rate of decay in the one-band diffraction region is computed. The tilt-force is the factor of the sideband sizing factor, the second is the factor of the sideband sizing factor. [26] This is the rate of decay in the signal diffraction region. The error of knowing the error of the knowing of the error of the operation of Xmath131 leads to systematic uncertainty in the measurement of the quantity of troughs in the signal region, which has an effect on our branching fraction measurement. In this way, we obtain a correction of Xmath135 for the extra energy required, and systematic uncertainty in each of the three requirements of xmath136 (all of them equal, by a random chance) . This method, by varying the semileptonic decay of the semileptonic decay of the branching fractions, is then compared with the loss of trough efficiency of the data vs. mc events . . . ‘ The background in the candidate samples of charge symmetric processes, such as the Xmath143 decay of a signal electron, and the Xmath143 conversion of a signal electron, are measured by measuring the incorrect-signal electron in events with Xmath147. The uncertainty in these backgrounds produces a Xmath141 uncertainty in the measurement of Xmath146 . Other sources of systematic uncertainty include xmath68 ( xmath137) , tag bias ( xmath149), tracking efficiency ( xmath148), xmath59 identification efficiency ( xmath150) and fsr . . . ‘‘— ‘Tax Rate’ (Tax Rate) and ‘Scale’ (Tax Rate)’ (Tax Rate) . In this way, we can calculate the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decaying at the base of @xmath153 through @xmath154, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. In summary, assuming the standard decay curve . . . (Tax Rate) we obtain the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay from @xmath153 to @xmath154 . . . in which the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic. We will assume @xmath161 and use the value . . . @xmath164 [Tax Rate] as our model. xmath43 with xmath0 decays we obtain Xmath166 and Xmath0 in a decay of xmath173 as in eq. ([Eq]) with known masses. This result is derived from absolute branching fractions only and is the most precise determination of the xmath91 decay constant. combining this result with our other measurement Xcite of Xmath169, via Xmath44, we obtain Xmath172 combining this result with our measurement Xcite of Xmath171 we obtain the branching fraction ratio xmath172 , which is consistent with xmath173 the value predicted by the sm with universality of the density of the lepton, as given in eq.
