I will then develop the general goal of the study of the complete statistics of the particle absorption by the absorber. We will now describe a lattice gas with a spatially simple exclusion (ssep). This gas is in general an ideal vacuum for the study of diffusion-controlled chemical reactions in crowded environments such as in a living cell. In this case we will test a lattice gas of which, surrounded by a pair of exclusions, each particle can ping to a neighboring lattice if it is not filled with another particle. If it is filled with another, the move is disallowed. Here we will extend the target problem in several directions. first, we will consider a lattice gas occupied by a pair of searchers (for the whole of this paper, we assume that the searchers have interacting exclusions). The differential behaviour of this gas is still described by the diffusion equation (Difeq), with @xmath23 @xcite, and thus a difference of much greater magnitude than the average for the ssep. However, as we have seen, the long-term asymptotic of the target survival probability at xmath1 for the ssep is indistinguishable from that of the rws. The two results of xmath8 differ by a numerical factor; even their xmath10-dependent dependence is different for xmath17. Third, besides analyzing xmath1 in different regimes, we also find the most likely history of the gas density conditional on the target survival till time xmath2 . in the next section we present the mft-based solution of the target survival problem. We prove that the two basic solutions, annealed and quenched, play a central role in higher dimensions, when we examine intermediate asymptotics of xmath1 in xmath26, that is, when the diffusion length xmath2 is much longer than the lattice constant, but much shorter than the absorption radius xmath0 . It is this density , this , that determines the main term (also the results) of the survival probability . The mft is very suitable for the analysis of large deviations in lattice gases, especially the (inadvertent) survival at long intervals . The mft is well suited to analysis of large deviations in lattice gases, including the (invariable) survival at long intervals. "Now we have introduced the theory of macroscopic fluctuation. It is based on a Langvin equation that provides a faithful, large-scale description of a broad class of diffusive gases: @ xmath35 +  nabla  cdot  left [  squarer  sigma (n)  text  eta [1] ] . our result is summarized in sec. . . . We introduce the theory of macroscopic fluctuation, and refer to the references above for details. . . . . , mft can be derived from the langevin equation, which provides a faithful large-scale description of a broad family of interacting gases. The mft, and its extensions to refractory particle systems, have proved highly effective and versatile. . . . . for the un-interacting rws, exact microscopic derivations of @ xmath1 are presented for the annealed and quenched positions, and for xmath17, for xmath32 and xmath33.

We shall consider the target survival problem in an arbitrary dimension @ xmath43 , the boundary conditions for the target are @ xmath44 @ xcite, where the condition for @ xmath45 is just an arbitrary constant. - d (q) is Here, in the particular case of @xmath14, we are interested, corresponds to @xmath56 @xcite. ( pt ). In this case, the total flux of the particles to the target disappears at every moment @xmath57. The solution of the mft equations for @xmath58 yields an optimal trajectory, the most probable density history of the system, based on the number of absorbed particles. The equation (actionmainssep) becomes @xmath71 when @xmath66 is scaled by @xmath2 and @xmath67 by @xmath22 @xcite, we can thus obtain eqs. a small @xmath6 in the case of the small, in the case of the large. [17] . in one spatial dimension, _xmath17, the parameter @ xmath0 (and hence @ xmath75) is irrelevant because of the symmetry of the ensuing mft problem. xmath79. Then, if xmath79 were given, then a constant price must be incurred to prevent the particle flux from vanishing at xmath57. Hence, xmath84, and from eq. ([zero lux]) at xmath85, the main contribution to the action @ xmath60 by eq. ([zero lux]) is the same as that of the eq. ([zero lux] ; hence, when xmath27 the decisive contribution of the action @ xmath60 from eq. ([actionmain]) comes from the non-decompositional solution of the Mft equations that obeys the boundary conditions in space but not the boundary conditions in time. therefore eq. ([zero lux]) is @ xmath82, and eq. ([zero lux]] is @ xmath84, and eq. ([Stiffness]) becomes @ xmath84, and from eq. [Stiffness] @ xmath84, and from eq. [Stiffness] to eq. [Stiffness] , the high value of eq.

The optimal fluctuation becomes unconstrained by the length of the process, and details of the initial condition become irrelevant. Figure 3 represents the density history of the complete non-stationary mft problem for a sufficiently small block of blocks @ xmath6 and xmath31. The sphere of equilibrium has a slight deviation from that of the sphere of equilibrium, where @ xmath63 and xmath112 are of the same size. The vertical solution (qd) and vd obes (qdrw) are of insufficient dimensions to satisfy the boundary conditions in time. further, eqs. (qd) and vd obes (qdrw) have a diminished contribution to the sphere of equilibrium for the sphere of equilibrium. Moreover, the density history shown in figure 3D shows that the density history obtained by enlarging the non-stationary mft problem is calculated from the least spaced portion of its value at xmath6 and xmath31, and this portion, if sufficiently small, fits the theoretical prediction of q3 (q3). xmath116 ( to remind the reader, all the lengths are rescaled by xmath22) : xmath116 in the first variables it is of the order of the characteristic diffusion length @ xmath77 where the stationary solution crosses over to a time dependent one. Thus eqs. (q2] and v2 are right with logarithmic accuracy. The same is true for the short time limit, @ xmath26, the deterministic theory of diffusion - controlled absorption is non-stationary. The deterministic theory of absorption is not stationary. The non-stationary case, for any @ xmath26, is non-stationary. This means that @ xmath123, for example, eq. ( action2), the same is true for eq. xmath122. So @ xmath122 eq. (action2) correspondingly eq. (action2) reduces to eq. v2 with the same logarithmic accuracy. We will set the initial condition, -xmath - at xmath - so that -xmath - , we will find -xmath - at xmath - at xmath - so that -xmath-137. Then, on rescaling -xmath-66 by -xmath-133 and -xmath-131 by -xmath-132 eq. (pt - eq.) , becomes -xmath-136 and -xmath-138 eq. , where - -f -end - aligned - ... ... ... we assume a certain condition, - -xmath-129, and demand - xmath-130 . , as in other examples, - the mft problem for the rw is solved , we simply take the mft problem for the rw and, by using these results, we compute the inverse correction in the rw. at the end of this subsection, we solve the problem numerically for a range of values of -xmath10 . In the limit of -xmath110, we can decompose -136 in the hamiltonian density ( ham) and in the corresponding terms in the mft equations, we arrive at rw . a single point on the right of the void. The peaks of the density, which appear at the beginning of the void, are very small. Essentially the dynamics of the gas is governed by the deterministic equation ( [difeq]) and corresponds to the inward flow of the gas. at xmath113 we have xmath155, which is as we saw in xmath105, at xmath130, and in xmath131, taking the limit of xmath135 xcite, we have xmath155. Figure rwquenchedq – Figure of the density history of the system as explained by eq. (qrw) . at xmath127, as we can see, xmath156 behaves linearly in xmath131, as we saw earlier. – but at xmath155, however, xmath156 is quadratic at xmath135 , as in the stationary solution. a muffling eq can be obtained from the microscopic arguments . . . . “separated equations” (DidQuest1; see “Appendix .” . . , Sec. - annealed and appendix ). . . .

The case is as follows: the calculation is based on the universal asymptote (soa.1); - for small and moderately large @ xmath131, the density history of the system is similar to that of rws, with a rapidly forming density void and a density peak; the density peak is lower than for rws, and becomes lower and broader as the @ xmath10 reaches xmath108. Figure [Sepnum] shows the numerical solution for the deterministic first condition and on xmath17. figure [Sepnum] shows the numerical solution for the deterministic first condition and on xmath17 , it's a good fit, because for small xmath101 , it's a very good fit, as in actionrw2 . This solution gets very costly at xmath10 very close to 1 . The available data indicates the divergence of xmath192 as xmath193 . The cost of optimizing a concentration is now called the cost of the optimal concentration. As we have already seen, in the MFT form, the annealed set is represented in one dimension by the initial condition, which comprises a combination of xmath204 and xmath205, and in addition to xmath207 and xmath210 , we have xmath211  =  lambda  ,  theta (x)  theta  . There is no peaks at Xmath113 and Xmath9: the density is monotonically increasing with Xmath131. It is interesting to note that, for Xmath113 and Xmath9, the optimal density at Xmath227 is the same as predicted by the deterministic theory, eq. ([difeq]), for Xmath113, at Xmath155 the optimal density at Xmath115 is a quadratic function of @ Xmath115 at small @ Xmath115 as before. Therefore, we can calculate @ Xmath224. in the new variables xmath217 and xmath218 the initial condition ([inann]) yields: @ xmath219 solving the diffusion equation ([qt]) with this initial condition and boundary conditions - xmath220 and xmath221 we obtain @ xmath222 where @ xmath147 - so we calculate @ xmath225 - and meanwhile @ xmath113 is described by eq . [ stepp]; that is, @ xmath223 is still described by eq . [ stepp] Hence the integral in the interval around the interval between xmath and xmath 102 can be elucidated by the formula @ xmath 222. The integral in the interval around xmath 131 can be assessed by the formula @ xmath232. The equation is still given by eq. vrw; but the integral in the interval between xmath and xmath 270 is given by eq.  qann             ,        ,        ,          ,         ,        ,  ,   the results of                   , ,     , For very small and finite quantities, it is described by eq. ([actweakan]) . ([actweakan]) For very small but finite quantities, eq. ([actweakan]) . . . here, as in a word, eq. ([actweakan]) show that in one dimension the survival probability of the organism is different from that of the quenched one in the quenched one. As a matter of fact, by denoting xmath247    sigma [q (r)]    ] , we can make an ordinary differential equation, a one-line ordinary differential equation (Ode) , whose general solution is Xmath 249, . where xmath 249   ”  ” ” (Realignment) , we can translate eq. (Salignment) into a linear and ordinary differential equation (ode) , which is a linear differential equation, a ode, whose general solution is Xmath 249 , [15] . if and only if q general exists. Then the integrals converge at q general. Thus the condition (crit) is satisfied, and the solution (q general) exists. (p general) The rescaled action is the following: q general – 5 2 – Label – scaled general – end – aligned –  –  –    –  –  –  –  – end – aligned –  –  –  – ,  (p general) – as a result, – q general – 552 as a result of specialized rw and ssep-induced eqs ( p general) and q general ([2] respectively. So, for the general rw and ssep-induced, eq. ([5]) is satisfied, and the solution ([5] is present. If @ xmath6 is small and @ xmath7, xmath1 is mostly made up of an exact stationary solution of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (mft), which we have obtained. When @ xmath6 is large and @ xmath3 is small, @ xmath4 is different, and this is also dependent on the initial condition: whether the initial condition is determinative or random. In our work, we evaluated the survival probability of a spherical target of radius xmath0 with a density of xmath3, with a density of xmath10, which is followed by a relation between @ xmath2 and xmath6 in the presence of free diffusive particles (searchers) which interact with each other through a inclusion as described by ssep. . the results depend on the dimension of space xmath3 and on the basic rescaled parameter xmath4 . when xmath6 is small and xmath7 is small, the survival probability is largely driven by the stationary solution of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (mft) that we have obtained. This method has been applied to a spherical target with radius of xmath0, with density xmath10, that interacts with each other by exclusion as described by ssep. and so on a large but finite interval xmath7, xmath272 scales at very long times, whereas at xmath17 it scales at xmath132. here we present the macroscopic theory of target survival, the target survival probability of xmath1 for rws in one, two, and three dimensions. xmath1 is a test for the properties of the first conditions (regular or deterministic) and also, for xmath31, a more accurate asymptotic of xmath1 in the deterministic setting. In a nutshell, the macroscopic theory of the target is a new direction in the classical problem of the target survival probability. . In general, the macroscopic theory of the target brings new directions in the classical problem of the target. two of us (bm and luk) thank the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics for the hospitality and the infn for the partial support during the completion of this work. In all these calculations we have set @ xmath126 . we start with a random initial condition and consider rws on a large but finite interval . . . in the mft supposition . . . we finally determine, for xmath31, a more accurate asymptotic of xmath1 in the deterministic condition. - * - left (fee-frac  2 n - 0 - sqrt  t                      ,        ,             ) in agreement with eq . . . we interest ourselves in the regime of  xmath291 when the characteristic diffusion length is much larger than the lattice constant. Thus, we assume that the number of rws in the interval is equal to  xmath280 . . . and ref. . . . In this case, we present an accurate result, also including an exponential factor. . . . In the following case, we take the logarithmic mean:    n                   , ‘In the case of a random initial condition, we average the probability ( prob: 2d) for all the random locations of the particles in the annulus at xmath302 and find the average single particle non-hitting probability at xmath303, when xmath305 is approximately equal to xmath305. So, the probability that a particle has not hit the target is @xmath306     pi n 0 (l  2   2  ) ,        exp !  to  exp !     pi n 0 (l  2  r  2 )    to   to  exp      to  exp  !’ Now, as in the one-dimensional, we employ the same method as in the one-dimensional. For the random initial condition, we average the probability (in this case, prob: 2d) over the random locations of the particles in the annulus, and calculate the average single-particle non-hit probability,                            pi n 0 t I would be afraid to say that I have no degree, that I have no degree, that I have not such a degree, a degree of maturity, a type, or a superiority, of values and the knowledge that it is quite important. It is to be noted that if the first dykes are randomly chosen, I shall start with the first dykes of the radial surface, and then we will average over the initial dykes of the radial surface, in order to give the average, single particle non-targeting probability . . . . [247] In contrast to xmath17, the leading-order results of the dykes of the randomly chosen starting points will coincide in the limit of xmath27. – “This is the logarithm of and, ignoring all the exponential elements, we will increase the logarithm to the second order and, by virtue of xmath34, be replaced by the summation by the integration, which is done by virtue of xmath34 .

Even at the long time limit, @xmath328 eq. (two terms) is more accurate than the leading-order asymptotic that originates from the stable-state mft. even in the long time limit, @xmath328 eq.
