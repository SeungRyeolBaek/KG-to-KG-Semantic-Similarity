The orientation of the person moving from the land to the sea is important for transport planning, and in order to improve the transport, the manager has to regularly assess the passenger flows, and the factors that influence this flow. Most of the literature, however, is devoted to the observation of passenger journeys. They assume that the person is accustomed to the traffic of the town and the way he passes, and thus he maintains a strict gaze on the city traffic. Various ways of estimating the orientation of the land and the movement of the people are used in the estimation of the route matrix, for example, with traffic counts, or road traffic flows. But the measurement of the od matrix is difficult and expensive, especially when one combines incomplete counts with other information, and then can be done at a reasonable rate. It is most commonly the case with the town rail, the sydney bus and the sydney ferry, which manage the public transport in the area around the city of sydney, Australia. Most of these papers, however, are not directed towards the passengers. They are usually based on the observation of the passengers, and assuming they know where they are going in and out of the public transport. Most of the papers in the literature take advantage of this observation, and use it to estimate the od-matrices by the use of traffic counts, and gravity. , kostakos - xcite proposes a wireless detection of the passenger trips, and lundgren and peterson - xcite - based on a set of target routes already defined. But none of the cited works involves the collection of survey data. The goal of this paper is then to develop an estimation method for the origin and destination of the transport network, based on the information received by the public transport users and / or from the previous surveys. Like the article from bierliaire - xcite, we use the survey data collected by public transporters, and we calculate the approximate structure of the matrix, estimating its eigenvalues. we also propose a method of regression, which account for the influence of the unbalanced variables, for instance, weather conditions or time of year. In their article, they used the parking surveys to infer an a priori estimate of the od matrix, and they combined this prior with the partial observations of the network flows to derive a generalized least square estimation of the od matrix. Despite the novelty of this article, this article assumes that the behaviour of car-users and public-transport users is identical, at least regarding their respective od matrix. Moreover, they use only the partial information collected from the parking surveys. Besides, the following sections describe how the measurements are obtained and what errors can be expected. we explain in section [sec. om] how the measurements are obtained and what error is expected from the measurements. We first introduce the passenger-model and then begin the observation model. But we will add in a moment: a casual passenger is defined as a return journey that is not repeated regularly (i.e. daily) . . . and a day return journey, which is required. As a rule, people who go to a festival once in a while will buy their ticket and return the same day. In this case, there is an obvious time dependency, referred to by xmath2 by the period in which the trip takes place (for example, a day). Let Xmath5 be the matrix of measurements. Here, we have in the subsection “convenience”, “department,” “return,” and “return,” which are different measurements. The table below describes the various measurements . . . In the first case (called Xmath6), all stations in the network have these machines, in the second case (called Xmath7) only the major stations have these machines. It is, therefore, possible to estimate Xmath0 by the observations indicated in section “om” (as well as to measure it directly) . The measures provided by the passengers are very different, and, considering them all, one can directly estimate Xmath0. And this information remains completely unknown. For major stations, we have the total number of passengers who have crossed the gates of the station, in and out. For stations without gates, we need to estimate by survey. we have the total number of people who have a valid zone ticket at time @xmath1 (e.g., on the day of the survey), and this number can be denoted by @xmath13. And for each of these completely different observations, we need a well-fitting model based on reasonable assumptions. To make a good statistical inference, we need two assumptions: * The traveler must act independently of the validity of his ticket; * The regular traveler must commit himself to a return journey each working day. remember that @xmath17 is a matrix of count; the main assumption is that the number of passengers is the sum of the casual passengers (@xmath17) and the regular passengers (@xmath15) plus a matrix indicating the extraordinary big events, such as major sporting events or large concerts (called @xmath20) , it could be assumed that the casual traveller’s journey is a poisson one, i.e. xmath22 is distributed according to a gamma distribution, xmath24. In this section we compute the stationary parameters of the model . . . we call these xmath24 and xmath24 respectively. According to this we define xmath28 as a negative binomial with parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 (we will call these xmath27) . . . and as the simple maximum likelihood estimation does not depend on the arbitrary nature of the sample, we shall suppose that, given no space-time dependence, @xmath5 is independently distributed as @xmath5; that is, for several realizations . . . . but unlike the casual traveler, we do not suspect an over-dispatch but an under-dispatch, and therefore, @xmath29 and @xmath30 . . . in this , the estimation will be performed in very precisely defined steps. Thus, the estimation of the maximum likelihood should be well accomplished, especially for large sample sizes . . . for the same reasons as described for the casual matrix, we will adopt a negative binomial distribution to account for the uncertainty of the regular traveler’s information. Therefore, let @xmath25 and @xmath25 be the expectations of @xmath32 and @xmath34 . . . but, unlike the casual traveler, we do not suspect an over-dispersion, but an under-dispersion, so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 . . . therefore, the estimation of the maximum likelihood should be able to work very well, especially for , one has to estimate the mean of the average departure and arrival day. , one has the times of entry and departure of major stations, but one does not have a complete estimate of the number of long-term tickets to and from the major stations. This is assumed to be symmetrical, one can diagonalize it so that, for example, for example, @xmath47, where @xmath48 is the projection matrix of eigenvectors of @xmath32, and @xmath49 is the diagonal matrix of @xmath44 with terms equal to the respective eigenvalues. Here we assume that only a proportion of the people will travel on day xmath1 of the day, where xmath40. Therefore, we can consider the matrix with the available departure and arrival data. So we are dealing here with a problem, which is to determine the matrix with the available departure and arrival data. The goal is to find out the general shape of the matrix xmath12, with the available departure and arrival data. Here, we assume that, as a general rule, the structure of xmath32 is known (i.e. the eigenvectors are known), then if the structure of xmath32 is known (i.e. the eigenvectors) then we can diagonalize it, so that , xmath47, where xmath48 is a projection matrix of eigenvectors of xmath32 and xmath49 is a diagonal matrix with terms equal to the respective eigenvalues , then And so, as we know xmath48, if we know xmath48, the maximum likelihood would be tractable and provide a numerical estimate of xmath32 (where xmath64 being the eigenvalue of xmath3). Hence, the probability in the following equation would be, if he knew xmath48, so he would be able to estimate xmath32 with the approximation of xmath32 (with xmath61 being the eigenvalue of Xmath3) . . . “[c]“2]. Therefore, we have, according to eq. diag , we have, “Eq. ” . . . ; the maximum probability in the next equation, if we suppose, yawn, di l t p  t vert r z , p  r           . . . (the sum j r  ij  ij  ij   ij  z, p  r  )   ad v  ]   ad t  nb  (the sum _ j r  ij  ij    z, p  ] . “We shall find the solution of the equation eq. mle—a classic optimization problem. In order to work out the solution, we shall need to add some constraint to the ml estimations. The problem with this estimation is that we cannot guarantee that it will satisfy the underlying constraint of the density. The simple likelihood shape guarantees that there is a solution and it is found by any standard optimization function. However, it is very unlikely that this solution will satisfy the constraint. Thus, the best option, at present, seems to be the diagonal elements of the matrix, which naturally fill in the constraints of # 1 and 2 of the matrix. * Thus, all elements must belong to the interval # 72 end  aligned                        end  rounded              end               [2]. – For example, if we want to take the more realistic view of the situation, it seems clear that we must take into account the spatial, temporal, and multivariate influences on the number of passengers, and then at the parameters of our analysis – and the proofs of propositions 1 and 2 are presented in a certain part. - Let    mathcal  p    lambda  end  aligned              – – and then we have     mathcal         lambda  end  aligned           –      – – and we have,     mathcal  p      lambda  ik   sum        x   –  sum l x – x – l – l – t    – It is still difficult to develop and implement a survey that yields accurate information. Moreover, we take xmath88 as an estimate of the eigenvalues of xmath32, relying on the assumption xmath101 , which is the key to obtaining the propositions xmath102 . in section [sec: a] it is assumed that the similarity of the matrix xmath31 and xmath32 relies on the projection matrix xmath48 and xmath100 . hence the varying xmath97 estimated from xmath31 will help to recover the matrix xmath32 . a more complicated solution would be to use the same technique as before, but the assumption that xmath48 is no longer constant is no longer valid. , then a space-time model is required , then a space-time model for the passenger of the regular zone is needed . - Despite the survey's unknown biases, it provides useful information. , despite the survey's biases, it provides useful information. The equation xmath113 is considered, and the error is explained, eq. . . noise. In the last line is a bias calculated according to eq. . . noise. The estimation of the ad-hoc is indicated in green. The ad-hoc estimate is drawn in green. The figure fig. sensnoise shows the results of the ml and ad-hoc estimation for the two variables, which were distorted by the same two factors, with a different number of observations and a different degree of bias. The difference between the two equations is based on the structure of the bias. The ad-hoc estimation is indicated in green. q .  noise, and the bottom line for  .  noise . the ad-hoc estimation is performed by the estimator. n, in eq .  noise , the vectors of the vectors are randomly added without any real value of the parameter. In this way, the estimators are more able to estimate the test results, when the measurement is performed by eq .  noise . . . . so we expect that the ad-hoc estimation is more robust than the naive ml estimation, whatever the type of noise is added. , width = 264, height = 226] – ci. Finally, and besides, the ad hoc estimation is more consistent, and it is less affected by the number of observations. let m be a matrix of parameters @ xmath123, representing the stations @ xmath123 (i.e. the probability of @ xmath124). the matrix @ xmath123 has the following values, @ xmath125 – % , width = 264, height = 226] + ci .

This report will be given as follows: it is numbered in a piece. The arrow represents the links between the wharfs, and it is that by taking a single ferry one can gain access. For that, the total distances are calculated by calculating the distances of each wharf and by calculating the longitude and latitude of the units. Nevertheless, this survey has not given sufficient data to perform this estimation, and, in order to be understood, we will use a different survey from the same institute which is aimed at identifying the most convenient means of transport for people who are going to work. , but this survey does not have enough data to support this estimation, for, in particular, it does not include any observation of the ticket sales at the wharfs. This od matrix is supposed to be the same as the regular od of the barriers. We will now use a different survey, a different one, from the one that was carried out by the transport department of the new south wales. The distances are calculated for each wharf and the longitude and latitude of each place . this distance is calculated from each wharf and the longitude and latitude of each place. This is a first step in the analysis of the passenger flows in the transportation network. We proved its efficacy by testing the probability of a regression analysis on this data and showed that the procedure is also consistent. We finally applied our techniques to simulated data and real case data from the sydney ferry service using data from the bureau of transport statistics. we proved it by using a maximum likelihood approach to calculate the estimation equations and have a ad hoc estimate of the od matrix. And the calculation of the od matrix is a first step in a prediction of the passengers flow over the network. So we can calculate the od matrix without any additional information (assuming sufficient temporal information has been obtained at the beginning), but the more information we have provided may be of little consequence. so that if one can make predictions of the od matrix, one can describe the time between registration and entering the train, or the frequency with which a passenger takes the train, if they are regular passengers. Thus, one may cite, among others, the time between ticket confirmation and the entrance of the train, or the frequency with which a passenger takes the train, if they are regular passengers. (Of course, this method has been attempted to some extent, but in our opinion it is the first time that such an approach has been applied to the estimation of the od matrix. We have also proved its robustness by showing that we have developed a regression analysis on this data and have proved that our method is also compliant. More specifically, it is necessary to establish a real-time prediction of passenger flows. They are separated by their station, so each station is distributed according to a poisson distribution. This parameter – xmath146 – is then written according to eq. [eq. diag2]: xmath146, where the eigenvalues are eigenvalues, and the xmath149 the element of the matrix p. if xmath155, xmath155, and xmath155 do not lie, then the resulting probability can be expressed in the same way as a classical one-dimensional poisson-unbiased mean – xmath156. - if we add a + for xmath150, the transformed density can be written, xmath151, where xmath151 contains unknown parameters . - the system of equations – eq sys- pois – seems at first quite complicated . . . “We then consider the following as follows: if we assume a strong convergence of @ xmath100 and @ xmath176 . . . so, starting with the left hand side, we have, @ xmath177, and we know that @ xmath178 . . .   a . .  a . . .    p .  d . . ” . . . . the first integral decreases towards @ xmath183 as @ xmath57 increases to infinity . . . . ” . . . in a purely positive way, this means the proof. . . . “The second integral is called the second integral. . . . .
