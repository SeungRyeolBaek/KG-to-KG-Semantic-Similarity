The kekul structure of a molecular graph (for example, benzenoid and fullerene) coincides with a perfect match of a graph. a forced set  xmath6 of a perfect match of xmath0 of xmath0 is a subset of xmath0 such that xmath6 is not contained in any other perfect match of xmath0 . the _minimum_ ( mumum>) a forcing set xmath6 is the smallest cardinality of all forced sets of xmath0, denoted by math7 . a perfect match or a 1-factor of a graph math0 is a set of edges of math1 such that each vertex of math1 coincides with exactly one edge of math0. — he is called a force edge if he is contained in a complete matching of math0 . . . . in general, to determine the minimum forcing number of a graph with a maximum of three is a complete and np-complete problem @ xcite. Be that as it may, let us assume an imperfection of a planar bipartite graph of xmath1 . (Section xmath2) ‘Children’ is a circumscribed, finitely connected graph, whose interior faces are a regular hexagon of half-length . . . a cycle of alternating cycles of alternating xmath1 is called a ‘constellation’. A consolation of alternating xmath1’s (if the intermembrance is allowed) is called an ‘constellation’ . A converging set of alternating xmath1’s (the intersection is allowed) is called an ‘constellation’ . A converging set of alternating xmath1’s (where the intersection is permitted) is called an ‘constellation’ . a negating number of the negating number, if it was an alternating circle of alternating triangles, of which the total number of alternating triangles intersects only at the edges of alternating circles of alternating triangles of alternating triangles of alternating triangles whose intersections are only at the edges of alternating triangles . . . it was the smallest cardinality of the negating number. We can see that the negating number of a graph of a hexagonal system, a hexagonal system, is the minimum negating number of all perfect matchings of xmath1. We also prove that the negating number has a close relation to the negation number: for every perfect matching of xmath0 of xmath1 the negating number of xmath1 is equal to the maximal number of alternating cycles of xmath1 that intersect only at the edges in xmath1. This result, therefore, is that the negating number of xmath3 is equal to the clarification number of xmath3 . Discussions on some extremal graphs about anti-forcement numbers show that the negating number of a graph of xmath1 with a maximum degree three can achieve the minimum force number or twice . In other words, each of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments is one of the segments of the segments. This segment of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments is an intrinsically anti-imposing number, or in other words, an anti-imposed number. “If xmath6 is an intrinsically anti-imposing number of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments, it is an intrinsically anti-imposing set of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments. Therefore, let xmath6 be a graph of xmath1 sorted by degree and degree, and xmath6 is an intrinsically anti-imposing set of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments. For instance, if xmath6 is an intrinsically anti-forcement set of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments, then xmath6 is not an intrinsically anti-forcement set of the segments. , that is, for any @xmath0 alternating cycle, which exists in @xmath1, Lemma [anti] demands that every edge in @xmath1 be a boundary line with the boundary line of @xmath5, which is in the opposite direction to @xmath0 . so that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath0 . Hence we claim that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath0 . Moreover, in the second inequality, we claim that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath1 . we assert that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath5 . we claim that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath3 . so that the definition for @xmath3 consists of an edge of @xmath3 , which should be, at least, an edge of @xmath3 . therefore, we claim that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath3 . thus, we assert that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath3 . and therefore we assert that @xmath3 is an anti-forced set of @xmath3 . So, @xmath3 will be, in addition to xmath3, an edge of xmath3 . that is to say, if any graph of xmath1 has two alternating cycles, either forming a tangle or intersecting only at the edges of xmath0, then by lemma – anti – any anti – anti cycle contains the edge of each of the anti– forcing cycles of xmath1 . The above argument has the following consequence. For any given graph of xmath1 that is perfectly parallel to xmath0, we now consider the anti–forced number xmath2 . . . randi and vukievi randi and vukievi randi computed the distributions of forcing numbers of kekul structures of xmath45 and xmath46 respectively. Let Xmath48 denote the maximum cardinality of compatible graphs of xmath1 . . . So let Xmath48 denote the maximum cardinality of compatible graphs of xmath1 . . . if a graph of xmath1 is perfect to the closest to xmath0, then we consider a number of xmath49. Let Xmath51 be a finite planar graph. Let Xmath51 be a finite planar graph. The minimum feedback set is as cardinality as a maximum number of arc-disjoint directed cycles . . . . by lemma [anti] a subset of xmath23 is an anti-forced subset of xmath0 if and only if xmath6 is a feedback set of xmath53 . . . and the first thing is to assign a specific orientation of xmath1 to xmath52 in order to obtain a digraph . . . a rectangle based on xmath52 is the centre of a rectangle; all edges in xmath52 are oriented from white to black, and the edges that are not in xmath52 are oriented from black to white . . . so by lemma (anti) a subset of xmath23 is an anti-force set of xmath0 if and only if xmath6 is a feedback set of xmath53. So by lemma [anti] a subset of xmath23 is an anti-force set of xmath0 if and only if @ xmath6 is a feedback set of xmath53 . . . and if the boundary of xmath3 is a boundary of the outside, a boundary edge is a boundary edge. Xmath3 is a hexagonal system, which is perfect matching. For the exact perfect matching, marked by bold lines, it is affirmed that there are at most three compatible alternating cycles, but its anti-forcement number is at least four . . . the following result is therefore a simple one: the maximum anti-forcement number is equal to the number of fries in a hexagonal system. . . . let xmath3 be a hexagonal system with a perfect matching . . . therefore we have that . . . a boundary . . . a boundary line . . . a boundary line . . . in the hexagonal system . . . let xmath3 be a hexagonal system with a perfect matching . . . On the other hand, in the same way, if a cycle in Xmath1 has two vertices, the first one being the xmath61 side, and the second the xmath62 side. (So the fourth vertices corresponding to xmath2 are alternated in xmath5 and xmath6 (i.e. Xmath1 enters xmath5 from one side and leaves from the other via xmath5). . . . (Quickly a.) in xmath2 the four vertices adjacent to xmath2 alternate in xmath2 and xmath6 (the bold lines are edges in xmath5). and we say that xmath47 is non-crossing if any two cycles in xmath2 are not crossing . . . In a word, if a cycle in xmath2 in xmath3 has two vertices, xmath69 and xmath70, then Xmath66 is the first vertex of xmath62 entering xmath2 and xmath68 the first vertex of xmath2 escaping from xmath2 after xmath2 . . . if @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 are both proper (you may refer to it as being illegitimate) @ xmath0 alternating cycles, let @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 be replaced with @ xmath76 and @ xmath77, to obtain a new compatible set of @ xmath3 which is non-overlapping. We call xmath80 the index of xmath47. by claiming 1 we can choose a perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 and a maximum compatible @ xmath0 alternating set @ xmath47 which is non-overlapping, and @ xmath79 which is as minimal as possible subject to (i) and (ii) . in such cases the crossed elements in @ xmath3 are not inseparable, and so we end up with a compatible @ xmath0 alternating set @ xmath63 of @ xmath3 that is non-overlapping. Since each cycle in @ xmath0 alternating set has an inner diameter of 10 , let us say 78 the number of hexagons in the inner diameter of 10 . it is obvious that @ xmath64 . When we take a look at xmath82, let us say it has a series of hexagons at the boundary of xmath82, as in fig. 3, which we call an alternating cycle (otherwise, it is in accordance with analogous statements) on the right-hand corner of xmath82. In a word, if xmath90 is a alternating cycle, xmath90 is a alternating cycle. We take the notion that xmath90 is a proper alternating cycle (although it is not stated in xmath90), we consider that xmath90 is not a alternating cycle (except, as we will see, that the other is an alternating cycle) , and we conclude that xmath90 is not a proper alternating cycle. Xmath90 is a hexagonal chain of alternating cycles, so that xmath90 is an alternating cycle . I can see that none of the members of @xmath82 is of @xmath95 , that is, of @xmath107 and that if @xmath113 is the fixed xmath10 point of intersection with @xmath103 , that is, if @xmath113 and all edges @xmath113 belong to @xmath93 , then the claim holds for @xmath93 , so if @xmath110, and if @xmath110 is a vector of intersection with @xmath102, then the intersection with @xmath110 can be replaced with @xmath110 to get another compatible alternating xmath, which is less xmath83 - index than xmath83 - which is also a contradiction . So, for example, the one example of Xmath110 is a hexagon of @xmath82 and @xmath95 , so the one example of Xmath120 is a hexagon of xmath82 and xmath95 . if Xmath113, then Xmath110 and all edges of xmath110 belong to xmath82 . Xmath131 , so let’s say @xmath147 , then @xmath147 belongs to @xmath10 , then @xmath125 can be replaced with @xmath125, to get a similar contradiction . . . if @ xmath133, then @ xmath147 belongs to @xmath105, and so @ xmath105 can be replaced by @ xmath125 , that is, @ xmath110 , so @ xmath111 , so if @ xmath110, then @ xmath113 is an actual alternating hexagon , which belongs to xmath105, and Xmath105. So if xmath145 , if @ xmath130, then @ xmath148 , then if @ xmath109 is a real alternating hexagon , then if @ xmath109 is a proper alternating hexagon, so if @ xmath109 is a proper alternating hexagon . if @ xmath110, then @ xmath109 can be replaced by @ xmath110 to get a similar contradiction. so @ xmath110. I mean, if the outside of @ xmath9 is a vertice, then that outside of xmath9 is a vertice. This is called a catacondensed double if its inner double is a tree; and if two hexagons of @ xmath9 share an edge, then the corresponding vertices are joined by an edge. And combining the theorems [clarity] and fries[2] by introducing corollary constraints we obtain the following relations between the clar number and the fries number. This results from the following study by harary et al. which explains a hexagonal system to have the fries number (or the maximum anti-force number) achieving the number of hexagons. Let @ xmath3 be a hexagonal system. Let @ xmath152 be a hexagonal system. The inner dual xmath158 of xmath3 is a plane graph: the centre of each hexagon xmath81 of xmath3 is the vertex xmath159 of xmath158, and if two hexagons of xmath15 share an edge, the corresponding vertices are joined by an edge. At the boundary of a kink, each hexagon has two choices for three interlocking edges, and only one of these edges can be glued with other hexagons, and this three edges are called “fusing edges”. Thus this equality enables us to find the result. For example, for a hexagonal system of xmath3, with a perfect matching of xmath0 , let xmath168 be the number of alternating hexagons of xmath3, which is divided into alternating hexagons. The independent dominating set of a graph of xmath1 is a set of vertices of xmath1 which is both dominating and independent in xmath1 . The independent dominating set of xmath1 , denoted by xmath170, is the minimum size of independent dominating sets of xmath1 . . . In a graph of xmath1 with perfect matchedness of xmath6 , let xmath168 be the number of alternating hexagons of xmath3 . then xmath16 is the maximum value of xmath168 over all perfect matches. 4: 4: if some hexagon in @ xmath177, adjacent to @ xmath81, has the three non-fusing edges in @ xmath0, then @ xmath178 . then @ xmath179 . let @ xmath176 be an independent dominating set of @ xmath158. So we can see that @ xmath176 is a perfect fusion of @ xmath3 and any hexagon in @ xmath . if any hexagon in @ xmath6 has the three non-fusing edges in @ xmath0, then @ xmath178 . and if it has the three non-fusing edges in @ xmath6, then @ xmath176 is an independent dominating set of @ xmath158 . . . . Let @ xmath 177 be any hexagon in @ xmath3 adjacent to @ xmath, which is called xmath177 , then xmath178 . otherwise, @ xmath81 is an alternating hexagon . In a system of integers xmath189, let xmath189 be a hexagon, horizontal rows of xmath190 hexagons, and the last hexagon of each row being immediately below and to the right of the last hexagon of the previous row, and we call this 'truncated parallelogram'. Xcite's algorithm gives an arbitrary average of the number of independent dominations of a tree. The minimum force for all kink catahexes is given by a linear system. For instance, fig. [Second] gives the minimum force of two kink catahexes . li is it so that the minimum force of an all kink catahexe may be larger than the minimum force. For example, fig. [Second] gives the minimum force of two all kink catahexes. Note that this parallelogram can be represented in other ways. for example, fig. [Second] gives the minimum force of two all kink catahexes . . . But the anti-forcement number of an all kink catahexe may be higher than the anti-forcement number; for example, the triphenylene has the minimum force of 1 and the anti-forcement number 2 (see fig. Xmath3 is normal or elementary if xmath1 has no fixed edges. xmath2 is an edge-cut of xmath2 and xmath203 is invariant for all perfect matches of xmath2 of xmath2. if xmath2 has a fixed edge and xmath197, then xmath2 has at least two normal components. if xmath2 has a fixed edge and xmath197, then xmath2 has at least two normal components. if xmath2 has no fixed edges and xmath197, then xmath2 has at least two normal components. This means that the non-resolved edges of xmath2 are a subgraph whose components are normal, and hence 2 connected graphs are called normal components of xmath2 . . . if xmath2 has no fixed edges and xmath199 has no fixed edges, then xmath2 has at least two normal components. So if Xmath204 and Xmath206 are in perfect parallel, if Xmath205 and Xmath206 converge together as a half-penny path of a detachable length such that + (i) the anti-conducting edge of xmath205 remains on the boundary, + (ii) the hexagons of each xmath208 with an edge of xmath207 form a chain or a chain with a kink (i.e., the inner-division is a path with exactly one turning vertex), and + (iii) when the half-penny path @ xmath207 passes through edge @ xmath210 (respect xmath207) of xmath205, the hexagons of each xmath208 with an edge of xmath207 form a chain or a chain with a kink (i.e., a path with exactly one turning vertex) and + (iii) when the half-penny path @ xmath207 passes through edge @ xmath210 (respect xmath210) of xmath205, the hexagons of each xmath208 with an edge of xmath207 form a linear chain or a chain with a kink (i.e. the inner double is a path with exactly one turning vertex) and + While deleting the ends of this edge and the incident edges, all the edges of the resulting graph belong to all the perfect matches of xmath213 and are therefore anti-forced by xmath25. Note that the interior faces of xmath216 are hexagons. The oblique sides of xmath69 are formed by a ray perpendicular to and away from xmath219 ( resp. xmath215) intersecting a boundary edge xmath210 at xmath47 ( resp. xmath209 at xmath86) so that xmath220 ( resp. xmath221) only crosses through hexagons of xmath 211. The other edge xmath215 is a slant edge. By the same arguments as xmath219, we can see that xmath216 is a hexagonal system with an anti-force edge @ xmath211. Hence, claim 2 has been rejected. In the same way, suppose that xmath25 is an anti-force edge of xmath3 (the contradiction here is visible). Let xmath69 be a hexagon with an anti-force edge @ xmath25, @ xmath217 the vertical edge of xmath69 adjacent to xmath25, @ xmath218 the other edge of xmath69 parallel to xmath25. I aforesaid, so if there is no hexagon adjacent to xmath232, we will conclude that xmath232 is a linear chain with an end hexagon in xmath232, and the edges of xmath232 parallel to xmath23 are anti-forced by xmath25 and thus belong to xmath0. . . . if xmath232 has no hexagon adjacent to xmath233, then we are under the same assumption as above that xmath232 is a linear chain with an end hexagon in xmath232, and the edges of xmath232 parallel to xmath218 are anti-forced by xmath25 and therefore belong to xmath0 . . . if xmath232 has no hexagon adjacent to the left end hexagon of xmath233, we are on the same assumption that xmath232 is a linear chain with an end hexagon in xmath223 and the edges of xmath232 parallel to xmath218 are anti-forced by xmath25 and therefore belong to xmath0 . . . . two cases must be considered. Xmath205 is a truncated parallelogram, and Xmath205 and Xmath206 intersect at an odd length and are ruled out by statements (i) and ii. Thus, xmath205 is a truncated parallelogram, a contradiction. So, if xmath245 is the centre of xmath244, let xmath63 be the center of the most - left vertical edge of xmath233, and xmath87 the center of the lowest right edge of xmath243 (see fig. 7). Let xmath252 be the graph consisting of hexagons of xmath223 adjacent to xmath223 . . . let xmath234 be the least integer, so that for each xmath239 , there must be an integer xmath238, such that there must be an integer xmath238 in each xmath239, and for each xmath239, a variable xmath239, so that for each xmath239 , the number of xmath239 is the same, so that @ xmath240 is a chain with an end hexagon in xmath222, and xmath240 has as many hexagons as @ xmath219, but @ xmath219 has a hexagon adjacent below the lowest hexagon of xmath243 (see fig. 7). , and if every @ xmath235 is a linear chain and that @ xmath257 has no hexagons adjacent to the left-end hexagon of @ xmath236, then @ xmath252 is a linear chain that intersects @ xmath223 at a distance of infinity, so that @ xmath258 must be a parallelogram consisting of @ xmath252 and its right side . . . ) then the edges @ xmath256 are anti-forced by @ xmath25 and belong to @ xmath0. otherwise, by analogous argument, we can see that each Xmath 97 is a linear chain with an end hexagon in Xmath223 and Xmath235 has as many hexagons as xmath236, but xmath232 has a hexagon adjacent to the left-hand vertical edge of Xmath233, and Xmath87 is the center of the edge of Xmath244 that is adjacent to xmath259 . Thus xmath262 . . . H. abeledo, g. w. atkinson, unimodularity of the clar number problem, linear algebra appl.
