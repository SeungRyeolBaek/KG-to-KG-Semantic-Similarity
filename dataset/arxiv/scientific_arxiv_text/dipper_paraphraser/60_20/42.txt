I have considered in detail several studies of white dwarfs with atmospheric clogging, a great opportunity for examining the final fate of planetary systems. White dwarfs, though not yet surrounded by the planets, show evidence for the existence of planetary debris. In addition, a study of the ultraviolet (uv) spectra of a white dwarf with effective temperatures of 17000 k, xcite has shown that the abundance pattern of the accreted material is similar to that found among solar system meteorites, though the effect of radiation on the concentration of the abundance patterns was ignored. Also, by taking into account the effects of this effect, xcite found that at least 27 % of their white dwarf sample (which includes the white dwarfs of the study) would be accreted, while in 29 % of these objects, which were generally the warmest of their sample, the effect of radiative levitation dominates the abundance pattern. The occurrence of this effect is a result of the absence of the effect of radiant levitation on the rate of accretion. A few detailed studies of the accreted white dwarfs have revealed great differences in the composition of the accreted material. This effect of ours, when we added this effect to our calculation, showed that at least 27 % of their sample, which included the specimen of xcite, would be accreting now, while in 29 % of these objects, which were of the hottest climate, the influence of radiant levitation dominates the abundance pattern. , a direct result of a method of oxidation. Subsequently we have observed in the case of gd 670 , an additional result, but with a higher fraction of water, that the materials are accreted from the surface of a white dwarf, in a new dynamic-spiritual catalog of the new catalogue of xcite. . . . we describe the recombination of a white dwarf which had been unknown (nltt 19868) and the associated nltt catalogue, the name of which has been revised. We present here an analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric characterization of a mysterious and unrecognized white dwarf (nltt 1986) from the revised catalogue of nltt (so-called) , which was exposed to the diffusion of trace elements on the surface of the white dwarf. In the convective envelope of a white dwarf the material becomes diluted in convective fluids, and diffuses, below the convective zone, in a time much shorter than evolutionary timescales. * a finding, but with a greater fraction of water, was found in the case of sds. j124231. . . . . . . we are describing the new observations in section 2: we have obtained new, low and high dispersions, as well as new and archival photometric measurements to estimate the spectral properties (se) . " We followed up our preliminary observations with four sets of echelle spectra, which were taken on the Xcite spectrograph with ut3 attached to the ut3 at the paranal observatory on ut 2014, on may 1, 29 and june 1 . the exposure time was about 2940 and 3000 s, and for the nir's slit was about 600 s. the time for the uvb and vis were about 2940 and 3000 s, and for the nir's five exposures of 600 s each . first, we measured the instruments' degrees of nlt 1986 and of a brighter star (ra [j2000] = 8h 36m03 , dec [j2000] = @ xmath101005525) with published photometry (@ xmath11, @ xmath12, @ xmath13, @ xmath14) with published photometry ( @ xmath11, @ xmath12, @ xmath13, and @ xmath14) with published geometry (@ xmath11, @ xmath12, @ xmath13, @ xmath14, "", from the aavso all-sky survey (apass), conducted by johnson, on April 3 , with a Pass – a Pass – a Pass – a Pass – a Pass – apass – all-sky survey conducted by johnson in five filters (johnson, 185) at la silla observatory on March 3, 2009. This is a big and constrained star, which doesn't share the white dwarf's motion and, consequently, is not physically related. note that the uncertainties of @xmath9 and @xmath8 are only statistical and don't account for any systematic effects. Moreover, we examined the 2mass images which show that nltt 19868 and the nearby star are clearly surrounded by a cloud at an angle p . a . 106 if nltt 19868 was surrounded by nltt 19868 in the near vicinity. In addition to this, we examined the vegametry of the vega system, which is a single wave in the sky (Is it Aquossas, *ios, * vhss) and from the ide (Waver 'm; ww') infrared Survey Explorer (Waver, *? ? ) (Waver, wks? ? ) . Since the Psf of the 'h' and the 'wks' of the 'h' and the 'h' are 6 - 1 and 6 - 4 arcsec, respectively, the 'h' and the 'h' measurements in the table [3] feigner(s) for the 'h' and the 'h' xmath25 must be combined with the 'h' and the 'h' for nltt 19868 “Gift ratio” (above) plots the calcium abundance of all known cool dwarfs with temperatures lower than 7000 k.; if we focus on the hydrogen-rich daz, then the temperature will be studied systematically. The number of cool dwarfs in the area is low, compared with the number of hot dwarfs or helium-rich daz. This is in particular because the diffusion-induced rise in the temperature of the dipoles may be accompanied by substantial decreases in the proportions of the dipoles. We focus on the helium-rich daz white dwarfs, which may help to establish whether their environment is similar to the more common dazs. Having examined the dipoles, our investigation of the cool dwarf nltt 19868 and other objects is timely. The effective temperature for the seven objects was revised by Xcite. Fig. . . . Here is a comparison with the population of the 60 white dwarfs whose white dwarfs are rated at xmath51, for which the average number is xmath51, and with a dispersion of 0 . . . Hence, the extremes at xmath43 (nlt 888, * ? ? ? ) and xmath44 (nlt 868) are striking. The abundance of fe in nlt 86 is perhaps the second lowest among known polluted white dwarfs, showing the low relative abundance of fe in comparison with other elements detected. The abundance of fe in nlt 86 is also lower than that of the cool dz white dwarf sdss j1043 and 3516 (@ xmath45, * ? ? ), while fe / ca in nlt 19868 is slightly lower than in the cool dz white dwarf nlt 43806 ( @ xmath48 = - 0 , * ? ) . Therefore, the extrema of nlt 888 and nlt 868 are notable. The abundance of fe / ca in nlt 868 is in fact the lowest known among known polluted white dwarfs, indicating the low relative abundance of fe with respect to the other elements detected. The observed abundance of fe / ca in nlt 868 is slightly lower than that of nlt 43806 (=0. ) . 2 We examine the case of nltt 888. We compute the observed fe/ca ratio between 5000 and 6000 k. and the relative abundance ratios of the two materials are nearly the same. The abundance of fe/ca in the accreted material fe/ca is very variable, and may, for example, correspond to the solar (see *? ? ? *) or to bulk (see xmath623) or to mantle (see xmath624), which in nltt 888 consists of 66 % core and 34 % mantle, the two measurements, however, are incalculable. However, the diffusion times are uncertain. A study of the abundance ratio of fe / ca in extreme cases of nltt 888 (@xmath57 k) and in the applicable cases supports in the accreted material the complex distribution of which is consistent with the system, with probable changes caused by diffusion. The table of @xcite between 5000 and 6000 k finds the table of @xmath59, and the abundance ratio in both mediums is nearly the same. Therefore, the estimated ratio of fe / ca in the accreted material fe / ca is largely greater than that of bulk (@xmath6213) or mantle (@xmath621 ) and the earth (@xmath621 ) suggesting that nltt 888 has 66 % of core and 34 % of mantle. In the past, as a consequence of the periodicity of the air, the fraction of iron in the atmosphere is low, and, therefore, in the form of the mantle, as a result of the low iron content in the atmosphere, suggests a similar deficiency of iron in the parent material, i.e., not much below that of the earth's mantle. however, in the present case, when we compare the % of fe / ca ratio for stars, galex 1931 is the star with the highest % of fe / ca ratio, which is only a little lower than that of nltt 888. . The observed fe / ca ratio is well compared with the numbers in the sample of stars in the sample, and in particular galex 1931 possesses the highest % of fe / ca ratio in the sample, and is only slightly lower than nltt 888. Note that the diffusion timescales compiled by xcite are systematically longer than those compiled by xcite, and this difference is caused by the fact that the convection zone is deeper than in the envelope models of xcite, where diffusion would be most restricted. On the other hand, if the material of the earthly type was accreted, the material of the mantle-type would be further limited to a speculative level. The calcined fe/c abundance ratio can be successfully reproduced, if the age of earth’s mantle-type material is turned off at xmath64 years ago, then it is possible to reduce the fe/c abundance ratio in the convection zone further to the - see, if the mass of the convection zone is @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 @ xcite, then the total mass of the accretion zone is @ xmath77 g, and if the iron mass is of a proportion of 6 % of the mantle, then the accretion event would have been @ xmath78 g , so that this mass corresponds to less than one thousandth of the mass of the earth ( @ xmath79) . we have thus identified a new cold, polluted white dwarf with a strong calcium-line between the weaker magnesium, aluminium and iron. In our analysis we have identified the lowest ratio of calcium and iron to calcium of any contaminated white dwarf. The same diffusion theory, however, if we employ earth’s bulk material, with a higher fe/ca abundance than in the mantle, would demand a longer settling time ( elapsed time @ xmath80 years) to correspond to the low present-day fe/ca abundance. Using the short-term elapsed time of @xcite we can calculate an initial abundance of fe / h @ xmath70 using : @xmath71, where the elapsed time since the accretion event is @xmath72 years and the diffusion time is @xmath73 years .
