It is assumed that the short lived radioisotope (slri) could have been injected into either the presolar cloud (e.g., boss & keiser 2012; boss 2012) or the solar nebula ( ouellette et al. 2007 , 2010; dauphas & chaussidon 2011) by a supernova or agb star shock . This suggests that at least some of the solar system's slri could have been injected into either the presolar cloud (e.g., boss & keiser 2012; boss 2012) or the solar nebula ( ouellette et al. 2007 , 2010; dauphas & chaussidon 2011) by a supernova or an agb star shock. . . . In either case, the injection occurred in a spatially heterogeneous manner, which might potentially reduce the usefulness of @ xmath4al as a spatially homogeneous chronometer (Dupas & chaussidon 2012) for precise studies of the early stages of the formation of planets (macpherson et al., 2012, cf. krot et al. . . . . . The atoms in comet 81p / wild 2 (Bernlee et al. 2006; simon et al. 2008; nakamura et al. 2008) are thought to have formed close to the protosun, and this is why they had large-scale external transport, which they could carry out with great force from the inner solar nebula to the outer solar nebula. So in the first degree of space heterogeneity, although the process would be continuous in time, rather than the result of a single shot, like a supernova whirlwind. In addition, there is the fact that the refractory particles in comet 81p / wild 2 ( brownlee et al. 2006, simon et al. 2008, nakamura et al. 2008) formed in the vicinity of the protosun, implying that these small particles entered the inner solar nebula, and traveled with them to the comet forming regions of the outer solar nebula. Mingzhou’s angular disk models (e.g., boss 2008, boss 2011; boss et al. 2012) can easily lead to the high mass absorption rates (at xmath7 yr@xmath7) necessary to explain the fu orionis eruption. However, the magnetorotational instability (mri) may also be involved in the eruptions of fu orionis (zhu et al. 2009). Several new sets of mgu disk models have been developed, for which the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity in the inner or outer solar nebula has been investigated by either a single shot or a continuous injection, for various disks and central protostar masses, including protostars with m dwarf masses. The numerical models are given by the same three-dimensional, gravitational hydrodynamic code as has been used in previous mgu disk models (Bobs et al. 2013; dressing et al. 2013; kopparapu 2013), which in a certain number of cases is found in the central protostar. The inner boundary absorbs the gases that come from the disk, which are added to the central protostar, and the outer boundary absorbs the momentum of the central protostar. The jeans length constraint is used to ensure sufficient resolution. A thin upper boundary absorbs the inflowing gas that falls from the disk, which is added to the central protostar, while the outer boundary absorbs the momentum of the inner disk. Many low-mass exoplanets have been discovered in the lower half of m dwarfs (Bobs et al. 2013; dressing et al. (2013); kopparapu (2013); kopparapu (2013); in the m dwarfs some of these are perhaps habitable exoplanets, so as to raise the importance of understanding mixing and transport processes in m dwarfs. In this chapter, we will describe two new models of mgu disks that explore the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced by either the inner or outer solar nebula, by either a single-shot event or a continuous injection, for a variety of for the 10 au outer radius disks shown in the table 2 and 3 the initial density distributions are based on the pressure profiles derived by the deterministic Boundary-Tite (Boundary-Tite) of a self-gravitating disk orbiting a star with mass xmath16 xmath17 xmath17 , which xmath17 is the distance from the star and xmath18 ; where xmath17 is the velocity of the gas axis and xmath17 is the time. The total amount of mass remains unchanged throughout the evolution; the initial envelope of a disk envelopes the disk, and no more mass is added to the system across the outer boundary of xmath31 . . . the radiance of the disks is thus revealed to any potential source of uv irradiation. The characteristics of the first density distribution (figures 1 and 2 ) are based on the data set of the Boolean coefficient by Boolean & Myhill (1993). Boolean & Myhill 1992 is identical to the continuity equation for the mid-plane density, and the intermediate density, . . . . . where xmath22 and xmath22 are the coordinates of the rotation, where xmath22 is the gravitational constant, . . . . . . . . . where xmath23 is the velocity of the gas and xmath15 the time. Pienio et al. (2013) showed that dg tau itself radiates its inner layers from a distance of 10 au to 90 au, so that the surrounding regions will have in the first place a gradient of a size of 170 cm, the width of which is a notch of 1 cm, centered at the injection radii indicated in the tables. In the second place, the colour will be assumed to represent a tiny, specklike gas or small particles produced by the uv photochemistry. table 4 shows the single shot and the continuous injection, where in the latter, the color will be added to the same place on the surface throughout the evolution, the finer way of simulating the reaction of co (e.g., lyons & young 2005) and perhaps leading to the stable and stable oxygen isotope fractionation between the gas and the solid phase. note that in both the single shot and the continuous injection, the total amount of color added is arbitrary (e.g., the color in the injection volume is merely set equal to 1), and is to be scaled to the values most appropriate to the isotopes that are to be examined. The color in the latter case is a gas or small particles resulting from the photochemistry of the uv . . . see the above example of the dg tau disk from podio et al. (2013) that dg tau itself radiates from 10 au to 90 au with a radiance of 30 au per second, thus preventing the formation of a negative radiance between the gas and solid phases. if one considers the mass of a star, it is very uncertain. We assume the difference between the amount of the mm-size dust and the mass of the disk. - Since the mass of a star reaches the minimum of xmath37, we give the minimum minimum stability and the injection radii of two different sizes. In the last decade, the mass of a star lkh xmath37 - dg. - is estimated to be a very high number of xmath37 (i.e., and e. , 2013) - from the first day of its formation , miller et al. (2011) have recently noticed that a lot of wretch(49) occurred in lkh xmath37 - dg. - (petio et al. 2013) , when analyzing the hydra disk, a lot of fl - xmath37 was expected to be as high as 0 . 1 xmath1 ( bergin et al. 2013). * This isometric analysis is usually used to estimate low, medium, low mass stars, e.g. 0 . 1 xmath1 for a protoplanetary disk, and perhaps in the solar nebula too. As we have observed, in the classical t tauri star lkh xmath37 - xmath35 - dg tau has an estimated mass of 0 - 1 xmath1 (Potio et al.). It is, however, a very strong surface movement of a manifold mgu disk that is responsible for the great quantities of color to be injected in 34 yrs., in which, in spite of the heat, the early atoms of the surface were, in fact, the coolest, which is gravitationally unstable, and the models show that this sufficiently covers all the atoms in Table 2. Figure 3 and 4 show the equatorial distribution of the colour/gas ratio (@ xmath41) for models 1 - 0 - 2 - 2 . The ratio is written as the square root of the sum of the squares of the color field divided by the gas density, subtracted by the azimuthal average of the ratio at a given orbit, divided by the square of the average of this ratio at a given orbital radius, divided by the square of the average at a given orbital radius, divided by the square of the average at a given radius. figure 3 shows that the first injection of the surface at 9 a receptacle at 9 a receptacle has produced rapid diffusion of the color field down to the midplane, and even to the inner wall of the inner plane at 2 a receptacle . The great three-dimensional motions of a Mbosphere are responsible for this large-scale transport in only 34 yrs. The proportions of the color/gas ratio in figure 5 are defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the color field divided by the gas density, subtracted by the azimuthal average of this ratio in the orbital radius, divided by the square of the azimuthal average at the given orbital radius, divided - but it is not more than a pillar. the origin of the dust and gas is also absorbed by the protostar. Note that the small refractory grains in the first disk, which are contained in the gas, are carried along with the gas and the pressure of the disk gas, so that some of the gas is carried to the outermost disk, like some part of the gas. But, on the contrary, the disturbance in the outermost disk is considerably higher than the initial disturbance, which was proved by boss (2011) for more than a pillar. This means that the growth of the outermost disk is not particularly sensitive to the shape of the initial milieu, as boss (2011) also found for a somewhat larger disk. In this, we can see that despite the change in the initial stability of the disk, the disturbance in the innermost disks is exactly the same as the original disturbance (within a range of @xmath2), which was also proven by boss (2011) for somewhat larger disks. This is due to the fact that, even if the initial instability is different, the disturbances in the outer disks allconverge to similar values of @xmath0 1 % to 2 %. As in all the models, it can be seen that the initial heterogeneous disk quickly homogenizes, in this case by about 5000 yr. as in all models, it can be seen that the initial highly heterogeneous disk becomes homogeneous very rapidly, i.e., by about 5000 yr. Note that this time scale is much longer than the one for the g dwarf disk mixing and transport processes, because of the longer keplerian orbits of the lower masses, the g dwarf disk. The equation in this case is: the differential dispersion of the inner disk is higher than the outer, although, in these models (with an initial @ xmath47_), the inner disk is drop to @ xmath0 5 % to 10 %, compared with @ xmath0 2 % to % in the outer disk , it is the result of the micro-engulfment of the inner disk. figure 7 shows the evolution of the dispersion for the 0 - 1 - 1________________, which is appropriate for a late m__________ m___________ , a late m_________________________________. As in the g_____________________________________________________ The figure 9 and 10 shows the evolution of dispersion for the two models 1 . . . . 40 . . 20 and 1 . . . 40 . . 20c, for example, after 200 yr the total amount of color injected has increased by a factor of xmath0 90 compared with the single-shot total, and by a factor of xmath0 two % to the inner disk edge. However, for the continuous injection model shown in figure 10 the evolution is similar to the one of the earlier single-shot models: rapid drop in the density, and then the homogenization is to xmath0 1 % to 2 % away from the inner disk edge. The higher dispersion seen near the outer disk (@ xmath0 40 a) is mainly due to the pile-up of considerable mass at 40 a, and must be attributed to this in the early phases. The intensity of the amount of color added by continuous injections is high, compared with single-shot ones: for example, in 200 yr the total amount of color was increased by a factor of xmath0 90 compared to the single-shot amount, and by another factor of xmath0 2 %. In such late stages, a simultaneous flow of gases and oxygen would be needed to achieve the present results. Eventually, similar results were obtained for all the other models in table 4 , the test results of which were grouped in two parts. The first, to be sure, were the results of the present models, which show that, in all models, mgu phases are capable of relatively rapid mixing and transport, regardless of their dimensionality and the precision of the stability parameter. The final results were the same as those shown in Figures 9 and 12 for the other models which are listed in Table 4 . Firstly, radial dispersion is a matter of relative weight, and that is the primary consideration in the long-term evolution. While the dust grains in the interstellar medium are generally amorphous, crystalline silicate grains have been discovered in a late m dwarf (sst-lupa111) disk, ranging from within 3 a m to below 5 a m, in both the midplane and the surface layers (mern et al. 2010). These results, however, are in agreement with the results of the present models, which show that the process of a minor gravitational instability in disks and stars with various masses and temperature ranges can lead to relatively rapid mixing and transport of gas in both the inward and outward directions of gas, in spite of the size of the disk and the exact range of the stability parameter. This is a very robust result, as it is said in the present study, that a phase of slight gravitational instability in disks and stars of varying masses and temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of gas and gas, as long as it has no volume of gas. * that’s the place for Jürgen Herstheim, I thank him for pointing out several problems, and thank the collaborators, sandy keiser, michael acierno, and ben pandit for their support of the cluster computing environment at DTM. - i thank Jürgen Herstheim for his comments, the referee for some suggested improvements, and for Zacharias supposition, et al., 2007 and 2009b, beck and aspin 2012, kopparapu 2013 - i thank jeff cuzzi, the referee for several suggestions of improvements, and for bringing in some corrections from the von Spekratius region.
