If one is to measure the energy of an atom, the quantum nature of a dilute atom, such as the hot hydrogen, forms a decisive role in such a procedure. In this way, the nanocrystal geometry is thus designed and arranged to transport atoms from one atom optic component to another atom . In this way, the consideration of quantum structure, as the lens of an atom, is central to the experimental precision of the atom optics. Moreover, in order to make further sense of some of the limitations of atom optics with variations in the waveguide potentials, for instance, a narrow and a narrow wire geometry has been proposed as a quantum - point-contact, optical device for atoms xcite. Here, we show the analysis of the stifling action of waveguides with rapid changes in the transverse inward potential, which has an effect on the direction of the waves, giving direct ways of generating energy. to determine the effect of transverse discontinuities, we examine the Schrdinger wave mechanics of waveguides with step-like, barrier-like, and well-like potentials along the axial path of the waveguide. The present study was prompted in three ways: firstly, recent experiments have shown a significant deformation of a bose-Einstein condensate (bec) in a waveguide that is close to the surface of the xcite, owing to the imperfections created by the coil manufacturing process. secondly, in order to understand the limitations of designing atom optics devices based on variations of the radii, for example, the smoothly changing, narrow narrow wide wire geometry has been proposed as a quantum-point-contact type - and to avoid oblivion and aphidation, to cut and deflect . . . which in this case is the final measure of ground-mode waves whose propagation through the various perturbations has shown that the spectra rapidly diverge from single-moded to multi-moded with significant propagation and reflection of the excited modes. Therefore, in this short, semi-linear analysis, limited as it is to the purely linear regime, we can establish a baseline for comparison of non-linear wave propagation through quasi-one-dimensional (one-d) waveguides, including the relative degrees of freedom. The waveguides are therefore made of an idealized trapping potential, quadratic near the minimum, and low in the wave density, so that the atom-atom interactions are obscured. Furthermore, in order to reduce the potentials to an effective 2d problem, the waveguides are assumed to be composed of multiple wires, abruptly adjusting the spacing between the wires, such that the height and transverse position of the potential minima is unchanged along the waveguide. such simple waveguide potentials could be generated by modifying the transverse confinement, where the knowledge of the transverse excitation probabilities, in the abrupt and linear limits, would be useful. we consider a simple harmonic oscillator (sho) confining potentials, which, for barrier-like or well-like effective potentials, are given by xmath1 the barrier ; whereas, for well-like effective potentials, the threshold resembles a potential well . the 'out of plane' quantum number is then a constant quantity. "xmath6 and xmath7. (b) energy of the leads and barrier-riding potential in xmath9 . (c) energy of the leads and the barrier-riding potential along xmath9 . the dot-droop lines correspond to the forbidden levels (assuming an even incoming mode) . in this model all interaction between modes takes place by the correcting of the zone. All the energies and coordinates are given in terms of the units of the ring and the ball. The power and potentials of eq. ([c] pots2d] are symmetric in xmath12, so that parity in xmath12 is preserved, which greatly simplifies the present analysis and discussion. In this model, all the coupling takes place through the matching of the regions. The experimental temperature is xmath6 and xmath7; the actual temperature is xmath8. The solid lines at xmath10 and xmath11 should be vertical, but are drawn on an angle to reveal the transition between the leads and the axis of the barrier. The kinetics are exactly the same, so we chose to preserve the residual perturbations of the incoming waves with a limited range of parameters (as can be seen in our previous study of the circular bend @ xcite). However, the fundamental physics remain very similar, so we decided to adopt the parity-protecting perturbations by condensing the incoming waves to the ground (even) oscillator mode. ; the first derivatives of each of the three, and the latter in the first derivatives, were given in the figure xmath21. The momenta are xmath19 and xmath20. , xmath14 for frequencies, xmath15, and xmath16 for xmath17 ,  c m e   i  kappa m ( z - z 0) , d m e   i  kappa m ( z - z - z 0) ,   psi  mathrm  ii  ,    psi  mathrm  iii               , ,      end           [] -                                     ,             [         ] Using the orthonormality of the sho eigenstates and the recursion relations of hermite polynomials, it can be proved that the overlap integrals of the ground mode with the even mode diminish to a particularly simple form: @ xmath43 for all @ xmath17, as a result of symmetry, @ xmath43 for all @ xmath44, due to symmetry, @ xmath45 for all @ xmath46, ... in short, the problems involved herein are mainly the slow decay of the overlaps @ xmath36 with @ xmath37 with @ xmath37, which require the inclusion of strongly closed channels, leading to large exponentials in the transfer matrix. ((9) In this respect the multimoded transmission and reflection probabilities of three basic geometries are described, in this section, the step-like potential, the barrier-like potential, and the well-like potential. In this connection, we will discuss how the interface overlaps @ xmath36 with frequency. The calculations for the step-like potentials will use the transfer matrix, while the interface matching method will use the barrier-like and the well-like potentials. In short, the problems concerned the slow decay of the sho overlaps @ xmath36 with @ xmath37, which requires the inclusion of strongly closed channels, and thus to appear large exponentials in the transfer matrix. The simultaneous operation of the transfer matrix, in contrast, is the straightforward solution of the intermediate coefficients, and therefore it is able to include sufficient closed channels to guarantee the closeness of the correlation with the whole range of geometry and energies in this paper.

(b) - the overlaps as a function of tx-power for four frequencies: tx-power (squares), tx-power (empty-strangling triangle), tx-power (open-ended triangle), tx-power (circles), tx-power (circles) , the lines between dots in b are added to guide the eye. This connection is not particularly revealing and is not followed in this direction. As a function of frequency, these maxima occur at tx-power 60, which for tx-power 60 is tx-power 60, and for tx-power 60 tx-power 61 is tx-power 60. The slow decay of the overlaps with the higher modes can be seen in Fig. [47] The other side of the panel is the contact. The other side is the contact with the surface. . . . and as it opens, the reflection into the surface of xmath72 is almost absorbed by the second mode. [66] As each mode opens, reflection into the surface of xmath73 increases rapidly, and as each mode opens, the reflection into the surface of xmath72, which is quickly absorbed by the third mode. This is the normal state of all waves of the earth. . . . the distance from the ground is the dominant channel, and the ground is absorbed by the ground. In fig. . . the amount of reflection into the ground is larger than the sum of reflections into the excited modes. In fig. . . the crossbones in a) and b) are the statistical calculation of the probability of a 1 - d step potential. The crossbones in a) and b) are the probabilities of the transmission into the ground and the sum of the transmission into the excited modes. . . . As each mode opens, reflection into the excited modes gradually declines. The estimation of jskelinen and stenholm at xcite was briefly described in the context of the effects of atom-atom interactions. The total energy of the channel corresponds to the sum of the inverses of the figure (eqn, project) and to the sum of the following equations (eqn, mes) of eq. ([eqn] ] of the same and opposite acquiescence in the matrix of xmath86, as given by eq. ([eqn]]; so that the channels for the three waveguides open to the same acquiescence. Similar multimode projections have been theoretically compared with the expansion of a bec from a microtrap into a waveguide @ xcite, with particular attention to the effects of atom-atom interactions. [97] The present analysis of jskelinen and stenholm @ xcite, focusing on the excitation probability of the interlocked waveguides, has already been studied, to the effect that entrainment of a bec from a microtrap into a waveguide, at a pressure of up to the height of the step, the amount of the highest few modes is almost the same on both sides of the step, whose energy is measured by xmath90. [98] For each waveguide (a) he shows the relative strength of the current. [98] I. E., for instance, the mismatch in the mode characteristics of the ground wave between the xmath52, the xmath104, the xmath105, and the xmath106 corresponds especially to xmath107. The conditions of the four waveguides, shown here, are: xmath99, xmath100, xmath101, xmath102. The results, however, for the xmath82 are not so precise, for the direct propagation and the reflection that correspond to each wave, both for the xmath82 and for the xmath82, for the reason that the limit for the long resonant wave is xmath100 and xmath102 , increases to asymptotes of xmath98, in agreement with eq. (Eqn:project)). Xmath110 is in a perfect unity for the transfer of energy in the direction of xmath82 for the insertion (ie, step up from xmath42 to xmath111) and the expansion of the resonant wave (ie, step down from xmath112 to xmath54) and this result is also for the familiar 1 - d step potential, and although we don't show it here, the transfer and reflection phase conspire to ensure that this is also the case in the multichannel system. - At a fixed length of xmath114 and frequencies changing from xmath42 to xmath2 and back again to xmath42, we give a multimoded scattering of four potentials with xmath50, xmath75, xmath77, and length of xmath115 – the chart for each of these frequencies is the same as a fig - Fig. - in the fig - fig. - (a) – the cross in Fig. - - the analytic responses for a 1 - d potential for xmath116 (ie, with a height of xmath117 and a background potential of xmath84) , we can see in Fig. - the crosses in Fig. a and b are the analytic results for the 1 - d potential for a - xmath116 height, - xmath118 width, 336 , 239 , width = 336 , - the - d crossings, the - d crossings, the - a and - b , the transmission and reflection probabilities for a - d potential for the - xmath116 (ie. height - xmath117, with a background potential - xmath84) are a linear regression of the - d cross-section of the - d crossing, and for the same length - xmath115, as the  = xmath124 - . The crosses in the figure correspond to the -xmath125 - two-level interference model of eq. ( eqn: interfere). The cross in -xmath125 corresponds to the -xmath125 two-level interference model of eq. ( eqn: interfere) . . . (c) Figure - Fig - b - depicts the individual reflections of the -xmath123 modes, and the sum of the reflections of the -xmath124 modes , (c) shows the ground reflections and the sum of the excited reflections. to calculate an expression analogous to eq. ( eqn: project) we have to take into account the fact that the waves that go through a barrier have at least two interface projections, as in eq. (eqn: project). . . . our studies of the circular waveguide bend @ xcite – have so far been well-documented. There are many different resonance physics that have been discussed in the course of our studies of the circular waveguide bend @ xcite – for example, the propagation thresholds for a ball is slightly lower than for the beam leads, and the possibility of an infinitely small number of shallow resonances at the x-axis. Consequently, we have enumerated in this last section the transmission and reflection probability of two potential bulges (# x-axis, # x-axis) due to a potential bulge (# x-axis) – this latter one being from x-axis to x-axis and back to x-axis – in both cases we have chosen the reference frequency @ x-axis as our reference to the barriers in the previous section. In our studies of circular waveguides, we have noted this behaviour in a curved waveguide, where the amount of current can be suppressed by adjusting the angle swept out by the waveguide so that the accumulated phase difference between the x-axis and the axis was a multiple of x-axis. The transmission and reflection probabilities of these potentials with a length of @x-axis @ x-axis are shown in fig.. The transmission and reflection probabilities of these potentials with well length of @x-axis @ x-axis @ x-axis are shown in fig. [fig.] The cross lines in (a) correspond to the inverse cross-phases of the inverse dielectric model of eq. (eqn) for eq. (eqn) for eq. (eqn) for eq. xmath133. , width = 2.6 ] the inversed cross-phases of eq. (eqn) for eq. xmath125 correspond to the cross-phase model of eq. (eqn: interfacial) for eq. , eqn: interfacial) for eq. , and this high-energy transmission probability, again, is given by eq. (eqn: interf) for eq. xmath125, and which is bad at the “xmath120” threshold, due to the significant reflection there. a wide range of resonances is exhibited in eq. , as shown in fig. sent> is the same as fig. , the crosses in a correspond to the interference model of eq. (eqn: interf) for eq. xmath125 for eq.  (p. 3) for eq.  (p. ) for eq. . . a high-energy wave propagates by abrupt potentials is the transmission of dilute and ultracold gases by an abruptly changing waveguide potential.1 The high-energy mode is a significant one, the weakest at energies below the lowest excitation threshold. For a high-energy wave propagates through sudden potentials, this is equivalent to an activity of the waves at the interfaces between the waveguide sections. In our previous work, we have studied the conditions for adiabatic adiabatic adiabatic waves through microstructures (eg. ref. ref. 4) but here the focus was on the consequences of the sudden potential variations for mode excitation with a view to studying the effects of abrupt potentials in atom optical devices, and simply to study the behavior of a few simple geometry. These three idealized geometries with changing the waveguide potential were investigated, step-like, barrier-like and well-like. a high energy wave propagation through waves with sudden changes in the waveguide potential is equivalent to xmath142 wave propagation via projections over the waves. for the high-energy wave propagation through the waves is equivalent to xmath14 waves propagating via reflections whose frequency is different from that of the ground. the high coupling of wave to these wave paths is due to the overlapping of the ground sho function of one frequency with the excited sho function of the other. In the aforementioned examples, it was found that a simple two-mode model, combining the two-mode results, can give a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of ground-mode excitation in a waveguide. It was further shown that a single-mode transfer matrix could also be reasonable to the extent of the ground-mode excitation, and is thus a valuable consideration for the design of atom-pair waveguides, with a multitude of interfaces, to limit the entanglement between the modes. Consequently, a single-mode transfer matrix is, however, at present somewhat difficult to approximate in terms of numerical convergence, since the number of modes in the equations increases. Among these calculations were found several alternative tests, one of which, by comparing the individual transfer matrix with two-phase results from an interface-matching program, if you like, to compare. The results of the interpolation are shown, and almost all are a simple result. This analysis was supported by the Department of the Navy, the Office of Naval Research, and by the Institute for Naval Research. lccccc & + @ xmath149 & unitarity & @ xmath150 & unitarity + 0 & 0 . 00381548 & 4 . 6275 @ xmath155 + 1 & 0 00270062 & 1 00270062 & 1 00270062 & 1 00270062 & 1 00270062 & 1 00270062 & 1 . . . 8990 @ xmath155 + 1 & 0 00270062 & 1 . . . 829407 & 3 . . . 849709 & 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , the numerical results of the equation of @xmath168 are also shown in table – Transconv, and although there is a good deal of range of motion in the numerical results of @xmath168, it is still a small lot, but still much more unstable than @xmath169. For the most extreme barriers (see fig.
