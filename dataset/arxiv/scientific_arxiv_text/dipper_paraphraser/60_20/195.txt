By a formula of this sort, we will examine the renormlization of a group of equations in general (Karder-Parisi-Zhang) , the second of which is a problem of excitation and which is formulated in the following way:   Mathcal-Statistical-Extractory.  Mathcal-Statistical-Extractory (int ,  h ,  i tilde  h               lambda 0     lambda 0    lambda 0    lambda 0   lambda 0        int  mathcal  d And  i tilde  h   (k,  omega)          (k,  omega)       (k,  omega)         (k,  omega)          ( g )      lambda    lambda  0     lambda   lambda  0     lambda    lambda   lambda    lambda      lambda   lambda    lambda     lambda    lambda   d k  d k  2     k  k It is then proved that xmath202 ‘Biggr’ is calculated as Xmath204 ‘Biggr’. – ‘End’ aligned        – ‘ple’-v’–v’–V’–gr’–v’ – ‘oh – h –   –  – ‘oh’ – ‘oh’ – ‘oh’– ‘oh’– ‘oh’ – ‘oh’– ‘oh’– ‘oh’– ‘oh’– ‘’– ‘oh’– ‘oh’-e’-n- ‘‘’– ‘‘‘ – ‘oh’ – ‘‘‘ – ‘ – ‘ ‘‘ – ‘’– ‘’ – ‘‘’ – ‘‘  h      ‘’ – ‘’ – ‘ – ‘’ ‘‘ – ‘ – ‘’ – ‘‘ – ‘   – ‘ ‘’ ‘ – ‘‘ – ‘‘ ‘’ – ‘‘ – ‘ ‘oh’ – ‘‘ – ‘‘ ‘ ‘  – ‘  – ‘ ‘‘ – ‘’ – ‘a   – ‘h     – ‘ – ‘’ ‘– ‘oh’ – ‘ – ‘‘ – ‘’ ‘- ‘  – ‘‘ – ‘’ – ‘’ - i - tilde - h                                                    - ( (eq: definition of n)) , we find the rg equation at xmath215. ([eq: propagator2]) , note the relationship with @ xcite @ xmath212 by setting @ xmath214 to the equations. ([eq: propagator2]) , then we obtain the rg equation at xmath215.   eq: rg     -  lambda   d k ( lambda )  d d  d  d  d  d  d  lambda &  d  lambda &  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d  d (Eq: rgnu) , sketch In the following subsections, we will deduce eqs . . . (eq: wtid - tilt) in two separate cases. The first is to separate eq. (eq: wtid - tilt) in two different cases. (eq: wtid - tilt) in two different cases. (eq: wtid - tilt) and then, as a result of the argument Xcite, we will deduce eqs . (eq: wtid - shift) - (eq: k / dd) , we find that this equality is eq. (eq: wtid - shift) , then, at xmath230, we have Xmath232, we have Xmath235, then we have Xmath235 by taking the limit @ xmath236 and applying eqs . (eq: definition of n) -   log  int  mathcal  d  [h    ,   tilde  h                                       (x , t)                 (x , t)         (x, t) We are rewriting (XMesh243) the following equations: s[xm]     delta    (xm)  c(t)        (xm)       (xm)             (xm) -                         - s - h           -                    - s - h        - s - h         -      -  -     - s -          -   -      -   -     -  - s -         -      -  -        -       -   -  - s -        -   -  -       -  — eq. action. (c. eq.) This results in the same result as @ xmath262 — s [h,  i  tilde  h                                    nu 0              end  aligned     end  aligned       end  aligned   ] —  log  mathcal  j  ,  end  aligned        ,  end  aligned       [ ] ... We have followed the inverse relation, xmath270, by recalling the definition given in eqs. ([10] eq: def of propagator] ...
