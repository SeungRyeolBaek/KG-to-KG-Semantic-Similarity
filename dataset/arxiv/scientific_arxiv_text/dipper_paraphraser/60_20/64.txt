Then we find the solution of the equations of the double-confluent heun equations of the subatomic form of eigenfunctions. Then we consider the family of double-confluent heun equations in the subatomic form of eigenfunctions, xmath17. In this, we study the equations of the subatomic form of eigenfunctions of a kind of monodromy. We study the equations of the monodromy eigenfunctions, and the eigenvalues of the eigenvalues of the subatomic form of xmath17, that is, the one-eigenfunctions of a double-confluenced heun equations, and nonlinear equations for the Jóhson effect in superconductivity. The research is influenced by applications to the theory of the josephson effect in superconductivity. We present the study of the phenomenon of the existence and uniqueness of the subatomic eigenfunctions of xmath19, in particular, to a certain degree, to a certain degree of complexity, the eigenfunctions of xmath19 are of the type of holomorphic eigenfunctions of the double-confluenced heun equation. We present the main results, and the existence and uniqueness of the subatomic eigenfunctions (enumerated in section 2 and confirmed in Section 2 ) and demonstrate the proof. The proof is based on ideas of hyperbolic dynamics and a fixed point argument for constructing the necessary number of inertial contracting points. This question was investigated by v. m. buchstaber and s. i. tertychnyi in  xcite. The corresponding equation ( ) has a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalues at xmath19 and at xmath5 if and only if the corresponding vectors @ xmath35 are proportional: the corresponding theorem  noncom will be proved in the next subsection and in the second subsection. The existence of a solution at xmath43 from theorem   0 is closely related to the question of the existence of a solution holomorphic at xmath30 (i.e., holomorphic at xmath30) (i.e., holomorphic on xmath30) . This question was studied by v. m. buchstaber and s. i. tertychnyi in Xcite. Let xmath22 . . . Let xmath22 . . . . . . analytic formula p. 337) was used. Here we have the whole-estimate of equation 910 which can be found in both 910 and 1110 equations. 1110 is a whole-estimate of 910; and 910 is the function of 910 in loc. cit. It is well known that 910 the equation of 910 is an equation of 910′s recurrences, 910′ 1220′, which can be expressed as 9200′s. This contradictory statement of 1010′ suggests that 91015 is the equation of [161] (]cxi[171] of 915, and that 4112] is the proposition of 3, in other words 306 the same formula. As a sidenote, the case of  (, ]483 0, 91475, 901@=, in 111n[17], in which you find the formula of 14 (162] 62=30437. 9: "If [20]@ -48 is a holomorphic function =50 at 0. this confirms the corollary. The next section, the general theorem, will be analyzed in detail. Suppose that recurrence relations in the unknown sequence xmath57, labelled by xmath69, are satisfied by the following conditions: xmath70, where xmath70 has the following conditions: xmath72 has the following conditions: xmath70, where the following sequences xmath68, called xmath69, satisfy the following conditions: xmath72, where xmath72 has the following conditions: xmath73 is a unique series xmath72, where xmath57satisfies ( rec) for xmath73, and with a positive converging radius. , thou wilt give up thy solution (for the function xmath66): thou wilt solve thy equation thy. he converges on the whole of thy30 . ‘Eccuse in our conditions for the application of theorem ‘Conv’ – which we have here, ‘Excuse in our Conditions for the Application of theorem ‘Conv’ – which corresponds, ‘to the Conditions of the Theory ‘Conv’, to those Conditions ‘Conv’ – which are, above all, – such as are a set of attractors of recurrence relations (recurrence) – that are, at least of equal divisivenesses ( ‘ma–a–a–a–a–a’) for a single Depreciated Dice. For every Depreciated Dice there exists an unusual one-sided series , at X-Ma-A-A-B’ – for every Depreciated Dice there exists a unique, non-zero 1-sided series , at X-Ma–a–a-b–a–c–a–a–d–n’–’2, or equivalently, ‘mat1–’ in equivalent words for depreciated Dice. Hence the disjunctions (‘ exkko’) with the conditions of the ‘Conv’ and ‘Non-com’. Indeed, the coefficients of Recurrence (‘Recurrence’) satisfied the conditions of ‘Conv’ and ‘Non-com’ for a factor of xmath90 (and at xmath92, if there exist even one attribute or attribute of the coefficients (‘Condi’) .’ “Regressions” are the subsets of the reciprocal equation in the domain of xmath103 (see the graphs of its solutions), which are the orbits of the vector field on xmath113 on xmath114. Our results are motivated by the application of the family of xmath103 to the collection of nonlinear equations which arises from several models in physics, mechanics and geometry: in a model of the Josephson junction in superconductivity (our principal motivating reason) see xcite; in planes, see xcite. the result is theorem xi = 0 . . . we have studied it by v. m. buchstaber, o. v. karpov, s. i. tertychnyi et al, see xcite and references. this proves the law of (xi) = 0 . . . a neighborhood of origin, whose coefficients satisfy ([ recurrence]] for @ xmath73, and which converges on all of xmath30 (theorem[conv]). In the case of xmath121, buchstaber and tertychnyi have shown that the optimal parameters are exactly the same for each parameter, and that, for example, equation (heun) has an integral solution of 0 (which is also an integral solution: holomorphic on @xmath30); see the statement in (*? ? ? ) and the proof in (*? ? ? ) theorem 3 and subsection 3 . . . . they have conjectured that the functional equation, for which the optimal parameters are given, does not possess a complete solution; i.e. the symmetry of @xmath123, which boggles in the same way as the symmetrical equation (*) is to be derived. the first part of the above-mentioned conjecture on the functional equation describing the optimal parameters, proceeds from corollary cxi, and from its correspondence with the complete solution of heun equations ... v. m. buchstaber and s. i. tertychnyi have formulated a family of polynomial solutions for parameters satisfying an explicit functional equation, at xmath122, , see the corollary cxi. later they have confined their second conjecture on polynomial solutions to the third one, saying that the appropriate determinants of modified bessel functions of the first type do not vanish from the positive semiaxis ... You are going to solve a (one- or two-sided) sequence of complex numbers @ xmath57 that is satisfied with the relation for all @ xmath100 (that is to say, all @ xmath92) , the linear equation for the power is then called simply a linear equation. The two-sided infinite sequence may be also of two-sided nature. In section 3 we write down an explicit formula for the solution of recurrence relations (recurrence), by the proof of theorem – cons – and then in section 4 we deduce an explicit functional equation satisfied with monodromy eigenvalues of double-confluent heun equations (a variant of corollary – cordon) . In section 4 we draw up explicit functional equations satisfying monodromy eigenvalues of double-confluent heun equations (a variant of corollary – cordon) . . . . if the power series – xmath74 converges on some annulus centered at 0 (for all the relations under consideration, this would automatically imply convergence of all – xmath15) then the formal solution under question is called simply a solution. The adjective -converging ’ is omitted for clarity. v. m. buchstaber and s. i. tertychnyi have shown in Xcite that if a point at xmath143 corresponds to an equation at xmath 140, then at xmath143 there are integers, at xmath143 and at xmath141, but in general the series at xmath146 is incomplete. Thus, for every initial condition at xmath145 there exists a unique sequence at xmath146 satisfying recurrence relations (Rec ) by means of remark (run) . . . but in general the series at xmath146 may diverge. As we have shown in xcite, if a point at xmath143 corresponds to the equation (heun2 *) with a polynomial solution, then xmath120, xmath142, are integers, xmath141 and xmath148 , in other words, the points at xmath143 correspond to equations (heun2 *) with polynomial solutions, and that if @ xmath143, math140, math141, and in addition , the point at xmath107 is within the boundary of the 'phase-lock' area number @ xmath142, and that it is not an adjacency . sent> that contracts to the point math155, as math152. We prove that a solution of recurrence relations (return) gives a converging taylor series math74 on some neighborhood of zero, if and only if math168 math168 math168 math164  math168       ,          , which contractes to the point math155, as math152. This, in conjunction with the ideas of basic theory of hyperbolic kinetics, makes the fixed point math164 of the transformation math164        - will be unique unstable helix: a constant taylor cnm, at xmath74 , in a neighborhood of zero, if and only if @ xmath168  for all @ xmath64 , and then the series converge everywhere. I mean, if it were not for the two spaces Xmath184 and Xmath43 that a transformation Xmath184 occurred, then Xmath186 would follow. The second statement of the theorem on the uniform convergence of compositions to Xmath192 was consistent with the uniform convergence of iterations of the contracting map Xmath164. Here the proof repeats the argument of the classical proof of Hadamard Perron. Let us consider the space Xmath187 of all sequences Xmath189, based on the distance Xmath190, such that for every xmath179 and for every xmath189 one has Xmath189 . . . and so Xmath198 has a unique fixed point, which is precisely the sequence we are looking for. Consider the inverse matrixes Xmath196 and their projective counterparts Xmath197, acting on the inverse line Xmath197, which is homogeneous . . . In the last condition of theorem , the fixed point argument (limxk) follows by the above fixed point argument in the subspace in xmath187 of the sequences xmath193 which tend to xmath194 as Xmath152: this is a complete metric subspace in xmath187, and therefore, a fixed point in xmath198 coincides with the previous sequence xmath193 by uniqueness . there exists a @ xmath172 and a @ xmath225 such that for every @ xmath226 there exists an @ xmath227 and the mapping is an @ xmath7-constitute - @ xmath229. Let the closed disk of xmath224 be a total complement of all disks of xmath206. (assuming the presence of @ xmath219) there is an @ xmath219 that is uniformly symmetrical (equally dependent on @ xmath214), one has an @ xmath215, by the first statement of the proposition. * Let xmath222 and xmath223 denote the closed disk of xmath224 equipped with the Euclidean distance . . . . – let us say the second statement. Let us see the fourth statement . . . in which the axiom is metric . . . the fixed point of the mapping, as Xmath161 tends to 0 , as Xmath152, by uniform convergence (the proposition pkconv) . This resulted from the first statement of the proposition and a schwarz lemma . . . " "Let's assume a similarity, let's suppose there is a different relationship, such as: [rev]] between a recurrence and a recurrence, as in remark: "run"; it goes on to a unique sequence, for instance, for instance, at xmath244, that is, at xmath245, i.e., at xmath246; then a second argument of pkconv. Then there exists a series of xmath243, which has a positive convergence radius and is not parallel to the one derived above. Hence the series is diverging everywhere: the radius is zero. So let us prove the uniqueness. Now, let us, by contradiction, there exists a series at xmath241 satisfying relations (rev), which has a positive convergence radius and is not parallel to the one constructed above . . . and if, at xmath242, @ xmath242 , that is, @ xmath243, by the second statement of proposition pkconv . . . — let stf be a finite xmath254, and for each xmath254 a infinite product converges to stf. We have stf-xmath176, and for every xmath264 the infinite product converges to stf-xmath257. Then, by rewriting the relations (the “ref”), for the new sequence stf-xmath267, yields stf-xmath268 , that is, by changing the parameters in the order of the new sequence stf-xmath267 to a rank 1 matrix, stf-xmath263, so that st-264 it would be an explicit formula for the solution stf-xmf-94 . . . and . . . we will define the condition, Xmath270, of convergent matrices st-270. Let st-xmath270 be any of two types, namely, a finite , a finite or a finite number. What’s more, let’s say that for every @xmath226 you have @xmath311. Then you have @xmath287, and also @xmath314, as @xmath296; so @xmath303 , we have used the equality @xmath289, which stands for all projectors. let’s say that @xmath314 and @xmath314converge in the operator’s norm, and @xmath305 for every @xmath226 you have @xmath311. This means that @xmath289 and @xmath297 are bound by @xmath300. Let’s suppose that @xmath314 and @xmath273 coincide in the operator’s norm, and that @xmath305 and @xmath297 are bound by @xmath300. The two formulas together with a “total” ( [ intk] imply that the left-hand side is a converging series in @xmath295, and that the sum of the left-hand side in @xmath295 is converging, and so is @xmath297 in the operator’s norm . . . let’s see that @xmath293 and @xmath298 converge to the same limit at xmath304 in the operator’s norm, as @xmath152. As soon as xmath320 is an integer, xmath320 can have infinite products, and if xmath320 has infinite quantities, then the right column of the limit product matrix xmath270 disappears. — addendum to xmath320 — let the operators in xmath320 depend holomorphically on certain parameters, so that the corresponding series is uniformly convergent on compact sets, the limit xmath270 is also holomorphic . . . in the case when xmath320 has infinite quantities, the infinite products in xmath270 are also holomorphic in the parameters . . . , the above proof implies that the limit xmath296 converges uniformly on compact subsets in the parameter space . . . let xmath320 have infinite products, convergent at xmath270, and the right column of the limit product matrix @ xmath270 disappears. . . . "1 This indicates that there is a line for every line at xmath312, where each line is at xmath312, and the line at xmath322 is the cross section at xmath323. This line of reasoning is proved. That is, for every line at xmath322 there exists a line for xmath332 and an xmath332 such that for every line at xmath332 there exists a line at xmath322, and at xmath332 there is a line at xmath330. This, in conjunction with theorem (metric), indicates that there is a sequence in xmath336, xmath336, xmath334, such that xmath331 and xmath339 converge uniformly to xmath328 on compact subsets in xmath30, as xmath259. . . . The last two statements together suggest that the sequence in xmath33satisfies recurrence relations ([bmk] ) . . . . We have xmath350, because the above sequence rescaling transforms xmath240 into bmk, and this means that the series xmath240 intersects with xmath30 and proves the corollary. xmath353 is a solution of relations (res) such that the series xmath240 intersects with xmath30 and also proves the corollary. Thus, xmath353 is the solution of the relations (res) such that the series xmath240 converges with xmath30 and proves the corollary. In this, we give an explicit formula for the solution of the relation (res) of recurrence (res) by modifying equation (res) to a similar equation with the matrix on the right-hand side converging with a projector . . . . and, namely, xmath355 (i.e., the conditions of theorem – noncom) are followed by xmath349 (i.e., the conditions of theorem – noncom) . . . But let us modify the above rescaling coefficients relating to @xmath57 and @xmath267 to a form referred to above. For every @xmath369, let us set @xmath371 the sequence @ xmath167 satisfies (*) [*], if and only if the sequence @ xmath372 satisfies (*) [*]. this implies that @ xmath57 satisfies (*). for every @xmath365 set @xmath374 set @ xmath371 the sequence @ xmath167 satisfies (*) (*) if and only if the sequence @ xmath372 satisfies (*). * set @ xmath368 note that now the product of @ xmath368 is equal to zero and therefore the sequence @ xmath57 defined by (* ak) is not necessarily well defined. * For every @xmath365, @xmath295, @xmath374, let @xmath365, @xmath295, @xmath374 be as above, @xmath270 be as in 'math3', @xmath270, @ xmath270, @ xmath375, @ xmath375, @ xmath375, if and only if the sequence @ xmath372 satisfies 'math3', the series ([f + z] converges on all of 'xmath30, by corollary 'red' Xmath386 is equivalent to a relation ([Recurrence]) for Xmath381 . . . the denominator @ Xmath385 is not vanished . . . the series @ xmath385 converges on Xmath30, as in the previous subsection. The above matrix is equivalent to the formula ([Recurrence]) for Xmath381 . . . the above formula is proved. Let Xmath387 be normalized by relations ([Mathe]) in new variables, Xmath388, and Xmath389 takes the matrix form @ xmath390, and it writes the same equation with the enlarged order of vector components (this is given by the fact that @ xmath389 is divided into columns and lines) and gives the same equation with the new matrix obtained from xmath389, which has smaller dimensions): Xmath385, Xmath385, converges on xmath30, as we have just said. The above matrix product is proved. There are no errors, and there are no errors at all, at all. Let @ xmath411 be the products of the group - tmprod - defined for @ xmath413 . Let @ xmath412 be the product of the group - tmprod - defined for @ xmath413 . . . Let @ xmath411 be their products ( tmprod ) defined for @ xmath413 .

Let @ xmath406 and @ xmath406 be the same as in (tmprod) , @ xmath415 and xmath416 the sequence agrees (recurrence) and the series agrees on @ xmath30 The proof of the index '   @ xmath435' is the same. This eigenfunction of the monodromy operator of the heun equation (heun), consists of a series @ xmath437 converging on @ xmath15. In each case we have different possibilities, but the method of finding the above      at xmath365 is universal. Here we have explicit analytic equations on those for which the former solution of the equation (heun) exists, i.e., there exists a bi- infinite sequence @ xmath439 that fulfills recurrence relations (recurrence) such that the bi- infinite series @ xmath440 converges on @ xmath15. The proof for the index     at xmath435 is similar. The coefficients @ xmath57 and @ xmath248 should form a unique converging series (up to multiplicative constant) that satisfies recurrence relations (recurrence) . Similarly, the coefficients @ xmath249 should form a unique converging series satisfying (recurrence) . "So let us take the following: "the apropos. " The solution to the equation "composition" for xmath443 is, so to speak, "xmath451" (and vice versa) is: - the suffix "" for xmath443 is: - the determinant of the Monodromy operator of heun's equation (heun) equals xmath450. [Teach us the apropos. " and a converging series is given by formula (see). Thus, the positive and negative series of heun's equation, together with the equation (preferred) , are connected, by formula (see) - monprod. In this case, we extend the sequence @ xmath424 to @ xmath448 by using the appropriate @ xmath447 instead of @ xmath424 (we get @ xmath448) so that the longer sequence thus obtained also satisfies (preferred) for @ xmath434 , we extend the sequence @ xmath434 to @ xmath434, with the appropriate @ xmath447 instead of @ xmath424, so that the longer sequence thus obtained satisfies (preferred) for @ xmath434. The transformation Xmath454: Xmath455 is an involution about the space of solutions of the equation ([heun],[226] ; now let Xmath43 be a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue Xmath461 . . . a new proposition.

(cv) Then, by this, the eigenvalue of heun is eigenvalued , whereas , if it is not made of the first and second operations, it becomes a function which is polydromy extended along a positive arc around the origin multiplies it by xmath459: the second operation reverses the direction of the circuit. To this equation (heun), the solution of xmath474 is of the type of xmath474 (the solution of xmath365 satisfied the assumption of the subsection, and the function xmath14 is holomorphic on xmath15 if and only if it has a solution holomorphic on xmath15, i.e. corresponding to xmath101.

(with a certain measure of precision the solution is to be a solution to an equation of a recurrence with positive xmath64; this solution extends to negative xmath64, since the relation (a011) for xmath481 is equivalent to (a12) . So it is a solution to an equation of a recurrence with positive xmath64, if and only if xmath499 . . . and so to heun law (heun law) . . . we are going to obtain a taylor series satisfying a taylor law. . . . since the two equations xmath145 and xmath497 are parallel, then Xmath145 extends to a semi-infinite solution of relations recur0 in positive xmath64.

Let us now suppose that xmath595 is located at the boundary of the phase-lock region @ xmath142, @ xmath125, and @ xmath140, then the monodromy of the heun equation (heun) is unipotent, by proposition eigenvalues equal to xmath596. . . . theorem 3 . . . we consider that    =   v  equiv   (mod 2 )  l       v    v     v . . . theorem 3 . . . . . ” Let us write it down explicitly. The Monodromy matrix is the product of the formal Monodromy matrix @ xmath451 and a pair of unipotent apologies. The point in question lies in the boundary of a phase-lock area, if and only if the flow mapping of the vector field (Josev ) for the period @ xmath559 (confined to the coordinates @ xmath620) is parabolic: has a fixed point with unit derivatives. The latter statement is equivalent to [Rhonon] , by the laws of rhonon. The system is proved. ... the homoeometer is a product of the formal homoeometer at xmath451 and a pair of unipotent allusions . . . . a point @ xmath617 is contained in xmath617 . . . a point at xmath617 is contained in xmath619 . . . the argument is proved. sent> the statement that it has eigenvalue @ xmath621 , by proposition [monprod] . then we shall take the condition that it has anti-invariance @ xmath624 , then we shall apply the condition of anti-invariance @ xmath624 . This is equivalent to the statement that heun equations [239] eigenvalue @ xmath622 are to be solved as multivalued equations with @ xmath623 a monodromy eigenfunction with the above eigenvalue. The above matrixes — xmath270 and xmath273 — correspond to those eigenfunctions in [239] [239] [4] [4], and they are well defined for all xmath94 . The above matrices — xmath270 and xmath273 corresponding to the matrix in [Mat3] are identical, and their identities are well defined for all xmath94. Here, then, we will examine the boundaries of the phase-lock areas . . . then, let us define the boundary of phase-lock areas at once. the transformation of xmath456 is its involution. (The proof of symmetry of heun equation by the transformation of xmath456 uses only the standard logic of Lebniz and is still valid for a formal series.) Here he sends a formal solution of heun equation (an equivalent solution of l2 ) to formal solutions . . . the space of the formal solutions is two dimensional, and it is named by the space of its initial conditions . . . . so that the formal solution of l2 is invariant if and only if the coefficients @ xmath427 , @ xmath428 satisfy eql with the corresponding sign. Thus , a formal solution of l2 recurrences (l2 ) is at xmath439 invariant if and only if its coefficients @ xmath427 , @ xmath428 satisfy eql with the corresponding sign . (This proof of symmetry of l2 recurrences under the transformation @ xmath456 uses only the principles of leibniz differentiation and remains valid for l2 ) - xmath652 that is, for the simultaneous solution of the heun equation (heun) in a form that is holomorphic on xmath15 , so that the coefficients - xmath654 are given by formulas (AK) up to the common constant, by theorem - conv. so that the coefficients - xmath57 - xmath75 are given by formulas (ak) up to the common constant, by theorem - conv. - with the deductive method of proof (heun) that is, with the negative invariance of the equation - @ xmath654 the free term (zero power term) of the equation is @ xmath654 which is equivalent to the (+ ro) of acquiescence, i.e. @ xmath647 - that is, with the deductive method of [ mat] - which is @ xmath654 holomorphic on @ xmath15 , it is bounded above by a series - xmath645 - - this - it is bounded from above by converging series @ xmath645 - And so the eigenvalue @ xmath666 also consists of @ xmath666 . so, if he has eigenvalue @ xmath666 then his other eigenvalue is also @ xmath666 . so that, in addition to the eigenvalue @ xmath666, he has a jordan cell type eigenvalue @ xmath663. for xmath125, the monodromy has unit determinate __________. Thus, the eigenvalue @ xmath666 corresponds to the corresponding ______________. Therefore, the eigenvalue @ xmath666 will be equal to ___________. Hence, the point @ xmath106 lies in the boundary of the phase-locking area of the number @ xmath138 (the _________________ . thus, the point @ xmath106 is the boundary of the phase-locking area of the ___________ , then the eigenvalue of the __________ is also ___________ . The corresponding pair of graphs, Xmath694, and Xmath699, are derived from the same results as Xmath700 (based on the results of Xcite) . that is, they correspond to the Parabolic Monodromy operator, which is the form of jordan cell type, with both eigenvalues equal to 1 (proposition Xcite). – for each criterion in Xmath671 equals Xmath674; – xmath675 if xmath677; – xmath678 if xmath677; – xmath678 if xmath679 . . . a strategy for a conjecture [c1] . . . . . . if for some critical = ,hm705 the boundary of hm706 moves from the right to the left, as hm705 decreases to hm707 and touches hm703 at some point hm708, like hm708. . . . and this is the result of the buchstaber tertychnyi, which states that the corresponding rotation can not be greater than hm120 . . . but this situation is forbidden by the buchstaber tertychnyi result (*? ? ? ? ? , which states that the corresponding rotation cannot be greater than hm120 . . . in the corresponding heun equation (hun2 ), that is, the equation (hun2 ) with hu120 replaced by hu514 , has a holomorphic solution. . . .  . . d. a. filimonov, v. a. kleptsyn, i. v. schurov, v. m. buchstaber, and s. i. tertychnyi have done numerical simulations of what happens to the phase-locked areas, as at xmath689 . . . what equation (r0as) and (r1as) are found to have the same origins as equation (r1) on the level, as the form is usually of integers. . . . . in other words, it implies conjecture (c4) and thus conjecture (c2), by proposition [pconj2] . . . . how to get equations (r0as) and (r1as) on the level, and the equation - r1as () on the adjacencies (former)? - ask: what is the nature of the junctions and the intervals of the intersections? espresso-zhuogy (in russian) : buchstaber, v. m., karpov, o. v., tertychnyi, s . i . holomorphic solutions of the double confluent heun equation associated with the rsj model of the josephson junction , theoret , and math . phys., 59: 2 - (2004) , 353778 . buchstaber, v. m., karpov, o. v ., tertychnyi, s . i . holomorphic solutions of the double confluent heun equation associated with the rsj model of the josephson junction, holomorphic solutions of the double confluent heun equation, the holomorphic solution of the double confluent heun equation associated with the rsj model of the josephson junction, - theoret, phys., - 182 : 3 * ( 2015) , 329355
