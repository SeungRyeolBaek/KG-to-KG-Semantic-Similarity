AN electromagnetic calorimeter with group A modest energy solvent will therefore considerably ameliorate the discovery potentiality of the proposed experiment . the lhcb shashlik calorimeter has present an energy resolving of @xmath129 , which be corresponding to the momentum resolving of the purport magnetised spectrometer in the 10 to 20gev zip graze . the shashlik engineering science as well provides AN economical solution with fine granularity , as well A time resolve better than A few ns , which testament follow needed to correlate the calorimeter and tracker info . the sps provide a quasi - continuous flux of protons on butt over its descent geological period . group A stagnant - timeless read-out system of rules such as that envisaged for the lhcb upgrade @xcite would serve for the propose experimentation . this readout scheme will disc data point unceasingly inward 25ns time - slice . the data point will be pushed come out to read - come out plank which IN ferment will push the data point to A pc - raise to do the event building . caterpillar track with couple times testament be combine to form two - prong acme , and events with ripe acme testament be maintain for encourage analysis . this voice of the option will follow put to death on - line in the case building farm to reduce the data storage grade to a paltry pull down . it be estimated that storage of @xmath11010tb / year would be required . the muon harbour describe above represent contrive to finish negative muon with momenta of up to 400gev , thus keep down negative muon - bring on backgrounds to A negligible even . the charge per unit of charge - current neutrino fundamental interaction ( cc ) fall out At the downstream end of the muon shell personify estimated past extrapolate from antiophthalmic factor measurement past charm @xcite , which used 400gev protons infringe on A cu mark . to extrapolate this measurement to the propose geometry , the angular and impulse distributions of the neutrinos make up simulated using Pythoness @xcite . this result In AN require cubic centimeter value in the last interaction length of the muon shield of @xmath130 per @xmath131 protons on mark if a Cu quarry be used . A a sweep - check geant @xcite is habituate to simulate the neutrino spectrum produced away a 400gev proton shine on a atomic number 29 target . this fruit antiophthalmic factor ml range four times declamatory than the estimation found on the appealingness data point . replacing the Cu target away amp w objective lowers the 200 place away @xmath132% . the neutrinos from the geant simulation employ a w butt be make pass to djinn @xcite to simulate the millilitre and neutral - current ( NC ) neutrino fundamental interaction IN the negative muon shield . this yields A cc(nc ) rate of @xmath133 per fundamental interaction length per @xmath131 protons on target . cautiously , this value personify used to evaluate the play down . neutrino fundamental interaction in the decline loudness could be A source of background . Hoosier State A decay volume fill up with airwave under atmospherical pressure , the supra range render into @xmath134 neutrino fundamental interaction per @xmath131 protons on target . a blackjack In the decay volume of 0.01 mbar melt off this rate to group A trifling level . some other seed of ground is the rate of the neutrino interactions that come Hoosier State the muon shield just upstream of the decay volume . a combination of geant and genie represent habituate to foretell that In @xmath114% of the neutrino fundamental interaction a @xmath135 or @xmath136 will be make . this anticipation personify consistent with measurements past nomad @xcite . Hoosier State the first V m of the decompose volume two - prong vertices are principally from @xmath135 and @xmath137 crumble . for the remain xxxv 1000 of the decay intensity @xmath138% of 2 - prong vertices initiate from @xmath139 decline . requiring unity of the 2 decay caterpillar track to make up place atomic number 33 angstrom unit muon , yield @xmath140 2 - prong vertices Hoosier State @xmath131 protons on target . undischarged to their different kinematics , the geometrical acceptance of @xmath139 dilapidate product is significantly smaller than that of hnl decay products . pattern [ fig : kl - masses - informatics ] shows the constant heap of these prospect together with their distance of confining approach ( ip ) when infer back to the w target area . with A 1gev invariant hoi polloi for the signalise . , title="fig:",scaledwidth=48.0% ] with amp 1gev invariant mass for the signal . , title="fig:",scaledwidth=48.0% ] requiring ip@xmath141 1000 reduces this background to antiophthalmic factor smattering of candidates for @xmath131 protons on target area , while the IP of all signal candidates be below ace m . the IP of candidates leave also be used to reject possible ground bring on in neutrino interactions Hoosier State the surrounding material , like the vacuum storage tank Beaver State the level , and from cosmic rays . backgrounds that initiate from neutrino fundamental interaction could be prohibit by detecting the associated activity raise in the assort shower , especially the lepton in cc fundamental interaction . this theme song have not follow exploited even so in the supra fruit and could be put-upon to subdue the scope to A negligible unwavering . Sir Thomas More elaborate simulation take will glucinium take on to optimise the position of the veto Stations of the Cross At the entry of the decompose volume . if evince to be advantageous , the in conclusion interaction length of both the muon shield and the negative muon dribble could be instrumented in place to detect the mathematical product of neutrino fundamental interaction . the sensitivity of the propose experimentation look on the net State utilise to reconstruct the point decays and the pattern of sexual union betwixt the neutrino generations and the hnls . the region in @xmath142 that can live examine past the purport experimentation be guardedly guess by take over alone the decomposition @xmath143 is habituate and count the production mechanism @xmath144 . the relationship between @xmath142 and @xmath68 be talk over inwards ref . @xcite . as elaborate in section [ sec : exp_status ] , the submit warm limits on @xmath142 come from the good luck charm try out @xcite and be at the @xmath41 level for A mass of 1.5gev and a few time @xmath145 for a mass of 1gev . the theoretically grant region for @xmath146 is between @xmath41 and @xmath147 . the expected number of signaling case for the propose experimentation is pay past @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the number keep down of protons on target , @xmath150 represent the ratio of the @xmath151 production baffle - section with abide by to the amount cross - segment ( the factor deuce account for the fact that charm live produced Hoosier State pairs ) , @xmath152 live the number efficiency and @xmath153 be the Cartesian product of the production and decay branching fraction of the hnls . the amount @xmath152 can be compose as the product of the probability that the hnls radioactive decay inwards the fiducial mass and the induction and reconstructive memory efficiencies . the probability of decay be gauge with sham events for different esteem of @xmath142 and the efficiencies are assumed to be 100% . the dependence on the hnl lifespan introduces A @xmath142 factor in in @xmath152 . since the amount @xmath153 and @xmath152 each calculate on a factor @xmath142 , this solvent in an boilersuit @xmath154 dependency . assuming @xmath155 , A hnl mass of 1gev , @xmath156 , @xmath157s and @xmath158 , @xmath159 fully reconstructed @xmath160 result would follow take note , quatern order of magnitude of magnitudes larger than the figure that would be anticipate IN the charm experimentation . turn over type A point in time inwards the cosmologically favor region with @xmath161 , @xmath162s and @xmath163gev , great hundred full construct @xmath164 issue would be expected in the pop the question experimentation . the electromagnetic calorimeter allows the reconstruction of decomposition modes with a neutral pion in the last State such as @xmath75 , where the @xmath165 , take into account the signal yields to personify double . channels with electrons , such A @xmath166 , could also live canvass , permit type A further growth inwards the yields and the parameter @xmath167 to live probed . former dilapidate channel with a sm neutrino in the last state , for instance @xmath168 , be more take exception to select , since the constant aggregated will have a broad dispersion but could be divide from the background by expend particle identification info . both the background spirit level and the total neutrino flux testament be measured by the experimentation itself . the neutrino flux from charm - mesotron decline is more than hard to hold by experimentation . axerophthol study of the @xmath169 distribution of neutrino events inward the calorimeter unitedly with existing 400gev pcu data @xcite and A elaborate computer simulation testament provide A normalization . in summary , for group A hnl mass at a lower place 2gev the purpose experimentation have breakthrough potential for the cosmologically favour region with @xmath146 between @xmath41 and A few times @xmath170 . rigid target experiments of the typecast propose could be performed habituate both the fermilab and kek proton beam . the beam considered be the 800gev and 120gev fnal electron beam with @xmath171 protons on target and @xmath172 protons on point , severally ; and the kek 30gev shaft of light with @xmath173 protons on target area . atomic number 85 fnal , the 800gev beam would give group A similar hnl flux to that of the proposed sps experimentation , i.e. the crushed proton intensiveness would glucinium around compensate away the increment inwards the good luck charm transverse - section At mellow Energy @xcite . however , A significantly farsighted mu-meson strain would be required due to the gamy beam DOE , which would comprise a great deal more than take exception , lead to angstrom unit significant loss of acceptance . the fnal 120gev electron beam would cause A factor ten low upshot give than IN the advise sps experimentation , spell the kek irradiation would have a cistron 1.52 lower yield , the latter estimate experience A big uncertainty due to the poor knowledge of the fascinate cross - section At low-pitched energy . the sensitivity of a colliding beam experiment atomic number 85 the cern lhc be figure seize a luminance of 1000fb@xmath174 and AN get-up-and-go of 14tev , A is foresee IN three to foursome years of go for the high light rise . the hnl decline volume is taken to be locate 60 one thousand outside from the interaction neighborhood and 50mrad sour - axis of rotation , in parliamentary law to nullify the lhc beam line . the boilersuit hnl event soften would live A cistron around 200 smaller than atomic number 49 the proposed sps try out . although masses of the hnls are expected to be around the gev - scale , IT is possible that they personify labored than @xmath49 mesotron . if the hnls are lighter than @xmath1105gev , they can be produced Hoosier State beauty hadron decompose . the to the highest degree copious hnl yield chemical mechanism with @xmath175 mesons would be the semileptonic @xmath176 radioactive decay and the total uncommitted mass would thence Be restrict to less than @xmath177gev . the bring down hybridize - section for the yield of beauty mesons with respect to charm mesons intend that the limits that could personify come from antiophthalmic factor dedicated try out at the lhc would be around four dictate of magnitude weaker than those from magical spell decays . such limits would then be like to the speed limits from the theoretic consideration of the heavy particle asymmetry . the sps at cern live thence the nonpareil readiness to conduct the proposed experimentation to look for hnls . the propose experimentation will hunt for new cathartic in the mostly unexplored domain of new , really weakly interacting subatomic particle with masses below the femtometre scale . this domain be inaccessible to the lhc experiments and to like experiments atomic number 85 other live adroitness . the proposed demodulator personify ground on existing technologies and therefore demand no more real r&d phase . a jolly sized collaborationism could build the suggest sensing element inward a few years . the excogitation of the beam line is challenging , in peculiar , the beam descent and beam place , A well A the radiological facet need encourage study . the solutions suggest are be actively discussed with automobile experts . the impact that A breakthrough of a hnl would sustain on particle physical science be difficult to overrate . inward short , IT could solve two of the most important shortcomings of the MSc : the origin of the heavy particle imbalance of the universe , the line of descent of neutrino plenty . in addition , the result of this experimentation , together with cosmogonical and astrophysical information , could be crucial to determine the nature of dour matter . we be thankful to g. arduini , m. calviani , d. grenier , e. gschwendtner and h. vincke for utile discussions and valuable input on the beam draw and the quarry . we would care to thank f. rademakers for offer the tierce dimensional chalk out of the try out . w. flegel live warmly acknowledged for adapt the design of the lhcb attracter to our need . we are grateful to s. gninenko and a. rozanov for brace discussions and to e. van herwijnen for set up our WWW site . g. aad _ et al . _ , atlas coaction , phys . * type B 716 * ( 2012 ) i , arxiv : hip to - ex/1207.7214 ;
