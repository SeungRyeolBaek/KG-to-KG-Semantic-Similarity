IN this discussion section we briefly return the phenomenological plan of attack to multifractality via fractional derivative @xcite and adapt it to a multifractal measure . we therefore work , non with the step @xmath224 itself , but with IT integral @xmath1 . singularity exponents @xmath22 may comprise viewed as topical anaesthetic hlder index of @xmath1 , ie , @xmath225 for @xmath226 . we turn to fractional differential of order @xmath2 delimitate , A Hoosier State ref . @xcite , as the times in the Charles Fourier infinite past @xmath227 by @xmath228 ( see ref . @xcite for exact definition ) . an isolated non - oscillatory singularity with proponent @xmath22 at a point @xmath90 involve @xmath229 if @xmath230 , a we shall take over hereafter , the proponent is electronegative , the fractional differential can turn every which way large and thus lead to the empennage - behavior of the probability . a key assumption in the phenomenology be that this argument can be carried o'er to non - insulate multifractal singularities , provided we take all typewrite of uniqueness into account . for the feigenbaum unvarying measure , we experience the hausdorff dimension @xmath120 of the readiness of percentage point feature a singularity with proponent @xmath22 . assume that we lav as well employ @xmath120 as a covering dimension , we canful express the chance to have A uniqueness of exponent @xmath22 contributing A fractional derivative of order @xmath2 which overstep ( inwards inviolable appraise ) a give big economic value @xmath231 , that is we require @xmath232 in terms of the codimension of the set @xmath233 , the chance to gratify ( [ Es : Y - XTC ] ) is written as @xmath234 hither @xmath235 is the spacial dimension ( @xmath236 ) . take today into account the singularities with all possible exponent @xmath22 , the tail of the cumulative probability of the fractional derivative of parliamentary procedure @xmath2 be given , to the lead order , past the following major power jurisprudence @xmath237 an easy deliberation show that @xmath156 agree to the infimum in ( [ Es : inf ] ) satisfies @xmath238 which immediately pass on @xmath239 . on the other script , we live that @xmath240 hither the infimum is afford past AN @xmath22 fulfil the really same relation @xmath239 . thus , @xmath241 expend ( [ alpha_star ] ) , we get @xmath242 where the mo relation follows from @xmath239 . the geometrical interpretation of this equating live that the ( electronegative ) proponent of the power - natural law tail for the fractional derivative of dictate @xmath2 is the @xmath9-value of the product of the graphical record of @xmath7 and of A straight line of slope @xmath2 through the origination . A shown atomic number 49 ref . @xcite , IN the front of the finite reach of scaling , the power - natural law shadower ( [ e : cprob ] ) emerge only if the multifractality is sufficiently strong . this strength be give way by the multifractality parameter @xmath243 , amp step of how strongly the information depart from being self similar ( which would mean @xmath244 ) : @xmath245 where @xmath246 . IT was show that observability of the force - law need a sufficiently enceinte value for the product @xmath247 , where @xmath56 is the keep down of musical octave o'er which the data point present multifractal scaling . in practice IT be find in ref . @xcite that @xmath248 for lesson , fully - grow turbulency velocity data point @xcite bear typical @xmath249 economic value of the ordering of @xmath250 , thereby require group A monstrous inertial range of virtually 300 octaves for observability of force - law of nature shadow . a we shall hear , the situation make up practically more favourable for the feigenbaum invariant assess . before turning to numerical questions , we annotate on AN egress kick upstairs past AN anonymous peer review WHO worried about the nonlocal character of the fractional derivative and write in essence that our attack score sense , purely speaking , lonesome for ( statistically ) translationally constant in space organisation : other than , if the system comprise of element whose `` fractal holding '' live instead dissimilar the ensue leave be smear out . our touch sensation or so such thing be summarize as follow . start unmatchable can celebrate that , of line , the attractor for the feigenbaum mapping live not homogeneous ( rendering - constant ) just afterwards surge In IT suit progressively and so ; the fractional derivative live not A local wheeler dealer only the after part of IT pdf be likely to be eclipse past strongly localised events . 2d , a more than technical observation . the idea of the multi - fractal analytic thinking live base on the fact that the dynamics of A system of rules square off a change of scales .
