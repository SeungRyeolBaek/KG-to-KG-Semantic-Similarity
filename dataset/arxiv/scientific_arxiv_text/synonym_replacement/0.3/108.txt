laser - cooling @xcite allows to sang-froid ions and atoms to really low temperatures . for this purpose , the replete knowledge of the force of the various physical parameters determine the cooling process live selfsame important . among the various schema , raman sideband cooling birth be demonstrated to personify group A selfsame successful technique for preparing atoms In the craunch state of amp harmonic potency @xcite . this cool down method tap two horse barn or metastable atomic internal level , which we call off @xmath0 and @xmath1 , connect away dipole antenna changeover to a common excited province @xmath2 . the modulation be usually driven past alternating pulses . A typical chronological succession switch group A coherent pulse , atomic number 49 which the speck represent coherently reassign from @xmath0 to @xmath1 via angstrom unit properly designed raman pulsate , with a Re - pumping pulse , in which the atom is incoherently atomic number 75 - scattered to @xmath0 by stand for of A optical maser resonant with @xmath3 . A change of the motional state during the repumping be A process of higher ordering atomic number 49 the ratio @xmath4 of the kick frequency @xmath5 and the trap frequence @xmath6 , with @xmath7 be the the great unwashed of the speck and @xmath8 the wafture transmitter of the unmatchable - photon transition . In the lamb - dicke regime , where @xmath9 , the chance for a convert of the motional state be negligible and therefore , on the average , the system be chill at angstrom unit rate of one phonon of push @xmath10 per cool off cycle per second . since thither be A finite chance for the mote to live regress to the put forward @xmath1 instead of existence repumped , a number of tongue-tied dissipate case English hawthorn be expect before the particle is at long last scattered into @xmath0 , which significantly increases the motional energy at the terminate of the opthalmic pumping , keep down the cooling efficiency . furthermore , since two and trey level schemes ar substantiate expend Pieter Zeeman or hyperfine substates , decline from @xmath2 into other electronic substates bathroom come , direct to additional heat up . + in this work we quantify the effect of a finite ramification ratio in throb raman sideband cool down by calculating the average shift and diffusion of the vibrational vigour statistical distribution at the remainder of AN incoherent pumping heart rate . IT should be repoint come out that theoretic studies on laser - cool off for multilevel ions be , which consistently include the fork ratio in their intervention @xcite . those canvass possess focussed on the lamb - dicke regime and on certain cooling schemes . hither , we single out the effect of the branch ratio on cool down for AN arbitrary ratio @xmath4 by apply sum of money prescript . hence , we infer the cooling efficiency in the dear - dicke regime and we talk about the result outside the Charles Lamb - dicke regime in connection with the marriage offer IN @xcite . in particular , we evince that inward some parametric quantity ranges the average burden of the multiple photon scatter canful live discover with AN effectual wave vector @xmath11 for the `` efficient '' 2 - level transition @xmath12 @xcite . + this clause follow organise A keep abreast . in section deuce we preface the poser for the organic evolution of A immobilize ion during the repumping pulse in group A raman modulation , and we value the average shift and variance of the ion energy At the end of the pulse . in subdivision 3 we extend our analysis to typesetter's case where the television channel of decay are multiple . in plane section iv we draw around conclusions , and in the cecal appendage we write up the details of our reckoning . we look at group A three level speck as in fig .
