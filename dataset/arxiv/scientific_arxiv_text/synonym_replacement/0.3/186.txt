" this hence evince that the subordinator be type A powerful bayesian approaching for variable selection . atomic number 49 this paper we make introduce subordinators into the definition of nonconvex penalisation function . this extend us to a bayesian go about for fabricate sparsity - inducing pretender - priors . IN particular , we get illustrate the expend of two deepen poisson subordinators : the combine poisson Vasco da Gamma subordinator and the negative binomial subordinator . IN increase , we make make the relationship between the two home of deepen poisson subordinators . that is , we have proved that the two families of compound poisson subordinators portion out the same limiting behaviors . moreover , their denseness atomic number 85 apiece sentence have the same mean and variance . we feature developed the ecme algorithmic program for solving thin learning problem base on the nonconvex log , exp , lfr and cel penalization . we have conducted the observational compare with the state - of - the - art approach . the lead have present that our nonconvex penalization attack be potentially useful atomic number 49 high - dimensional bayesian modeling . our plan of attack tin live cast into type A head estimation fabric .
