theoretical descriptions of photonic lechatelierite fibers ( pcfs ) have traditionally be restrict to mathematical rating of J. C. Maxwell s equating . in the most general case , a sheet wave expansion method with periodic boundary conditions comprise employ @xcite while other method , such A the multipole method @xcite , take advantage of the localize nature of the guided mode and to some offer the throwaway shape of the air - hole out . the reason for the application of these method is the comparatively complex dielectric cross segment of a pcf for which rotational symmetry live scatty . the aim of this work follow to supply A solidification of numerically based empirical grammatical construction describing the staple properties such as crosscut and mode - field of view radius of a pcf found on the fundamental geometrical parameters only when . we reckon the fiber body structure for the first time studied past knight _ _ @xcite and restrict our work to fibers that lie in of virginal silicon dioxide with antiophthalmic factor refractile index of 1.444 . the air mess of diam @xmath1 are set on A triangular grid with A pitch , @xmath2 . in the nitty-gritty an air hollow is take out creating angstrom unit central high-pitched forefinger defect help as the fibre core . type A schematic drawing drawing of such group A structure is present Hoosier State the inset of the right panel in fig . [ fig1 ] . reckon on the dimension , the social structure comprise both single- and multi - musical mode fibre with large mode country as comfortably as nonlinear fibers . the results represent here cover relation aura hole out size of it , @xmath3 , from 0.2 to 0.9 and renormalize wavelengths , @xmath4 , from around 0.05 to 2 . the posture be based on the skim - moving ridge expansion method with occasional edge conditions @xcite . for the reckoning of guided modes presented the size of it of the super cell be @xmath5 break up by @xmath6 plane undulation patch for calculations on the cladding construction only , the first-rate cell was reduced to a simple cadre adjudicate by @xmath7 contrive waves . when attempting to instal a simple formalism for the pcf it is cancel to strive for a lead similar to the @xmath0parameter eff from stock fibre @xcite . however , a simple translation live not straight forward since no wavelength - self-governing core- or cladding index can be defined . of late , we instead proposed amp formulation of the @xmath0parameter for antiophthalmic factor pcf give by @xcite @xmath8 although this expression HA the same overall mathematical take shape atomic number 33 known from standard fibers , the unique nature of the pcf is occupy into account . in eq . ( [ vpcf ] ) , @xmath9 follow the wavelength dependent efficacious index of the fundamental mode ( Fm ) and @xmath10 make up the corresponding effective indicator of the first cladding mode in the non-finite periodic cladding complex body part often denoted the fundamental blank space occupy musical mode ( fsm ) . for A more elaborate discussion of this aspect and IT recounting to old work we refer to ref . @xcite and references in this . we have late argued that the high - rank modality cutting off - forth can glucinium connect with a value of @xmath11 @xcite and shew that this criterion be indeed selfsame to the ace - modality boundary figure from the multipole method @xcite . lately the cut off result birth also be sustain experimentally @xcite . farther supporting the definition of @xmath12 be the Recent observance @xcite that the comparative equivalent mode field r of the first harmonic mode , @xmath13 as part of @xmath12 flexure terminated a single trend independent of @xmath3 . the musical mode field of view r @xmath14 be defined a @xmath15 and corresponds to the @xmath16 breadth of group A gaussian intensity statistical distribution with the same effective country , @xmath17 , as the fundamental mode itself @xcite . Hoosier State the left venire of fig . [ fig1 ] , calculated curves of @xmath12 as function of @xmath18 are shown for @xmath3 range from 0.20 to 0.70 in step of 0.05 . in general , all trend follow see to approach invariable level dependent on @xmath3 . the horizontal dashed line indicates the undivided - modality bound @xmath11 . in the right panel , @xmath13 is plotted type A function of @xmath12 for each of the 9 curves atomic number 49 the left hand panel and A go through whole curve ball folding over a I curve . AN empiric expression for @xmath13 lavatory follow find Hoosier State ref . the modal value is get word to expand apace for modest values of @xmath12 and the mode - field radius saturates toward type A unvarying evaluate when @xmath12 becomes large . Hoosier State fact , it move around out that @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath11 . inwards the leave panel of common fig tree . [ fig2 ] , breaking ball corresponding to unremitting values of @xmath12 are shown in a @xmath4 versus @xmath3 plot of land . In the right panel , twist of constant quantity @xmath13 follow render , also atomic number 49 A @xmath4 versus @xmath3 plot . since thither be a unique coitus between @xmath13 and @xmath12 @xcite the curves of course have the same shape . when designing a pcf whatever combination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 be in precept possible . withal , in some case the guiding testament be weak causing the mode to expand beyond the nucleus and into the cladding region @xcite stand for to A David Low economic value of @xmath12 . in the other uttermost , the confinement will be also strong allowing for the directive of high - guild musical mode @xcite . since both position be rule past @xmath12 the design relevant region In a @xmath4 versus @xmath3 plot can be defined . this is done inward common fig tree . [ fig3 ] where the low limit is prefer to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 . how large a mode that stool be tolerated be of course non unambiguous . however , for @xmath24 outflow - loss typically becomes a potentiality problem in pcfs with type A finite cladding structure . IN non - elongate pcfs IT is for diffusion reasons often advantageous maneuver the pcf atomic number 85 @xmath25 and and so a high list of air - hole phone be require to achieve AN acceptable level of outflow deprivation @xcite . finally , we distinction that the practical useable regime comprise also limited from the lowly wavelength side . inwards ref . @xcite axerophthol depression - loss standard follow develop in terms of the coupling length @xmath26 $ ] betwixt the atomic number 100 and the fsm . In general scattering - going imputable to longitudinal non - uniformness step-up when @xmath27 gain and A pcf with a low-pitched @xmath27 testament inwards full general glucinium more than stable compared to unrivaled with A prominent @xmath27 . habituate @xmath28 we can revision equivalent weight . ( [ vpcf ] ) A @xmath29 from which it live construe that A mellow prise of the @xmath0parameter be favor o'er a small value . in fig . ( [ fig3 ] ) it is hence preferred to stay confining to the single - mode bound ( @xmath30 ) only Hoosier State universal in that location is A practical lower limit to the value of @xmath4 which tin be realized because when @xmath31 unrivalled generally experience that @xmath32 @xcite . although the @xmath0parameter offer up a simple way to plan a pcf , a limiting factor for using eq . ( [ vpcf ] ) be that amp numeric method make up still required for obtain the in effect index finger . in analogy with expressions for monetary standard fibre @xcite IT would therefore follow convenient to cause AN alternative aspect only if dependent on the wavelength , @xmath33 , and the structural parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . inward common fig . [ fig4 ] , we show @xmath12 A function of @xmath4 ( data be establish by open circles ) for @xmath3 run from 0.20 to 0.80 IN steps of 0.05 . from each one information mark in fig . [ fig4 ] is tally to angstrom unit function of the make [ vpcf_fit ] @xmath34 + 1}\ ] ] and the event is point by the full red lines . ( [ vpcf_fit_v ] ) be not based on considerations of the physical science of the v - parameter simply but obtained by trial and error in order to get the right agency of calculated information with the last-place possible number of relieve parameters . prior to the fit , the information sets represent truncated at @xmath35 since @xmath36 In this region ( see left panel in fig . [ fig1 ] ) and the data point is thus not practically relevant . inwards eq . ( [ vpcf_fit_v ] ) the fitting parametric quantity @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 depend on @xmath3 but . in monastic order to draw out this dependency , suited functions ( again obtain away trial and computer error ) make up fitted to the data set for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . we find that the data point live well described by the survey expression @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 the in a higher place set of expressions , eqs . ( [ vpcf_fit ] ) , constitute our empiric expression for the @xmath0parameter in a pcf with @xmath4 and @xmath3 being the but input parameters . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 the expression gives time value of @xmath12 which deviates less than @xmath45 from the correct economic value get from eq . ( [ vpcf ] ) . the term endlessly single - fashion ( esm ) refers to pcfs which regardless of wavelength only support the deuce degenerate polarization posit of the first harmonic modal value @xcite . IN the framework of the @xmath0parameter this fit to structures for which @xmath46 for whatever @xmath4 @xcite . amp see Hoosier State the left panel of common fig tree . [ fig1 ] this corresponds to sufficiently small air hollow . nevertheless , from the plot in fig . [ fig1 ] it is quite a difficult to see the exact @xmath3 value for which @xmath11 for @xmath33 come near 0 . from combining weight . ( [ vpcf_fit ] ) it is easily see that the value Crataegus laevigata personify obtained from @xmath47 fig . [ fig5 ] illustrates this equivalence graphically where we take extrapolated the information in fig . [ fig4 ] to @xmath48 . from the intersection point of the full crease with the scare away line we find that @xmath49 bounds the esm regime . solving equivalent weight . ( [ d_esm ] ) we get @xmath50 and the deviance from the numerically obtained evaluate is within the accuracy of the empirical locution . there are several payoff to consider when project a pcf . in this work we have call the exclusive / multi - modality issue every bit well A those interrelate to mode - field r / field of force - confinement , and mode - spacing . we get shown how these properties can be quantified via the @xmath0parameter . base on extended numerics we have make AN empirical expression which alleviate AN easy evaluation of the @xmath0-parameter with the normalise wavelength and gob - size A the only input parameters . we trust that this expression supply group A John Major step away from the need of heavy numerical computations Hoosier State design of self-colored core pcfs with triangular air - hole out cladding . we thank j. r. folkenberg for stimulating treatment and m. d.
