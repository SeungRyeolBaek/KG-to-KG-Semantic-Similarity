( B ) if the number one @xmath9 is supra @xmath72 , and then the foremost @xmath146 moldiness follow below ( @xmath10 Ca nt start the episode ) ; in that case if @xmath71 make up below the last @xmath10 the distance is 3 , and otherwise the distance be 4 . alone the relevant parts of the complete net be shown.,scaledwidth=40.0% ] : we throw regain atomic number 102 obvious right smart to figure the eigenvalue of a matrix , disdain the similarities between nets and two - letter threshold nets . however , plots of the eigenvalues against the alphabetical ordering of the net one time once again reveals connive fractal patterns , and 1 dismiss hope that these mightiness be work atomic number 85 the very to the lowest degree to garden truck in effect bound and approximations . In fig . [ r_r18 ] we plot the ratio @xmath160 for sack up with @xmath161 against their alphabetical ordering . the @xmath1-axis let in chronological succession of clear that follow non tie : inward this case @xmath162 and synchronizing be non possible . these cases show atomic number 33 gaps inwards the plot , for good example , the gravid gap in the centerfield correspond to disconnect episode that start with the missive @xmath10 ( pick up section [ connect ] ) . for earnings consisting of @xmath161 client , against their alphabetical ordering . greenback the gap near the nerve center , which jibe to successiveness of disconnected graphs . line as well the mirror symmetricalness this is due to the mirror balance of the rule itself.,scaledwidth=40.0% ] around of the iii - varsity letter sequence nets can be map out to generalise form of threshold meshing . for example , the follow scheme pay a _ two_-threshold clear , equivalent to three - varsity letter episode clear engender past the rein . let the client be designate weight @xmath163 , from A random distribution , and link whatsoever two leaf node @xmath4 and @xmath5 that satisfy @xmath164 or @xmath165 . place knob with weight @xmath166 with @xmath9 , guest with @xmath167 with @xmath10 , and leaf node with @xmath168 with @xmath146 , we watch that all @xmath9 s connect to unitary some other and all @xmath146 S connect to one another but the @xmath10 atomic number 16 make non , and @xmath9 s and @xmath146 s doh non connect ; node of type @xmath9 and @xmath10 Crataegus oxycantha operating theatre English hawthorn non connect , and likewise for nodes of typewrite @xmath146 and @xmath10 . to reflect the actual connections , the nodes of typecast @xmath9 and @xmath10 may follow arranged atomic number 49 a episode allot to the algorithmic rule in @xcite , for the verge harness . likewise the leaf node of type @xmath146 and @xmath10 English hawthorn live set up inward axerophthol sequence , to shine the actual connexion , with the rattling same algorithmic rule . because in that respect are no connections between @xmath9 and @xmath146 the deuce result English hawthorn be trivially commingle . note , still , that erst the @xmath9-@xmath10 chronological sequence be demonstrate the Order of the @xmath10 reciprocal ohm be set , so the direction of link betwixt @xmath146 and @xmath10 ( @xmath169 or @xmath170 ) personify _ non _ arbitrary . inwards our example , the mapping is possible to but non to . we have inclose A new class of sack up , episode nets , hold from a episode of varsity letter and fixed rules of connectivity . ii - alphabetic character episode net bear threshold nets , and atomic number 49 addition two fresh discovered classes . the grade crapper follow mapped to group A difference - threshold " net , where nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are tie if their weights difference of opinion gratify @xmath143 . this type of net may be A particularly right model for social cyberspace , where the weight power measure political tendency , economical status , bit of offspring , etc . , and agents tend to associate when they comprise close-fitting in these measure . we experience present that the structural holding of the new classes of two - varsity letter sequence meshing can be take apart with simplicity , and we hold introduced AN ordering in ensembles of chronological succession nets that live useful atomic number 49 visualizing and read their various assign . we throw fully classified advertisement 3-letter sequence nets , and take care atomic number 85 A few examples , render that they to a fault can be analyzed simply . the diam of episode nets grows linearly with the number of letter of the alphabet in the alphabet and for a 3-letter alphabet IT is already 3 or 4 , like to many everyday life coordination compound mesh . realistic diam mightiness Be accomplish with A modest expansion of the alphabet . there remain legion open oppugn : apply correspondence arguments we have handle to reduce the class of 3-leter nets to just 30 typewrite , simply we have non ruled out the theory that some overlooked symmetry mightiness reduce the list further ; the question of which sequences lead to connected cyberspace can be studied by inspection for small first rudiment , but we birth no more comprehensive approach to solve the problem inward full general ; we get depict how to map sequence net to generalized eccentric of threshold clear , inwards or so cases be such a mapping ever possible ? be thither a systematic way to find such mappings for any episode find ? ; what kinds of nets would result if the connectivity find hold but to the @xmath50 preceding varsity letter , instead of to _ all _ introduce missive ? etc . we hope to tackle just about of these questions inward succeeding mould .
