In both cases the angulate dependence be outlined past the firstly move of hadronization . the farther atomisation of the residuary quasmon is well-nigh isotropous . . , width=302 ] IT comprise point Hoosier State above that the energy spectrum of quark partons in angstrom unit quasmon rear end follow calculate AS @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the energy of the primary quark - parton In the revolve around of people system ( cms ) of the quasmon , @xmath53 is the mass of the quasmon , and @xmath52 , the number of quark - partons in the quasmon , throne be cypher from the equating @xmath188 hither @xmath56 be the temperature of the system . in the number one scenario of the @xmath138 interaction ( fig .
