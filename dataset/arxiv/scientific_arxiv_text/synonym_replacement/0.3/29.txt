In quantum entropy swear out , information is stored and treat with a quantum organization . A quantum scheme is incessantly in contact with its surround environment , which lead story to decoherence inwards the quantum system of rules . decoherence must live suppress for quantum information stored in qubits to be intact . thither ar various proposition to fight against decoherence . quantum error rectification , abriviated as qec hereafter , be ane of the to the highest degree promising candidate to suppress environmental disturbance , which principal to decoherence @xcite . away bestow extra ancillary qubits , in analogy with classical mistake chastening , IT follow possible to encode A data qubit to an @xmath4-qubit codeword in such a way of life that AN wrongdoing which act in the error quantum channel is identified by measure another set of ancillary qubits append for wrongdoing syndrome readout . then the correct codeword represent regain from a codeword suffering from a possible wrongdoing by applying a recovery mental process , whose expressed work is fix past the erroneous belief syndrome read-out . in contrast with the formal scheme outline in the old paragraph , at that place is A scheme inwards which neither syndrome read-out nor syndrome read-out ancilla qubits are required @xcite . in special , inwards @xcite , a oecumenical efficient connive be proposed . a information qubit is encoded with encryption ancilla qubits past the Saame encryption circuit A the formal unitary , after which A noisy channel be apply on the codeword . afterwards , the opposite of the encoding circuit make up applied on A codeword , which peradventure suffers from AN error . the resulting state live A tensor ware of the information qubit commonwealth with A possible erroneous belief and the ancilla qubit land . IT is possible to correct erroneous information qubit state by applying correction logic gate with the ancilla qubits as control qubits and the data qubit A antiophthalmic factor target qubit . this paper gift two instance of erroneous belief set codes light in the second category . the noisy quantum channel follow take for granted to personify fully correlated @xcite , which mean totally the qubits be the codeword make up content to the same error manipulator . In most physical realizations of a quantum computing device , the system size of it be typically on the order of a few micrometers OR less , while the environmental racket , such A electromagnetic wave , have A wavelength on the monastic order of amp few mm or centimeters . and so it is innate to usurp totally the qubits IN the register lose from the same error manipulator . to establish the advantage of the secondly category , we curtail ourselves within the dissonance operators @xmath7 in the following , where @xmath3 be the identification number of grammatical constituent qubits inward the codeword . we show that in that location exists AN @xmath4-qubit encoding which accommodates AN @xmath5-qubit data state if @xmath4 is unmated and an @xmath6-qubit date state if @xmath4 be even . although the channel is middling artificial as an wrongdoing channel , we English hawthorn apply our error correction connive IN the following situation . opine alice wants to get off qubits to bob . their qubit base differ by unitary trading operations @xmath8 surgery @xmath9 . even when they do non cognise which fundament the other company employs , the can aright send off qubits by supply unitary spear carrier qubits ( when @xmath4 is odd ) Beaver State two duplicate qubits ( when @xmath4 is even ) . we land the theorems and prove them IN the next plane section . the last surgical incision is pay to summary and treatment . In the abide by , @xmath10 refer the @xmath11th constituent of the Wolfgang Pauli intercellular substance and we take the base vectors @xmath12 and so that @xmath13 be diagonalise . we innovate operator @xmath14 and @xmath15 acting on the @xmath4-qubit space @xmath16 , where @xmath3 A mentioned before . let @xmath17 live @xmath18 complex ground substance , and have @xmath19 . refer away @xmath20 the ( joint ) rank-@xmath21 numerical range of @xmath22 , which be the collection of @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for just about @xmath18 rank-@xmath21 rectangular projection @xmath25 @xcite . a quantum channel of the mold @xmath26 take a @xmath21-dimensional quantum error right codification ( qecc ) if and solely if @xmath27 . to try out this statement , we need to recall the knill - laflamme correctability condition , which asserts that yield a quantum channel @xmath28 with computer error manipulator @xmath29 , @xmath30 be axerophthol qecc of @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the projection wheeler dealer with the range of mountains space @xmath30 @xcite . IT should live clear that @xmath34 if and lonesome if thither follow a qecc with dimension @xmath21 . instantly IT follow from @xmath35 and the relations @xmath36 when @xmath4 is even and @xmath37 when @xmath4 make up uneven that the channel ( [ eq : corrch ] ) has a @xmath21-dimensional qecc if and simply if @xmath38 by observe that @xmath39 irrespective of rank @xmath25 , we find @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 . [ thm1 ] suppose @xmath3 be odd . then @xmath42 . our proof follow constructive . for @xmath43 , denote @xmath44 . countenance @xmath45 and so @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the amount of @xmath48-combinations from @xmath4 element . since @xmath49 we have @xmath50 let @xmath25 be the impertinent projection onto @xmath30 . so the above reflexion show that @xmath51 and @xmath52 . therefore , @xmath53 , which register that @xmath54 and so @xmath30 be register to be A @xmath55-dimensional qecc . _ now let us turn to the even out @xmath4 case . we first land a lemma which be necessary to evidence the theorem . [ lem1 ] rent @xmath56 be A pattern matrix . and so the rank-@xmath21 numerical range of @xmath57 be the intersection of the bulging Isaac Hull of whatever @xmath58 eigenvalues of @xmath57 . the proof of the lemma is bump atomic number 49 @xcite . [ thm2 ] suppose @xmath3 is level . and so @xmath59 but @xmath60 . _ proof rent @xmath61 . past theorem [ thm1 ] , @xmath62 . consider @xmath63 take note that the projection @xmath25 onto @xmath64 fulfil @xmath65 and @xmath52 and thence @xmath66 , which prove @xmath59 . _ since @xmath67 follow axerophthol commuting family , @xmath8 and @xmath9 lavatory represent diagonalized simultaneously . we Crataegus oxycantha seize that @xmath68 since @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 net ball us demonstrate that @xmath71 . we first-class honours degree take down the identicalness @xmath72 for hermitian @xmath73 . let U supersede @xmath74 away @xmath75 and @xmath76 by @xmath77 to obtain @xmath78 . since @xmath75 and @xmath77 commute , @xmath79 is formula and lemma [ lem1 ] live applicable . from combining weight . ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we find @xmath79 have eigenvalue of a square matrix @xmath80 and for each one eigenvalue follow @xmath81-fold deteriorate . by take @xmath82 and @xmath83 in lemma [ lem1 ] , we uncovering the rank-@xmath55 mathematical range of a function of @xmath79 be the convergence of the bulging hulls of any @xmath84 eigenvalues . since each eigenvalue of a matrix has multiplicity @xmath81 , each convex Cordell Hull involves At to the lowest degree deuce-ace characteristic root of a square matrix . by scrutinise 4 eigenvalues plotted inwards the complex plane , we easy find the intersection point of totally the bulging Isaac Hull be a single spot @xmath85 , which leaven @xmath71 . similarly , we prove @xmath86 . from these equivalence we obtain @xmath87 say @xmath42 . let @xmath25 be amp rank-@xmath55 projection such that @xmath88 . let @xmath89\ ] ] where each @xmath90 has size @xmath91 . from @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we let foursome sovereign equations @xmath94 have @xmath95 be the singular form value disintegration of @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is type A nonnegative bias intercellular substance and @xmath98 . then the above equations are solve A @xmath99 past take in these result , we find the forcing out operator be decomposed type A @xmath100 \[\begin{array}{cc}d&d\\ d&d\end{array}\]\[\begin{array}{cc}u^\dagger&0\\ 0&v^\dagger\end{array}\]\,.\ ] ] since flagrant @xmath101 and @xmath102 , IT follow from @xmath103 that @xmath104 . let @xmath105 then both @xmath57 and @xmath106 be non - singular . on the former hand , the effrontery @xmath107 connote @xmath108 and thus @xmath109 , which be a contradiction in terms . thus , @xmath60 . in the conform to , we render AN explicit construction of qecc for @xmath31 Hoosier State eq . ( [ eq : corrch ] ) with uneven @xmath4 . the technique follow based on theorem [ thm1 ] and the final result in @xcite . let @xmath110 represent the @xmath111 matrix with columns in the set @xmath112 delineate the @xmath113 ground substance @xmath114 $ ] . in our qec , AN @xmath5-qubit state @xmath115 is encoded with unity ancilla qubit @xmath116 A @xmath117 . and so a noisy quantum channel @xmath31 is use on the encoded state and later the retrieval surgical process @xmath118 be applied thusly that the decoded state automatically appear IN the production with no syndrome measure . our qec represent in short sum As @xmath119 where @xmath120 . opt AN encryption amounts to set apart apiece of @xmath81 pillar vectors inward @xmath110 a basis transmitter of the completely hilbert space without repeating . therefore in that location are expectant degrees of freedom in the choice of encoding . IN the following examples , we make take encryption whose quantum circuit nates be implement with the to the lowest degree number of cnot Bill Gates . since our decryption circuit follow the inverse of the encoding circuit , IT be also implemented with the to the lowest degree figure of cnot gates . when @xmath121 , the unitary functioning @xmath122 force out represent take A @xmath123 when @xmath124 , @xmath122 lav represent chosen as @xmath125 material body [ nodd ] show quantum circle of the intercellular substance @xmath122 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .

( [ qecc ] ) that the recuperation circuit is the reverse of the encryption circuit . it seems , at first visual modality , that the effectuation given in fig . 1 negate with equivalent weight . ( [ qecc ] ) since the command non gate in the end of the retrieval circuit live missing in the encryption circuit . note , even so , that the top qubit personify set to @xmath138 ab initio and the verify non gate is safely omitted without affecting encryption . we construct A decoherence - free encryption when @xmath4 live even angstrom unit come after . the codeword in this case live resistant to the resound manipulator , which is AN analog of noiseless subspace / subsystem introduce inward @xcite . let @xmath139 and then apparently a vector @xmath140 be separately invariant under the action at law of @xmath141 and @xmath9 . on that point be @xmath142 orthogonal transmitter of such conformation , e.g. we hold four vectors , @xmath143 for @xmath144 . thus we happen a decoherence - free encryption for @xmath145 qubits by jut out onto this constant subspace spanned by these basis . it should be observe that the acoustic projection operator @xmath25 to the subspace @xmath146 sweep by the 4 transmitter in eq . ( [ nss ] ) fulfil range @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which register @xmath149 . IT is leisurely to generalise this result to case with arbitrary @xmath150 . figure [ neven ] ( A ) and ( B ) depict quantum circuit for ( a ) @xmath144 and ( b ) @xmath151 , severally .
