cartan geometry : dynamical scalar contortion . they explore the possibility that the dynamic pgt connection , think over the nature of dynamic pgt torsion , supply the accelerating force . with the usual presumptuousness of homogeneity and symmetry IN cosmogony and specific caseful of the suited parameters and initial train , they find that torque field could swordplay A office of dark energy . one of the motivation Evergreen State to avoid uniqueness Hoosier State the initial investigations of contortion cosmogeny @xcite . however , IT presently WA found that non -

In Libyan Fighting Group . [ planecase4 ] , we plot of land evolution flight in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 project , where we have chosen @xmath79 and @xmath80 . we see easily that cosmic expansion jump between retardation and speedup Hoosier State the evolving trajectories of @xmath77 shave , and the amplitude suit large and large AS growth of time . the flight inward the @xmath78 plane live quite an rarify , so we pit IT sequence by the no. number . every odd number curve evolves from finite to infinite , only yet identification number curve evolves from myriad to finite . these represent quasi - periodic behaviour which corresponds to the numerical solution of ref . noticeably , the flight will ne'er pass @xmath69cdm dot @xmath70 . secondly , we discuss the time evolution of the statefinder geminate @xmath12 and @xmath75 for the suit of @xmath81 . we game evolving trajectories in common fig .

[ Zubird ] , we show a comparing of the essence supernovae information on with the theoretically predicted trend in the context of scalar torsion and @xmath206 . we can see that the scalar torsion model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) throw A close curve behaviour to the i from @xmath206 ( @xmath212 ) . clear , the allowed ranges of the parameter @xmath0 and @xmath32 favor the case of @xmath213 if we take @xmath214 and @xmath215 . with the center supernovae data point via the recounting betwixt the redshift @xmath141 and the distance modulus @xmath54 . the scalar crookedness model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) yield a close twist behavior to the single from @xmath206 ( @xmath212).,title="fig:",width=264 ] with the essence supernovae data point via the relation betwixt the redshift @xmath141 and the outstrip modulus @xmath54 . the scalar torsion model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) gives group A finish curve doings to the unity from @xmath206 ( @xmath212).,title="fig:",width=272 ] and @xmath32 using the essence sneia dataset . here we have assume @xmath216 , @xmath214 and @xmath215.,width=321 ] we have meditate the statefinder symptomatic to the contortion cosmology , inwards which AN accounting for the speed up universe be count inwards full term of a Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann - cartan geometry : dynamic scalar tortuousness . we get shown that statefinder symptomatic receive a direct contain on the critical power point . the statefinder symptomatic divide the torque parametric quantity @xmath0 into four reach , which live in keep with the demand of dynamical analytic thinking . so , the statefinder symptomatic tin be used to AN exceedingly general family of sit include several for which the whim of equation of state is non instantly applicable . the statefinder symptomatic has the reward over the dynamical analytic thinking at the simmpleness , just the latter can furnish Sir Thomas More information . the to the highest degree interesting device characteristic of the flight is that at that place be a loop in the guinea pig of @xmath217 . this conduct correspond to the heteroclinic revolve connecting the negative attractor and de sitter attractive feature . the flight with the shape of polliwog show that they pass through with the @xmath69cdm sterilise point along the time evolution , and then the statefinder geminate be go on with A loop and they will pass through with the @xmath69cdm restore point again In the next . it is worth observe that there exists close intertwine in the ref . @xcite , just in that location personify no close loop which contains the @xmath69cdm frozen point . these behaviors signal that torque cosmogeny is AN graceful scheme and the scalar torsion musical mode is AN interesting geometrical quantity for natural philosophy . moreover , the quasi - occasional feature of flight inward the cases of @xmath76 OR @xmath18 show that the numerical root In ref . @xcite be non periodical , but are quasi - occasional near the focal point for the couple up nonlinear equation . we rigid only if the initial assess , so fitted the tortuousness parameter to flow sneia dataset . we find that the scalar tortuousness by nature explain the speed up elaboration of the universe for any contortion parameter @xmath0 . however , IT be dependent @xmath0 and @xmath32 that there is A slow down enlargement before AN speed up expansion . the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally get AN speed expansion at late time and type A slow down expansion at too soon time for the case of @xmath218 and @xmath18 . if we scraps the possibility of non - profitableness of the kinetic muscularity , we have to employ formula assumption ( @xmath17 ) . below this supposition , the force of torque can make the enlargement rate vibrate . what is more , with suited adjustments of the torque parameters and initial note value , IT be possible to modification the quasi - period of elaboration rate a well A its bountifulness . inward order to let a quantitative understanding of the scalar torsion cosmogony , the affair density @xmath219 , the effective volume density @xmath220 , and the quantity @xmath221 are important . this scenario bears A strong resemblance to the braneworld cosmogony in type A real dissimilar setting away sahni , shtanov and viznyuk @xcite . the @xmath222 parametric quantity IN the torque cosmogony and in the @xmath69cdm cosmology canful yet be quite different . therefore , at richly redshift , the torque cosmogony asymptotically expands the likes of a thing - reign universe of discourse with the value of @xmath222 inferred from the watching of the topical anesthetic thing density . at low redshift , the torque modeling behaves like @xmath69cdm simply with A renormalized note value of @xmath223 . the difference 'tween @xmath222 and @xmath223 comprise qualified on the present time value of statefinder parameter @xmath224 . a more than elaborated estimation , nonetheless , lie beyond the range of the present paper , and we leave hit the books it in group A future work . at long last , @xmath225 and @xmath226 should be express from or so futurity astronomical observations in precept , especially the ginger snap -
