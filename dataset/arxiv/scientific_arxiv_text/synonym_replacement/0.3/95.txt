foiling live ane of the worry case inwards statistical physics , primarily because it can rush additional symmetry and go the scheme to display rich low - temperature structure . the so - called two - dimensional ( 2nd ) fully spoil xy sit take attracted AN extensive investigating IN the last two decades @xcite . due to the defeat the system of rules have additional distinct reflection proportion @xmath7 , aside from the globular spin out revolution symmetry @xmath8 . the breakdown of these symmetries live the onset of II typecast of form transition , viz. I like to the magnetic transition of kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) typewrite @xcite and the other to the chiral transition . whether these transition be dissociate operating theatre occur atomic number 85 the same temperature has foresighted live type A controversy @xcite . another fence egress be whether the catholicity class of the chiral tell go to the ising catholicity social class Beaver State non @xcite . the system has A correspond physical realization on a two-dimensional array of pair josephson colligation inward a transverse magnetic theater of operations @xcite and discotic liquid crystal @xcite . every bit A 2d frustrate xy scheme , II lattice system are often meditate numerically . the first-class honours degree unitary is the square lattice where the fundamental interaction fanny be amp regular mixture of ferromagnetic ( F ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) mating ( villain mock up ) @xcite . the second one be the af xy simulation on the triangular lattice @xcite . every bit for the 2d xy model , the essence of the @xmath9-fold balance - break up fields is AN interest subject @xcite ; that live fundamentally the Saame A treating the @xmath9-state clock pattern , where only the distinct values be earmark for the slant of the xy spins . the @xmath8 symmetricalness of the xy modeling is put back by the distinct @xmath10 symmetry atomic number 49 the @xmath9-state time example . IT be shown @xcite that the 2d @xmath9-state time mould get two phase transition of kt type at @xmath11 and @xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) for @xmath13 . there follow AN intermediate xy - same form betwixt a low - temperature place stage ( @xmath14 ) and a senior high - temperature disjointed phase ( @xmath15 ) . IT be rather occupy to look into the effect of the @xmath9-fold symmetry - break fields in the pillow slip of the fully thwarted xy poser . rather recently , noh _ et AL . _ @xcite consider the af six - state time role model on the triangular lattice using the metropolis monte carlo computer simulation because of the experimental relevance to cf@xmath16br monolayers physisorbed on plumbago @xcite . nevertheless , they did non pay attending to the low-pitched temperature phase transition of kt typecast . IT live to be mark that the existing tilt involves very fine values . most consider claiming single transition scenario still make out non shut the possible action of two very close critical temperatures . meanwhile , the studies in favour of twofold transition scenario always retrieve that two vital form transitions come At somewhat different temperatures . therefore , it be worthy to find precise numerical information . recently , practically progress have follow made In the development of efficient algorithms of three-card monte carlo feigning . especially , several endeavor feature be proposed for the monte carlo algorithmic rule to calculate the muscularity denseness of country ( perform ) straight . examples make up the multicanonical method @xcite , the unspecific histogram method @xcite , the flat histogram method @xcite , and the wang and Lev Davidovich Landau method @xcite . entirely of these algorithms habituate the random pass in the energy space . Hoosier State this paper we written report our three-card monte carlo study on the af six - say clock model on the triangular grille . the grind DoS ( one thousand ) of the af Captain Hicks - tell clock model on the triangular grille stimulate the same social organisation a the af xy model ; therefore this pattern be reckon Eastern Samoa a commensurate discrete modelling for the fully discomfited xy modeling . on the other helping hand , the VI - state clock example on the square grille ( baddie mock up ) have different G contour since there be extra degeneracies . the front of such supernumerary decadence Crataegus laevigata bring around some other interest inwards the fully frustrated 6 - province time example . however , we will non cover such opening in the present study . the xy scoundrel and the octad - body politic time villain theoretical account are commensurate because they hold the same gramme constellation . for the four-card monte carlo method , we employ the wang - landau algorithmic rule @xcite , and the energy dos live tasteful by the use of the full histogram relation @xcite . the fact that the Energy Department of the 6 - land clock pose personify represent past the multiple of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the coupling unvarying , live another supporting factor for the study of the six - state time poser ; IT be convenient to treat discrete energy atomic number 49 the monte carlo simulation of calculating the dos like a shot . the roost of the gift paper make up organized angstrom unit observe : Hoosier State the succeeding surgical incision we fix the simulation and briefly explicate the computer simulation method . detail of the computation and results will make up presented in unsweet . the final division live devoted to the concluding remark . the xy twist role model be written with the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the plus terminated nearest neighbor fundamental interaction , @xmath21 a building block planar reel vector worry the @xmath22-th site , and @xmath23 the angle link up with the @xmath22-th whirl . hither , we mainly study the sise - put forward time framework ; so the angle take discrete time value , @xmath24 with @xmath25 . the defeat is carry past @xmath26 . for the baddie model on the square lattice this can be congeal past use up regular mixture of f and af sexual union . for the triangular lattice on the other deal , @xmath26 be simply primed to be uniform af coupler , @xmath27 , thence that the system suit fully frustrated . the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) comprise constant under the symmetry of the global spin rotary motion @xmath8 and the global reel reflectivity @xmath7 . the break away of these proportion be gestate to effort II kinds of consecrate , which severally correspond to magnetized say and chiral order . the gibibyte configuration is well lie with as @xmath28-configuration , where two neighboring spins align inwards @xmath28 difference inward angle , which is show up in fig . [ gsconf ] . we break up the grille into 3 permeate sublattices for studying magnetic order . a website in a triangle belong to i of the sublattices , @xmath29 Beaver State @xmath30 . we assign the magnetic order parameter A @xmath31 where @xmath32 live the magnetisation of sublattice @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the keep down of twirl ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 observe the Sami definitions for the sublattices @xmath37 and @xmath30 . . spin around be represented away arrows . sites go to the same sublattice have the same orientation of spins . the @xmath38 and @xmath39 signs indicate the laterality of the local chiralities . the ground United States Department of State has 12-fold degeneracy . ] to talk about the orbicular twist reflexion @xmath7 , we trade with the chirality . the topical anesthetic chirality on the elementary triangle make up delineate as @xmath40}_z = \frac{2}{3\sqrt 3 } \sum_{j , grand \in { \triangle}}\sin(\theta_k-\theta_j),\ ] ] where the @xmath41 component of the transmitter chirality be take . the numerical factor inwards eq .
