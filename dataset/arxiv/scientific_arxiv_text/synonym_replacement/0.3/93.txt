trust to atomic number 4 the main origin of the jet quenching phenomena observed @xcite in nucleus nucleus hit at rhic push @xmath2@xmath3 , parton Energy going via gluon - radiation syndrome is require to look on the properties ( gluon density and volume ) of the ` spiritualist ' organize in the hit and on the belongings ( color flush and mess ) of the ` examine ' parton @xcite . hard gluons would lose to a greater extent vigor than concentrated quarks due to the strong color couple up with the mass medium . in addition , influence and beauty quark ar qualitatively dissimilar probes with honour to lite partons , since their energy loss is wait to be melt off , axerophthol a effect of type A mass - dependent restriction in the phase - blank space into which gluon radiation canful occur @xcite . we study quenching effects for ponderous quark by add on perturbative QCD computation of the baseline @xmath4 distributions with inward - medium vim loss , included via the bdmps quenching weights . the quell weights , computed for light quarks and gluons in @xcite and for laborious quarks in @xcite , bet on the channel coefficient @xmath5 , a measure of the mass medium density , and on the in - medium path length . these inputs follow pass judgment on A parton - by - parton level , victimization A glauber - model based verbal description of the topical anaesthetic @xmath5 profile in the thwartwise direction @xcite . the @xmath5 prize is elect inward order to reproduce the light - flavor particles nuclear limiting broker @xmath6 measured in central hit at @xmath7 ( fig .

[ cols="<,^ " , ] heavy - quark vigor release be currently meditate atomic number 85 rhic using measurements of the atomic modification factor @xmath10 of ` non - photonic ' ( @xmath11-conversion- and @xmath12-dalitz - take off ) undivided negatron . the most recent data point away phenix @xcite and star @xcite , strain come out to 5 and ix gev , respectively , be evince in fig . [ fig : rhic ] ( flop ) . since this make up an inclusive measuring , with influence decays eclipse at low-toned @xmath4 and knockout decays dominating at high @xmath4 , the comparing with peck - dependent push loss predictions should bank on amp strong and data - corroborate pp baseline . such baseline is still missing atomic number 85 the present moment , A we explain inward the follow . the state - of - the - nontextual matter perturbative predictions ( fonll ) , that we use Eastern Samoa a baseline , indicate that , Hoosier State pp collisions , tempt decays dominate the electron @xmath4 spectrum up to around 5 gev @xcite . however , there be amp magnanimous perturbative uncertainty on position in @xmath4 of the @xmath13-decay/@xmath14-decay crossing point : depending on the choice of the factorization and renormalization scale leaf this position force out vary from 3 to 9 gev @xcite . in improver , the computing lean to underpredict the non - photonic negatron spectrum deliberate in pp hit @xcite . for our negatron @xmath10 result ( fig .
