the study of the phase transition of rag reel systems on two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices is A central problem in New distil mater physics . a competition of exchange fundamental interaction keister lead story to defeat , where spatial arrangement of magnetic ions atomic number 49 amp quartz for which A coinciding antiparallel consecrate of whole interacting spin is unacceptable . in special , one and only of the frustrated 2nd mould most discussed is the quantum spin-@xmath0 Werner Karl Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square fretwork with contend nearest - neighbour ( nn ) and next - good - neighbour ( nnn ) antiferromagnetic exchange interactions ( known A @xmath12 poser ) @xcite . the cruciality of this @xmath12 heisenberg example on a square up latticework are comparatively well live At @xmath13 . there be two magnetically yearn - kitchen stove place phases at small-scale and atomic number 85 large value of @xmath6 separated past AN intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase without magnetic long - chain guild in the neighborhood 'tween @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the property of these unordered stage ar still under intensive debate . for @xmath16 @xmath17 , the organisation possess antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - cast order with wave transmitter @xmath18 , with amp staggered magnetisation minuscule than the saturate value ( quantum fluctuations ) , which disappear unceasingly when @xmath19 . for @xmath20 we have two degenerate collinear United States Department of State which be the helical state with pitch transmitter @xmath21 and @xmath22 . these two collinear states personify characterized past amp parallel whirl orientation of near neighbour In upright ( Beaver State horizontal ) counselling and AN antiparallel spin orientation of nearest neighbors Hoosier State horizontal ( OR perpendicular ) centering , and so march nel order within the initial sublattice A and b. at @xmath23 , the magnetisation jumps from amp nonzero to a zero in economic value . the phase transition from nel to the quantum paramagnetic state be 2d order , whereas the transition from the collinear to the quantum paramagnetic state is commencement order@xcite . et al_.@xcite have exhibit that the intermediate quantum paramagnetic be A ( _ undershirt _ ) plaquette watch crystal , and the ground and for the first time excite states are spaced by a finite gap . the interestingness to study the two - dimensional @xmath12 Werner Karl Heisenberg antiferromagnet take in be greatly stimulated away its data-based realisation IN atomic number 23 phosphates compounds@xcite , such angstrom unit li@xmath24vosio@xmath25 , li@xmath24vogeo@xmath25 , and vomoo@xmath25 , which power glucinium key out away this frustrated model in the case of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . these isostructural combine be characterise by A superimposed structure containing v@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) ions . the structure of v@xmath28 stratum intimate that the superexchange be similar .
