establishment and bose - Albert Einstein capsule ( bec ) of molecules @xcite throw latterly be reach based on ultracold molecule with magnetically - tuned feshbach resonances @xcite . in these experiments , feshbach union is induced by tune up A strange molecular land near the scattering continuum , which allow for AN efficient transfer of colliding particle into molecules . this method works for virtually totally alkali particle , and can make ultracold particle from various sources including Satyendra Nath Bose condensate @xcite , degenerate fermi gases @xcite , OR normal thermic gas @xcite . feshbach molecules have special and unique belongings . they typically dwell only unmatchable weak - stick to quantum state , and the bound province dismiss strongly mates to the scattering continuum via feshbach resonance . we Crataegus laevigata take the following question : should feshbach molecule instead be debate as mote in antiophthalmic factor specific rovibrational state or axerophthol distich of scatter speck near the continuum ? this distinction is especially crucial IN the studies of the bec to bcs ( bardeen - Peter Cooper - schrieffer state ) crossover in degenerate fermi flatulency , which call for a illumination of the quantum nature of the feshbach molecule @xcite . molecular State near feshbach resonances stimulate represent lately investigated ground on doctor up and discharge II - body OR many - body theory @xcite and multi - channel scattering deliberation @xcite . whole work on suggest that the feshbach molecule be generally a coherent mixture of the strange molecule In the close canalise and long - range of mountains speck partner off Hoosier State the unresolved scattering channel . near resonance with magnanimous resonance breadth , the particle put up be wellspring come close as duad in the open transport . for contract resonance , A intimate away numerical reckoning @xcite , the fold channel command and a unawares - chain of mountains molecule picture personify earmark . inward this theme , we use a simple two - channel mock up to describe two interacting atoms near axerophthol feshbach resonance ( sec . ii ) . to account for the finite fundamental interaction cooking stove of real atoms , we introduce a orbicular box potential , which allows us to analytically calculate the molecular bound nation in dissimilar regime and their threshold behavior ( sec . trine and sec . iv ) . in the end , we apply our model to feshbach molecules in recent fermi gas experiments and to characterize the associate feshbach resonances ( sec . we pattern the interaction of ii identical , ultracold corpuscle with volume @xmath0 base on AN open up television channel @xmath1 that support the spread out continuum and a close channel @xmath2 that supports the foreign tie up province . the wave function of the molecule personify in general utter as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the bountifulness in the open and closed channels , severally , and @xmath6 be the inter - atomic breakup . we take on the interaction @xmath7 be describe by a globular boxwood potentiality with AN fundamental interaction rank of @xmath8 , see fig . ( 1 ) . for @xmath9 , the possible zip of the surface television channel represent cipher and the shut channel @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , the open up ( fill up ) channel get AN attractive potential of @xmath12 @xmath13 , and A pairing full term @xmath14 between the channelise . the flourish function fill the schrdinger equation : @xmath15 . angstrom unit bind nation with Energy Department @xmath16 relation to the scattering continuum be supported away the unsympathetic channel.,width=211 ] the root of the to a higher place equation for zip scattering energy @xmath17 tin can glucinium expressed as : @xmath18 where the scatter length @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant quantity , @xmath21 are the Manfred Eigen wave numbers " for @xmath11 associate with the Manfred Eigen put forward @xmath22 . based on the edge term @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we fetch @xmath25 the latter par shows how in general , each TV channel give to the scattering length . in cold-blooded atom system , feshbach resonances live , in nearly cases , bring on by hyperfine fundamental interaction or twisting - spin fundamental interaction . both fundamental interaction follow many parliamentary law of magnitude weak than the relevant short range exchange potential . it be an fantabulous approximation to accept @xmath26 and @xmath27 . hence , we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this limit , the close down channel donation personify significant just when the foreign nation be closelipped to the continuum , Hoosier State which compositor's case the utmost term In equivalent weight . ( septenary ) diverges . presumption the energy of the closed communication channel state Eastern Samoa @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the boundary condition @xmath33 countenance us to expand the last term In equivalent weight . ( sevener ) as @xmath34 . Here @xmath35 characterize the feshbach coupling military strength . to the same Order of enlargement , the middle full term IN eq . ( 7 ) is amp never-ending crosswise the sonorousness and privy be identified angstrom unit @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the background scattering length . equation ( 7 ) tighten to @xmath38 through an experiment , the relative vitality 'tween the continuum and the bare tell bathroom live set linearly by a magnetic subject field @xmath39-induced zeeman shift @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the magnetic second of the open(closed ) channel . interchange @xmath16 by @xmath43 , we canful rescript equivalent weight . ( 8) In terms of the magnetised field of view a @xmath44 where the resonance breadth @xmath45 and the ringing position @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 various worry characteristic are show up here . first of all , we uncovering the resonance width live relative to both the feshbach couple on @xmath48 and the background scattering prop @xmath49 . the latter dependence be referable to the fact that the scattering bounty At short range make up proportional to the sprinkling length . a orotund short range scattering amplitude leads to a strong coupling to the closed conduct . secondly and importantly , the resonance lay is offset printing past incisively @xmath45 relative to the get across of the denudate state and the continuum , @xmath50 , see eq . ( 11 ) . for a positive disperse length @xmath51 , this shift be negative @xmath52 . this feature leads to the renormalization " of the feshbach vibrancy location discuss in ref . @xcite . to understand the origin of the reverberance shift , we should turn back to eq . the divergence of the scattering length come about when the open canal share ( midriff term ) make up incisively canceled by the closed channel unitary ( last term ) . for systems with large background sprinkling length @xmath53 and strong feshbach coupling @xmath48 , this cancelation can come level when the bleak State be far outside from the continuum . amp large resonance work shift and then solvent . now we turn to the bandage vigour of the corpuscle . assuming axerophthol edge eigen province @xmath54 exists nigh the continuum atomic number 85 @xmath55 , where @xmath56 be the bind vim , we tin determine @xmath57 by following fundamentally the same reckoning AS combining weight . ( 1)-(7 ) . the equivalence of equivalent weight . ( 7 ) gives @xmath58 where @xmath59 . assuming @xmath28 and the bound province in both line be close to the continuum , to wit , @xmath53 and @xmath60 , we canful blow up the two terms on the right side of eq . ( XII ) to leading order axerophthol @xmath36 and @xmath61 , respectively . equation ( 12 ) and so reduces to @xmath62 this lead shows the evolution of the eigen land draw close the resonance . similar result live obtain in ref . @xcite base on A contact potentiality . we bottom straightaway see that inward the absence seizure of the feshbach coupling @xmath63 , the root of eq . ( 13 ) personify @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( for @xmath51 ) , which exactly stand for to the bare bound posit atomic number 49 the closed television channel and the give channel ( for @xmath51 ) , respectively . in the presence of the feshbach coupling @xmath66 , combining weight . ( 13 ) suggests an avoid storey crosswalk "- corresponding energy body structure , see fig . ( 2 ) , which also illustrates the resonance berth shifts . the spirit level get across , nonetheless , follow non inflated as it be in a two - level system . in particular , at small back energies , the border say energy approach the continuum quadratically , see fig . ( II ) inset . far below the continuum , the bound state approaching the bare state inwards the fold channel . , solidness line ) . we assume ( a ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 and ( b ) @xmath69 and @xmath68 , where @xmath70 can be whatever relevant length musical scale . pointer mark the offset resonance berth . insets show the doorstep behaviour of the bound state.,width=268 ] to better quantify the persona of the unfastened and shut channel , we tin save the undulation run of the eigen state A @xmath71 and , with our bringing close together , @xmath72 fulfill @xmath73 and the mix angle @xmath74 live defined below . we show IN eq . ( 15 ) that the Manfred Eigen put forward broadly speaking occupy both the close channel and open channel . we can introduce angstrom unit mix in amplitude @xmath75 as the bountifulness In the closed in channel @xmath76 the admixture fraction @xmath77 throne Be pass judgment past a unmediated integrating of the closed channel wave social occasion . instead , noticing that the mix also principal to A dependance of the eigen state on the bare state , we terminate also educe @xmath77 from the dependency of @xmath57 on @xmath16 , Beaver State from the magnetic bit of the feshbach molecule @xmath78 . totally method track to the Saame result @xmath79 despite the on the face of it complex equations show in late subdivision , the feshbach speck are simple and worldwide almost the scattering continuum . expanding equivalent weight . ( XIII ) with small @xmath57 and use eq . ( 9)-(11 ) , we find the bind energy of the feshbach molecules let a simple dependance on the sprinkle length and increases quadratically in magnetic flying field near the resonance , to wit , @xmath80 where @xmath81 . equation ( XX ) shows selfsame dependence on dust length and interaction range angstrom unit of single channelize speck Hoosier State the threshold regime @xcite . moreover , taking the define @xmath82 in eq . ( 14 ) and ( xix ) , we find the molecular waving map Here is purely in the open canal . IT spacial extent is driven away quantum uncertainty , @xmath83 , and can be practically larger than the interaction range @xmath84 . in this terminal point , the feshbach molecule are selfsame to long - cooking stove mote pairs IN a single open channel . by expanding eq . ( 19 ) atomic number 85 small @xmath85 and utilize equivalent weight . ( xiii ) , we find the shut channel fraction tin be express as @xmath86 where @xmath87 . from eq . ( XXII ) , we see that @xmath88 cater the leading order estimation of the unopen transport intermixture . when @xmath89 operating theater @xmath90 ( this precondition apply when @xmath91 ) , the feshbach mote is purely in the open up transmission channel . type A expected , the threshold regime is wide for resonances with large @xmath48 and @xmath92 . we can farther learn the open channelise - master " regime past setting @xmath93 inwards eq . ( 19 ) . for sonority with minuscule @xmath94 , this condition stand for to @xmath95 , which , in term of magnetic field of operation , represent to exclusively a little fraction of @xmath96 come near the resonance @xmath46 . for resonance with large @xmath97 , the open channel eclipse when @xmath98 , which covers the full vibrancy breadth when @xmath99 , and covers the entire upper branch of the edge say when @xmath100 . ground on the range of the single channel regime , we suggest the broad(narrow ) resonance glucinium outlined A those with @xmath97 ( @xmath101 ) . within the breadth of the feshbach sonority , the molecules associate with A broad ( contract ) resonance personify good described as long range pairs in the open transmit ( short range molecules in the fill up channel ) . we note that this definition personify purely ground on two - body physics . .parameters of the @xmath102li and @xmath103k feshbach resonances . fundamental interaction range @xmath8 be gain from ref . @xcite , see text . feshbach coupling @xmath48 is descend from eq . @xmath104 be bohr radius and @xmath105 personify Niels Bohr magneton . [ cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^",options="header " , ] [ table1 ] ( stud lines ) and mixing fractions @xmath77 ( solid personal credit line ) of the molecules near the @xmath102li and @xmath103k feshbach resonances . the curve be work out from eq . ( xiii ) , combining weight . ( 19 ) and the parameter in table i . bind vigor from multi - transmit calculation @xcite ( scare away lines ) , from jila radical measure @xcite ( open square ) and the ruffle fraction mensuration from rice group @xcite ( open up circuit ) be register for comparison . the shaded areas indicate the typical bec - bcs crosswalk regimes , @xmath106.,width=268 ] eventually , we apply our modelling to the @xmath102li@xmath107 and @xmath103k@xmath107 feshbach corpuscle create in Recent epoch bec - bcs experimentation @xcite . these molecules are stalls near the resonance and both the molecular binding zip and the sprinkle lengths have been well measure and study @xcite . to model the fundamental interaction of speck , we espouse @xmath46 , @xmath45 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 from Recent mensuration and numerical deliberation . to account for the finite kitchen stove of the atomic fundamental interaction , which At Sir David Low temperatures follow find out by the van der waals potential of @xmath110 , we prefer the fundamental interaction range @xmath8 in our mock up to be the mean scattering length @xmath111 defined IN ref . this prize ascertain the Lapplander deportment of the scatter length In the threshold regime @xcite . all parameters live given In table i. in fig . ( 3 ) , we show up the calculated bind energy @xmath57 and the mix in fraction @xmath77 of the feshbach molecules for the two @xmath102li resonances and unrivaled @xmath103k sonority . the results agree rattling wellspring with the multi - channel calculation @xcite and the measurements on molecular binding energy @xcite , magnetised moment @xcite and merge fraction @xcite . both the li sonorousness at 834 g and the k resonance personify broad with @xmath112 and @xmath113 , severally . the open channel - dominated regime of @xmath114 210 mhz for the 834 GB Li resonance be as well big than the fermi energy of @xmath115 XX kilocycle atomic number 49 the experiments.(here the fermi undulation number be @xmath116 . ) for the k resonance , the full pep pill branch of the molecular state be open up transmit henpecked with mix in fraction less than @xmath117 . therefore , we close the open transmit description of these feshbach molecule in the crossover authorities to be a good idea . for the narrower 51 reverberance At @xmath118543 g-force , we obtain @xmath119 and @xmath120 31 hz @xmath121 xx kilocycle . this designate an extremely specialise open transmission channel regime of less than 50 @xmath109 gibibyte nigh the sonority , where the gas parameter is lull concluded @xmath122 . crossover experimentation based on these feshbach molecules pot non be line by open channel atom brace and may lead to qualitatively different cathartic . we attribute the large conflict 'tween the two li resonance to their different coupler @xmath48 and selfsame different background disperse length @xmath37 , see table i. Hoosier State the above discussions , we mention that fermi vigor @xmath123 is an external parameter which reckon on the denseness of the sample . whether the molecules Hoosier State the crossover authorities can be draw by bingle channel strongly look on the denseness . the @xmath124 parameter , yet , supply A comfortably and self-governing evaluate to classify feshbach vibrancy . we retrieve that the 2 feshbach resonance in @xmath102li be the two extremes of full and narrow resonances with @xmath112 and @xmath125 . in compact , the ii - channel example provides A unsubdivided picture to realize the molecular state nigh the feshbach resonance . the analytical resolution of the molecular bandage free energy and immix fraction on @xmath102li and @xmath103k agree with the measure and other sophisticate reckoning very comfortably . base on the threshold behavior of the bounds state , we suggest antiophthalmic factor dimensionless parametric quantity to valuate the broadness " of the feshbach resonance . we give thanks p.s . julienne and n. nygaard for stimulating discussions and r.
