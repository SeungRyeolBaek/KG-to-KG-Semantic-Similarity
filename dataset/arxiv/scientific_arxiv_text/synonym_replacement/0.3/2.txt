the leptonic decay of a charge pseudoscalar meson @xmath7 are treat of the type @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , OR @xmath11 . because no more strong fundamental interaction follow submit in the leptonic final state @xmath12 , such decays provide a clean mode to probe the composite , warm fundamental interaction that bind the quark and antiquark within the initial - nation meson . in these disintegration , strong interaction effectuate can live parametrized by a single quantity , @xmath13 , the pseudoscalar meson decay unvarying . the leptonic decline rate can be metrical past try out , and the decay never-ending put up be determine past the equation ( disregard radiative corrections ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 be the Enrico Fermi mate perpetual , @xmath16 be the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) ground substance @xcite element , @xmath17 is the mass of the mesotron , and @xmath18 personify the mass of the accuse lepton . the quantity @xmath13 key the amplitude for the @xmath19 and @xmath20-quarks within the @xmath21 to have 0 separation , a consideration essential for them to annihilate into the practical @xmath22 boson that produces the @xmath12 brace . the data-based conclusion of decline constants is one of the most important tests of computing involve nonperturbative QCD . such calculations give been do utilise various example @xcite surgery using grille QCD ( lqcd ) . the latter be now in general look at to be the to the highest degree true way to calculate the quantity . noesis of decline constant quantity follow of import for account various key process , such A @xmath23 amalgamate , which look on @xmath24 , axerophthol quantity that is also foreshadow past lqcd calculations . experimental conclusion @xcite of @xmath24 with the leptonic decomposition of amp @xmath25 mesotron follow , all the same , very modified A the value be extremely strangled due to the smallness of the magnitude of the relevant ckm intercellular substance element @xmath26 . the charm mesons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are intimately instruments to hit the books the leptonic radioactive decay of leaden mesotron since these decomposition be either less ckm suppressed surgery favour , _ id est _ , @xmath29 and @xmath30 be a good deal larger than @xmath31 . thusly , the decline constant quantity @xmath32 and @xmath33 determined from influence mesotron disintegration tail end be used to test and corroborate the necessary lqcd calculations applicable to the @xmath34-meson sector . among the leptonic disintegration IN the influence - quark sphere , @xmath35 crumble are more than approachable since they ar ckm favored . furthermore , the turgid mass of the @xmath11 lepton polish off the helicity curtailment that be present inwards the decomposition to lighter leptons . the existence of multiple neutrinos inward the final state , even so , get mensuration of this decay challenging . natural philosophy beyond the standard posture ( Sm ) power also move leptonic decompose of charmed mesons . depending on the non - sm feature , the ratio of @xmath36 could be stirred @xcite , Eastern Samoa could the ratio @xcite @xmath37 . whatever of the individual breadth mightiness be increased operating theatre reduced . there be an meter reading of A disagreement 'tween the observational determination @xcite of @xmath33 and the to the highest degree Recent epoch precision lqcd computation @xcite . this variance live particularly enigmatical since the cleo - C determination @xcite of @xmath32 agrees wellspring with the lqcd computation @xcite of that amount . some @xcite conjecture that this discrepancy English hawthorn be explain away a level higgs boson or a leptoquark . Hoosier State this article , we report AN meliorate measure of the sheer branch fraction of the leptonic crumble @xmath0 ( billing - conjugated modes be mean ) , with @xmath1 , from which we determine the decomposition constant @xmath33 . we use A information sample of @xmath38 case bring home the bacon by the Ezra Cornell electron storage band ( cesr ) and gathered by the cleo -

A shown In sec . [ sec : resolution ] , this result live paltry in our chosen strip tag modes . the @xmath92 decline make up reconstruct by combining oppositely charge cut across that originate from A vernacular peak and that experience an unvarying mass within @xmath93 mev of the nominal mass @xcite . we need the resonance crumble to satisfy the following mass windows around the titular raft @xcite : @xmath94 ( @xmath95 mev ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 mev ) . we require the momenta of charged mote to be @xmath56 mev or not bad to inhibit the easy pi-meson desktop from @xmath98 decompose ( through and through @xmath99 ) . we place a st away victimization the invariant volume of the ticket @xmath100 and rebound pot against the tag @xmath101 . the recoil volume follow defined A @xmath102 where @xmath103 be the net four - impulse of the @xmath4 beam , have the finite beam crossing angle into account ; @xmath104 follow the quaternion - impulse of the track , with @xmath105 reckon from @xmath106 and the nominal hoi polloi @xcite of the @xmath91 meson . we require the recoil mass to be within @xmath107 mev of the @xmath108 mass @xcite . this loose window allow both primary and subaltern @xmath91 chase after to be take . to estimation the backgrounds inwards our st and dt yields from the wrong tag combining ( incorrect compounding that , past chance , prevarication within the @xmath109 signaling part ) , we use the tag constant mass sidebands . we limit the signalize neighborhood every bit @xmath110 mev @xmath111 mev , and the sideband realm angstrom unit @xmath112 mev @xmath113 mev surgery @xmath114 mev @xmath115 mev , where @xmath116 be the difference between the tag end mass and the titular mass . we fit the st @xmath109 statistical distribution to the sum of double - gaussian signalise function plus 2nd - degree chebyshev polynomial background run to get the tag aggregative sideband grading factor . the constant mass statistical distribution of tag candidates for from each one tag musical mode follow bear witness in common fig .

[ cols="<,>,>,>,>",options="header " , ] we consider six semileptonic decays , @xmath121 @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , as the John R. Major germ of screen background In the @xmath128 point region . the second master the nonpeaking background , and the 4th ( with @xmath129 ) eclipse the peak background . dubiousness in the signal yield due to nonpeaking background ( @xmath130 ) personify appraise by varying the semileptonic dilapidate ramify fractions by the precision with which they be fuck @xcite . imperfect knowledge of @xmath131 pay move up to a systematic dubiousness inward our estimation of the add up of peaking background IN the signal part , which feature an effect on our fork fraction measure of @xmath132 . we consider differences IN efficiency , information vs Mc events , due to the spear carrier energy requirement , special caterpillar track disallow , and @xmath133 necessary , past using sample from data point and MHz event , inward which _ both _ the @xmath134 and @xmath2 satisfy our tag requisite , ie , `` double - ticket '' upshot . we and then apply each of the supra - cite demand and liken loss in efficiency of data quintuplet mc case . Hoosier State this way we hold angstrom unit chastening of @xmath135 for the extra energy requirement and taxonomical uncertainness on to each one of the three requirements of @xmath136 ( all match , away chance ) . the non-@xmath69 background knowledge In the sign @xmath69 candidate sampling make up paltry ( @xmath137 ) due to the first chance ( @xmath138 per track ) that hadrons ( @xmath139 OR @xmath140 ) are misidentified as @xmath69 @xcite . incertitude in these backgrounds produces A @xmath141 uncertainty in the mensuration of @xmath142 . the secondary @xmath69 screen background from charge symmetric processes , such angstrom unit @xmath143 dalitz decay ( @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 conversion ( @xmath146 ) , are evaluate past measure the wrong - sign signal negatron Hoosier State case with @xmath147 . the incertitude inwards the measurement from this rootage is estimate to be @xmath148 . former possible source of systematic uncertainness include @xmath68 ( @xmath137 ) , label predetermine ( @xmath149 ) , tracking efficiency ( @xmath148 ) , @xmath59 identification efficiency ( @xmath150 ) , and fsr ( @xmath150 ) . combine entirely contributions Hoosier State quadrature , the total taxonomical uncertainty in the furcate fraction measuring represent estimated to live @xmath151 . in sum-up , using the sample of @xmath152 labelled @xmath28 disintegration with the cleo - c sensing element we obtain the infrangible branch fraction of the leptonic dilapidate @xmath153 through @xmath154 @xmath155 where the world-class uncertainty be statistical and the secondly follow taxonomical . this result replace our previous mensuration @xcite of the same branching fraction , which used a subsample of information used Hoosier State this work . the decompose perpetual @xmath33 send away make up computed habituate combining weight .
