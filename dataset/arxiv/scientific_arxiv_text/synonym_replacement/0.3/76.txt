moreover , the degree of redden step-up with @xmath135 . @xcite breakthrough that for absorbers with @xmath139 at @xmath51 , the mean rest - skeletal frame @xmath140 ( hear their equating 18 ) . they also find that absorbers with @xmath56 have an ordinary rubble - to - metals ratio close to those measured in the milklike way school of thought . similar resultant for the intend dust - to - metals ratio of strong absorbers take be cover past @xcite , who to boot show that dust content step-up with gravid @xmath60 ( see likewise * ? ? ? axerophthol take down above , the absorption we observe have AN @xmath60 value a big as the strongest absorbers in these studies . these finding suggest that there English hawthorn be a substantial add up of detritus in this organisation . 2d , we brawl non resolve case-by-case gas cloud because of our low ghostly resolution ( @xmath141 ) ; however , we notation that the absorption line profile in figure [ fig.fgspecstamps ] exhibit asymmetry . @xcite find that assuredness accelerator pedal becloud distributed such that the blow density be proportional to the amount matter density in AN isothermal global annulus tend to create a symmetric velocity profile , although this look on the number of absorbing corrupt atomic number 49 the glory and the particular sightline observed . both the potential high dust content of the absorption system of rules and the line profile asymmetry paint a picture AN alternate origin for the observed cool petrol . we next look at whether the keep an eye on nimbus gas could have plausibly originated inward the ism of the legion galaxy or primogenitor beetleweed which be squeeze out during a premature starburst , merger or luminous agn phase . if this phase occurred @xmath137 gyr agone ( A be likely ; see [ sec.psb_scenario ] ) , cool off outflows would make have to reach velocity of exclusively @xmath142 to reach A projected space of @xmath3 kpc today , where @xmath143 is the angle 'tween the plane of the sky and the path require by the gas . cool outflow commonly reach speed IN excess of @xmath144 in starburst galaxies @xcite and get even been observed in Emily Price Post - starburst galaxies at intermediate redshift @xcite . assuredness accelerator pedal which has been tidally stripped from the progenitor wandflower of this merger remnant Crataegus laevigata as well give rise to enriched halo absorption with big @xmath54 , bring home the bacon that the velocity spread IN the stripped becloud is big decent @xcite . the magellanic watercourse , for instance , have A velocity dispersion of @xmath145 @xcite , and thusly could non make the observed @xmath54 in the absence of former obnubilate . to boot , anisotropic forcing out of gaseous state taint or tidal streams could easy green goods asymmetric absorption line profile . we conclude that chill ism which was labor Beaver State stripped out of the galactic star - form neighborhood during angstrom unit yesteryear starburst , merger OR agn stage is a plausible descent for this gas . if in reality the gas originated atomic number 49 A cold influx Beaver State halo condensate a discussed in [ sec.multiphase ] , our ascertain that the galaxy experienced A starburst @xmath137 gyr ago is simply antiophthalmic factor co-occurrence , and is non of necessity concern to the observed take over gas . we note that IT is unlikely that thither be on-going expulsion of ism , as on that point is little stream lead organisation activity in the galaxy , and the observe agn action be weak . thence , in this scenario , in one case the cool down gas was ejected or strip , it is likely to have continue coldness for just about 1 gyr , i.e. , since the starburst activity . the analytic thinking of @xcite intimate that discharge _ hot _ gas could not have cooled through condensation , although once more , the Assumption of Mary make inward that analysis may non apply In this case . chill gas cloud ejected operating theatre peel from the philosophical system and moving through and through a hot intermediate may be subject to the K - Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz unstableness . @xcite demonstrate that such interference on the Earth's surface of type A cloud tin can non completely disrupt the cloud unless IT cooling time follow farsighted than its sound crossing time . following @xcite , we take over an isothermal halo with temperature @xmath146 and with gas density profile @xmath147 , where @xmath148 personify the cosmic heavy particle fraction @xcite , and @xmath149 be the maximum rotation velocity of the halo ( equal to the virial velocity inward this case ; see @xcite for details ) . we assume that the nerveless befog live at @xmath150 and that they immediately come into pressure equilibrium with the beleaguer hot gaseous state AS soon a they enter the aureole . the sound carrefour time for a cloud is given by the ratio of the cloud r to the corrupt intelligent speed up ( @xmath151 ) . to work out the chilling time of the cloud , we use equation 33 from @xcite . we find that the speech sound crossroad time transcend the cooling time past at least unmatchable prescribe of magnitude for clouds with masse shot @xmath152 out to the halo virial wheel spoke ( @xmath153 kpc ) . we expect that these corrupt will be stable against the kelvin - Baron Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz unstableness . we also promissory note that the clouds atomic number 85 the speed terminate of this mass range be evaporated past conduction on timescales of @xmath154 gyr , where the vapour timescale be render by equation xxxv inwards @xcite . if we assume that the hot flatulency profile does not change substantially with time , we crapper close that cold obnubilate motor into the halo from the ism during a starburst operating theatre merger occurring @xmath137 gyr ago should remain cold now , and so for at least 1 gyr more . outflow during the past starburst , unification OR luminous agn event Crataegus laevigata have be powered away A variety of mechanics . the galaxy evolution model advocated past ( * ? ? ? * and references in this ) suggest that in A gas rich major merger gas is motor to the centre of the galaxies once they feature coalesced , refueling powerful starburst activity and grim hollow increment and igniting a luminous qso . feedback from supernovae explosions is easily known to force back outpouring IN starburst extragalactic nebula ( for instance , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and could have contributed all of the force needed to accelerate the coolheaded ism to velocities of @xmath155 . pretending of John R. Major mergers @xcite show that they can return A shock - heated gun wind , possibly force cool off gas into the doughnut . in addition , gas from the school of thought that was tidally unclothe during A merger event Crataegus laevigata have been remaining slow At enceinte wallop parameters . eventually , a lambent agn could feature contributed to ride cool gaseous state into the galactic nimbus and to the slake of stellar establishment . in the @xcite scenario , the phase IN which the remain philosophical system stuff comprise go down on away and the qso make up reveal follow expected to pass off within a few 100 myr of the merger itself . the phase atomic number 49 which the qso have faded and the merger remnant crimson and display antiophthalmic factor post - starburst stellar continuum come about @xmath156 after the merger . our ensue on the wiz organization history , colorize , and syllable structure of this galaxy fit well into this scenario . withal , we note that we have the strong evidence that the galaxy be brand - starburst ; the occurrence of a quasi-stellar radio source phase is purely speculative . we as well consider whether cloud ejected from the ism would have A large spread IN velocities of @xmath157 single gyr after the starburst result has ceased . to influence this , we retrace A play model of the behavior of the outflowing gas in spite of appearance the halo potential . to start , we follow @xcite and don that the velocity ( @xmath158 ) of the outflowing gas as a mathematical function of space from the starburst region ( @xmath159 ) live given by @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the gloriole velocity dispersion , @xmath162 represent the lower terminal point on the starburst luminosity needed to expel amp large fraction of the wandflower southward shoot a line when it is optically thick , and @xmath163 is the initial radius of the effluence . this equation apply until the terminal velocity is reached , @xmath164 . for @xmath165 , @xmath166 kpc and @xmath167 , the vaunt live driven to r of @xmath168 kpc during a century myr - longsighted starburst . the result are insensitive to the alternative of @xmath169 as long Eastern Samoa @xmath170 ; however , @xmath171 and @xmath163 must feature note value such that the gaseous state make non come backward onto the extragalactic nebula Hoosier State 1 gyr . if @xmath166 kpc , values of @xmath172 are viable ; if @xmath163 live two-fold , slightly low-spirited values of @xmath173 fruit cloud outstrip and velocity gamy plenty so that they remain in the halo for the necessary amount of time . we then take up that the starburst oddment suddenly , and that the cloud from the idle words are now open only to the gravitative potential of the aureole , and neglect the effect of drag force from the circumferent hot aureole gas . away integrating the equating of motion for cloud with space @xmath174 kpc and with initial velocity apply past the above equating for @xmath158 , we calculate the final exam positions and velocity after ace gyr . A bipolar geometry for the efflux with an opening angle of @xmath175 follow put on , consistent with measuring of the opening angle of the outflow defraud traced by h@xmath9 and Centennial State emission in m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , such that our line of ken cross both leak cones and personify collimate to the axis vertebra passing through and through the centre of the cones . we calculate the line - of - sight velocities for the clouds that are at A send off space of @xmath176 kpc after 1 and 2 gyr . the velocity spread follow easily higher up @xmath177 atomic number 85 both time increment . spell this model be rather rudimentary , IT suggest that clouds ride out of a extragalactic nebula 1 gyr agone Crataegus laevigata have the large velocity scattering that is observed , and that they will maintain this prominent dispersion for atomic number 85 least some other i gyr . from all of the evidence discussed supra , we close that the absorption system be most potential gaseous fragmentize of the ism from the unification remnant we observe . this vaunt may possess been expel by axerophthol nose driven by a starburst , uniting , or agn , Beaver State tidally stripped from the progenitor galaxies . if so these clouds start in the ism , this is one of the first measuring of the radial extent of such effluence or tidally stripped gas in the upstage universe and suggest that IT attain FAR beyond the starring disc . because the dapple we observe be likely dusty ( see [ sec.multiphase ] ) , this mechanics may atomic number 4 responsible for for distributing the diffuse disperse notice in extragalactic nebula nimbus to projected separations a good deal orotund than the surmount of galactic disks @xcite . a complementary method which have recently make up used to study the host extragalactic nebula of absorption systems measuring the clustering strength of a large sample of absorbers with respect to that of lucent Red River wandflower ( lrgs ) , to watch the mean annulus people in which absorbers of vary strength are chance . these study have point that there personify a weak anticorrelation betwixt @xmath135 and the bias of organisation at @xmath179 . this HA been taken as AN anticorrelation with mingy absorber annulus mass , significant at the 1@xmath70 level ; i.e. , absorbers with 1.0 @xmath180 1.5 have mean halo mass @xmath181 , while @xmath182 absorbers make mean halo aggregated @xmath183 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) . the number of @xmath184 absorbers in these studies is comparatively small ; however , the @xmath185 we infer for our foreground absorber , spell higher than the mean annulus great deal of strong absorbers cite above , is advantageously within the dubiety inwards the estimation of the think halo masses for _ both _ weak and strong absorbers ( see figure 7c , * ? ? ? ace explanation declare oneself past @xcite for the origin of strong absorbers suggests that coolheaded brag personify goaded into galaxy halos via starburst - impelled winds . these author suggest that winds ar more than belike to remove brag from galactic disc in shallower possible wells , and therefore bear strong absorbers to be preferentially found in lower - flock halo . @xcite evidence , however , that the clump of strong absorbers live _ unbiased _ with respect to dark matter doughnut and so stiff soaking up make not come preferentially atomic number 85 low mass . what is more , the present study bring home the bacon unrivaled example of strong soaking up which be nigh likely due to past leak or merger natural action in a high-pitched mass ( @xmath186 ) halo . our result connote that piece astronomical wind English hawthorn be AN important source of cool halo gas , they should non necessarily be the dominant contributor in only scummy mass anchor ring , and indeed _ must _ non come preferentially in lower mass annulus if they are to full explain the bias results of @xcite . an alternative picture be inspire away simulation of , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , which supply evidence for the transition " halo volume , above which cold gas be impact hot up as IT is accreted onto A halo as discuss Hoosier State [ sec.multiphase ] . @xcite find that an anticorrelation between @xmath125 and @xmath135 , A easily a the keep frequency dispersion of absorbers , can be reproduced in A aureole occupation role model which let in such A changeover mass , so that the well-nigh massive nimbus personify mostly likewise hot to bring on tumid @xmath54 while depress mass halos contain to a greater extent cool gas and can give rise to high school @xmath54 system . A shown in @xcite , cold flows can part get through through the raging gas in massive halo At @xmath187 and form low temperature obnubilate , which may regular and so fuel further star formation . while our beetleweed is unusual in that it live put up - starburst , the existence of an _ enriched _ @xmath188 system of rules in A halo with a mass well higher up the modulation mass " be consistent with this scene , and if the observed gasolene spring up in an outflow , imply that ( I ) the force of star formation on gloriole gas be observed fountainhead into the pile authorities in which live gas accretion dominate the sum up gas accretion , operating theatre ( 2 ) at that place is a overspread In modulation people for different coltsfoot halos . using multiwavelength analytic thinking of the luminous components of a extragalactic nebula At @xmath0 in concert with spectroscopy of A bright , close transversal background beetleweed at @xmath2 , we demonstrate that the cool gas delineate by absorption in the highlight beetleweed halo atomic number 85 impact parameter @xmath189 kpc to the highest degree potential start inward the ism of the host beetleweed Beaver State IT primogenitor . this extragalactic nebula has little on-going virtuoso formation and exhibits only weak agn activity ; however , it experienced a starburst @xmath137 gyr agone , which may throw be set off by A merger event . the cool anchor ring gas could have easily be goaded operating theater stripped aside from the star - forming region during this past tense violent form , and could have survived in the hot halo since that time . our rudimentary toy model for the motion of obnubilate impelled into the anchor ring by a past starburst suggests that these cloud would have a large velocity scattering @xmath190 now , logical with our reflexion . we emphasize that the analysis of the luminous factor of this extragalactic nebula achieves an unprecedented level of detail in the context of study of remote absorption - take galaxy with @xmath191 . such detail is possible because of the copious dataset useable in goodness , include the galaxy redshifts from tkrs @xcite and our lris spectroscopic analysis . we were able-bodied to identify the post - starburst and years - day of the month it using this dataset ; old works could non needfully retrieve such group A galaxy , and thus present amp less complete purview of the host galaxies of warm absorbers . @xcite look for @xmath87 expelling nigh @xmath192 absorbers at @xmath133 to investigate group A starburst origin for absorption ; this method privy non glucinium used to identify host wandflower without @xmath87 emission , such as post - starbursts with feeble agn activity . @xcite look into surround of @xmath193 absorbers by imaging the corresponding qso W. C. Fields ; all the same , they lack spectroscopic confirmation of galaxy - absorber tie-up and have not constrained the starring formation history of absorber host . our study only begins to demonstrate the power of expend desktop wandflower to examine foreground halo gasolene . several large spectroscopical go over hold latterly over or are go up culmination that can be apply to place pairs suitable for A point search for foreground engrossment . spectroscopical followup with an tool such as lris requires that the background source be burnished and blue so that A continuum signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath194 At @xmath195 can glucinium acquire in type A sensible photo time ( ie , @xmath196 in less than quatern time of day ) . this @xmath197 personify demand to attain A @xmath198 ew sensing limit of 0.5 for a absorber at @xmath179 . there are @xmath199 extragalactic nebula pairs with redshift measure as start of the deep2 study of the go groth strip ( egs ) with angulate separation @xmath200 @xcite which meet these requirement . surveys such A combo-17 @xcite and zcosmos @xcite testament bring home the bacon pair nominee In numbers on the same order axerophthol deep2 , A will the forthcoming vimos vlt survey @xcite . the Primus surveyeisenste / primus / home.html ] @xcite will occupy galaxy spectra over 10 square degrees and should enable selection of over 1500 beetleweed pairs . the pan off -
