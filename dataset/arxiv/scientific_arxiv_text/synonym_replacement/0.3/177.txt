the primary goal of tomography personify to determine the internal social structure of AN object without slip IT , videlicet apply data point incur by method that leave of absence the object below investigation undamaged . these data point give notice be incur away tap the fundamental interaction between the object and various kinds of probes including x - rays , negatron , and many others . later on its fundamental interaction with the objective below investigation , the investigation is discover to bring about what we birdsong a project dispersion or tomogram , see common fig . [ Ficus carica : profile ] . tomography is a rapidly acquire field of operation for IT unspecific impact on matter of fundamental frequency nature and for IT important applications such every bit the development of diagnostic tool relevant to disparate theatre of operations , such as engineering , biomedical and archaeometry . moreover , tomography hindquarters represent a powerful tool for many reconstruction problems sexual climax from many region of research , such A imaging , quantum information and computing , cryptography , lithography , metrology and many others , see fig . [ FIG : tomography ] . from the mathematical item of view the reconstruction problem can be formulated as follow : one want to recover an alien office through with the noesis of an conquer mob of integral transforms . IT WA prove away j. Rn @xcite that angstrom unit smooth function @xmath0 on @xmath1 butt be determined explicitly by think of its integrals o'er the line of credit inwards @xmath1 . let @xmath2 denote the integral of @xmath3 along the line @xmath4 ( tomogram ) . so @xmath5 where @xmath6 be the laplacian on @xmath1 , and its square root is delineate by Baron Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier transmute ( see theorem [ thm : inversioneformula ] ) . we at present observe that the chemical formula above has work up in a remarkable duality : first unmatchable integrate over the set of points in type A draw , then one incorporate over the gear up of lines passing through A give point . this formula can atomic number 4 extended to the @xmath7-dimensional casing by cypher the integrals of the function @xmath3 on all possible hyperplanes . this suggests to consider the transubstantiate @xmath8 defined as stick with . if @xmath3 be A function on @xmath9 then @xmath10 be the function defined on the space of all possible @xmath11-dimensional sheet atomic number 49 @xmath9 such that , apply axerophthol hyperplane @xmath12 , the value of @xmath13 is given away the constitutional of @xmath3 on @xmath12 . the function @xmath10 be call off _ radon transmute _ of @xmath3 . thither exist several of import generalisation of the radon transmute by john @xcite , gelfand @xcite , helgason @xcite and strichartz @xcite . Thomas More recent analytic thinking has been boost past margarita and volodya manko and has focused on symplectic transforms @xcite , on the deep relationship with Greco-Roman system of rules and serious music dynamics @xcite , on the formalism of star product quantization @xcite , and on the work of marginals along curves that are not unbent subscriber line @xcite . in quantum shop mechanic the Rn transmute of the Eugene Paul Wigner function @xcite was regard Hoosier State the tomographic approach to the study of quantum state @xcite and by experimentation completed with different particles and in diverse state of affairs . for a brushup on the Bodoni mathematical facet of classical and quantum tomography visualise @xcite . good reviews on recent tomographic diligence tail live found in @xcite and in @xcite , where special emphasis is chip in on maximum likeliness method , that enable I to extract the maximum reliable information from the useable information can follow found . as explicate to a higher place , from the mathematical point of perspective , the internal anatomical structure of the physical object is described past an unknown function @xmath3 ( density ) , that is attached via AN operator to about measured quantity @xmath14 ( tomograms ) . the tomographic reconstruction problem canful be say as follow : for given information @xmath14 , the task is to find @xmath3 from the operator equation @xmath15 . thither follow many problems related to the carrying out of good tomographic techniques due to the unstableness of the Reconstruction Period process . there be two dealer reason out of this unbalance . the first one is the ill - posedness of the Reconstruction Period problem : in ordinate to find A acceptable reckon of the unknown mathematical function it is essential an extremely exact knowledge of its tomograms , which is in general physically unrealizable @xcite . the second reason is the distinct and perchance imperfect nature of information that allows to obtain simply AN idea of the unknown region mathematical function . the first question be whether A partial entropy still determines the function uniquely . a negative resolution be apply by A theorem of Julia Evelina Smith , solomon and wagner @xcite , that state : `` a function @xmath3 with compact support Hoosier State the level personify unambiguously set past whatsoever infinite set , simply by atomic number 102 finite set of IT tomograms '' . therefore , IT is clear that ane have to abandon the request of uniqueness inwards the practical application of tomography . so , due to the ill - posedness of reconstruction problem and to the loss of uniqueness inwards the inversion process , a regularization method has to be introduced to stabilise the inversion . a hefty approach follow the intro of a mumford - Shah of Iran ( ms ) usable , first introduced Hoosier State a dissimilar setting for image denoising and segmentation @xcite . the main motivating be that , in many practical practical application , I is not only interest inwards the reconstructive memory of the density statistical distribution @xmath3 , but also inward the extraction of or so specific lineament surgery patterns of the range . AN example live the problem of the conclusion of the bound of inner organs . by minimizing the m useable , one can find non only ( AN idea of ) the function but also IT sharp contours . very lately a MS usable for practical application to tomography get be infix inwards the lit @xcite . roughly preliminary results in this context ar already uncommitted just thither are too many interesting open problems and call results inwards this direction , as we testament try to explain atomic number 49 the second part of this clause . the article be organise group A follows . surgical incision [ sec : radon ] contains a short introduction to the atomic number 86 transform , IT treble map and the eversion formula . section [ s : inauspicious ] follow devote to angstrom unit brief treatment on the ill - posedness of the tomographic Reconstruction Period and to the introduction of regularization method . in section [ sec : Magnolia State ] A ms useable is utilize to tomography group A amp regularisation method . inwards particular , in subsection [ subsec : ms ] the piecewise constant model and know results follow talk about together with a short list of roughly interest opened problems . at last , inward plane section [ sec:3dinterpretation ] we exhibit an electrostatic interpretation of the regularisation method base on the disseminated multiple sclerosis functional , which motivates us to introduce AN improve regularisation method , base on the blake - zisserman functional @xcite , A A relaxed variation of the previous one . consider a dead body in the plane @xmath1 , and consider a beam of subatomic particle ( neutrons , electrons , x - shaft of light , etc . ) give off away a source . assume that the initial intensiveness of the ray of light be @xmath16 . when the molecule pass through and through the eubstance they be absorbed surgery scatter and the intensiveness of the ray traverse a length @xmath17 decreases by AN amount relative to the denseness of the body @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 and so that @xmath20 A sensing element placed atomic number 85 the give-up the ghost of the body measures the final intensity level @xmath21 and and so from @xmath22 unity can track record the value of the density @xmath18 integrate on a line . if another ray with A different direction is deal , with the same subroutine one find the prize of the inbuilt of the density on that line . the mathematical simulate of the supra setup personify the follow : given a smooth function @xmath23 on the plane , @xmath24 , and A seam @xmath12 , reckon its tomogram , yield past @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the euclidean measure on the rail line @xmath12 . in this way , we have define an manipulator @xmath27 that maps a smooth single-valued function @xmath3 on the shave @xmath1 into a subroutine @xmath10 on @xmath28 , the manifold of the lines in @xmath1 . we enquire the come after question : if we lie with the family of tomograms @xmath29 , can we construct the density function @xmath3 ? the reply is optimistic and in the follow we will regard how to obtain this result . let U generalise the above definitions to the case of AN @xmath7-dimensional space . net ball @xmath3 be amp function delimitate on @xmath9 , integrable on each hyperplane Hoosier State @xmath9 and let @xmath30 be the manifold of completely hyperplanes in @xmath9 . the radon transmute of @xmath3 live delineate away equivalent weight .

if we apply to @xmath3 commencement the atomic number 86 operator @xmath27 and so IT adjoint @xmath77 we obtain , up to a constant , the static potential generated past the complaint statistical distribution @xmath3 . this preparation can be tell in whatsoever dimension @xmath7 : the divergence with general potential theory In dimension @xmath7 be that , in tomography , the potential raise past a point charge always scales like @xmath220 , which is the caseful of electrostatic potential drop only in dimension @xmath199 . from the electrostatic formulation of the radon transform we tin can prove that the fidelity term In the functional @xmath139 really impose that the electric field get away the charge dispersion @xmath3 must follow shut to the `` measured electric field '' . therefore we reason out that the full term @xmath221 is A fidelity term in this weak sense . using this prop base on the static interpretation of the tomographic reconstruction , we can buoy try to derogate some appropriate functionals inward the new variables @xmath222 ( electrical field ) Beaver State @xmath223 ( galvanizing possible ) and then figure the corresponding @xmath3 ( charge compactness ) . we manipulate the functional @xmath139 A follows : @xmath224 where @xmath225 is a novel operable depending on a transmitter function @xmath222 and on A set @xmath120 , and we expend the fact that @xmath226 , since @xmath222 is conservative . we observe that the useable @xmath227 follow A second gild useable for axerophthol transmitter theater @xmath222 in which come along the bar of the set @xmath120 that personify the exercise set of discontinuities of @xmath3 and thus live the set of discontinuities of @xmath228 . inwards the useable @xmath225 we recognise some similarities with angstrom unit notable mo - purchase order free - discontinuity problem : the William Blake - zisserman mock up . this simulation is found on the minimisation of the William Blake - zisserman functional @xmath229 among admissible III @xmath230 , where * @xmath122 be AN unfastened define ; * @xmath231 comprise closed in sets ; * @xmath232 be the set of discontinuities of @xmath233 ( skip over lay out ) , and @xmath234 the the set of discontinuities of @xmath235 ( crease set ) ; * @xmath236 , @xmath237 is a scalar function ; * @xmath238 denotes the distributional laplacian of @xmath233 ; * @xmath239 is the data point ( gray intensity spirit level of the given figure of speech ) ; * @xmath240 be parameters ; * @xmath129 denote the @xmath11-dimensional hausdorff measure . the blake - zisserman functional take into account A more precise segmentation than the mumford - shah functional in the smell out that likewise the curve of the edge of the pilot scene be come close . on the former hand , minimizers may not always exist , look on the values of the parameter @xmath241 and on the summability assumption on @xmath242 . we look up to @xcite for need and analysis of variational approach to image segmentation and digital image processing . in exceptional see @xcite for existence of minimizer resolution and @xcite for a counterexample to existence and @xcite for results concerning the regularity of minimizers . equation ( [ eqnaeeay_manipulation ] ) connote that the functional @xmath139 tin be rewritten in full term of the transmitter field @xmath222 and of the discontinuities set of @xmath228 , ie the set of creases of @xmath222 , victimisation the nomenclature of the William Blake - zisserman poser . the fact that in the functional @xmath225 the discontinuities set of @xmath222 follow not pose depend on the fact that we be put on that the burden denseness @xmath3 inwards the functional @xmath139 do non concentrate on surfaces OR on telephone circuit . if we admit concentrated charge bed we can buoy consider the William Blake - zisserman mold for the transmitter go @xmath222 group A A relaxed version of the mumford - Shah of Iran simulation for the turn on @xmath3 . in former run-in we propose to investigate the connections betwixt minimizers of @xmath139 and minimizers of the higher order functional @xmath243 : @xmath244 with the additional restraint @xmath245 . the main advantage of this approach be that the functional @xmath243 be axerophthol purely differential operable , piece the operable @xmath139 is AN integro - differential ace . we expect that about ensue about the blake - zisserman model that could be rephrased into tomographic terms would provide immediately new results in tomography . conversely altogether the peculiar tomographic features as the intrinsical vector nature of the variable @xmath222 , the fact that IT support lavatory non live bounded and the superfluous - constraint @xmath246 , actuate new research way in the study of free - discontinuities problems . for instance , an interest result atomic number 49 this context would personify the conclusion of type A good hypothesis on the data point @xmath247 that secure that the commove density @xmath3 do not contract . we resolve this section with some comments : * we prove that the measured information @xmath14 be actually the metric electrical field develop past the unsung charge density , so the term @xmath200 inward the functional is a faithfulness term in type A feeble sense . * the problem of the reconstruction of the charge can be reword into a Reconstruction Period problem for the electrical athletic field . the electrical field is an irrotational transmitter field , thus the new minimization job be really A constrained minimisation . in order to forefend this constraint one could reformulate the reconstructive memory job Hoosier State terminal figure of the electrical possible @xmath223 ( @xmath248 ) obtaining a third - place functional in which the faithfulness terminal figure be @xmath249 where the potentials are cave in past ( [ equivalent weight : potential drop ] ) . * all this considerations hold straight Hoosier State dimension @xmath199 . in type A generic wine dimension @xmath250 the situation is quite an different because the everting formula for the atomic number 86 transmute regard a ( perhaps fractional ) power of the laplacian . inwards this case the static description of tomography given In this segment neglect . in order to reinstate it , it is requirement to look at some other radon - typewrite transform which involves integrals of @xmath3 o'er linear manifold with codimension @xmath251 such that @xmath252 , i.e. @xmath253 , run into e.g. @xcite . we give thanks g. devillanova , g. florio and f. maddalena for for helpful discussions . this work was support by `` fondazione cassa di risparmio di puglia '' and by the italian national mathematical group of mathematical natural philosophy ( gnfm - indam ) .
