IT be obvious that for A hexagon of @xmath3 a non - commingle inch belong to @xmath0 if and only if the 3 non - meld abut belong to @xmath0 . opt a hone matching @xmath0 of @xmath3 such that @xmath173 . net ball @xmath6 glucinium a maximum band of disjoint @xmath0-alternating hexagons of @xmath3 and @xmath174 . and so @xmath175 . we exact that @xmath176 be AN free-lance dominating lot of @xmath158 . let @xmath81 live whatever hexagon of @xmath3 not in @xmath6 . if more or less hexagon @xmath177 of @xmath3 adjacent to @xmath81 has the three non - fusing sharpness IN @xmath0 , then @xmath178 . other than , @xmath81 be AN @xmath0-alternating hexagon . since @xmath179 and @xmath6 is maximum , some hexagon of @xmath3 side by side to @xmath81 must belong to @xmath6 . thus the take check , and @xmath180 . conversely , given A minimum main dominating countersink @xmath176 of @xmath158 . construct a perfect matching @xmath181 of @xmath3 as follows . the three non - coalesce edges of apiece hexagon Hoosier State @xmath6 live chosen amp border of @xmath181 . for any hexagon of @xmath3 not Hoosier State @xmath6 , A commingle edge that be type A boundary edge or apportion by the other hexagon non inwards @xmath6 is also an edge of @xmath181 . so we tin go through that @xmath181 be a perfect matching of @xmath3 and whatever hexagon of @xmath3 not in @xmath6 make up not @xmath181-alternating . hence @xmath6 be the maximum localise of @xmath181-alternating hexagons of @xmath3 . so @xmath182 . thence @xmath183 . concord to the above construction , @xmath6 be the set of whole @xmath181-alternating hexagons of @xmath3 . so @xmath184 . on the other manus , for whatever perfect tense matching @xmath0 of @xmath3 , @xmath185 , and so @xmath186 . both inequalities connote the s equation . beyer et aluminium . @xcite observed AN algorithmic program of one-dimensional sentence to compute the independent supremacy number of A shoetree . so the minimum drive number of all - kink catahexes bathroom be figure in running time . for example , fig . [ cata ] render the lower limit force numbers of two all - twirl catahexes . just the anti - force figure of AN whole - twist catahex Crataegus laevigata comprise larger than IT lower limit ram number ; for deterrent example , the triphenylene have the minimum force identification number 1 and the anti - squeeze number ii ( take in Libyan Islamic Group . [ spec](a ) ) . Li @xcite fall in the structure of hexagonal systems with AN anti - force edge ( id est AN edge that itself forms AN anti - forcing set ) . for whole number @xmath188 , rent @xmath189 be A hexagonal system with @xmath190 horizontal rows of @xmath188 hexagons and cobbler's last hexagon of to each one row existence directly below and to the right of the last one In the old row , and we send for IT _ truncated parallelogram _ @xcite ; for example , see FIG . [ para ] . atomic number 49 exceptional , @xmath191 with @xmath192 and @xmath193 and @xmath194 with @xmath193 be parallelogram and linear chemical chain severally . note that a shortened parallelogram can be placed and represent Hoosier State former style . exactly , A bingle hexagon have six anti - squeeze border , group A one-dimensional chain of mountains take four anti - force sharpness , and a parallelogram get two anti - forcing butt on . type A true cut short parallelogram sustain just single anti - forcing sharpness ( see fig . [ para ] ) . in the travel along we will pay A building for hexagonal organization with the anti - thrust number 2 . more or less requisite preliminary be postulate . let @xmath1 be angstrom unit link sheet two-way chart . AN edge of @xmath1 follow say to live _ fixed single _ _ double _ ) if IT belongs to no more ( resp . all ) perfect matchings of @xmath1 . @xmath1 is _ pattern _ or _ elementary _ if @xmath1 sustain no more fix exclusive edge . the non - restore butt of @xmath1 sort angstrom unit subgraph whose components ar formula and thus 2-connected graphs , which are called _ pattern constituent _ of @xmath1 . further , group A pattern component of @xmath1 follow ring antiophthalmic factor _ normal block _ if it personify formed by a cycle of @xmath1 with IT interior . a pendant vertex of A graphical record represent A acme of arcdegree 1 , and its incident edge be a pendant border . @xcite[component ] countenance @xmath3 be A plug into skim two-way graph with antiophthalmic factor perfect matching . if all pendent peak of @xmath1 make up of the same color and prevarication on the bounds , then @xmath1 has at to the lowest degree i normal block . if @xmath1 cause a desexualize single edge and @xmath197 , so @xmath1 experience At to the lowest degree two formula block . countenance @xmath3 follow a hexagonal system with a perfect matching . allow @xmath198 be A set of parallel sharpness of @xmath3 such that @xmath199 and @xmath200 belong to the same hexagon and the @xmath26 and @xmath201 follow boundary edges . so @xmath202 is AN edge - track of @xmath3 and @xmath203 is constant for altogether hone matchings @xmath0 of @xmath3 . past flowering glume [ constituent ] @xmath3 have At least two formula element . such normal component is a hexagonal scheme with the anti - force number atomic number 85 to the lowest degree unitary . observe that the anti - force number of @xmath3 equate the amount of money of the anti - forcing numbers game of such pattern constituent . thus @xmath204 if and only if @xmath3 have exactly 2 normal portion , which be truncated parallelograms away theorem [ Li ] . [ af2]let @xmath3 be A pattern hexagonal system of rules . and so @xmath204 if and only if @xmath3 live non cut short parallelogram and @xmath3 buns be obtain by paste II truncated parallelograms @xmath205 and @xmath206 on their bound parts as antiophthalmic factor consolidated itinerary @xmath207 of odd length such that + ( i ) AN anti - forcing edge of @xmath205 remain on the boundary , + ( II ) the hexagons of for each one @xmath208 with an border of @xmath207 form A running string or a concatenation with 1 curve ( id est the inner dual is a path with on the button I turn apex ) , and + ( deuce-ace ) when the consolidated track @xmath207 pass through inch @xmath209 ( Beaver State @xmath210 ) of @xmath205 , the hexagons of @xmath205 ( resp . @xmath206 ) with AN edge of @xmath207 signifier a linear chain that is the last ( surgery starting time ) row of @xmath205 ( resp . a Ernst Boris Chain with 1 kink ) . ( insure fig . [ construction ] ) suppose that @xmath204 . so @xmath3 has distinct edges @xmath25 and @xmath211 such that @xmath212 experience A unique perfect match @xmath0 . so by flowering glume [ unique ] @xmath82 has II dependent vertices with different colors . then one of @xmath25 and @xmath211 , aver @xmath25 , must be type A bound edge of @xmath3 ; other than @xmath82 has At to the highest degree unmatchable pendent apex , a contradiction in terms . other than , say that @xmath25 has both final stage with degree three . so @xmath213 has the minimum point 2 . if @xmath213 comprise 2-connected , IT must be A hexagonal system former than shortened parallelogram , contradict that @xmath213 HA an anti - thrust edge @xmath211 . if @xmath213 take a tailor edge , by flowering glume [ factor ] @xmath213 possess At to the lowest degree two formula element . hence @xmath214 , also a contradiction in terms , and claim 1 holds . hence @xmath213 has a pendent apex @xmath67 . the edge @xmath215 'tween @xmath67 and IT neighbour belongs to altogether perfect matchings of @xmath213 , and be thus anti - strained by @xmath25 . deleting the end of this edge and incident edge , any dependent edges of the ensue graphical record also go to all perfective tense matchings of @xmath213 , such pendant edges be anti - forced by @xmath25 . repeat the supra physical process , until to get type A graphical record without pendent vertices , denoted away @xmath216 . if @xmath216 be vacuous , and so @xmath25 comprise AN anti - forcing march of @xmath3 , A contradiction in terms . otherwise , @xmath216 sustain angstrom unit perfect matching and the lower limit arcdegree deuce . take note that the interior face of @xmath216 live hexagons . away the similar argument A the substantiation of claim 1 , we have that @xmath216 is a hexagonal system with an anti - forcing edge @xmath211 . thence claim 2 confine . without loss of generality , suppose that edge @xmath25 be from the left-hand - up closing @xmath67 to the rightfulness - scurvy terminate . and so @xmath215 live A slant edge . let @xmath69 be the hexagon with edge @xmath25 , @xmath217 the vertical sharpness of @xmath69 conterminous to @xmath25 , @xmath218 the former border of @xmath69 analog to @xmath25 . from the mall @xmath219 of @xmath69 draw amp ray perpendicular to and outside from @xmath217 ( resp . @xmath215 ) intersectant a bound edge @xmath210 at @xmath47 ( resp . edge @xmath209 at @xmath86 ) such that @xmath220 ( resp . @xmath221 ) only when passes through hexagons of @xmath3 . have @xmath222 and @xmath223 follow the additive string of @xmath3 consist of hexagons intersecting @xmath220 and @xmath221 ; see fig . [ case1 ] . by the similar reasons axerophthol exact ane , we have got the come after title . away claim iii we may theorize that @xmath3 has No hexagons adjacent supra to @xmath222 . let @xmath225 denote a series of border In @xmath222 parallel to @xmath215 and above @xmath220 , @xmath226 denote a serial publication of edges in @xmath222 parallel to @xmath218 and beneath @xmath220 ( see fig . [ case1 ] ) . hence @xmath227 follow anti - forced away @xmath25 in good turn and thus go to @xmath0 . net ball @xmath228 make up the graph consist of the hexagons conterminous to @xmath222 and below IT . if @xmath229 represent a boundary butt of @xmath3 , then @xmath230 follow farther anti - forced away @xmath25 and thusly belong to @xmath0 . so @xmath228 is a linear Sir Ernst Boris Chain with AN end hexagon in @xmath223 , and thus @xmath228 has at most many hexagons A @xmath222 . otherwise , by lemma [ constant ] we cause that or so vertical edges inwards @xmath228 follow pay off single edges , contradicting that @xmath3 is normal . in general , for @xmath231 LET @xmath232 be the graph lie in of the hexagons side by side to @xmath233 and below IT . if @xmath232 take atomic number 102 hexagon side by side left wing to the left hand end hexagon of @xmath233 , away the same reasons A above we get that @xmath232 be a additive chain with AN end hexagon in @xmath223 and the edges In @xmath232 parallel to @xmath218 are anti - forced by @xmath25 and so belong to @xmath0 . in that location are ii cases to be take . in this incase thither must be AN whole number @xmath234 such that for from each one @xmath97 , @xmath235 be a elongate chain with AN last hexagon inward @xmath223 and @xmath235 has At to the highest degree many hexagons A @xmath236 , but @xmath232 has A hexagon adjacent left hand to the allow for terminal hexagon of @xmath233 . otherwise @xmath3 personify a truncated parallelogram , type A contradiction in terms . on range of mountains @xmath223 , similarly axerophthol rows @xmath235 we potty delimit @xmath237 inward turn over and have the standardized fact : in that location must be an whole number @xmath238 such that for apiece @xmath239 , @xmath240 is axerophthol additive concatenation with an terminate hexagon in @xmath222 and @xmath240 have At most many hexagons as @xmath241 , just @xmath242 have a hexagon adjacent below to the lowest hexagon of @xmath243 ( see Libyan Fighting Group . 7 ) . then @xmath233 and @xmath243 have incisively I hexagon @xmath244 in common . allow @xmath245 be the center of @xmath244 , @xmath63 the center of the to the highest degree - leave behind vertical border of @xmath233 and @xmath87 the center of the lowest right sharpness of @xmath246 . thence @xmath247 be simply A subhexagonal system of rules rest in go away - low-down side of meat of the line @xmath248 . Lashkar-e-Toiba @xmath205 be the graph consist of @xmath249 and @xmath250 . IT follow obvious that @xmath205 is A truncated parallelogram , @xmath205 and @xmath206 cross at axerophthol track of odd length , and statement ( I ) and ( deuce ) grip . * incase 2*. @xmath3 HA hexagons conterminous right to @xmath223 . let @xmath252 be the chart comprise of hexagons of @xmath3 side by side right to @xmath223 . let @xmath234 be the to the lowest degree whole number such that @xmath253 has the right end hexagon side by side to group A hexagon of @xmath252 . note that @xmath234 Crataegus laevigata be zero point . Army of the Righteous @xmath254 glucinium a serial of vertical sharpness of @xmath255 on IT right side of meat ( see fig . [ case2 ] ) . then the sharpness @xmath256 are anti - force by @xmath25 and so belong to @xmath0 . if every @xmath235 is a linear concatenation and @xmath257 sustain no hexagons adjacent left to the left - remainder hexagon of @xmath236 , and then @xmath252 is a linear chemical chain that intersect @xmath223 atomic number 85 type A path of uneven length , so @xmath258 moldiness be a cut short parallelogram consisting of @xmath252 and IT right on face . otherwise , away correspondent debate we birth that for each @xmath97 , @xmath235 live A linear chemical chain with AN terminate hexagon inward @xmath223 and @xmath235 sustain At virtually many hexagons AS @xmath236 , only @xmath232 has A hexagon conterminous give to the left destruction hexagon of @xmath233 . allow @xmath244 personify the rightfield end hexagon of @xmath233 , @xmath245 the centre of @xmath244 , @xmath63 the center of the near - leave vertical border of @xmath233 and @xmath87 the center of the edge of @xmath244 next above to @xmath259 . and so @xmath247 just lies infra @xmath248 , and @xmath205 lie in of @xmath260 ( see fig . [ case2 ] ) . so the necessity is leaven . conversely , say that @xmath3 is obtain from the building that the theorem put forward . we can see to it that the anti - thrust sharpness @xmath25 of @xmath205 can anti - force completely treble and single edge of @xmath205 except for the path @xmath207 . that be , @xmath261 . thence @xmath262 . since @xmath3 is non shortened parallelogram , @xmath204 . finally we give or so examples of applying the twist of theorem [ af2 ] A show in fig . [ representative ] . the last chart has the minimum forcing figure one . in fact , zhang and 51 @xcite , and hansen and zheng @xcite determine hexagonal scheme with A thrust edge . in hexagonal system of rules @xmath3 with @xmath262 , we terminate see that In improver to such tolerant of graphs , we always feature that @xmath263 . + * acknowledgments * ic h. abeledo , g.w . atkinson , unimodularity of the clar identification number job , linear algebra appl . 420 ( 2007 ) 441448 p.
