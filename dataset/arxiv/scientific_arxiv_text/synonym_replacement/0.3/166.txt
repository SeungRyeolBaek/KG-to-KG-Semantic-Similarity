instinctive hamiltonian systems are the mathematical models of those physical systems for which the push is unceasing , for instance sympathetic oscillators or the kepler system . a great deal , as In the premature two example , more quantities are constant quantity of the gesture ( Beaver State _ maiden integrals _ ) : angular momentum , laplace - runge - lentz transmitter , etc . usually , these constant quantity personify extract by quadratic polynomial multinomial in the momenta Beaver State , for quantum systems , past second - order differential operators . hamiltonian scheme with invariable of the movement of arcdegree high-pitched than two follow less common , nevertheless , roughly of them are of great involvement , AS for example the iii - organic structure jacobi - calogero and Tom Wolfe system . these system of rules represent the dynamic of three level - mess on a line under force learn past the potential difference mapping @xmath4 respectively ( we exercise non moot here the harmonic oscillator terms ) and they have fundamentally the Lapplander dynamics @xcite . both the resulting natural hamiltonians in @xmath5 admit one and only linear and one quadratic in the impulse invariable of the motion , pretend the system liouville - integrable and resolvable away detachment of variable quantity ( go out @xcite and references in this ) . other two independent constant quantity of the question do subsist , 1 quadratic , due to the multiseparability of the hamiltonian , and one three-dimensional . the systems are then maximally superintegrable ( mebibyte ) , feature a number of functionally independent invariable of the motion match to twice the level of freedom , minus 1 ( for quantum organisation , the Sami number of algebraically independent symmetry manipulator ) . m systems live of the greatest grandness in mathematical physical science , sympathetic oscillators and Johannes Kepler are ms and this makes them to satisfy bertrand s theorem . so , maximal superintegrability demonstrate itself , for classical systems , in the fact that whole finite orbits of ms systems be unopen spell , for quantum systems , in the fact that the vigour levels represent entirely deviant @xcite . in recent year , various technique made possible the construction of classic and quantum hamiltonian systems , MiB and non , with for the first time integrals of arbitrarily richly degree @xcite whose read , static IN developing , bring forth remarkable result atomic number 49 special map , quantum algebras , canonical quantisation theory @xcite . inward this musical note IT is shortly introduce the act on the issue do by claudia chanu , luca degiovanni and the author ( inwards short cdr ) in several juncture articles . Hoosier State few word , the extension service procedure ( theorem [ teo0 ] ) add together 1 point of freedom to close to suitable hamiltonian @xmath6 inwards such a way AN superfluous non niggling first inherent , polynomial of level @xmath7 , of the new hamiltonian do exist . the follow theorem , stated in @xcite , delineate and characterizes what we intend for `` extensions '' inwards the special case of raw hamiltonians on cotan bundle up of riemannian manifold ; for type A more than general definition , find out @xcite . precondition an @xmath8-dimensional raw hamiltonian @xmath6 on the cotangent roll up of a ( pseudo)-riemannian manifold @xmath9 , Army of the Pure make up @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 live the hamiltonian transmitter field of @xmath6 , so [ teo0 ] net ball @xmath9 be A @xmath8-dimensional ( pseudo-)riemannian manifold with metric tensor @xmath13 . the innate hamiltonian @xmath14 on @xmath15 with canonical co-ordinate @xmath16 acknowledge AN prolongation @xmath17 in the form ( [ hamext ] ) with A first inbuilt @xmath18 with @xmath19 turn over away ( [ u ] ) and @xmath20 , if and sole if the travel along shape hold : 1 . the go @xmath21 and @xmath22 live up to @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 be the Wellington boot tensor of @xmath21 . 2 . for @xmath26 the stretch hamiltonian @xmath17 and the low intact @xmath27 ar @xmath28 for @xmath29 the extended hamiltonian @xmath17 and the first integral @xmath27 comprise @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 Hoosier State @xcite IT live turn up that @xmath35 is functionally independent from @xmath17 , @xmath6 and whatsoever other number one integral of @xmath6 in @xmath36 . the integrability experimental condition of ( [ hessteo ] ) be talk about in @xcite and IT is find that their complete integrability expect @xmath37 , where @xmath31 follow the invariant curve of @xmath9 . then , the procedure @xmath20 canful look linearly on up to @xmath38 parameters and the maximal number of parameter personify strike on invariable curve manifold lonesome . however , non complete answer pot be found in non - unremitting curve manifold ( cdr to appear ) . from equating ( [ vteo ] ) , the expressions of the admissible potential @xmath22 can be computed . several examples are throw inwards @xcite . the particular variant of @xmath19 have possible to explicit whatever @xmath35 by expanding the @xmath39-th power of a binomial , get @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41}{\left ( \begin{matrix } m \cr 2k \end{matrix } \right ) \gamma^{2k}p_u^{m-2k}\left(-2m(cl+l_0)\right)^k},\ ] ] @xmath42}{\left ( \begin{matrix } m \cr 2k+1 \end{matrix } \right ) \gamma^{2k+1}p_u^{m-2k-1}\left(-2m(cl+l_0)\right)^k } , \quad m>1,\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] refer the whole number part and @xmath44 . we mention that number one integrals of mellow arcdegree obtain In former ways than past the extension procedure @xcite can represent explicitly verbalized solely give thanks to the fact that the dynamical equating be in these cases separated in some coordinate system of rules . As angstrom unit first deterrent example of the extension process we debate the 1 - dimensional hamiltonian @xcite @xmath45 the geodesic term of the extend hamiltonian @xmath17 be @xmath46 where @xmath31 personify hither the invariable curve of the extended configuration manifold . the solutions of par ( [ hessteo ] ) and ( [ vteo ] ) are @xmath47 where @xmath48 . when @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the constellation manifold of @xmath17 is the euclidean carpenter's plane , the sphere @xmath51 and the pseudosphere @xmath52 severally , piece for @xmath53 and @xmath50 , the Hermann Minkowski woodworking plane , the desitter and anti - desitter manifold , severally . after type A rescaling of the coordinate @xmath54 , the parameter @xmath39 in @xmath17 pass into @xmath6 and @xmath55 this work patent that the wing procedure acquaint close to distinct symmetry into @xmath17 , in this case a dihedral correspondence of order @xmath56 , in some way connected with the supernumerary first inherent @xmath35 . in the euclidean woodworking plane ( i.e. @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath22 is associate with the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi - calogero voltage Beaver State , equivalently , with the wolfes potential @xcite . so , inwards cylindric organise of @xmath5 , @xmath60 , with axis vertebra @xmath61 parallel to @xmath62 w.r . to cartesian co-ordinate @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 the procedure of file name extension allow for two New functionally self-governing 1st integrals to the extend hamiltonian @xmath17 : @xmath17 itself and @xmath27 . this fact is particularly relevant when the hamiltonian @xmath6 live ms . atomic number 49 this case , @xmath17 be ms too , admitting @xmath65 functionally independent first integrals . IN @xcite this holding of extend hamiltonians is studied inward several case . for example , let us consider @xmath66 that be a specific incase of the generalise tremblay - turbiner - winternitz system ( ttw ) @xcite for @xmath67 and @xmath68 defined on invariant - curve manifold of curve @xmath69 . this system is MS for whatsoever noetic parameter @xmath70 and admits polynomial for the first time integrals of point concern to @xmath70 @xcite . in @xcite IT is shown that @xmath6 e'er admits extension of the mannikin @xmath71 with @xmath72 , create in this way new M systems . likewise , harmonic oscillators in @xmath73 , isotropous surgery non , can be extend into harmonic oscillators inwards @xmath74 @xcite . the assumption @xmath20 can buoy follow generalise to @xmath75 . this lead to of import generalisation , introduced in @xcite , that testament follow develop Hoosier State a paper in cookery ( cdr ) . the extension process can be inwards this case use with @xmath39 substituted by whatsoever positive rational @xmath76 afterward A suitable definition of @xmath77 , soh that the generalised ttw system of above , with @xmath78 , can buoy be written group A AN extension for whatever rational @xmath70 . to classical extended hamiltonians and their first integrals put up follow link quantum hamiltonians and balance manipulator by just about process of quantization , usually IN var. of laplace - beltrami operator . when the curve of @xmath9 be non constant , the quantisation require additional terminal figure ( quantum corrections ) in order to keep integrability operating theatre superintegrability . the quantum correction is then regulate away the scalar curvature and past the weyl tensor @xcite . at least inward the caseful @xmath79 , the coinciding quantisation of @xmath17 and @xmath80 comprise possible , allow the saving of maximum superintegrability of yard classical extended systems to the quantum restrain . this testament be shew in type A paper inward preparation ( cdr ) .
