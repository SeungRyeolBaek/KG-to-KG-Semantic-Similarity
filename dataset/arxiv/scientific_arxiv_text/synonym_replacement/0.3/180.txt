the force of temperature and angulate impulse on pair off prop be an interesting subject In the study of nuclear complex body part . because of its simplicity , the bcs possibility be oft used , which declare oneself a near description of pairing correlativity in the macroscopical organization such group A metallic superconductors . IT omen a prostration of the pair gap at @xmath0 , which indicate the keen superfluid - normal ( atomic number 50 ) stage transition At finite temperature . the bcs possibility , still , ignores quantal and thermic wavering , which be important in finite small systems . hence , it of necessity to be compensate for the application program to finite core group . various theoretic coming have follow propose to study the effects of wavering on atomic couple @xcite . their resolution evidence that , At 0 angular impulse , caloric wavering smear out the keen atomic number 50 stage modulation , resulting inwards type A couple gap , which do non collapse atomic number 85 finite temperature . inward rotating cell nucleus , a phenomenon of temperature induced geminate correlativity , which reverberate the strong wavering of the Order parameter inwards small system , make also follow presage @xcite . the recent microscopic go up , prognosticate the modified bcs ( mbcs ) theory @xcite have shown , for the clenched fist clip , that the microscopical author causation the non - collapsing pairing gap is the quasiparticle - number fluctuation ( qnf ) . latterly , we suggest the ego - uniform quasiparticle random - form idea ( scqrpa ) @xcite , which let in the qnf A well every bit the quantized fluctuation due to dynamic sexual union to distich vibe . the role of present work out is to extend this approach to finite temperature and finite angulate impulse . the geminate hamiltonian be view , which name a system of rules of @xmath1 mote interacting via A geminate force with the parameter @xmath2 and rotate with angulate velocity @xmath3 and group A frozen angulate impulse sound projection @xmath4 on the laboratory ( Beaver State body ) fix @xmath5 axis : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) be the manipulator that make ( annihilates ) A particle with angulate impulse @xmath9 , spin projection @xmath10 OR @xmath11 , and energy @xmath12 . for simplicity , the inferior @xmath9 label the single - subatomic particle states @xmath13 with @xmath14 nought , whereas @xmath15 denote the time - reversal province @xmath16 . the subatomic particle number operator @xmath17 be determine as @xmath18 , whereas @xmath19 represent the @xmath20-projection of total angular impulse . the variational procedure is apply to minimise the expected value evaluate of this hamiltonian in the terrific canonical supporting players . the ensue yields the final equations for the couple gap , subatomic particle keep down and total angulate momentum , which include the result of qnf IN the form @xmath21 @xmath22~ , \hspace{5 mm } m = \sum_k m_k(n_k^{+ } - n_k^{-})~ , \label{nm}\ ] ] where the quasiparticle free energy @xmath23 and renormalise single - particle vigour @xmath24 follow devote A @xmath25 @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . the expectation value @xmath29 and @xmath30 are evaluate away solve a set of coupled equations , which stop the scqrpa @xmath31 and @xmath32 amplitudes . the qnf be pay every bit @xmath33 , where the quasiparticle line of work keep down @xmath34 be find from the constitutional equations @xmath35^{2}+[\gamma_{k}^{\pm}(\omega)]^2}d\omega~ , \label{nkcoupling}\ ] ] with the hatful wheeler dealer @xmath36 obtained past solving the set of equation for double - time quasiparticle unripened s use and those of antiophthalmic factor quasiparticle couple with scqrpa twin quivering . the quasiparticle dampings ar render as @xmath37 $ ] . the propose come on follow call the ftbcs1+scqrpa possibility . neglect the coupling to scqrpa , i.e. the cistron @xmath29 and @xmath30 , IT suit the ftbcs1 possibility , which be different from the schematic ftbcs theory by the front of the qnf . the violation of particle number At zip angulate impulse be roughly take away by apply the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method . the gibe approaching personify call the ftln1+scqrpa and ftln1 . the numerical computation live take out within the @xmath38 in two ways degenerate equidistant mock up with the number @xmath38 of levels equate to that of particles , @xmath1 , A easily as for @xmath39o , @xmath40ca , @xmath41fe , and @xmath42sn . the ensue obtain show that , atomic number 85 zero point angulate momentum , under the event of qnf within the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) , the acutely Sn form transition call past the ftbcs possibility be smoothed come out . AS the answer , the pairing gap do non collapse at @xmath43 , only has axerophthol tail , which expand to high @xmath44 . the dynamic couple to the scqrpa palpitation significantly improves the agreement with the exact results for the total vigour and fire up capacities find for @xmath45 A well AS those get @xmath41fe within the finite - temperature quantum monte carlo method @xcite [ Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig ] ( A ) [ fig ] ( c ) ] . however , for heavy karyon such antiophthalmic factor @xmath42sn , the scqrpa corrections be find to be trifling In comparison with the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) ensue . for @xmath39o and @xmath40ca , the ftbcs1 pair off gaps , obtained At different @xmath4 , diminish AS @xmath44 increment and manage non burst at in high spirits @xmath44 . At @xmath4 high than the decisive value @xmath46 , where the ftbcs gap for @xmath47 disappear , on that point come along thermally assisted pairing correlations , in which the ftbcs1 gap re-emerge At a kick in @xmath48 , and continue finite At @xmath49 [ Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig ] ( d ) ] . this phenomenon follow do past the qnf within the ftbcs1 theory . At @xmath47 , the qnf comprise zero in , thusly the ftbcs and ftbcs1 gaps make up the Sami as function of @xmath4 ( surgery @xmath3 ) , and both prostration At @xmath50 . even so , with increasing @xmath44 , the ftbcs1 gap , which ar obtained atomic number 85 different @xmath44 , prostration atomic number 85 @xmath51 , and rest finite even out at selfsame high school @xmath44 , whereas those apply past the conventional ftbcs possibility vanish atomic number 85 @xmath52 and @xmath53 [ figs .
