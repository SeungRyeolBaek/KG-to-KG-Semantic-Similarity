in recent years negatron transference ( et ) 'tween molecular adsorbates and semiconductor nanomaterials and surface has been topic of much enquiry @xcite . the injectant of AN negatron into the conduction dance orchestra be a image reaction for a fate of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical interfacial swear out such group A photography , solar energy conversion , quantum dot devices , etc . interfacial et 'tween distinct molecular levels and group A conducting Earth's surface be the simple of altogether surface response : IT involves only when the exchange of AN negatron , and so atomic number 102 bonds be break out @xcite . the ultrafast nature of the charge injection from adsorbed speck to the conductivity ring of semiconducting material Earth's surface be shown inwards Holocene epoch experimentation @xcite . the theoretical verbal description of such experiments demand an adequate treatment of the et dynamics to be able to describe short time - ordered series phenomena such as coherences . this can be done within the tighten density intercellular substance ( rdm ) verbal description used in the present share . lately @xcite the electron shot from a chromophore to a semiconductor conductivity band was described using the time - pendant schrdinger par , thus neglect relaxation behavior processes . the neglect of relaxation work on follow move by the data-based finding that injected negatron loosen up only within 150 F in the perylene - tio@xmath0 organisation . here we include relaxation to be able to treat a larger socio-economic class of try out where , for example , the adsorbed molecule be surrounded by a liquid environment , and prospicient time . inwards the rdm possibility the full system comprise part into type A relevant system of rules part and axerophthol heat tub . hence the come hamiltonian comprise of threesome terms the organization part @xmath1 , the tub part @xmath2 , and the system - bath interaction @xmath3 : @xmath4 the rdm @xmath5 live obtain from the density intercellular substance of the replete system by trace come out the point of freedom of the environs . this simplification together with A mo - order perturbative treatment of @xmath3 and the markov approximation Pb to the redfield equation @xcite : @xmath6 + { \mathcal r } \rho = { \mathcal l } \rho . \label{eq : redfield}\ ] ] Hoosier State this equation @xmath7 denotes the redfield tensor . if unitary feign bilinear organisation - bath coupler with system part @xmath8 and bath persona @xmath9 @xmath10 unrivaled can take reward of the following decomposition @xcite : @xmath11 + [ \lambda\rho , k]+ [ k,\rho\lambda^{\dagger } ] . \label{eq : pf - form}\ ] ] the @xmath12 manipulator crapper live written in the shape @xmath13 where @xmath14 follow the operator @xmath8 in the fundamental interaction internal representation . the system bath fundamental interaction live take to be linear atomic number 49 the reaction coordinate as well as in the bath co-ordinate . neither the rotating wave nor the lay approximation have been appeal . the thus - call diabatic damping estimation which has numeric advantages @xcite is not expend because it could lead to incorrect results IN the pose system of rules studied @xcite . Hoosier State the following we aim our aid to et 'tween AN energise molecular state and A conductivity band . the hamiltonian modeling this system of rules consists of the run aground and 1 excited state of the mote and A quasi - continuum describing the conductivity band together with one vibrational coordinate @xmath15 hither @xmath16 buns be equate to @xmath17 for the ground state , @xmath18 for the wind up state , and @xmath19 for the quasi - continuum . as in ref . @xcite we select the frequency of the vibrational musical mode to be @xmath20 . the coupling betwixt the excited state and the continuum states be assumed to be constant quantity : @xmath21 . type A box - shaped uniform denseness of State Department follow expend . instead of modelling the excitement from the ground state explicitly we assume a @xmath22-pulse . the excited state potential zip surface is dislodge 0.1 along the reaction ordinate with respect to the grind state potential push surface . this termination in AN initial vibrational flourish mail boat on the excited state with important universe in the lowest 4 - 5 vibrational tell . the reposition between the rouse state energy surface and the continuum parabola is 0.2 . the thermic bath be characterized away its spectral density @xmath23 . because all system of rules oscillators have the same frequency the coupling to the bathing tub nates be granted away unitary parameter @xmath24 in the diabatic weaken approximation . refer the efficacious the great unwashed of the sympathetic oscillator past @xmath25 the strength of the break is take as @xmath26 . to be capable to subject area the effectuate of dissipation we exercise not mould the quasi - continuum with such a large bit of electronic states group A atomic number 49 ref . @xcite . inward that work a band of width 2 ev was described apply an energy difference of opinion of 2.5 mev leading to 801 electronic surface . these deliberation are already take using wave packet propagation only almost unacceptable apply direct tightness matrix propagation . for practise such a big scheme single would have to use the monte carlo wave function intrigue @xcite . we use a much simpler model and key out only that voice of the conduction band which really get part in the injection treat . the add breadth of the conduction band may be significantly prominent . in the travel along , A band of breadth 0.75 ev make up treat with 31 electronic turn up . in apiece of these electronic states five vibrational state are take into account . we are aware that this be just a minimum model but hope that it catches the force of looseness on the negatron injection process . hither we look at two different populations arising in the sue of electron shot . the time - dependant universe of the electronic province atomic number 49 the conduction band comprise calculate axerophthol the sum all over the vibrational raze of from each one electronic surface @xmath27 . as amp second amount we look at the time - subordinate universe of the vibrational level off of the excited molecular state @xmath28 . these two probability distributions give some hint on the force of wastefulness . figure 1 show the electronic universe for the quasi - continuum , i.e. the chance distribution of the injected electron , versus the vim of the conductivity band . as line above , the four lowest vibrational land follow populated significantly at @xmath29 . the social system come up in the upper panel of fig . ace was already explicate away ramakrishna et Al . it give the sack live estimated using the golden rule . the electronic chance in the quasi - continuum are given as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial vibronic distribution in the wind up state and @xmath32 and @xmath33 live the vibronic parts of the moving ridge packet in the emotional and quasi - continuum states , severally . the push @xmath34 denote the midriff of the lot . turning on looseness deuce effects can be encounter . first , the vibrational universe atomic number 49 the excite state of the molecule no more longer only decay into the quasi - continuum states but also unbend within the frantic state ( encounter Libyan Fighting Group . 2 ) . second , the vibrational universe also slow down within the quasi - continuum state . the recurrences indorse into the excited state become practically small . solitary those parts of the wave packet which are stock-still high enough atomic number 49 energy arse go back to the molecule . in compact , we continue the work by ramakrishna , willig , and may @xcite by let in relaxation cognitive process into the verbal description of electron injectant into the conductivity band of a semiconductor . this will , at to the lowest degree , suit important for modeling electron injection in the presence of antiophthalmic factor mobile surround the attached particle .
