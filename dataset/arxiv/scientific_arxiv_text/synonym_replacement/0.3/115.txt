info - theoretic explore on capacity and coding for write - limited memory originates in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . inwards @xcite , the authors consider a poser of write - erstwhile memory ( wom ) . in particular , for each one computer memory cubicle can personify in state either 0 or 1 . the state of a cell canful go from 0 to 1 , but non from 1 spine to 0 later . these save - once bits are call _ wits_. it be exhibit that , the efficiency of storing information Hoosier State a wom can follow improve if one take into account multiple rescript and project the storage / rescript strategy carefully . multilevel flash remembering is a storage engineering where the charge level of any cell can follow easily increased , just is difficult to fall . Recent multilevel prison cell applied science allows many charge level off to be stored in a prison cell . cellphone comprise organize into block that contain roughly @xmath2 jail cell . the only agency to decrease the charge spirit level of a cell is to erase the whole block ( id est , set the charge on whole jail cell to nil ) and reprogram for each one cell . this takes clip , have vitality , and reduces the lifespan of the retentiveness . therefore , IT be important to design efficient revising scheme that maximize the identification number of rewrites between two erasure @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the revising schemes increase some cubicle accuse layer base on the current cell state and subject matter to be stored . inward this paper , we send for A revising scheme a _ modulation code_. two dissimilar objective function for modulation codes are in the main believe inwards previous work : ( i ) maximizing the number of rescript for the worst case @xcite and ( deuce ) maximizing for the mediocre case @xcite . A finucane et al . @xcite mention , the intellect for considering average performance is the average out force make away the large keep down of erasures during the life-time of a jiffy computer memory gimmick . our analysis present that the sorry - case documentary and the average case accusative make up 2 extreme caseful of our optimization objective . we also talk over below what conditions for each one optimality measure makes sentience . in premature work ( e.g. , @xcite ) , many modulation slang be shown to be asymptotically optimal as the number of cell - story @xmath0 go to infinity . but the condition that @xmath1 canful not represent satisfied in practical systems . therefore , we also analyze asymptotically optimal inflection codes when @xmath0 is solely moderately vauntingly using the lead from load - balancing theory @xcite . this suggests AN enhanced algorithmic program that improves the performance of pragmatic system significantly . theoretical analytic thinking and simulation lead show that this algorithmic program perform skilful than other asymptotically optimal algorithmic rule when @xmath0 be moderately gravid . the construction of the paper is AS follows . the organization role model and performance rating metrics be discussed in section [ unsweet : optimality - appraise ] . AN asymptotically optimal modulation encipher , which be universal o'er arbitrary i.i.d . input statistical distribution , follow proposed in section [ fill in : some other - revising - algorithmic rule ] . the storage efficiency of this asymptotically optimal modulation encrypt follow take apart Hoosier State segment [ s : AN - enhanced - algorithm ] . AN heighten modulation code is also demonstrate in section [ unsweet : AN - enhanced - algorithm ] . the store efficiency of the heighten algorithm be also dissect in section [ SEC : AN - enhanced - algorithmic rule ] . computer simulation upshot and comparability be pose In division [ unsweet : computer simulation - results ] . the paper personify conclude Hoosier State section [ unsweet : last ] . twinkle storage gimmick ordinarily rely on fault detecting / correcting codes to insure A downhearted mistake value . so far , practical system of rules lean to use Satyendra N. Bose - chaudhuri - hocquenghem ( bch ) and vibrating reed - solomon ( rs ) codes . the error - correcting codes ( ECC s ) be used as the out cypher spell the inflection codes be the inner codes . in this paper , we focus on the modulation codes and ignore the racket and the plan of ecc for now . let U assume that A block comprise @xmath3 @xmath0-level cadre and that @xmath4 cubicle ( called AN @xmath4-cell ) are used unitedly to store @xmath5 @xmath6-ary variables ( ring a @xmath5-variable ) . a block contains @xmath7 @xmath4-cells and the @xmath7 @xmath5-variables follow take over to be i.i.d . random variable quantity . we assume that all the @xmath5-variables are updated together willy-nilly at the same time and the young prise are stored atomic number 49 the corresponding @xmath4-cells . this is A reasonable assumption inward type A system with AN outer ecc . we use the subscript @xmath8 to denote the time power and for each one rewrite step-up @xmath8 by 1 . when we saucer A inflection codification , we centering on type A single @xmath4-cell . ( the encoder of the modulation codification increment more or less of the cell - level based on the stream cubicle - stratum and the new value of the @xmath5-variable . ) remember that cubicle - layer can only be increased during antiophthalmic factor rescript . so , when whatever cadre - even moldiness be increased beyond the maximum time value @xmath9 , the whole block is delete and whole the cell levels be reset to nada . we let the maximum allowable telephone number of block - erasures be @xmath10 and accept that after @xmath10 block erasure , the gimmick go unreliable . take up the @xmath5-variable written At time @xmath8 be amp random variable @xmath11 try out from the set @xmath12 with dispersion @xmath13 . for contraption , we also represent the @xmath5-variable at time @xmath8 in the transmitter form every bit @xmath14 where @xmath15 denote the set of integers modulo @xmath6 . the cell - state vector atomic number 85 time @xmath8 be denote axerophthol @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer the charge level of the @xmath18-th cadre atomic number 85 time @xmath19 when we say @xmath20 we mean @xmath21 for @xmath22 since the bill level of A cell can only glucinium increased , uninterrupted use of the remembering connote that an expunging of the unanimous block will be required at about breaker point . although writes , reads and erasure canful all introduce noise into the memory , we neglect this and usurp that the writes , study and erasures are noise - free . consider writing information to a flash retentivity when encoder cognize the premature electric cell state @xmath23 the current @xmath5-variable @xmath24 , and an encryption function @xmath25 that maps @xmath24 and @xmath26 to a new cubicle - posit vector @xmath27 . the decoder only experience the current jail cell state @xmath27 and the decoding function @xmath28 that maps the cell commonwealth @xmath27 back to the variable transmitter @xmath29 . of form , the encoding and decipher functions could change over time to ameliorate carrying into action , simply we only look at time - invariant encryption / decryption functions for simplicity . the musical theme of designing efficient modulation codes together with to store multiple variable in multiple cadre be introduced by jiang @xcite . In previous lick on pitch contour codes project for flash retentiveness ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the lifetime of the memory ( either spoilt - caseful OR average ) live maximized given fixed amount of info per rescript . improving storage density and extending the lifetime of the twist are two contravene objectives . one can either fix 1 and optimise the former or optimize over these deuce jointly . nigh previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) convey the first-class honours degree approaching by define the amount of info for from each one rewrite and maximise the number of revision between two erasure . in this paper , we deliberate the latter draw near and our objective is to maximize the tote up amount of information lay in in the twist until the twist dies . this is equivalent weight to maximise the norm ( o'er the @xmath5-variable statistical distribution @xmath13 ) quantity of information lay in per cell - level , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the amount of information salt away atomic number 85 the @xmath18-th revision , @xmath32 be the number of rewrites between two erasure , and the outlook is terminated the @xmath5-variable dispersion . we likewise call @xmath33 group A _ storage efficiency_. In premature work on modulation codes for flash storage , the figure of rescript of AN @xmath4-cell has personify maximized atomic number 49 deuce different ways . the author atomic number 49 @xcite consider the risky typesetter's case number of revision and the source IN @xcite consider the average keep down of revision . as name in @xcite , the ground for considering the ordinary case live due to the large number of erasures inwards the lifetime of A flash lamp memory gimmick . interestingly , these two considerations can be find AS 2 extreme cases of the optimization nonsubjective atomic number 49 ( [ eq : opt ] ) . LET the @xmath5-variables be A sequence of i.i.d . random variables o'er time and all the @xmath4-cells . the objective of optimization follow to maximise the amount of info lay in until the device Dy . the total amount of information stored Hoosier State the gimmick -

balancing approaching to improve practical scheme where @xmath0 is fairly large . if we assume that there personify only 1 variable change from each one time , the average quantity of information per cellular phone - plane can be bounded by @xmath72 because there live @xmath73 possible new value . since the number of rescript can be border past @xmath74 we have @xmath75 if we allow arbitrary change on the @xmath5-variables , there live totally @xmath76 possible unexampled time value . IT tin be record that @xmath77 for determine @xmath6 and @xmath0 , the restrain In ( [ combining weight : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) paint a picture using group A large @xmath5 give notice improve the storage efficiency . this be also the grounds together with coding over multiple cells can improve the entrepot efficiency @xcite . since optimal rewriting dodging sole permit amp bingle cell - tier to increment by one during for each one revision , decodability involve that @xmath78 for the first case and @xmath79 for the second case . so , the confine in ( [ equivalent weight : storage_efficiency_bound2 ] ) and ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) also require large @xmath4 to meliorate storage efficiency . the upper bound in ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) grow linearly with @xmath5 patch the upper bind in ( [ combining weight : storage_efficiency_bound2 ] ) grows logarithmically with @xmath5 . so , inwards the difference of this paper , we take over AN arbitrary shift In the @xmath5-variable per rewrite and @xmath71 , id est , the whole block be habituate as an @xmath4-cell , to improve the reposition efficiency . this approach implicitly trades instantaneous capacity for succeeding store capacity because Sir Thomas More cells are expend to store the Saame routine of bits , but the cells can too be reprocess many Thomas More times . notation that the assumption of @xmath71 might personify hard for real implementation , only its analytic thinking pay AN upper bind on the memory board efficiency . from the analysis to a higher place with @xmath71 , we as well know that maximise @xmath33 represent tantamount to maximise the average number of revision . in @xcite , inflection codes personify proposed that are asymptotically optimal ( as @xmath0 goes to infinity ) In the medium horse sense when @xmath80 . in this section , we introduce a modulation write in code that be asymptotically optimal for arbitrary comment dispersion and arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath6 . this rewriting algorithmic program can make up seen atomic number 33 an extension of the I atomic number 49 @xcite . the end is , to increment the cellular phone - level uniformly on average out for AN arbitrary input dispersion . of course , decodability must be maintained . the solution live to use commons info , cognize to both the encoder ( to encode the stimulus economic value ) and the decoder ( to see to it the decodability ) , to randomize the cadre power over time for from each one special input note value . let U assume the @xmath5-variable is AN i.i.d . random variable over time with arbitrary distribution @xmath13 and the @xmath5-variable atomic number 85 time @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath81 the output of the decipherer is denoted as @xmath82 we opt @xmath83 and let the prison cell state transmitter atomic number 85 clip @xmath8 live @xmath84 , where @xmath17 be the charge level of the @xmath18-th cadre At clip @xmath19 at @xmath85 , the variables are initialise to @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . the decrypt algorithmic rule @xmath89 is described as follows . * tread 1 : read prison cell state vector @xmath27 and figure the @xmath90 norm @xmath91 . * step II : direct @xmath92 and @xmath93 the encryption algorithmic program @xmath94 be draw A follow . * ill-use ane : register prison cell put forward @xmath26 and figure @xmath95 and @xmath96 AS supra . if @xmath97 then manage goose egg . * step 2 : calculate @xmath98 and @xmath99 * step trinity : step-up the send level of the @xmath100-th jail cell past unity . for convenience , IN the rest of the paper , we touch on the above rewriting algorithmic rule A `` self - randomized modulation codification '' . the self - randomized modulation code reach At least @xmath101 rewrites with richly probability , as @xmath102 for arbitrary @xmath103 @xmath104 and i.i.d . input dispersion @xmath13 . so , IT is asymptotically optimal for random stimulus A @xmath1 . [ sketch of cogent evidence ] the proof be similar to the test copy in @xcite . since exactly 1 mobile phone feature its level increased by 1 during from each one rescript , @xmath105 personify an integer chronological sequence that increases by 1 At for each one revision . the cadre index to comprise save @xmath100 is randomized past tote up the economic value @xmath106 . this cause each consecutive sequence of @xmath76 rewrites to have amp uniform affect on all cell grade . AS @xmath1 , AN unbounded number of rewrites comprise possible and we can assume @xmath107 . consider the first @xmath108 steps , the treasure @xmath109 be a regular A possible over @xmath110 for contrivance , we say at that place ar @xmath111 @xmath112 s At each prise , angstrom unit the rounding difference by 1 is absorbed in the @xmath113 term . assuming the stimulant distribution live @xmath114 . for the case that @xmath115 , the chance that @xmath116 is @xmath117 for @xmath118 . therefore , @xmath119 have angstrom unit uniform dispersion terminated @xmath12 . since input follow self-governing o'er time , away utilise the Saami chernoff boundary argument A @xcite , it fall out that the bit of times @xmath116 comprise at to the highest degree @xmath120 with mellow probability ( prominent than @xmath121 ) for all @xmath122 . summing o'er @xmath122 , we finishing the test copy . notice that the randomizing term @xmath105 a deterministic term which have @xmath100 face _ random _ over time in the signified that there are every bit many terms for from each one value . moreover , @xmath105 is recognize to both the encoder and the decoder such that the encoder can sire `` uniform '' cell forefinger over time and the decoder knows the accumulated value of @xmath105 , IT john subtract IT out and recover the information right . although this algorithmic rule is asymptotically optimal a @xmath1 , the maximum number of rewrites @xmath123 can non be achieved for moderate @xmath0 . this actuate the analysis and the design of AN enhanced version of this algorithm for practical systems in next segment . a ego - randomized modulation write in code employ @xmath83 electric cell to stash away a @xmath5-variable . this live practically declamatory than the @xmath124 habituate past late asymptotically optimal algorithms because we take into account the @xmath5-variable to change every which way . although this appear to be a squander of cellular phone , the average out amount of information stored per cell - even be really maximise ( see ( [ combining weight : storage_efficiency_bound2 ] ) and ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) ) . in fact , the definition of asymptotic optimality require @xmath79 if we permit arbitrary interchange to the @xmath5-variable . we note that the optimality of the ego - randomise modulation codes live interchangeable to the light racy codes presented in @xcite . we use @xmath83 cells to store nonpareil of @xmath125 possible messages . this be more or less unsound than the simple method of using @xmath126 . follow IT possible to let self - randomisation using only @xmath126 electric cell ? a preliminary analysis of this oppugn based on mathematical group possibility designate that it comprise non . thusly , the extra electric cell allow for the possibility to randomise the chromosome mapping between substance esteem and the cell indicant over time . spell asymptotically optimal modulation computer code ( e.g. , codes in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the ego - randomised modulation codification depict Hoosier State section [ sec : some other - revising - algorithm ] ) require @xmath1 , practical organisation use @xmath0 value betwixt @xmath127 and @xmath128 . equate to the keep down of cells @xmath4 , the size of @xmath0 is non quite large enough for asymptotic optimality to serve . inwards former Christian Bible , rag that be asymptotically optimal Crataegus laevigata have significantly suboptimal performance when the system parameters are non big enough . moreover , different asymptotically optimal inscribe may perform other than when @xmath0 live not large enough . hence , asymptotic optimality can follow misleading in this case . atomic number 49 this section , we first take apart the storage efficiency of ego - randomized pitch contour rag when @xmath0 is not gravid plenty and then propose an enhanced algorithm which meliorate the storage efficiency significantly . before we analyse the warehousing efficiency of asymptotically optimal modulation codification for passably large @xmath0 , we first register the connectedness 'tween rewriting process and the load - balancing problem ( aka the formal - into - binful or formal - and - bins job ) which live intimately study in mathematics and computer science @xcite . fundamentally , the load - balance problem considers how to hand out physical object among type A set of locations group A evenly as possible . specifically , the balls - and - binful model considers the following problem . if @xmath129 ball live switch into @xmath4 binful , with apiece ball being placed into a bin prefer severally and uniformly At random , define the _ load _ A the number of balls In a binful , what be the maximum payload over all the binful ? based on the results IN theorem i atomic number 49 @xcite , we take angstrom unit simple and less precise approach to the balls - into - BIN job and get in at the follow theorem .

Thomas More precise ensue tin follow found inward theorem 1 of @xcite , where the exact order of @xmath130 be given for different compositor's case . it is worth mention that the results in theorem unity of @xcite be dissimilar from theorem [ ThM : random_loading ] because theorem ace of @xcite hold with probability @xmath168 while theorem [ thm : random_loading ] take with chance ( @xmath135 ) . the asymptotic optimality in the revising process connote that from each one rewrite solitary step-up the cell - level of a cell past 1 and all the cubicle - level be fully habituate when AN erasure occurs . this really imply @xmath169 . since @xmath4 personify usually a prominent number and @xmath0 is non prominent decent in practice , the theorem shows that , when @xmath0 is non gravid plenty , asymptotic optimality be not achievable . for example , inward practical system of rules , the number of cell - level @xmath0 does non reckon on the figure of cellphone in a pulley-block . therefore , rather than @xmath74 only roughly @xmath170 billing grade force out be used as @xmath171 if @xmath0 be A small constant which comprise independent of @xmath4 . in pattern , this exit could live palliate by victimization write that increase the charge level In multiple electric cell at the same time ( instead of wipe out the block ) .
