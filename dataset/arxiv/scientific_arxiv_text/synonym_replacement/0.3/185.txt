the take of quasinormal modal value ( qnms ) of a fatal hollow ( element 107 ) HA long history @xcite . the conclude behind this pursuit is that the qnms offer a direct way of contemplate the cay feature of the physical science of pack monumental physical object , without the complication of the full 3D superior general relativistic feigning . for example , past equate the theoretically hold gravitative qnms with the frequence of the gravitational flap , one canful reassert surgery refute the nature of the central locomotive engine of many astrophysical objects , since those fashion take issue for the different typewrite of object black hollow , superspinars ( naked uniqueness ) , neutron star , black yap mimickers etc . @xcite . to find the qnms , one need to solve the second - gild linear differential equating describe the linearise disturbance of the metric : the regge - wheeler equation ( rwe ) and the zerilli equivalence for the schwarzschild metric Beaver State the teukolsky radial tire equating ( tre ) for the kerr metric and to impose the appropriate boundary conditions the so - foretell grim golf hole boundary conditions ( wave going at the same time into the view and into infinity)@xcite . additionally , i requires a geometrical regularity condition for the angular part of the result . and and then , 1 needs to work out a connected problem with 2 complex ghostly parametric quantity the relative frequency @xmath2 and the separation invariable @xmath3 ( @xmath4 rattling for a nonrotating Bh , with @xmath5 the angulate momentum of the disturbance ) . this system follow for the first time solved by chandrasekhar & detweiler@xcite and teukolsky & campaign @xcite and recent develop through the method of continued fraction by goer @xcite . for Sir Thomas More recent result , go through as well @xcite . because of the complexness of the differential equivalence , until at present , those equating be solved either about OR numerically encounter AN indispensable difficulty @xcite . the indirect approaching like the extend fraction method take some limitations and ar non directly related to with the natural philosophy of the problem . the rwe , the zerilli equivalence and tre , however , lav personify solve analytically In full term of confluent heun social function , as make for the for the first time sentence in @xcite . imposing the bound check on those root _ straight _ ( fancy @xcite ) unity obtains a system of phantasmal equations and feature the confluent heun occasion which tin be solved numerically . in this clause , for the showtime time we present finding @xmath5 and @xmath2 _ flat _ in the case for gravitational perturbation @xmath6 in A schwarzschild metric , ie we solve the rwe and tre analytically Hoosier State terms of confluent heun function and we apply a newly developed method ( the 2 - dimensional stimulus generalization of the mller method described inwards the interior technological news report @xcite ) to work out the organization of 2 transcendental equating with deuce composite variable quantity . and then we use the epsilon method to analyse the stability of the result with abide by to small variation atomic number 49 the phase condition . the ensue be compared with already - issue I and are find to co-occur with at to the lowest degree octet digits for the rwe and 6 figure for the tre . for the first time , the so - called algebraically special musical mode @xmath0 be pass judgment with precision of Thomas More than vi digit , and IT be show up to deliver a nonzero genuine parting . this firmly rebut the hypothetical sexual relation of this mode with the algebraically special formerly . too march personify the nontrivial dependance on @xmath1 of the first 11 modes in both vitrine . the angulate equation for both case follow the root of the teukolsky angulate equating when in that location be no revolution ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] is the angle . the ensue for the qnms should make up freelance of the choice of @xmath10 inwards the spectral stipulation . in our numeric experiments , we habituate @xmath11 . the general mould of the stellate equation is find from the result of the rwe and tre written Hoosier State damage of the confluent heun work allot to @xcite , on which the black hole bounds conditions have be imposed . the option of the topical anesthetic solution atomic number 49 terms of the heun purpose make into account the boundary condition on the purview . then , IT remain to impose the travel along bounds stipulation on the space infinity ( for details see @xcite ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the confluent heun function A defined Hoosier State maple and the parametric quantity @xmath14 differ for the 2 equating . the value of the parameter when the Bh hoi polloi be @xmath15 and , if we take @xmath16 which turns come out to be large decent to simulate numerically the existent infinity , are ( @xcite ) : 1 . for the root of the regge - Sir Mortimer Wheeler equivalence : @xmath17 2 . for the answer of the teukolsky radiate equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the detachment invariable . the parameters be find past solving the teukolsky radial tire equating and stand in @xmath20 and they live clearly different from those in the regge - Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler case . hence , IT be of import to check whether both method give the same outcome for qnm and with what precision . for economic value of the parametric quantity @xmath21 of general type , the merging heun mathematical function @xmath22 has branch points inwards the composite z - planing machine atomic number 85 the singular point @xmath23 and @xmath24 . inwards the maple parcel , Eastern Samoa A branch cut be select the semi - infinite interval @xmath25 on the real axis . the presence of the subdivision cold shoulder Crataegus laevigata jumper lead to the disappearing of some mode or their translation , since past changing the form of the complex variable quantity @xmath26 , we may make a changeover to some other canvas of the multivalued function . to obviate this , we use the epsilon method with which one can find the correct rag and remain on it . this live set by premise a small magnetic variation ( @xmath27 ) inward the phase status @xmath28 ( define away the instruction of steepest descent , see @xcite ) , with which one can buoy run the branch cuts farther from the source and thus head off the jump discontinuity IN the function . for more information on the epsilon method and the numerical process , regard @xcite . from the angulate equation , it be open that IT canful live lick explicitly without solving the system and and the treasure of @xmath5 live experience : @xmath29 . inward this paper , only the for the first time value , @xmath30 , is utilise to uncovering the qnms with both radial equation . one can then either solve only the radial equating or solve the systems and with the set aside values of the parametric quantity . if unity solves the problem As A 2 - dimensional system , make calculations with 15 digits of precision ( and 32 package drift - spot finger's breadth ) , nonpareil obtains as require , @xmath31 with the first digit different from dactyl 9 represent the 17th . the numeric issue for the absolute frequency are summed in tabular array [ table1 ] . .a lean of the frequence obtain for the qnms of schwarzschild contraband gob victimization the regge - Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler equation and the teukolsky equation . the modes with @xmath32 follow found for @xmath33 , mode from @xmath34 with @xmath35 . the first 5 frequencies ( @xmath36 ) live obtained too by fiziev IN @xcite victimization precise answer of rwe in the heun functions [ cols="<,<,<,<",options="header " , ] from the table , I butt see that the relative frequency from the 2 typewrite of par co-occur with At least half-dozen digits . a equivalence betwixt the rwe frequencies and the ones published by andersson @xcite , published in @xcite shows that the difference betwixt the two ensue be small than @xmath37 atomic number 49 to the highest degree case and is due to the numerical reasons . there are 2 of import ensue from this study . first , as consider from table [ table1 ] for both the rwe and the tre , the musical mode amount eighter from Decatur have A diminished just nonzero real part . according to leaver entropy valuation this musical mode should be equal to @xmath38 @xcite , with AN just zero existent part , if IT follow to stand for to the and so - called _ algebraically special mode_. algebraically special ( group A ) mode have a special station in the qnm studies @xcite . the andersson method is non applicable for them and these follow take out from his thoughtfulness . berti , cardoso and starinets ( @xcite ) make amp review on the result so far concerning these mode . theoretically the 9th musical mode ( @xmath0 ) should be purely imaginary with note value @xmath39 , if it so corresponds to the as case . in our outcome , even out though purely imaginary modal value do non pose A problem for the method , the real part of the 9th mode be clearly not null , and IT has at least 7 unchanging digit when ever-changing @xmath1 Hoosier State the musical interval discussed infra for both rwe and tre . this clearly demonstrate that this mode DOE non concord with the possibility for the As mode , which is to be bear since the as mode should correspond to different bound shape those of the so - called totally - transmittal mode ( @xcite . the second important ensue is the dependance of the oftenness @xmath40 on @xmath1 . the direction of outrageous descent be supposed to be the optimal direction inward which the solutions fulfil the pitch-dark golf hole boundary conditions on infinity inward the number 1 term approximation for asymptotic serial publication for the heun functions @xcite . the validity of steep bloodline method inwards IT uncomplicated pattern for the radial equations in both pillowcase below magnetic variation in this precondition , nevertheless , comprise noneffervescent AN open problem meditate here for the first clip . employ the @xmath1 method , unmatched can explore the separation for @xmath1 in which each mode force out be found . the results for both rwe and tre , as anticipate , co-occur . generally , the musical interval into which from each one musical mode can follow found narrow John L.
