A we recognise from isolated merger simulation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , to resolve such a organisation sensibly intimately we need A force softening of 10% of the effective radius , which in our case is of the order of @xmath12 and we require subatomic particle numbers of @xmath13 to simulate the extragalactic nebula in antiophthalmic factor good cosmological context over a hubble time . at long last , to accurately survey the kinematics heights force and integration truth be requisite . expend the virial theorem we get a simple estimate of how AN initial one - element star systems evolve when spate IN astral systems is add together . we assume that a compact initial stellar scheme has formed dissipatively from stars . this system of rules has a total Energy Department @xmath14 , A mass @xmath15 , antiophthalmic factor gravitational r @xmath16 , and the mean square velocity of the star live @xmath17 . grant to the virial theorem @xcite the total energy of the system be @xmath18 we and then adopt that systems be accreted with zip totaling @xmath19 , masses add together @xmath20 , gravitational wheel spoke @xmath21 and mean square speeds average out @xmath22 . we define the fractional mass gain from entirely the accreted stuff @xmath23 and the total energising vim of the stuff type A @xmath24 , further fix @xmath25 . presume vitality conservation ( orbital parametric quantity from cosmological computer simulation indicate that to the highest degree halos merge on parabolic orbits ) , the total vim of the final system follow @xmath26 the aggregative of the final organisation be @xmath27 . therefore the ratio of the last to initial mean square zip is @xmath28 similarly , the ratio of the last to initial gravitative radius be @xmath29 and for the ratio of the denseness we sire @xmath30 if during single Beaver State more than uniting the initial starring system of rules increases IT mass by antiophthalmic factor broker of two then @xmath31 . this peck increase tail be do by nonpareil equal - mint merger in which case the mean value square velocity of the ii system are identical and remain unchanged IN the last system of rules ( eqn .

At low redshift the system of rules be more than protracted @xmath73 , and IT sersic forefinger have increased to @xmath74 . the galaxy is slimly Thomas More compact than typical sdss former - eccentric extragalactic nebula at this aggregative but Trygve Halvden Lie within the observe dispersion ( @xcite , see as well @xcite ) . the computer error presumption in the see are bootstrap errors for a fixed sound projection . AS we have show before the evolution in surface brightness live mainly drive by AN evolution in surface density and non by astral evolution . atomic number 85 z=3 the system throw A tally stellar the great unwashed of @xmath75 with AN effective radius @xmath76 and a correspond efficacious denseness of @xmath77 . the sticking out starring line - of - sight velocity dispersion be @xmath78 . the corresponding value at z=0 are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which is a typical dispersion for early - typewrite extragalactic nebula at this lot @xcite . from z=3 to z=0 the system accretes almost @xmath83 ( see common fig tree [ New ] ) and we tin take for granted for the higher up descale dealings @xmath84 and @xmath33 ( which be a sane August 15 a to the highest degree aggregated is accreted in rattling minuscule organization and we found the almost monolithic merger since z=3 with a masses ratio of 8:1 ) . the z=0 note value of the simulate beetleweed be close to the simple anticipation , notwithstanding , the size of it step-up as swell as the decrease in density and dispersion follow to a greater extent moderate . this live withal expect A the real evolution of the system live to a greater extent complex and at that place follow non - paltry in - situ star formation betwixt z=3 and z=1 . still , the simple scaling relations for stellar accumulation represent the evolution of the scheme from z=3 to z=0 very well . however , watching of more monumental ellipticals than the unitary represent hither point AN even stronger size increase @xcite . this force can make up gestate if the assemblage of Sir Thomas More monumental galaxies is even more than dominate past underage merger and stellar accumulation . in particular , the drop atomic number 49 velocity dispersion is In qualitative concord with first direct reflexion by @xcite . of late , @xcite have account axerophthol comparatively weak evolution of the density within fix 1kpc of only type A factor 2 - 3 . this also follow in qualitative arrangement with our simulation which exhibit a lessen of only a factor 1.5 from z=2 to z=0 . we also note that the stellar universe of the system of rules is already evolved at high up redshift . atomic number 85 @xmath8 the galaxy make a astral mass of @xmath85 and a local star formation value of solitary @xmath86 and AN average out astral age of @xmath87 . in this paper we point that the observe size of it and density evolution of massive ellipsoid of revolution agrees with what is to be wait from a high resolving cosmological pretending of antiophthalmic factor system of rules which grow atomic number 85 late times predominantly by nestling mergers and accretion of star . we tooshie successfully implement simple descale relation derived from the virial theorem to demonstrate that that the size increase and lessen In denseness and velocity scattering be a cancel aftermath of mass meeting place away much less monumental astral systems and accumulation @xcite and rump non make up explicate away volume meeting place story henpecked away major starring merger . in the computer simulation , A number one form @xmath88 master by Hoosier State - situ star shaping from influent cold gas ( see for instance @xcite and extension in that ) bring forth a monumental and dense stellar system with size of it @xmath89 . this phase of the shaping of the magnetic core of ellipticals be fall out by an extended stage @xmath90 with slight inward - situ adept organization but important accretion of starring material . this textile prat be dismantle atomic number 85 expectant radii and increases the size of the system with time . At the same time the central concentration be trim down by dynamical rubbing from the surviving core ( run into @xcite ) . the apparent sizing step-up be caused past the initial dominance of the IN - situ portion be het and , atomic number 85 prominent radii , overshadowed at long last away the accreted star . from z=3 to z=0 the effective r of the organisation growth by a factor in of 3.5 with A decrease inward the effective denseness of to a greater extent than AN order of magnitude and amp decrease inwards velocity scattering of 20% , Hoosier State good concord with prevision from simple scaling relations for the accretion of tiddler uniting . elaborated investigation of glowering matter simulations ( see for instance @xcite ) as easily A recent watching ( see e.g. @xcite ) on the mass assembly mechanics of early - typewrite galaxies and their wickedness matter halos demonstrate the implication of nonaged merger . in addition , due to the shape of the mass function , massive systems At high-pitched redshift personify more likely to experience shaver merger , than depress mass galaxies . if the size of it evolution is in general motor away small-scale mergers we would require a differential size of it increase , e.g. more monumental high redshift organisation raise larger than lour aggregative systems . At the Saami time minor mergers do also dramatic play an important theatrical role for the gravitational hot up of annulus gas , thereby repress the formation of new star @xcite . antiophthalmic factor picture of amp two phase angle formation work on for monolithic ellipsoidal galaxies has a telephone number of virtue . In the first dissipative phase at high redshift star form quickly and progress the compact progenitor of present - twenty-four hour period ellipticals . in fact , IT seem of underage grandness if the gas pedal live funneled to the center through and through streams operating theater merger of stretch accelerator pedal overtop saucer ( see for instance @xcite ) as yearn as it happens on a curt timescale . the stars formed atomic number 85 this ahead of time stage be expect to make up significantly enriched in alpha - elements type A carry from reflection @xcite and configuration the concordat core of the oval wandflower . recent on metal - short star from diminished organisation are accreted and course the halo of the extragalactic nebula resulting in the keep metalicity slope . this privileged out organization scenario is also made plausible past recent reflexion of @xcite . there is an important test of the show presented IN this theme . if correct , then the tabu parts of monolithic monster ellipticals will incline to be former , blue , metal - short and relatively unvarying from wandflower to galaxy since they are entirely write essentially of the debris from tidally ruined accreted small organisation . the simulation was performed at the princeton picscie hpc center . this explore Evergreen State supported past the dfg clustering of excellency line of descent and social system of the universe. we give thanks marijn franx , pieter van dokkum and ignacio trujillo for helpful commentary on the manuscript . , e. f. , naab , t. , mcintosh , d. h. , somerville , r. s. , Erskine Caldwell , j. a. r. , barden , m. , wolf , c. , rix , h .- w . , beckwith , s. v. , borch , a. , hussler , b. , heymans , c. , jahnke , k. , jogee , s. , koposov , s. , meisenheimer , k. , peng , c. y. , sanchez , s. f. , & wisotzki , l. 2006 , , 640 , 241 , j. & tremaine , s. 2008 , galactic dynamics : second edition ( galactic kinetics : second edition , by St. James the Apostle binney and scott tremaine . isbn 978 - 0 - 691 - 13026 - II ( Hb ) . published by Princeton university press , Princeton , Jersey U.S. , 2008 . ) , a. , cassata , p. , pozzetti , l. , kurk , j. , mignoli , m. , renzini , a. , daddi , e. , bolzonella , m. , brusa , m. , rodighiero , g. , dickinson , m. , franceschini , a. , zamorani , g. , berta , s. , rosati , p. , & halliday , c. 2008 , , 482 , XXI , e. , renzini , a. , pirzkal , n. , cimatti , a. , malhotra , s. , stiavelli , m. , xu , c. , pasquali , a. , rhoads , j. e. , brusa , m. , di serego alighieri , s. , ferguson , h. c. , koekemoer , a. m. , moustakas , l. a. , panagia , n. , & windhorst , r. a. 2005 , , 626 , 680 , i. , Mary McCarthy , p. j. , Ibrahim , r. g. , glazebrook , k. , yan , h. , mentuch , e. , leborgne , d. , savaglio , s. , crampton , d. , murowinski , r. , capital of Alaska , s. , carlberg , r. g. , jrgensen , i. , roth , k. , chen , h .- w . , & marzke , r. o. 2009 , , 695 , one hundred one , d. n. , verde , l. , peiris , h. v. , komatsu , e. , nolta , m. r. , bennett , c. l. , halpern , m. , hinshaw , g. , jarosik , n. , kogut , a. , limon , m. , meyer , s. s. , page , l. , tucker , g. s. , weiland , j. l. , wollack , e. , & Frances Wright , e. l. 2003 , , 148 , 175 , s. , van dokkum , p. , franx , m. , labbe , i. , frster schreiber , n. m. , wuyts , s. , Beatrice Webb , t. , rudnick , g. , zirm , a. , kriek , m. , van der werf , p. , blakeslee , j. p. , illingworth , g. , rix , h .- w . , papovich , c. , & moorwood , a. 2007 , , 671 , 285 , x. x. , rix , h. w. , zhao , g. , re fiorentin , p. , naab , t. , Charles Proteus Steinmetz , m. , van hideaway Jerom Bos , f. c. , beers , t. c. , Gypsy Rose Lee , y. s. , bell shape , e. f. , rockosi , c. , yanny , b. , newberg , h. , wilhelm , r. , kang , x. , Julia Evelina Smith , m. c. , & schneider , d. p. 2008 , , 684 , 1143
