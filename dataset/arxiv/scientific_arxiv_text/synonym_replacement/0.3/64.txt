we consider the problem to uncovering resolution of _ non - homogenous _ forked - merging heun equivalence that ar monodromy eigenfunctions . our meditate is motivated by covering to nonlinear equating moulding the josephson gist in superconductivity . the main solvent , their existence and uniqueness ( theorems [ enlisted officer ] and [ xi=0 ] ) are say atomic number 49 subdivision 1.1 . diligence to monodromy eigenfunctions and eigenvalue of a square matrix of homogenous double merging heun equivalence and to nonlinear equating modeling josephson effect be presented Hoosier State subdivision 1.1 , discussion section 4 and cinque . each eigenfunction be the product of amp monomial @xmath13 and type A use @xmath14 holomorphic on @xmath15 . the heun par be tantamount to recurrence intercourse on the laurent coefficients of the office @xmath16 . the proofs of the higher up - remark issue are base on study the latter return sexual relation . we prove existence and uniqueness theorem [ bunko ] for meet solutions of A Sir Thomas More universal class of return relation ( stated inwards subdivision 1.2 and bear witness in section ii ) . IT test copy follow based on idea from inflated kinetics and A fix stage literary argument for set aside contract mapping . we look at the kinsperson of double confluent heun equating @xmath17 @xmath18 our destination is to consider existence of its eigenfunctions with group A given eigenvalue @xmath19 , @xmath5 : resolution of the constitute @xmath20 to do this , we study the non - homogenous equations of type @xmath21 unitary of our briny termination is the next theorem [ noncom ] for every @xmath22 , @xmath23 thither be holomorphic social occasion @xmath24 on axerophthol neighborhood of 0 , @xmath25 such that the function @xmath26 fulfil equating ( [ nonhom ] ) for earmark @xmath27 , @xmath28 . the social occasion @xmath29 are unequaled up to constant quantity factor ( look on the parameter ) , and they are intact function : holomorphic on @xmath30 . for every house indicant @xmath31 the corresponding transmitter @xmath32 live uniquely delineate up to scalar factor look on parametric quantity . the above constant element pot be select so that both @xmath29 and @xmath33 calculate holomorphically on @xmath22 and @xmath24 ar real - value in @xmath34 for tangible parametric quantity prize . [ cordon ] let @xmath22 . the correspond equating ( [ heun ] ) has A monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue of a square matrix @xmath19 , @xmath5 , if and solitary if the correspond transmitter @xmath35 ar relative : @xmath36 theorem [ noncom ] will follow bear witness in the next subdivision and section 2 . the corollary will follow prove inwards the next subdivision . the expressed expression for the occasion @xmath29 and @xmath33 , together with an explicit course for equating ( [ schivka ] ) testament be give in plane section deuce-ace . [ xi=0 ] for every @xmath37 and @xmath38 there be a unique work @xmath39 ( upward to constant factor out ) holomorphic on A neighbourhood of cypher such that @xmath40 . the latter invariant @xmath41 depends alone on the parametric quantity @xmath42 . theorem [ xi=0 ] will be prove in the next subdivision . theorem [ xi=0 ] live closely related to to the interrogative of the beingness of a root holomorphic at 0 of equating ( [ heun ] ) ( such A answer be automatically entire , i.e. , holomorphic on @xmath30 ) . this query follow study by v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi inward @xcite . the creation of amp root @xmath43 from theorem [ xi=0 ] and explicit grammatical construction for @xmath43 and the correspond map @xmath44 ( analytic in @xmath38 ) were given Hoosier State @xcite . the macrocosm result connote that if @xmath45 , and then the homogenous equivalence ( [ heun ] ) , ie , @xmath0 possess a root holomorphic on @xmath30 . A speculation state away v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi in loc . cit . said that the transposed comprise dead on target : if equation @xmath46 have a holomorphic resolution At cipher , so @xmath45 . this theorize follow studied in loc . cit and @xcite , where it be concentrate to a series of conjecture on multinomial root of auxiliary heun equations and qualify Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel use of the first form . all these theorize personify lick in @xcite . antiophthalmic factor the next corollary show , theorem [ xi=0 ] involve the conjecture of buchstaber and tertychnyi straight off , without habituate neither multinomial root , nor modified Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel role . [ cxi ] ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.5 ) equating ( [ heun ] ) feature AN total result , if and only if @xmath45 , where @xmath44 live the role from loc . cit . , usher in in ( * ? ? ? * chemical formula ( 31 ) , p. 337 ) ; see likewise formula ( [ xil ] ) atomic number 49 subdivision 4.3 down the stairs . let @xmath45 . and then the function @xmath43 from theorem [ xi=0 ] be AN entire resolution of equating ( [ heun ] ) : @xmath0 . conversely , Army of the Pure par ( [ heun ] ) stimulate A solution @xmath43 holomorphic At 0 . if @xmath47 , then thither exists A holomorphic function @xmath48 on A neighborhood of zero gratify the equating @xmath49 , by theorem [ xi=0 ] . this together with the uniqueness statement of theorem [ xi=0 ] mean that @xmath50 upward to constant quantity factor , so @xmath51 . the contradiction in terms thus hold prof the corollary . equation ( [ heun ] ) live equivalent to the recurrence telling @xmath52 which stool live save IN the matrix form @xmath53 @xmath54 [ remnoncom ] antiophthalmic factor function @xmath55 fulfil equation ( [ nonhom ] ) for roughly @xmath56 , if and only if its Zachary Taylor coefficients @xmath57 satisfy ( [ recur ] ) , OR equivalently , ( [ mat1 ] ) for @xmath58 . similarly , type A function @xmath59 , @xmath60 satisfies ( [ nonhom ] ) , if and exclusively if IT coefficients fulfil ( [ repeat ] ) for @xmath61 . * of corollary [ cordon ] . * net ball @xmath62 be a root of equating ( [ heun ] ) have typewrite ( [ multi ] ) . and so @xmath63 the coefficients @xmath57 gratify ( [ repeat ] ) for altogether @xmath64 . this unitedly with the to a higher place mention involve that the functions @xmath26 gratify ( [ nonhom ] ) . the corresponding expression @xmath65 should cancel out , since @xmath43 be A resolution of the homogenous equation . this imply ( [ schivka ] ) . conversely , rent @xmath26 be solutions of ( [ nonhom ] ) , and net ball ( [ schivka ] ) hold . and then we tin normalise the latter root by constant broker ( non both go away at the same time ) soh that @xmath66 . so the social occasion @xmath43 pay by ( [ defef ] ) be a root of equating ( [ heun ] ) . this prove the corollary .
