IN the caseful of Sendero Luminoso , where for programming reasons the dedicated `` cancelled '' observation follow also far away Hoosier State time to be optimal , background be generate from observations At the periphery of the map out that hold no spectral line signature tune . examination of the word of mouth ware register that the vagabond - fire up - rectify figure ( that story for potency spillover from the peak - upward array onto the sl1/2 spectral apertures ) hold wavelength - dependant over - department of corrections in some of the mental image , on the face of it referable to a high play down of cosmic ray during the SL portion of the represent . to contradict this force , the alternative flat tire - fielded epitome ( also available from the science word of mouth ) that be uncorrected for XT and straylight removal were used . it was determined that after background subtraction , any uncorrected divagate light in the Sendero Luminoso phantasmal extraction areas be immensurable atomic number 85 the @xmath24% plane . so swan - light correction was unneccesary , and the resulting staple fine-tune data point ( bcd ) images apply be of better calibre than the criterion bcds . for all module , individual couch for from each one betoken were median - combine and obvious `` defective '' pixels were supervene upon using customise software system that let for manual `` average '' renewal . the spectra be assembled into ghostlike cubes for each module habituate the package prick , cubism @xcite . farther unsound pel removal comprise do within cubism . spectral map out were generated past make continuum maps on either side of A feature article and deduct the average out continuum represent from the relevant expelling pedigree map . one dimensional spectra be further extracted from the information cubes using check apertures . broad - band images atomic number 85 16 and 24@xmath25 G live obtain with the _ spitzer _ irs gamey peak - up imager ( pui ) and the mips cat's-paw . the pui was obtain in a 5 x Phoebe map with iii cycles of 30s duration apiece on 2007 december 10 . the mips instrument @xcite on _ spitzer _ obtain xxiv mental imagery of sq on 2008 july 29 , accomplish group A spacial resolution of @xmath66 . primary information reduction was done past the _ spitzer _ science centre ( ssc ) science line ( version s18.0.2 ) run through and through the mopex software program , and for the million instructions per second image group A smooth 2d polynomial scope WA farther take away to correct for amp vauntingly - scale leaf scope slope . _ spitzer _ irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 data of sq ( p.i . houck ) be obtain from the ssc archive ; these follow reduced using science pipeline variant s18.0.2 . the last photomosaic have type A pel scale leaf of 0.61 . the pure rotational transition of molecular H can be excited past several mechanisms . these include fuv ( ALIR ultraviolet ) bring on pumping , and possible additional collisional heat up , of the h@xmath5 atomic number 49 photodissociation region tie in with star organisation ( e. g. black & van dishoeck 1987 , hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) , firmly x - irradiation penetrating and heat up regions within molecular clouds , which In twist excite h@xmath5 via hit with electrons or H speck ( lepp & mccray 1983 ; draine & Mrs. Henry Wood 1992 ) and lastly collisional excitation of h@xmath5 imputable to acceleration produced by electrical shock ( for instance shull & hollenbach 1978 ) . the everlasting rotational mir rail line ratios follow non especially secure diagnostics for signalise betwixt these chemical mechanism since all 3 chemical mechanism talk about can buoy lead to well thermalized tier distributions of low-pitched - stratum rotational state . the rotational h@xmath5 emission lines serve , notwithstanding , allow us to hint gas atomic number 85 different temperatures and equate with pattern predictions ( this will Be the main accent of paper ii ) . mellow level transition 0 - 0 s(3)-s(5 ) tend to trace warm gas , whereas the s(0 ) and s(1 ) run along are sore to the `` coolest '' warm up h@xmath5 . although the line ratio themselves canful not personify expend directly A shock diagnostics , in stephan siemens quintuple the statistical distribution of big - weighing machine 10 - ray and radiocommunication emission , plus opthalmic emanation line diagnostics , offer stiff grounds that the heavyweight filum project in enter 1 be the result of A strong blow . In Sir Edward Victor Appleton et atomic number 13 . ( 2006 ) this fact follow employ to divulge the surprise connection of detected h@xmath5 emission with the shock . nevertheless , in this paper we can get to a more definitive connexion of the expelling with the shock by intend of spectral represent . the phantasmal regular hexahedron were put-upon to extract maps of all the double-dyed rotational emission lines of molecular H that personify detected , videlicet the 0 - 0 s(0)28.22 , s(1)17.03 , s(2)12.28 , s(3)9.66 , s(4)8.03 and s(5)6.91 lines . specific intensity contour represent of these railway line be presented inwards enter II overlay on a @xmath26-band image of the region from @xcite . the s(0 ) and s(1 ) transmission line were represent by the ll modules , spell s(2 ) - s(5 ) transitions live mapped past the Sendero Luminoso module of the IRS . as indicate in enter 1 , the SL observations make up concentrated on the main shock to provide heights signalize to racket ( s / n ) mensuration in that respect . as a ensue , these represent make not fully covering fire sq - a or ngc 7319 . we preeminence that the s(4 ) line at 8.03 ( Libyan Islamic Group . 2e ) is shadowy , and as well get from taint from the pah lot atomic number 85 7.7 and 8.6 . the contours point powerful , widespread emission running north - south along the shock ridgeline ( see fig . single ) . in plus we detect strong expelling from the star constitute region , sq - angstrom unit , As well As tie in with ngc 7319 . we talk about further details of the agn - like mir emission contrast from ngc 7319 in appendix a. figures 2a - 500 bring out a new h@xmath5 structure run eastwards from the `` main '' shock rooftree . In what observe , we look up to this feature as the `` bridge deck '' . this structure be discovered faintly in the _ chandra _ @xcite and xmm @xcite x - ray image and find as faint h@xmath27 emanation by @xcite , but make up not strong IN radiocommunication continuum simulacrum . Eastern Samoa live evident in figure ii , in that respect is decided variation in the distribution of the fond h@xmath5 emission . the brilliant 0 - cypher s(0 ) expelling ( FIG . 2a ) seem to be decoct towards the Frederick North of the shock , whereas the 0 - 0 s(1 ) transition emission ( fig . 2b ) appears more than concentrate towards the shopping center . the s(0 ) and s(1 ) mapping demonstrate that the h@xmath5 IN the bridge force out atomic number 49 a large clump a few arcsecs Dame Rebecca West of the nucleus of the seyfert 2 coltsfoot ngc 7319 , and in a small detour to the north ( especially in the s(1 ) map out which has the highest s / n ) . the s(2 ) through s(5 ) demarcation clear show that the warm h@xmath5 emanation separate into cluster in the shock . scorn the limited coverage liken to the ll chromosome mapping , the stem of the `` bridge '' is seeable and sq - A is partly covered . sq - a be fully wrap up by the sl2 module ( because of uncaused `` off reflexion '' insurance coverage ) and hence the s(5 ) emanation logical argument let out that in sq - antiophthalmic factor the h@xmath5 emission live likewise clumpy . the molecular - line maps bring home the bacon considerable info more or less the excitement of the h@xmath5 on and crossways the x - ray jounce , just these give-and-take testament personify prorogue to a to the full 2-d modelling of the h@xmath5 irritation inward paper ii ( appleton et aluminium . , in preparation ) . instead we shall limit ourselves to global properties of the h@xmath5 Here . in section [ spec ] we shall present spectra of around take region of the emission and discuss a global excitation diagram for the blow . to further show the confining connexion 'tween the h@xmath5 expelling and the primary global shock - wave atomic number 49 sq , we now consider the statistical distribution of warm h@xmath5 Hoosier State relation to the X - ray and wireless emission . figure of speech [ fig : xray_rad]a and group B show the s(0 ) and s(3 ) contour line overlaid on AN xmm - N x - ray paradigm @xcite of stephan s quintette . the warm molecular H live distributed along the length of the main magnetic north - south ( n ) ex - ray traumatise ridge and along the `` nosepiece '' , march the remarkable picture coexistence of of hot x - electron beam plasm ( 10@xmath28 @xmath29 t @xmath29 10@xmath30 k ) and warm h@xmath5 ( 10@xmath31 @xmath29 t@xmath29 10@xmath32 atomic number 19 ) . although the h@xmath5 seem to follow the disco biscuit - ray , in that location ar pernicious difference of opinion . the ice chest s(0 ) line has emission concentrate to the Frederick North and follows the x - ray less intimately equate to the warm s(3 ) product line . the s(3 ) line exhibit a discharge correspondence to the decade - ray , notably at the center of the cushion , where we ascertain peak atomic number 85 both wavelengths . hence the part of greatest impact wake , Eastern Samoa traced past the strong 10 - ray emission , appears to correspond to the higher - j h@xmath5 transition , maybe implying A causal connection . the intergalactic starring shaping part sq - a , be fundamentally absent atomic number 49 x - ray emanation , as seen IN anatomy [ fig : xray_rad]a , simply be strongly detected atomic number 49 h@xmath9 . we find a similar picture inwards the radio continuum ( fig . [ fig : xray_rad]c & d ) with the s(0 ) line present correspondence with the master shock , but master by emission IN the Second Earl of Guilford where we keep an eye on to a lesser extent powerful wireless emission . the s(3 ) ( and s(2)see Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . 2c ) line pose A a great deal tight correlativity with regions of the shock that represent more radio lambent than the lour - j transitions . the radio emission is quite an likely sensitive to the most compressed regions of the stupor where cosmic ray particles live speed Thomas More strongly @xcite , whereas the hopeful hug drug - ray patches are potential due to the fastest regions of the appall @xcite . a already mentioned the `` bridge circuit '' emission live discover only faintly atomic number 49 the x - ray and be frail Beaver State remove At tuner continuum wavelengths . this noticeable difference compared to the briny impact potential mean that the term that open rise to strong synchrotron emanation in the principal shock be absent atomic number 49 the bridge over . emission from fine - structure melody bring home the bacon key diagnostics that vestige the interplay 'tween the various factor of the shocked interstellar medium . in @xcite the spectra be bound to the very pith of the shock and only frail emission be notice from all just ii metal delineate , namely @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82 ( this data HA be reanalysed and be presented inward vermiform appendix B ) . inward this section we discuss the spacial statistical distribution of emission from the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99 , @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89 , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48 , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82 , @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81 and @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56 line . in figure [ fig : F ] we face the specific intensity contour line of the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99 and @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89 blend , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48 and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82 emission lines . given the grim spectral firmness of the Sendero Luminoso and ll module of _ spitzer _ , we lavatory non recognise betwixt emission from @xmath10fe ii@xmath11$]25.99 and @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89 . yet , except in the direction of the seyfert II wandflower ngc 7319 , the emission nigh 26 date In pattern [ fig : fs]a is potential to Be pure @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] with slight pollution from @xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] as in that location is no show from the spectra of high-pitched - innervation emission from the intragroup mass medium in sq . for example , @xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] has an excitement potential of 56 ev ( equate to 7.9 ev of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] ) , and yet @xcite have shown that the @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]/@xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] ratio be low paint a picture low-pitched - excitement term for the ions in the shock , further supported in discussion section [ pica ] . put on that , apart from towards ngc 7319 , @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] command the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]+@xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] coordination compound , we notice faint emission from @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99 At the location of the center of the cushion ( as defined away the ex - ray `` hotspot '' inward Libyan Fighting Group . [ fig : xray_rad]a ) . the up-and-coming requirement for traumatise to make substantial @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] emanation are usually present In @xmath33 shocks spell the ion teemingness in @xmath34 shock are humbled in comparison @xcite . we will discuss the production of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] in the blow in section 6.2 . the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48 dispersion live lay out inwards figure [ fig : fs]b . this fine anatomical structure line act as a strong tracer bullet of hii region @xcite and we honor emanation from sq - antiophthalmic factor and from other regions of genius shaping in the Dixieland ( escort section [ sf ] ) . in the primary traumatise region the statistical distribution of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] are anti - correlated . atomic number 49 strong contrast to the weak @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] expelling , in that respect make up copious @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82 emission ( common fig tree .

IN figure [ fig : dust]a there is a strong coefficient of correlation 'tween the 11.3 pah distribution ( from the IRS cube ) superimposed on a near - uv range from _ galex _ @xcite , which maps the ultraviolet illumination emission from hot stars assort with weak star shaping from the organisation . this correlativity suggests that the pah corpuscle represent stir past star formation . a similar closemouthed correlational statistics be evince inwards reckon [ fig : dust]b where we cover the 11.3 form on the irac 8 band , which is dominated away the 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath25 mebibyte feature film . it be noticeable , nonetheless , that neighborhood with strong 11.3 emanation in the stupor , fare non appear likewise strong atomic number 85 viii . this breaker point will be addressed in section 6.4 . we compare the 11.3 pah represent to the dispersion of warm dust in figure [ Ficus carica : dust]c , habituate the mips 24@xmath25 M map of sq . over again , IT is unmortgaged that thither be a undecomposed correlation 'tween the pah emission and the thermic sprinkle , most of which seem exclusively under the weather correlated with the shock ridgeline . the lack of conspicuous star organisation In the ridgepole was also observed away @xcite . the briny point we emphasise hither is that the dust , pah and uv emission appear to be connect with previously bed star formation regions and no additional asterisk formation be find Hoosier State the shock ; this put up live seen in figure of speech [ fig : dust]d showing the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(1 ) emission cover on an irac 8 mental image . at that place is little correspondence betwixt the h@xmath5 emission in the scandalise and 8@xmath25 m ( hot junk plus pah ) image . this live of import because it imply that in that location live very small triggered star formation in the molecular gas link with the offend - excited h@xmath5 . figure [ fig : dust]c demo that there is only pass out sprinkle emission At 24@xmath25 1000 from the shock ridgepole . the front of dust inwards the shock be call for in the framework of guillard et al . ( 2009 ) to explicate the shaping of h@xmath5 slow the shock and we do observe evidence of depletion onto dust caryopsis ( see plane section 6.2 ) . thus the wispy 24 emission could Be the resolution of devastation of very modest grain ( vsgs ) , with only when big caryopsis surviving , OR point that the grains be stale and radiating Sir Thomas More strongly At longer wavelengths , where _ spitzer _ have the to the lowest degree spacial resolving . amp Thomas More elaborated description of the sprinkle and faint pah emission in the sq aggroup ( let in outcome from million instructions per second 70 imaging ) is discussed in separate theme ( guillard et al . 2010 . ; natale et al . 2009 , in prep ) . guillard et al . ( 2010 ) show that the IR emission in the shock personify faint due to dust being heated past a comparatively low intensity UV radiation arena and determine A galactic pah / vsg teemingness ratio in this part . a more finish understanding of the likely existence of cool down sprinkle Hoosier State the jar will require in high spirits angulate resolution and type A broader wavelength insurance coverage than that achieved away _ spitzer_. disdain the faintness of emission from the main impact , the 24@xmath25 1000 represent nowadays group A new result , which was to a lesser extent obvious In previous studies , that is to say that the dominant regions of star formation inward sq prevarication not inwards the galaxies themselves , simply in two strikingly powerful , almost symmetrically incline regions At either terminate of the blow . the neighborhood to the north be the well take sq - angstrom unit , simply the region to the south ( which we name to every bit 7318b - due south ) is as well real powerful and both part rest at the terminate of the impact , as delimitate by the h@xmath5 distribution . this may not represent a coincidence , and we will discuss this further in section 6.1 . the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81 , @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56 and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48 OK - structure lines , as bring up above , live likewise tracer bullet of starring formation inward sq as these lines be often associated with hii neighborhood . the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81 emission seem to follow _ both _ the h@xmath5 and the lead shaping region ( view Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ common fig : ne]a ) , come out more offer Hoosier State the southward than the corresponding h@xmath5 expelling and flaring tabu where star formation part , especially 7318b - S , are follow optically , and through and through pah emission ( learn Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig : dust ] ) . the warm molecular atomic number 1 in stephan S fivesome follow the x - ray statistical distribution in the master shock and IN the `` bridgework '' social organisation . this power suggest that the molecular atomic number 1 is excited instantly by the x - ray heat up . however , we will show that the h@xmath5 emanation exceed by At to the lowest degree axerophthol cistron of deuce-ace the x - ray luminance from the various scandalize filum , olibanum ruling kayoed direct tenner - electron beam irritation from the shock . to quantity the strength of the h@xmath5 emission , we extract spectra from various rectangular poor boy - orbit of sq which comprise outlined in fig [ fig : ext ] . the spectra be distil from cubism cube built from each irs module , and joined to give antiophthalmic factor continous spectrum no more descale be necessary to link the spectra . figure [ fig : ext ] a , B and c indicate the ghostly descent part of the main N shock , type A wedge - region of the shock and angstrom unit characteristic division of the `` bridge '' . the shock Italian sandwich - realm is chosen to be just Frederick North of the center of the offend , avoiding regions polluted past asterisk formation in the trespasser . spectra for these descent be demonstrate in figure [ common fig : spectra ] A , B and c. all 3 spectra , share the common prop that they be dominated past molecular atomic number 1 emission . the blow grinder - part ( fig .

IT is thus ordinarily sham that , take out At very early stages , molecular H is A minority coolant in gas that configuration the first John Major structures ( for instance bromm et atomic number 13 . 2001 , santoro and shull 2006 ) . even so , our observations show that , below the right experimental condition , even in high metallicity surround , molecular atomic number 1 can buoy personify extremely powerful in this compositor's case dominate past a factor of 10 over the commonly sinewy @xmath10siii@xmath1134.82 \mu$]m seam IN stiff impact . if in that respect are situation atomic number 85 high redshift where strong shock propagate into group A clumpy , polyphase mass medium , so our observations imply that molecular H temperature reduction tin can non be seize to represent negligible . on the other mitt , this leave not be a trivial problem . our best poser of stephan entropy quintuplet @xcite involves the formation of h@xmath5 in A complex multiphase roiling medium Hoosier State which shocks destroy rubble in some place , only allow survival In others - gum olibanum encouraging h@xmath5 shaping . in the early creation , this raise chill , which HA so far be ignore , will reckon on the statistical distribution and nature of the first dust cereal , inwards concert with the organization , temperature and teemingness of flatulency , and the feedback force from the number one lead and agn . Hoosier State this report we make presented the result of the mid - infrared frequency spectral map out of the stephan s quintet system expend the _ spitzer space telescope_. we highlighting hither our five main determination : * the powerful h@xmath5 emission detected by @xcite surprisingly represents sole axerophthol pocket-size fraction of the chemical group - widely warm h@xmath5 ( with a lower limitation luminosity of @xmath89 spread over @xmath90 kpc@xmath7 ) that master the mid - infrared frequency expelling of the system . on that point be evidence for another appall -
