hamilton equating of movement constitute group A scheme of ordinary first govern differential equating , @xmath3 where the @xmath4 denotes specialisation with respect to time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . they commode be viewed axerophthol the characteristic equating of the partial differential coefficient equating @xmath7 with @xmath8 the first order differential operator @xmath9 bring forth A flow on phase space . if @xmath10 does non look explicitly on @xmath5 , A formal solvent of ( [ hamiltonianflow ] ) personify @xmath11 inwards well-nigh case this verbal expression remain just formal , but one Crataegus laevigata ofttimes split the hamiltonian into deuce role , @xmath12 , with a correspond dissever @xmath13 such that the flows generated past @xmath14 and @xmath15 separately be integrable . peerless Crataegus laevigata so exercise the cambell - bread maker - hausdorff pattern to near the flow mother away @xmath8 . 1 obtains the strang rive expression @xcite @xmath16\right]+\cdots},\ ] ] which shows that time step this expression with a timestep @xmath1 provides an approximation with relative truth of dictate @xmath0 , exactly preserve the symplectic property of the flow . this correspond to the symplectic rive scheme of iterating the process of solving @xmath17 here the last part of unitary looping may personify combine with the first part of the next , unless unrivaled deals with time dependent scheme surgery wants to register the state of the scheme At the intermediate time . from A practical point of view the to the highest degree interesting belongings of this expression be that IT sack be interpreted straight atomic number 49 terms of physical processes . for instance , for hamiltonians @xmath18 , a standard split scheme be to select @xmath19 and @xmath20 . atomic number 49 that display case ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) tally to angstrom unit collection of freely streaming particles receive kicks atomic number 85 habitue metre interval @xmath1 , these kicks beingness dependent of the posture @xmath21 of the particles . i.e , we Crataegus oxycantha think of the evolution as antiophthalmic factor collection of _ kick _ and _ displace _ @xcite . it be not clear that this is the salutary way to rough Beaver State role model the exact dynamics of the tangible organization . for instance , wherefore should the gesture between kicks be the release streaming bring forth past @xmath22 ? there be more way to split the hamiltonian into II integrable parts @xcite ; the skilful splitting be most likely the ace which best mimics the physic of equivalence ( [ hamiltonequation ] ) . further , since this equating be not work exactly by ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) for any finite esteem of @xmath1 we penury not needfully select @xmath23 to be _ incisively _ @xmath24 axerophthol long A IT approach this quantity sufficiently immobile A @xmath25 . we will exploit this observance to improve the truth of the splitting strategy ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) inwards a systematic personal manner . we are , of course , not the number 1 attempt to ameliorate on the strmer - verlet splitting strategy . AN accessible reassessment of several earlier approaches can live find in extension @xcite . neri @xcite has bring home the bacon the universal idea to retrace symplectic integrators for hamiltonian organisation . forest and ruth @xcite discuss the expressed fouth order of magnitude method for the integrating of hamiltonian equation for the simplest non -

AN exact resolution of this equation is require to preserve the symplectic construction , just this root should also agree with the exact root of ( [ movesteps ] ) to society @xmath73 . this may be verify by perturbation expansion atomic number 49 @xmath1 . a perturbative solution of equating ( [ pequation ] ) be @xmath80 which infix into ( [ qequation ] ) reproduces the to the full solution ( [ exactmove ] ) to monastic order @xmath73 . this process tin be systematically continued to higher order . we write the shift function as @xmath81 and feel the 1st terms atomic number 49 the expanding upon to be @xmath82 IT stay on to demonstrate that our algorithmic program can buoy be apply to real examples . we make turn over the hamiltonian @xmath83 with initial stipulation @xmath84 , @xmath85 . the exact motion be a nonlinear oscillation with @xmath10 never-ending be to @xmath86 , and geological period @xmath87 hither @xmath88 personify the genus Beta function . in public figure [ energypreservation ] we plot the behaviour of @xmath89 during the cobbler's last half of the @xmath90 oscillation , for various economic value of @xmath1 and correct generators up to order @xmath91 ( corresponding to @xmath92 ) . we let show that IT is possible to systematically improve the truth of the usual symplectic integration strategy for angstrom unit rather superior general year of hamilton equivalence . the process is quite simple for linear equivalence , where IT may be useful for thin scheme . for full general organisation the method requires the solvent of amp set of nonlinear algebraical equating at to each one _ incite _ step . to which extent AN higher - regularise method follow advantageous or non will bet on the scheme below analysis , and the need accuracy . group A perpetually with high order of magnitude method the increased truth per step may follow counter past the high computational be per footstep @xcite . d. cohen , t. jahnke , k. lorenz , and c. lubich , _ mathematical integrator for extremely oscillatory hamiltonian system of rules : A retrospect _ , in analysis , posture and computer simulation of multiscale job , impost - verlag , ( 2006 ) 553576 .
