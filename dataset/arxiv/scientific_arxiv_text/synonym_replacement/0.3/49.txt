the variance of ex lup comprise discovered past escape e. janssen inwards 1944 piece examining ghostlike crustal plate At the harvard observation tower ( mclaughlin 1946 ) . herbig ( 1950 ) first level stunned the similarity of ex lupi s spectral characteristic and t tauri star with substantial expelling assembly line of h , caii , feii , and hei . IN unmatchable of the spectrograms he hold atomic number 49 1949/1950 the H and caii line clearly show an inverse p cygni profile . herbig ( 1977a ) assign the ghostly typewrite of m0:ev using the 5850 - 6700 mountain range . photographic and visual light - curve cover up amp century of observance bring out the irregular photometric deportment of the asterisk ( mclaughlin 1946 , bateson et Camellia State . ebullition of upwardly to 5 magnitude may come , just the star normally establish only small amplitude irregular variance . the to the highest degree prominent events endure astir unitary year . the typical return time scale of tumultuous disturbance be of the ordination of a decade . + up to now thither are only A few other principal cognize with like tumultuous disturbance characteristics ( herbig 1989 ) . this small grouping of really fighting T tauri stars have been prognosticate exors or sometimes stand in - fuors . both make point to an phylogenetic relation to the so called fu orionis star ( fuors ) . fuors are another group of young depression mass star with even stronger tumultuous disturbance endure for tenner . different exors , during an outburst fuor spectra crook from T tauri characteristic to that of lots earlier f or G supergiants lack strong line emanation ( herbig 1977b ) . fuors have richly hoi polloi accumulation rat ( @xmath0,hartmann 1991 ) and strong wind ( e.g. calvet et Heart of Dixie . 1993 ) and they English hawthorn live the source that get herbig - haro fall ( reipurth 1989 ) . + exors are small read , simply potentially of great interest because they may represent AN medium story of activity betwixt ordinary dynamic thyroxin tauri star and wide-cut blown fu orionis eruption . in rules of order to roll farther light on this reading , we take followed or so exors spectroscopically and photometrically during 1993 and 1994 . the star ex lup feature follow atomic number 85 A low-spirited unwavering of activity during the 1980 S . atomic number 49 the other 1990 atomic number 16 this situation shift and the star turn active ( jones et atomic number 13 . 1993 , Howard Hughes et atomic number 13 . amateur observance ( variable stellar section of the majestic astronomical society of New Sjaelland , unpublished ) indicate type A strong clear in Feb / march 1994 . patten ( 1994 ) account some fall out -

outburst spectra in the Saame wavelength region atomic number 85 declaration of 1.5 and 12 At the 3.5m - ntt with emmi atomic number 49 grand 1994 . completely spectra feature be reduced with the ctioslit software program inward iraf . observations of spectrophotometric monetary standard and every night extinction trend let for a flux standardisation . + in fig.3 we exhibit deuce spectra of ex lup : one close to the outburst level best and the former at low-toned activity almost half amp yr after the extravasation . some of the emission lines of h , caii , feii , hei , and heii be indicate . under the supposition that the total light potty be decomposed into AN underlying t tauri star photosphere , A continuum source , and superimposed emission run along , we right away discuss the dissimilar spectral components and their variability . a powerful method to mold the continuum excess emission personify to determine the veiling by comparison with spectra of asterisk of the Saami spectral typecast and light year but wanting whatever disc signature ( hartigan et al . 1989 , 1991 ) . the truth of the veiling purpose decrement rapidly when the emission element transcend the photospheric luminance . in the example of ex lup during IT extravasation we therefore did not destine to derive the blot out and the avowedly inordinateness emanation spectrum past comparison with spectral type monetary standard , only we could examine the spectral variability caused by the tumultuous disturbance . + no more photospheric absorption feature film be seen during the outburst ( upper spectrum in fig.3 ) but they seem inwards the spot - burst spectrum . thus the major root of variability presumptively make up A featureless continuum . therefore , a departure spectrum betwixt burst and station - gush spectra should follow a good step of the continuum emanation spectrum . in fig . quaternary we secret plan II difference spectra atomic number 85 low-pitched resolution . the first show the difference 'tween an tumultuous disturbance ( march 3 ) and a post - flare-up ( august XVI ) spectrum , while the second show the difference betwixt two send - tumultuous disturbance ( venerable 18 and 16 ) spectra which show normal low - level variability . the continuum emission spectrum display the formula low - level activity is profane than the continuum expelling present during blowup . the most connive features in the spectra of ex lup are inviolable emission subscriber line . the balmer serial publication privy comprise seen up to h15 especially during time of minimum activity . combining weight breadth and fluxes of case-by-case lines personify give in defer unity . essentially totally strong emission lines feature increasing fluxes As the star lighten . nonetheless imputable to the steep ascend of the continuum the equivalent widths decrease , which is too observable inwards the data from patten ( 1994 ) at h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , and h@xmath5 during the maximum . evidently the caii line throw antiophthalmic factor magnanimous flux amplification during the ebullition than the balmer lines . at that place follow some indication that line fluxion of metal doh non increment spell the star goes into blowup ( cai , feii , srii ) . + lrrrr & & & & + identification & w@xmath6 & w@xmath7 & flux@xmath8 & flux@xmath9 + & & & @xmath10 & @xmath10 + & & & & + & & & & + h11 3771 & -1.0 & -4.2 & 16 & 6 + h10 3798 & -1.5 & -7.0 & XXV & 9 + h Nina from Carolina 3835 & -1.2 & -12.1 & 20 & 16 + h octet 3889 & -2.7 & -13.0 & 44 & 18 + sii 3906 & -0.2 & -0.8 & 3 & 1 + caii 3934 & -7.7 & -12.0 & 123 & xv + .comparison of selected emission blood atomic number 85 dissimilar even of activity . equivalent breadth and line magnetic flux during the tumultuous disturbance measure out on march 3 ( @xmath8 ) and In the post -

At balmer lines in high spirits than h9 the tantamount breadth of the redshifted absorption dip is level enceinte than the breadth of the emission constituent . comparing the sequence of spectra between march triad and half a dozen we hindquarters control A substantive fleet of the absorption . the mean velocity displacement reaction of the soaking up mensurate in these spectra live @xmath12 km / southward . this soaking up component part follow stillness seeable in our spectrum hold on venerable xviii ( fig.5a ) . we likewise plot the difference 'tween the II spectra from lordly 18 and august 16 to heighten the visibleness of the absorption dip and to remove possible pollution due to photospheric lines . the displacement of the soaking up cutpurse measured IN the billet - outburst difference spectrum correspond to angstrom unit velocity of @xmath13 km / s . photospheric feature of the rudimentary T tauri star tin be find out only if In the send - outburst spectra . figure 6 shows the region around cai 4227 , which be the strong stellar soaking up melodic phrase , in 2 station - tumultuous disturbance spectra . the difference of these ii spectra no more tenacious demo the absorption line , and the modification of total flux by around 40% be therefore due to continuum emission rather than photospheric variability . + the photospheric line of the T tauri star be hide , yet At minimum smartness . the superimposed emission short letter spectrum to boot replete in many soaking up line . the measurement of the veiling follow therefore kinda hard . we find a upright fit to the observed enduringness of absorption line past bring out A flat continuum emission rival to the photospheric continuum of the underlying star ( veiling r=1 , comparison with hd 202560 , ghostlike type m0v ) atomic number 85 4200 when the smartness of ex lup make up v=13.0 . the tumultuous disturbance of ex lup canful be realize in terms of a people accumulation case causation increased continuum emission in angstrom unit hot neighborhood close to the surface of the star where the infalling matter in conclusion loose its kinetic vim . the total light of the photosphere and the red-hot realm turn overlook away the latter and therefore it be much down in the mouth during the flare-up . what is more totally photospheric line follow intemperately obliterate ( take over that r=1 At minimum spark and then the veiling during outburst would be r@xmath1420 ) . the different slope of the continuum emission in the tumultuous disturbance equate to the Emily Price Post - tumultuous disturbance ( regard fig.4 ) indicates that the red-hot part is _ cooler _ during tumultuous disturbance ( seize atomic number 102 change in extermination due to circumstellar matter ) . this interpretation and so imply a dramatic expansion of the spicy region In enjoin to business relationship for the notice ascent inward brightness level during the outburst . + the opposite P cygni profiles of many emission lines bear witness the infall movement of accreted stuff . the velocity derived from the redward displacement of the absorption ingredient of these assembly line are of the range of 300 kilometre / sulphur and therefore practically high-pitched than those usurp in the classical boundary layer simulate for t tauri stars ( lynden - bell & pringle , 1974 ) . notwithstanding , these high infall velocity Crataegus laevigata result from magnetospherically arbitrate disk accumulation ( camenzind 1990 , knigl 1991 , hartmann et aluminium . high resolution hit the books of Hellenic T tauri stars have unveil A great fraction of stars exhibiting reverse p cygni structures ( e.g. appenzeller 1977 , Jonathan Edwards et Heart of Dixie . , 1994 ) . the usual low level variability power glucinium make by geometrical effect during the rotation of the star . the more spectacular outbursts could be ascribe to occasional change atomic number 49 the magnetosphere , ensue in to a greater extent continue infall feed of circumstellar textile onto the star . + _ acknowledgement : _ we give thanks g.herbig for alerting us to the gush of old-fashioned lup in former march 1994 . also we comprise thankful to the come after commentator for kindly provide start of their observing time : t.abbott , j.f.claeskens , d.de winter , c.flynn , h.jerjen , a.manchado , f.patat , n.robichon , p.stein .
