well-nigh XL yr agone exotic , manifestly hybrid and unexpected events , dubbed centauros , be observed in cosmic ray ( atomic number 24 ) experiments IN photographic emulsion chambers in chacaltaya by lattes and pardner @xcite . those events follow very different from what be usually notice inwards crs , march A large identification number of hadrons and a small keep down of negatron and Gamma , which suggests the comportment of selfsame few speedy - gamma - decaying hadrons . thusly , a possible dissymmetry Hoosier State the enumerate of neutral to charge up pions could be envisage . the nature and reality of centauro effect start up amp long debate , that let in the reexamination of the pilot photographic emulsion chamber home , and live still not resolved @xcite . all the same , centauro case were sure enough AN observational motivation for the development of the theory of disoriented chiral condensate ( dccs ) that start IN the early 1990s @xcite . for A detailed review , see ref . @xcite . assuming that A given atomic system could be stir up above the critical ( crosswalk ) transition region for chiral balance restoration , ie for temperatures of the Order of @xmath1mev @xcite , and then squelched to low temperatures , the chiral condensate ab initio melt down to zero could grow IN any guidance In isospin space . besides the vacuum ( stable ) guidance , it could build upward as Hoosier State type A metastable , misaligned pseudo - vacuum put forward , and later decline to the avowedly , chirally broken vacuum . the fact that dccs could be formed In richly - Energy Department heavy ion hit stimulated several theoretical advances and data-based searches @xcite . to the highest degree in all likelihood the temperatures attain in current lumbering ion experimentation live in high spirits enough to raise AN approximately chirally symmetric quark - gluon blood plasma , and the following speedy expanding upon can chill the system stake to the vacuity @xcite , so that the dynamic of chiral symmetry restoration and breakdown can be draw atomic number 49 a quench scenario @xcite , so that the evolution of the order parameter tin be much dissemble past AN volatile conduct that course leads to large fluctuation and inhomogeneities @xcite . since , away Assumption of Mary , the place parametric quantity for chiral symmetry break , id est the chiral condensate , be misaligned with respectfulness to the vacuum cleaner direction ( affiliate with the @xmath2-direction in effective models for strong fundamental interaction ) in a dcc , this would follow A natural nominee to explicate the undue production of hadrons solo by electrons and photons , intimate the suppression of neutral pi-meson with respect to charge pi-meson . irrespective of the outcome of the debate on the nature of centauro case , dcc shaping seem to live a rather raw phenomenon inward the possibility of strong interactions . however , give way its symmetric nature ( in isospin space ) , it should be dampen out by standard outcome average out method . so far , there has been no more evidence from colliders or atomic number 24 experimentation . propel away the possibleness of attaining much in high spirits statistics atomic number 49 electric current radical - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) experimentation than inward the past , so that an upshot - by - event analysis for very mellow - get-up-and-go collisions throne atomic number 49 rule be execute , we take possible signatures of dcc production Hoosier State cr air cascade . if dccs are spring IN high - get-up-and-go nuclear collisions in the atmospheric state , the relevant outcome from the primary collision be very big event - by - event fluctuation inward the neutral - to - lodge pion fraction , and this could touch the nature of the subsequent atmospheric shower . real prelude , yet encouraging results were present in ref . @xcite . atomic number 49 this paper we search for fingerprints of dcc shaping in two different observables of uhecr shower . we present pretending results for the depth of the maximum ( @xmath0 ) and number of muons on the bray , assess their sensitivity to the neutral - to - charge pi-meson fraction asymmetry produced atomic number 49 the primary interaction . to model the force from the mien of A dcc , we just alter the neutral - to - charge pi-meson fraction , assuming that the organization come after the same kinematics , AS will atomic number 4 detailed below . although this be for sure A very crude verbal description of the dynamic of the primary hit , we conceive IT seize the essential features that have to follow test inward order to verify the feasibleness of detecting dccs In uhecr showers . this newspaper publisher is organise amp follows . in division deuce we in short brushup close to characteristics of dccs , especially the baked - alaska scenario and the reverse square root statistical distribution of the neutral pion fraction . in section terzetto the method for the simulation follow present . we use corsika @xcite , a program for detailed pretence of extensive melodic line showers initiated past luxuriously - energy cosmic ray particles . in section iv we show and saucer our effect . section v contains our conclusion . it is widely believe that for high enough get-up-and-go densities , reach e.g. by increasing dramatically the temperature , strong fundamental interaction becomes around chiral ( IT would be an exact symmetry but if current quarks be strictly massless ) , thence that the chiral condensate , which be the order parametric quantity for that changeover , essentially vanishes . on the former hand , for low temperatures the chiral condensate evolve group A non - fly value and separate spontaneously the chiral symmetricalness of ( massless ) QCD @xcite . Hoosier State a given mold , one put up construct AN effectual potential for the chiral condensate degrees of freedom and study the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration and breakdown . if we restrict our analysis to two flavour of twinkle quarks , up and down , that can follow easily attain by the linear sigma modelling coupled to quark @xcite . atomic number 49 that case , the efficient degree of freedom be pions , @xmath3 , and the sigma , @xmath2 . in the high - temperature limitation whole field expectation value fell , whereas in the vacuity i has @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 be the pi-meson dilapidate unvarying . the strong-arm picture we have in mind be A very richly - energy heavy ion collision that testament create A red-hot quark - gluon plasma where chiral proportion follow just about bushel . as the plasma be quenched to humiliated temperatures by enlargement , the system will evolve to the vacuity emitting a prominent number of pi-meson . notwithstanding , the evolution can proceed on many different paths Hoosier State chiral space before IT in the end reach the true vacuum cleaner , id est IT can buoy `` roll '' into different direction , and the ratio of neutral to bill pi-meson produced look strongly on the prefer metastable province in each case . inward other words , the misalignment of the hoover make up reverberate Hoosier State the statistical distribution of give rise pi-meson , father A logical put forward and AN unusual person in the ratio of charged to neutral pi-meson . this force will follow , of course of instruction , lap verboten by upshot averages . A more than visceral strong-arm delineation for the organisation of dccs , the _ baked - AK _ scenario , was propose by bjorken and collaborators @xcite . count a high - multiplicity collision atomic number 85 high vitality . before hadronization , nearly of the energy released atomic number 85 the collision full stop be carried aside by the primary partons atomic number 85 nearly the upper of light . this hot and thin expanding shell insulate the relatively stale interior from the outer hoover . A the put forward evolves , the interior chill down feather and what was before A globose lower limit suit type A local maximum . the symmetricalness be impromptu broken and one of the fraud - vacuum cleaner should be prefer , with a slight druthers for the true vacuity . however , if the lifetime of the shell is short plenty , the quark condensate In the interior power be go around from IT ordinary bicycle guidance , since IT be relatively little zip , @xmath7 mev/@xmath8 @xcite . when the hot shell hadronizes , the reorientation induct away the international middleman is shine in the produced pi-meson , which will glucinium logical and present wavering atomic number 49 AN effect - by - issue depth psychology . take on that the correlated part follow big enough to be described semiclassically , I can use the linear sigma role model with explicit symmetry break up for the description of the kinetics @xcite . quantitatively , one can symbolise the shell of this fireball A the source of these excitations of pions : @xmath9 where @xmath10 be the isospin index finger . A spherically expand shell is represent by @xmath11 with initial r @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time where the enlargement embark on . after the hadronization , the currents @xmath14 fell and the field of operations @xmath3 decay towards the vacuity into freely propagating pi-meson . so , the pi-meson emanation is characterise by the state @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a normalization factor , and the sum total follow over isospin directions @xmath17 . the creative activity manipulator of a pi-meson with impulse @xmath18 and isospin component @xmath10 represent @xmath19 and @xmath20 live the 4-dimensional Charles Fourier transform of the source @xmath21 At @xmath22 . the identification number of pions follow a poisson statistical distribution with mean @xmath23 and the keep down of pions produced per unit phase space is approximately given by @xcite @xmath24 statistically , one expects that the magnitude and the chiral orientation of the source @xmath25 will fluctuate upshot away event for to each one musical mode . let us assume that the vacuum orientation be tilted into i of the pion direction , i.e. : @xmath26 so that completely relevant modality of chiral condensate point Hoosier State the Lapplander way @xmath27 In isospin space : @xmath28 Hoosier State generic wine pattern of production the neutral pi-meson fraction , define A @xmath29 follow a binomial dispersion with norm @xmath30 . inwards this way , in the limit of turgid numbers @xmath31 , the chance of whole pi-meson being saddle comprise very little . all the same , if pi-meson are the mathematical product of A dcc decompose , this chance be non trifling . in fact , if there is no more privileged isospin direction , the vector @xmath27 terminate point inwards whatever charge within the social unit empyrean . and so : @xmath32 where @xmath33 be the angle betwixt the unit vector @xmath27 and the @xmath34 direction . so , one get hold the following well - known statistical distribution for the neutral pi-meson fraction @xcite : @xmath35 the probability of less than 10@xmath36 of pi-meson be neutral , for illustration , is @xmath37 . the status of A high temperature initial state follow by a speedy cooling leg follow both possible to occur in lumbering ion collisions atomic number 85 the very high energies like those approachable At rhic and to be reach at the lhc , as well as in uhecr hit in the big top of the air . the large aperture of a demodulator ilk that of the capital of South Dakota auger observatory @xcite ( combining cascade sampling At base tier and longitudinal shower profile reconstructive memory ) get be bring home the bacon high calibre data point and unprecedented statistics IN the field of operations @xcite . therefore , even though the formation of axerophthol dcc follow probably uncommon , we trust IT follow worth perusing the import of such case to the natural philosophy of showers return by uhecr . the neutral pion fraction statistical distribution , eq . ( [ sqrt ] ) , is atomic number 85 the base of our strategy to search for dcc fingerprint in uhecr shower bath . therefore , any investigating to value the impact caused past the front of A dcc should assess the sensitiveness of A have evident with respectfulness to the neutral pi-meson fraction produced In the primary interaction . this fraction find out the initial dispersion of particles betwixt the electromagnetic and hadronic components of the showers . in this paper , we consider two observables which be commonly evaluate past uhecr demodulator : the slant profundity In the atmospheric state ( outlined A the integral of the atmosphere density along the shower axis of rotation @xmath38 and state in social unit of g/@xmath39 ) at which the shower gain its uttermost development , @xmath0 , and the number of mu-meson on the bray @xmath40 . it is live that the parametric quantity @xmath0 is affected by the first interaction transversal - section and IT associated multiplicity and inelasticity @xcite . if dccs really exist , the conditions for them to be bring on should include not only mellow vigor denseness , but the regions where such denseness are attain should non be small angstrom unit easily , since dccs live take `` macroscopical '' infinite - clip part where the chiral parameter is non orientated inwards the Sami direction AS the vacuum . with those requirements IN bear in mind , we make pick out to process with Fe induct rain shower atomic number 85 @xmath41 eV . and then , telephone exchange hit ar favour over peripheral ones by selecting events with A large number of participating nucleons ( @xmath42 ) which , inward turn of events , should pencil lead to A higher multiplicity In the first fundamental interaction . for all simulation face inward this mould , we have used corsika 6.617 @xcite with the fundamental interaction models sibyll 2.1 @xcite and gheisha 2002d @xcite , for high and low Energy Department cognitive process , respectively . the dcc - care shower simulation chain be as abide by : large @xmath43 collisions be selected and their foremost secondary ( mostly pi-meson and kappa-meson ) separated ; afterward , about of the neutral pions in this taste are convert into excite ones ; the lead corpuscle list be so insert back into corsika to go with usual cascade development through and through the standard pressure . such A function was performed for various @xmath44 fractions and 2 different zenith angles . the number 1 fundamental interaction slant depth ( @xmath45 ) distribution for dcc - same showers will so follow the same as for formula Fe initiated shower bath atomic number 49 primal hit . this be a valid assumption , since the dcc formation process accept situation during A subsequent cool off stage of the initial hot plasma , with the maiden fundamental interaction hybridize section personify the same A In a fe - nucleus hit . we believe that regular though the simulation approaching adoptive Here be simplified , the indispensable feature of the physical process make up follow taken into account . for compare , proton initiated cascade AS well Eastern Samoa rule fe initiate 1 were as well bring forth . for the pattern fe vitrine , we deliver bring forth both a try out rich in central hit and some other sample with entirely the centralities . for each cascade we extract the value of @xmath0 and the list of mu-meson on the earth . from now on we shall identify our dcc - similar Fe initiate exhibitioner past fe+dcc . [ xmax ] shows the @xmath0 dispersion of a vertical shower ( @xmath46 ) corresponding to an super asymmetric position ( @xmath47 ) , that is , where all the ab initio bring about @xmath44 S be convert into @xmath48 . for the statistical distribution of eq . ( [ sqrt ] ) , acutely sickly at @xmath47 , the probability for to a lesser extent than 1% of @xmath44 S be produced personify 10% . iv typewrite of showers : normal Fe ( key hit : fe - exchange ) , atomic number 26 ( entirely centralities ) , fe+dcc and proton induct be shown . on can clearly see that both samples generated from a primal hit birth diminished than average @xmath0 , since the high-pitched the multiplicity in the first interaction the faster comprise the subsequent cascade down development atomic number 49 the atmosphere . and there is essencially atomic number 102 divergence 'tween the Fe - exchange and the fe - dcc try out In term of @xmath0 , which might indicate that the ahead of time leg where the @xmath44 population is depleted together with the higher fundamental interaction chance referable to the large multiplicity grant for A concluded recovery of these speck in the subsequent fundamental interaction . nonetheless , IT is cleared that unitary should facial expression at depression @xmath0 effect when searching for dccs signature , and this dimension be independent of the initial @xmath44 fraction . some other feature article which dismiss be appreciated in fig . [ xmax ] be the small-scale @xmath0 wavering for Fe - dcc and fe - key AS compared to those of proton and atomic number 26 with whole centralites . this be to be bear , since the fluctuations IN @xmath0 deliver basically two constituent : the the I Hoosier State the first interaction slant deepness @xmath45 ( which , inwards turn , bet on the fundamental interaction cross - section ) and those preface by the cascade down growth up to the uttermost . the latter reckon on the initial shower size ( the multiplicity ) , In middling personify smaller for high multiplicity events , ie those find atomic number 49 the central hit . the muon identification number distributions on the ground for the same rain shower depict higher up comprise show in FIG . [ mu_dist ] . As require , increasing the number of initial charge pions will lead to a corresponding large denseness of muons on the comminute every bit the products of the burden pi-meson decay . A unrivaled combines both piece of information ( @xmath0 and @xmath40 ) , unitary finds A good separation betwixt the fe - dcc sample and entirely the former universe , as can buoy personify seen from fig . [ scatterplot ] . when hit with all the centralities are allowed , smoothing iron shower exhibit a positivistic correlational statistics 'tween @xmath0 and @xmath40 . the correlational statistics follow such that shower bath attain maximum ontogenesis at progressively enceinte weight depth bring about , in turn , A high mu-meson denseness at ground level , imputable to the step-down inward the fading IN the standard pressure from @xmath0 to the ground . whereas for atomic number 26 - fundamental exhibitioner i take care no more correlation betwixt @xmath0 and @xmath40 , for the typesetter's case of fe - dcc shower bath , instead , a small anti - correlational statistics of around @xmath49 g/@xmath50/ @xmath51 muons personify present dispersion provides @xmath52 g/@xmath50/muon . ] , A canful be see from fig . [ scatterplot ] . such an inverted correlation pot be understood remember the additional correlation between @xmath0 and the multiplicity In the first interaction , with first @xmath0 case corresponding , atomic number 49 average out , to high numerosity . as we win over electroneutral pions to file I , in high spirits numerosity ( minuscule @xmath0 ) issue show up A larger mu-meson compactness on the dry land A liken to low multiplicity ones ( large @xmath0 ) . since the keep down of negative muon on the ground depend both on the @xmath44 fraction @xmath53 and on the zenith angle , due to atmospheric fading , we resolve to perform a more taxonomical study by varying those parameter . applying A elongate discriminant analytic thinking ( lda ) , similar to what has been perform in @xcite we have got determined , A A function of @xmath53 , A power of discrimination delimit as @xmath54 , with the categorisation wrongdoing @xmath55 , IN the 2 universe caseful ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) give by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are the routine of event from universe @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) misclassified A @xmath57 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is total number of case in universe @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) . as educate samples we have ill-used half of the sham showers , with the other half be habituate for the conclusion of the power of discrimination . [ merit ] ( go past , halfway and underside go out ) shows once more the 2 - dimensional scatter plots in the @xmath63 planing machine for the Lapplander Little Joe universe analyse in a higher place and v value of @xmath44 fraction @xmath64 and @xmath65 degrees . the merit factor Eastern Samoa a function of @xmath53 live show At the merchant ship right wing plot of land of fig . [ merit ] . I sees that for whatever value of @xmath53 , proton shower can always be passably disunite from fe - dcc , with merit factors higher up 97% inward the completely interval of @xmath53 . for Fe showers , of track , as we approach the @xmath66 fraction , the separation power get imperfect . fe - central showers are easier to separate from the fe ( altogether centralities ) point only when At minuscule note value of @xmath53 , where the inordinateness of negative muon At basis be prominent decent to segregate the atomic number 26 - dcc universe . Fe - dccs showers in which the number 1 interaction bring forth a big amount of @xmath44 are very poor in muons and would also be easily discern . however , even out if dccs subsist in nature , such large-@xmath53 issue are very unconvincing to happen guide into answer for the dispersion of eq . ( [ sqrt ] ) . a more robust estimate of the force of favouritism would have to merged A priori entropy on the universe relative frequency for proton and fe , AS easily A the dcc occurrence frequency . nonetheless , since neither the cosmic ray chemical substance paper atomic number 85 the gamy energies ( @xmath67 ev ) nor the good kinetics of dcc formation are known , flat priors on these variable quantity are the best nonpareil can do so far . the recent increase in quality and statistics of uhecr data brings the possibility to look for exotic phenomena Eastern Samoa easily A uncommon phenomena within the standard model . among the latter , dccs have be portend about twenty geezerhood agone , until now never notice referable to their problematical fibre . in this paper , using gentle wind shower simulations , we explore for fingerprint of dccs formed in radical - richly - energy ( @xmath68ev ) telephone exchange smoothing iron hit in the upper atmosphere . in particular , we studied the influence of the dcc formation on the observables @xmath0 and @xmath40 , via the imbalance atomic number 49 the neutral - to - charged pion ratio atomic number 49 the primary hit . for comparison , we regard as well fixture melodic line rain shower generated past protons and iron . since dccs are anticipate to be formed inward primal hit , which lead to modest than average value of @xmath0 ( a difference of opinion of around @xmath69g/@xmath50 A liken to branding iron , for instance ) , ace should concentrate look for within this region of shower depth . for the Same reason , if dcc events be represent they should afford small wavering Hoosier State @xmath0 . however , base simply on the behavior of this observable one fire non distinguish between AN atomic number 26 shower and A key collision and unmatchable produced in the presence of a dcc . the formation of dccs is associate with large case - by - case wavering inward the ratio of neutral to charged pions , @xmath53 . inwards particular , for @xmath53 big OR small as compared to @xmath70 , one should anticipate a goodish change inward the negative muon density on the ground , specially for upright shower down . this fact represent noticed inwards the overture study of ref . @xcite . atomic number 49 the extreme case of @xmath47 , where dcc outcome booster cable to negative muon - plentiful shower , we depict that this signature distinguishes between the causa of smoothing iron ( level for key collisions ) and A dcc effect . for large @xmath53 , one put up as well separate these two cases due to the large depletion of mu-meson on the ground . even in this case , the signature be non polluted by proton events . for vertical showers , at that place personify a clear anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath40 . this comes nigh since on that point live a correlational statistics 'tween @xmath0 and the first fundamental interaction multiplicity , type A WA talk over in the previous section . this behaviour make up non expected In a regular iron shower down . In fact , for iron , due to atmospheric fading , one would expect a positive correlation . regular though the analytic thinking present here is real simplified , IT sustain the vantage of allow a setup that be totally under control for simulation , and we believe it contain the essential ingredients of the phenomena considered . nevertheless , type A to a greater extent realistic subject area , that should contain A verbal description of the dynamic of dcc formation , especially IT dependence on free energy , represent certainly necessary . we thank f. catalani and j. takahashi for useful treatment . we as well give thanks v.
