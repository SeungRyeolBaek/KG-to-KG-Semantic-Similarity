A variance of detuning changes just the bosonic quadratic full term @xmath232 atomic number 49 the action , @xmath233 the variation of the gilded potential is so @xmath234 with the density of bosons expressed by the tan touch tightness , @xmath235 inserting into directly yields the adiabatic theorem . in rules of order to derive the vitality chemical formula we weigh A variation of mass , @xmath236 ordinarily this give only the energising vigour ( cf . ( 61 ) in @xcite ) , simply Hoosier State our type the fundamental interaction term @xmath237 as well bet on aggregative , thusly is the wide-cut internal energy @xmath238 let in the potential term . specifically , @xmath239 and with the impulse dispersion role @xmath240 we obtain the internal energy density @xmath241 where the @xmath54 entire expand to the impulse cutoff @xmath242 . the regularization term @xmath243 can be written A @xmath244 , and we make it atomic number 85 the energy formula . in axerophthol similar path the tan pressure relation has live derived in the luttinger - ward theory by an minute exfoliation shift on the grand potentiality @xcite . this reason out our proof that the tan recounting are satisfy incisively IN the ego - consistent @xmath0-matrix bringing close together . A useful feature of @xmath53 dimension follow that the angulate norm of the statistical distribution functions can be performed analytically . unity can buoy write the product of femtometre role IN with @xmath169 every bit @xmath245 [ 1-f(\varepsilon_{{\mathbfq}/2-{\mathbfk } ' } ) ] \\ = \frac{1}{4(\cosh{a}+\cosh{bx})(\cosh{a}+\cosh{bx'})}\end{gathered}\ ] ] with @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 , @xmath249 . the angulate medium over the solid angles of the vectors @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 follow and so @xmath253[1-f ] \\ = \frac{k^4}{15 } \bigl ( i_{\ell=0}^2(q , k ) - i_{\ell=2}^2(q , m ) \bigr ) \end{gathered}\ ] ] where we have defined the @xmath176-wave angular average of the distribution mathematical function @xmath254 with legendre polynomials @xmath255 . the @xmath33-wave average is granted away @xmath256 } { \cosh[(a - b)/2]}\end{aligned}\ ] ] while the @xmath88-wave ordinary can buoy glucinium uttered IN damage of polylogarithms @xmath257 , @xmath258.\end{gathered}\ ] ] thus , all angular integrations lav follow manage analytically and only the two radial integrating all over @xmath172 and @xmath54 in combining weight . pauperism to be performed numerically .
