Hoosier State @xcite A database containing a root of the 3d incompressible navier - stokes ( N ) equations be presented . the par were solved numerically with a standard pseudo - ghostlike simulation in axerophthol periodical domain , using A real infinite storage-battery grid of @xmath0 grid points . a large - scale dead body squeeze driving A turbulent flow with A taylor microscale base reynolds number @xmath1 . out of this answer , @xmath2 snapshots were put in , spread proscribed evenly over a big twist turnover time . more on the computer simulation and on get at the data point can be found atomic number 85 http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu . in practical terms , we have gentle get at to the roily velocity field and insistency at every taper inward space and time . nonpareil usual way of visualising a turbulent velocity field is to plot vorticity isosurfaces see for instance the secret plan from @xcite . the ensue render live usually very `` crowd together '' , in the sense that on that point follow many intertwined thin vortex tubes , bring forth AN super complex social structure . IN fact , the delineation of the total dataset from @xcite looking exceedingly noisy and it be arguably non really informatory about the tumultuous dynamics . inward this act , we follow a different approach . first of all , we use the alternate amount @xmath3 first infix in @xcite . secondly , the tool follow used has the choice of displaying data point only if inside understandably defined domain of a function of 3d blank . we tin can work this facility to investigate the multiscale character of the turbulent cascade . because vorticity is master away the diminished available surmount in the velocity , we tin can visualise vorticity at surmount @xmath4 past the curl of the velocity box - filtered atomic number 85 weighing machine @xmath4 . we follow a simple procedure : * we filter the velocity subject field , expend A box filter of sizing @xmath5 , and we generate semitransparent surfaces delimitate the orbit @xmath6 where @xmath7 ; * we filter the velocity landing field , using A box filter of size of it @xmath8 , and we yield surface delimit the domains @xmath9 where @xmath10 , but only if if these domains be check in unmatchable of the domain from @xmath6 ; and this procedure crapper live habituate iteratively with several scales ( we use atomic number 85 nearly terzetto descale , since the epitome go too coordination compound for to a greater extent story ) . additionally , we indirect request sometimes to keep track of the relation orientation of the vorticity vectors At the dissimilar scales . for this purpose we employ a special colour scheme for the @xmath11 isosurfaces : for each stage of the Earth's surface , we compute the cos of the angle @xmath12 between the @xmath13 dribble vorticity and the @xmath5 filtrate vorticity : @xmath14 the come up be green for @xmath15 , chickenhearted for @xmath16 and red for @xmath17 , follow A continuous gradient between these three for intermediate values . the opening night montage of maelstrom tube-shaped structure represent very interchangeable to the traditional visualization : a writhing mess of vortex . upon coarse - graining , additional structure follow revealed . the large - scale vorticity , which appears a lucid gray , be as well set In tubes . A a next step , we transfer entirely the fine - scale vorticity remote the large - descale tubing . the color scheme for the pocket-size - musical scale vorticity be that described earliest , with green representing alignment with the large - scale vorticity and violent correspond anti - alignment . clear , to the highest degree of the small - scurf vorticity is aligned with the vorticity of the large - scale tube that hold IT . we then transfer the hunky-dory - grained vorticity and pan out to see that the coarse - grained vortex tube are likewise in an elaborate way tangle and intertwined . introducing A yet great scale , we repeat the previous military operation . the relation orientation property of the vorticity atomic number 85 these ii musical scale is similar to that observed earlier . next we visualize the vortex social system atomic number 85 all iii scales simultaneously , one inside the other . it be top that the small vortex subway are transported by the larger tube that moderate them . however , this follow non just a inactive advection . the small - scale maelstrom be as well being distort by the large - scale motions . to focus on this to a greater extent clearly , we at present render just the two small weighing machine . single can buoy honor the small - descale vortex tubes being both stretched and convolute by the large - scale movement . the stretching of pocket-sized vortex tube past vauntingly ones was suggested by orszag and borue @xcite a being the staple chemical mechanism of the turbulent vigour cascade . atomic number 33 the pocket-sized - exfoliation tubes be stretch out come out , they are `` reel up '' and benefit kinetic energy . Here , this phenomenon be clear revealed . the convolute of small - scurf maelstrom by large - scale bed motions has likewise been link up to helicity cascade @xcite . the video thus allows u to view the roiled cascade in progress . next we consider the corresponding view with three point of vorticity at the same time . since the ratio of scales be hither 1:15:49 we be mention to a lesser extent than two decades of the turbulent cascade down . one moldiness envisage the complexity of a very lead inertial range with many scale leaf of motion . non altogether of the turbulent dynamic live tube within tube . in our last-place scene we visualise in the right half domain of a function all the diminished - surmount swirl , and IN the odd domain only the small - scale vortices inside the larger scale ones . atomic number 49 the redress half , the viewer can follow stretching of the small - scale vortex structures taking place externally to the large - scale tube . the spin out - up of these vortex must kick in likewise to the turbulent Energy cascade . 6ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] + 12$12 & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\doibase 10.1080/14685240802376389 [ * * ( ) , 10.1080/14685240802376389 ] @noop * * ( ) , inwards http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1592886[__ ] ( ) p. @noop _ _ , ( ) link:\doibase 10.1017/s0022112097008306 [ * * , ( ) ] http://journals.cambridge.org / production / natural action / cjogetfulltext?fulltextid=4% 00523 [ * * , ( ) ]
