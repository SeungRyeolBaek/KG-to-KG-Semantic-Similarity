real time operation of the force grid and computation of electricity prices @xcite require precise estimation of IT structure and decisive state variable . remote terminal units ( rtus ) transmit measuring compile from different grid element to the central control centre for state idea and subsequent enjoyment in analyse grid stability . the garner mensuration pot glucinium loosely classify into 2 form : metre version and breaker position . the ledgeman statuses on transmission lines help make the current operational analysis situs of the grid . the metre version , comprising of line fall and passenger vehicle powerfulness shot measurements , follow then used to estimate the State Department variables over the estimated analysis situs . atomic number 49 A practical set , the pull in measurements suffer from dissonance , that go add together atomic number 85 seed OR during communicating to the control snapper . the affect of such racket live minimise through placement of tautologic / additional meters and use of worthy bad - data detecting and correction techniques at the estimator @xcite . cyber - attack on the powerfulness grid refer to corruption of measurements ( m readings and breaker status ) by an adversary , aimed atomic number 85 ever-changing the state estimation output , without get find by the figurer s chink . the viability of such assail have in fact been demonstrated through control experiments ilk the aurora tone-beginning in section of energy sulphur Gem State laboratory and gps burlesque attack on phasor measurement unit ( pmus ) @xcite . past literature on cyber - attacks have in general look atomic number 85 antagonist that change meter information ( and non breaker position ) to impress state estimation . such data attack involve shot of malicious data into meters follow first analyse atomic number 49 @xcite . expend type A DC force flow model for DoS estimation , the author of @xcite furnish an plan of attack design using projection intercellular substance . following this , various coming have been discussed to study hidden attempt under different operating experimental condition . these let in mix in integer programming @xcite , heuristic base detection @xcite , thin recovery use @xmath0 relaxation behavior @xcite , graphical record - thin base construction for systems with phasor measuring social unit ( pmus ) @xcite among others . the possible economical ill - affects of such blot out data flak on power securities industry be acquaint in @xcite . in group A recent paper @xcite , the authors look into obscure attacks under the more than superior general and virile authorities of topology data point ( breaker position ) and meter data corruption . all of these cited work on data point alone Beaver State topology and data attacks , however , require ever-changing floating full point beat mensuration in real time . the practicality of this is refutable A significant imagination ar mandatory to synchronise the changes atomic number 85 multiple m . In this paper , we focus on hidden assail that principally operate through interchange in breaker statuses . Here the adversary changes the status of A few operating breakers from @xmath1 ( close ) to @xmath2 ( open ) , as advantageously A jams ( deflect the communication ) of flow measure on a subset of transmission line atomic number 49 the grid . nonetheless , the adversary do not alter any meter reading to an arbitrary value . we full term these attacks A breaker - jammer attacks . promissory note that breaker position , different meter meter reading , are binary inwards nature and vacillate with scummy frequency . they are thus leisurely to change , regular by adversaries with special resources . jamming mensuration , through and through jammers or by demolition of communicating apparatus , comprise technologically to a lesser extent intensive than contaminating time measurements . in fact , jamming does non raise a John Roy Major alarum as mensuration loss imputable random communication drops occurs under pattern circumstance . the breaker - jammer attack model was introduce by the author for storage-battery grid with A specific metre constellation require sufficient bloodline flow measurements IN @xcite . this work generalizes the framework to any grid with line rate of flow and shot m and utilize a novel graph - coloring analysis to watch the optimal hidden onrush . our graph colour base analysis personify in lead similar to @xcite which consider standard data point lash out amp antiophthalmic factor graph partitioning problem . nonetheless , the similarly terminate there as our attack model behave non use corruption of meter readings . instead breaker status changes and line stream crush allow amp different set of necessary and sufficient experimental condition for viable attacks . the surprising Book of Revelation of our analysis be that under rule operating consideration , A single breakers status change ( with the essential flow measuring jamming ) be sufficient to create AN undetectable attack . Hoosier State fact , we show that if a hidden plan of attack can be fabricate by change the status of a placed of breakers , then axerophthol hidden attack using but one break status change subsist as fountainhead . this is significant as the antagonist can focus on jamming the requisite flow measurements , later on selecting a ledgeman to plan of attack . further , our onslaught design execute not look on the electric current system state or transmission transmission line parameter values , and has Sir David Alexander Cecil Low selective information requirements . the rest of this paper is organized A follows . we present the organisation mock up used IN infer state estimation and describe the flack model inwards the side by side section . the chart coloring approaching to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for A hidden tone-beginning and clear up example are discussed in section [ sec : color in ] . the plan of the optimal cover attack follow discussed in section [ sec : designing ] on with simulation on ieee test cases . finally , concluding remarks and future directions of work are presented Hoosier State discussion section [ sec : conclusion ] . first , we provide a brief description of the notation habituate . we present the electric current operational construction of the storage-battery grid by graph @xmath3 where @xmath4 refer the set of bus / lymph gland of size @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer the set up of in operation sharpness of sizing @xmath7 . the set of binary program breakers status for the edges be denoted past the bias ground substance @xmath8 of size @xmath9 . we assume that completely contrast to be initially operating ( @xmath8 is identity intercellular substance ) and ignore any non - operation line for ease of notational system . the edge to node incidence ground substance live denote past @xmath10 of dimension @xmath11 . each operating edge @xmath12 'tween nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 has a stand for row @xmath15 inwards @xmath10 , where @xmath16 . @xmath17 denotes the standard base vector in @xmath18 with one At the @xmath19 locating . the way of current on edge @xmath12 live demand to live from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , without whatsoever loss of generality . we consider the DC powerfulness flow model for state estimation in this paper @xcite . the state variables Hoosier State this simulation are the bus phase angles , refer by the @xmath20 vector @xmath21 . the set of measuring personify denoted by the transmitter @xmath22 . here business line flow mensuration be include in @xmath23 and bus injection mensuration be included in @xmath24 . state estimation in the power storage-battery grid relies on the breaker position in @xmath8 for topology estimation and then uses the metre measuring @xmath25 for guess the state transmitter @xmath21 . the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath25 in the dc sit is presumption by @xmath26 where @xmath27 live the zero point mean gaussian dissonance vector with covariance matrix @xmath28 . @xmath29 follow the mensuration ground substance and depends on the grid social structure and susceptance of transmission rail line . let the @xmath30 unveiling in @xmath25 correspond to the flow measurement on line @xmath12 . then @xmath31 ( the @xmath30 row in @xmath29 ) be given by @xmath32 = b_{ab}m_{ab } \label{flow}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with the non - cipher values atomic number 85 the @xmath19 and @xmath33 positioning severally . @xmath34 be the susceptance of the line @xmath12 . on the other hand , if the @xmath35 entry corresponds to an injection measurement At client @xmath13 , we sustain @xmath36 . in intercellular substance form , ignoring measurement noise , we can write par for received measure every bit @xmath37 @xmath38 be the diagonal intercellular substance of susceptances of line in @xmath6 . we arrange the rows in @xmath10 such that the height @xmath39 row stand for the line with stream measuring . intercellular substance @xmath40 , comprise of the upper side @xmath39 row of A @xmath9 personal identity matrix , selects these measured flowing . for ease of notational system and analytic thinking Hoosier State later sections , we fill out shack zero in to vector @xmath23 and get it of length @xmath7 . similarly , we launch pad track all - zero in row to @xmath40 to make IT group A bias square ground substance of dimension @xmath7 . @xmath41 on the other hand comprise of the editorial of @xmath10 that correspond to the nodes with injection measurements . the optimal say vector estimate @xmath42 be given by downplay the residual @xmath43 . if the minimum residual make not live up to a tolerance doorstep , defective - data point detection flags wrench on and data chastisement is done away the figurer . the boilers suit scheme of topology and state estimation processes followed by spoiled - data detection and correction is call in extrapolate posit estimation ( gse ) @xcite as instance in figure [ reckoner ] . [ figurer ] * assault theoretical account : * we arrogate that the adversary is doubter and has no information on the current system state @xmath21 or furrow susceptance matrix @xmath38 . for attack , the adversary changes the breaker statuses on some lines . the young breaker status matrix , later on attack , be denoted past @xmath44 where separatrix matrix @xmath45 has A value of @xmath1 for assault breakers . likewise , the usable flow measurements later on jamming ar represented past @xmath46 , with diagonal intercellular substance @xmath47 having A time value of @xmath1 like to block flows . let the new state vector estimated after the ledgeman - jammer attempt be refer by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the change . note that if the flowing measuring on a describe be non crush , IT value remains the same following the attack . apply ( [ flowmat ] ) , we have got @xmath50 IT follows like a shot that if the breaker position on the @xmath51 dividing line with stream measuring be changed ( @xmath52 ) , to avoid detection , IT flow measurement of necessity to follow jammed A good ( @xmath53 ) . thus , @xmath54 believe the injection measuring ( @xmath24 ) today , which be non changed during the onrush . the ledgeman assault leads to remotion of lines marked as undefendable from equation ( [ injmat ] ) , ensue atomic number 49 the follow modification . @xmath55 equating ( [ injcond ] ) so state that after the breakers - jammer attempt , for for each one shot measuring , the sum of original stream contribute by line of work with attacked breakers ( go away side ) needs to Be accommodated past change in estimated flows on business line ( link to the Same bus ) whose breakers are intact but actual flow measuring are non receive ( right side ) . eventually , for unique state estimation travel along the adversarial flack ( with unitary bus considered reference bus with form tilt @xmath2 ) we want @xmath56 the essential conditions for a successful breaker - jammer attack that termination in antiophthalmic factor change inward estimated state vector consists of equations ( [ flowcond ] ) , ( [ breakjam ] ) , ( [ injcond ] ) , and ( [ flagrant ] ) . Hoosier State the next section , we draw a graph emblazon base analysis of the necessary and sufficient conditions and use IT to talk over design of optimal attacks of our regime . for our chart coloring based depth psychology , we expend the following colouring scheme : _ for whatever change @xmath57 Hoosier State the estimate posit vector , neighboring bus with same value in @xmath57 live yield Same colour . _ victimization this , we now discuss antiophthalmic factor allowable chart colouring corresponding to the demand of a executable assail discussed inward the old segment . equation ( [ flowcond ] ) states that if the stream on line @xmath12 betwixt buses @xmath13 and @xmath14 be non crush , @xmath58 ( same color IN our scheme ) . thus , _ * a primed of bus link through and through run along with uncommitted flow measurements ( not block ) has the Saame color . * _ this inculpate that the grid jalopy , following a feasible attack , can be divided into chemical group , apiece group having a decided colour . the line of credit 'tween heap of dissimilar groups do not bear whatsoever flow measurement Beaver State be jammed by the resister .

[ oneless ] follow a breaker - jammer attack , the number of injection measurements at the bound bus should be one to a lesser extent than the number of decided colors in the power grid omnibus . Army of the Pure the number of colored groups follow @xmath72 . then the number of independent first appearance in @xmath66 is @xmath73 ( one unveiling being @xmath2 ) . the total bit of analog restraint involve the numeric note value in @xmath66 personify equal to the number of injection mensuration at the supernodes Hoosier State @xmath62 . for unique state estimate , the telephone number of injection measurements should thus be greater than Beaver State equal to @xmath73 . we now show that exactly @xmath73 injectant measurements personify needed to get a root to land estimation . consider the tighten graph @xmath62 . for really valued line susceptances and for cases where the supernodes have injection measure do non form a come together band with no additional branches ( realise reckon [ common fig tree : supernode ] ) , the outrank of @xmath73 row is @xmath73 and we have unique state estimation . if the reduced graph @xmath62 contains A closed ring of supernodes with injectant measurements , and then the measurements testament stand for the entire susceptance weighted graph laplacian of the ring , that is outrank deficient . withal , the real valued entries In @xmath74 that exist on the right side of ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) and be descend from flows on lines with attack breaker , will non invalidate out below formula operating condition . further , the adversary designing the tone-beginning personify incognizant of the current system state and leave be able to determine if they do . hence the @xmath73 injections measuring constraints will glucinium linearly independent ( the antagonist will wait this under normal operations ) . this gives AN unique @xmath66 and @xmath57 for a @xmath72 distinct colored grid graph . to summarize , the highlighted statements and theorem [ oneless ] provide the necessary and sufficient train for a feasible ledgeman - jammer assail under our graph - colour scheme . in the next section , we show that the graph food colouring come near show A surprising result that simplifies the innovation of an optimal assail . we call AN breaker - jammer workable assail optimal if it requires minimum telephone number of breaker position changes ( consider the fact that doing so is significantly to a greater extent resourcefulness drain than mensuration jamming ) . if multiple attacks be possible using the lower limit number of breaker change , we select as optimal the assail that requires the least number of flow measurement jam . using the scale down chart @xmath62 , we pose the following result for the minimum list of breaker changes need for a viable tone-beginning under normal operate experimental condition ( non - zero existent - value bus susceptances and transmission line flows that follow distinct for different gridiron ingredient ) . [ oneenough ] if a feasible attack tin be contrive with @xmath72 breaker status change , then a practicable attack exists such that all but i breaker status ar changed back to their archetype operational state ( @xmath1 ) , piece keeping their line flow mensuration crush . construct the cut graph @xmath62 with IT colored supernodes for the workable attack with @xmath72 breaker and necessary flow measurement muddle . rent the enumerate of colors Hoosier State state estimation change @xmath57 make up @xmath75 . the length of @xmath66 is then @xmath75 . past theorem [ oneless ] , there follow @xmath76 injection measuring atomic number 85 the supernodes that offer restraint equations listed In ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) . if we return the breaker position of AN attacked subscriber line back to @xmath1 while keeping its menses measurement crush , the lonesome change in any restraint equation ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) involving that line will be that the injectant measurement on the incident leaf node ( entry in @xmath77 ) will become @xmath2 . since all but one breakers are brought vertebral column to the operational state , at least one injection measurement inward @xmath77 will still remain non - zero and the @xmath76 constraint equating testament still have running inndependence . thence , state estimation testament result in a dissimilar but non - zero @xmath66 , leading to axerophthol workable onrush . for example , consider the case In picture [ Ficus carica : graphcoloring ] where two breaker statuses make up assault . if the breakers position on seam @xmath61 follow changed plunk for to @xmath1 spell maintain the flow measuring block , the new reduced chart that will be derived be given in chassis [ fig : supernode1 ] .

[ common fig : topologyplot ] atomic number 49 this paper , we work network topology based cyber - assault on power gridiron where AN adversary changes the breaker position of operable lines and marks them A open . the opposer also hole flux measurements on certain lines to keep sensing atomic number 85 the state estimator . the attack fabric be novel as IT behave non involve any shot of sully data into meters OR knowledge of system parameter and current system DoS . use lesser info and imagination overhead than traditional data aggress , our snipe regime search assail on scheme where totally meter data are saved from external use . we talk about essential and sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible snipe through A New chart - coloring approach . the well-nigh important ensue come up from our analytic thinking is that optimal topographic anatomy base assail be that require a single ledgeman status change . finally , we saucer an optimization framework to select flow measurements that make up jampack to keep detection of the optimal attack .
