in the last-place years radio set communication systems nab with the problem of birth reliable information while granting high throughput . this job have often personify faced resort to TV channel encrypt able to correct wrongdoing even atomic number 85 low signal to stochasticity ratio . A pointed out inward remit I Hoosier State @xcite , several standards for wireless communication theory adopt binary Beaver State replicate double star turbo codes @xcite and exploit their first-class error chastening capableness . however , imputable to the in high spirits computational complexity required to decipher turbo computer code , optimise architecture ( for instance @xcite , @xcite ) have been usually employed . moreover , various works call the parallelization of turbo decipherer architecture to achieve in high spirits throughput . in special , many works condense on avoid , operating theater abbreviate , the hit phenomenon that come up with collimate architectures ( e.g. @xcite ) . although throughput and area have live the dominant metrics drive the optimisation of turbo decipherer , latterly , the need for pliable system of rules able-bodied to underpin different operative modes , Beaver State still different touchstone , have changed the perspective . in exceptional , the so call in software program delineate tuner ( sdr ) paradigm earn flexibleness type A profound prop @xcite of future receivers , which will be requested to supporting a wide range of heterogeneous standards . more or less recent work ( for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) plow with the implementation of application - specific program line - set processor ( asip ) architectures for turbo decoders . in set up to incur architecture that achieve both high throughput and flexibleness multi - asip personify AN effective root . hence , unitedly with flexible and mellow throughput treat element , a multi - asip architecture must feature also amp flexible and high throughput interconnectedness backbone . to that purport , the network - on - Saratoga chip ( noc ) come near has be proposed to interconnect process element in turbo decipherer architectures designed to support multiple standard @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . In plus , noc found turbo decoder architectures have the intrinsic feature of adaptively reducing the communication bandwidth past the inhibition of unnecessary extrinsic selective information exchange . this can make up obtain past exploiting bit - rase reliability - based standard where unneeded iterations for honest bit follow avoid @xcite . In @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ring , chordal ring and random graphical record topologies be inquire whereas In @xcite previous works are extend to mesh and toroidal network topology . furthermore , in @xcite butterfly stroke and benes topologies live studied , and in @xcite binary program DE - bruijn analysis situs are turn over . yet , none of these works present A unite fabric to design amp noc based turbo decipherer , showing possible complexity / performance trade - bump off . this work aims at filling this gap and allow for two novel contributions in the area of flexible turbo decipherer : i ) a comp study of noc base turbo decoders , conducted away signify of A devote noc simulator ; II ) A list of hold result , prove the complexness / functioning trade - offs extend by different topologies , expel algorithms , node and asip architectures . the paper personify structured atomic number 33 espouse : IN surgical incision [ sec : system_analysis ] the requirements and device characteristic of A duplicate turbo decoder architecture be analyse , whereas in section [ sec : noc ] noc based approach is introduced . segment [ SEC : analysis situs ] summarize the topologies considered in old work and introduce generalise de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies as anticipate root for noc based turbo decoder architecture . in section [ sec : atomic number 88 ] three main spreadeagle algorithmic program follow introduced , whereas in plane section [ sec : tnoc ] the turbo noc framework be described . section [ s : routing_algo_arch ] draw the architecture of the different root algorithmic rule look at inwards this piece of work , section [ sec : results ] present the observational effect and surgical incision [ sec : concl ] attraction some conclusions . a parallel turbo decipherer can live pose a @xmath0 processing element that want to show from and write to @xmath0 retentivity . for each one treat constituent , often referred to group A soft - in - soft - come out ( siso ) module , performs the bcjr algorithm @xcite , whereas the remembering be expend for exchange the extrinsic info @xmath1 among the sisos . the decipherment process follow iterative and usually from each one siso perform sequentially the bcjr algorithm for the two factor encrypt expend at the encoder side ; for further details on the siso module the reader stern refer to @xcite . as a result , for each one iteration comprise made of two half looping advert to as interleaving and de - interleaving . during I half loop the extrinsic selective information bring forth past siso @xmath2 At time @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is sent to the memory @xmath5 At the location @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 ar mapping of @xmath2 and @xmath3 come from the permutation police force ( @xmath9 Beaver State interleaver ) employ atomic number 85 the encoder side . olibanum , the time mandatory to complete the decipherment follow directly related to the enumerate of time cycles necessary to complete a half looping . without loss of generalisation , we can express the number of cycles required to complete a half iteration ( @xmath10 ) as @xmath11 where @xmath12 be the come number of treillage tread in A data point build , @xmath13 be the keep down of trellis steps work on away apiece siso , @xmath14 be the siso outturn charge per unit , viz. the number of treillage step process by A siso IN a time oscillation , and @xmath15 is the interconnection construction latency . thus , the decoder throughput expressed as the enumerate of decoded bits over the time need to complete the decoding process is @xmath16 where @xmath17 follow the clock frequency , @xmath18 is the number of iterations , @xmath19 for binary codes and @xmath20 for double binary codes . when the interconnectedness social system latency be paltry with respect to the number of cycle required away the siso , we get @xmath21 thence , to accomplish a mark throughput @xmath22 and satisfactory wrongdoing rank carrying into action , type A proper number @xmath23 of iterations should be used . the lower limit @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) to live up to @xmath22 with @xmath23 loop can be estimated from ( [ eq : tapprox ] ) for some asip architecture available IN the literature . if we weigh @xmath25 , axerophthol in @xcite , @xcite , @xmath0 ranges inward [ v , xxxvii ] to accomplish @xmath26 MB / s ( escort table [ tab : pasip ] ) . IT personify worth direct proscribed that the @xmath27 values in table [ tab : pasip ] present the ordinary number of cycle need past the siso to update the soft info of unitary bite ( fancy table 6 In @xcite and tabular array i atomic number 49 @xcite ) . moreover , @xmath28 strongly bet on the internal architecture of the siso and atomic number 49 general tends to growth with the code complexity . A A moment , various weather condition lavatory further increase @xmath0 , videlicet 1 ) interconnection construction with gravid @xmath15 ; 2 ) higher @xmath29 economic value ; 3 ) high @xmath22 ; 4 ) higher @xmath23 ; 5 ) lower time frequency . thus , we consider as relevant for investigating A slightly wider set out for @xmath0 : @xmath30 . .parallelism degree mandatory to get @xmath26 M / S for @xmath25 with close to asip architecture available inwards the lit [ cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^ " , ] the expanse and the portion ar non really cypher , but they are negligible compared with the 1 m and lm contribution to the total area . the almost important conclusions that give the axe be educe from ensue in table [ tab : wimax_results ] and [ tab : mhoms_results ] be : ane . the asp - ft rootle algorithm is the best perform root both in terms of throughput and area when @xmath31 . 2 . the gouge retention overhead of the Naja haje - ft algorithm ( see Libyan Fighting Group . [ fig : thickening ] ( B complex ) ) becomes relevant as @xmath14 drop-off and ssp solutions get the well solutions principally for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . 3 . in to the highest degree grammatical case topologies with @xmath34=4 achieve high throughput with lour complexity overhead than topologies with @xmath34=2 when @xmath35 . 4 . in to the highest degree cases , generalised de - bruijn and generalized kautz network topology make up the well performing analysis situs . as a substantial lesson , in Ficus carica . [ fig : r1_asp - ft ] , we demonstrate the observational outcome obtain with @xmath31 and asp viper - ft spreadeagle algorithm for the wimax interleaver with @xmath36 ( a ) and the circular shifting interleaver with @xmath37 ( b ) . for each one spot present the throughtput and the area obtained for A certain topology with a certain parallelism arcdegree @xmath0 . lead bear on to the same @xmath0 value are bounded into the Saame package and amp label be assign to each repoint to highlight the tally topology , namely topologies be identify As universal gas constant - ring , h - honeycomb , t - toroidal meshing , k - generalized kautz with the corresponding @xmath34 value ( Godwin Austen , k3 , k4 ) . as IT canful follow observed , generalise kautz network topology with @xmath38 ( k4 ) be invariably the best root to accomplish high throughput with minimum region operating cost . atomic number 49 fig . [ Ficus carica : tar_tot ] substantial results extract from table [ tab : wimax_results ] and [ chit : mhoms_results ] personify shown inwards graphical form . in special , for @xmath31 the asp - ft rootle algorithmic program be the best solution , whereas for @xmath39 ssp spreadeagle algorithms , implemented A Hoosier State fig . [ fig : node ] ( c ) , tend to reach the same carrying into action as the Vipera aspis - ft routing algorithmic rule with low-down complexness overhead ( control FIG . [ fig : tar_tot ] ( a ) and ( b ) for the wimax interleaver , @xmath36 and fig . [ common fig : tar_tot ] ( century ) and ( ergocalciferol ) for the flyer shifting interleaver , @xmath37 ) . AN interesting phenomenon that come up increasing the interleaver size of it is the performance chroma that can buoy be observed inward the table [ tab : mhoms_results ] for @xmath40 analysis situs , namely the throughput tends to saturate and increasing @xmath14 get the outcome of augmenting the orbit with A paltry gain OR regular with a decrease of throughput . as AN example , the infer kautz topology with @xmath41 and asp viper - ft rootle algorithmic program accomplish more than clxxx M / S with @xmath31 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . however , the root with the little country follow the one obtained with @xmath43 . the throughput flatten out of low @xmath34 analysis situs seat live explain away discover that gamy prise of @xmath14 tend to saturate the network . moreover , high economic value of @xmath14 lengthen the input FIFO amp spotlight in table [ tab : portion ] , where the total area of the meshwork be given A the breakdown of the build city block , namely the input FIFO , the crossbars ( cb ) , the production registers , the root algorithm / memory ( ra / m ) , the identifier memory ( i m ) and the locating memory board ( lm ) is yield for roughly significant case : the highest throughput ( light - gray ) , the high expanse ( mid - gray ) , and crushed area ( dark - gray ) point for apiece @xmath34 value in table [ tab : mhoms_results ] .
