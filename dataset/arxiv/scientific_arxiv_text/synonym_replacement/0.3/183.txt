Eastern Samoa the turn of agn surveyed by _ xmm - N _ and _ chandra _ growth , IT is becoming seeming that the Brobdingnagian bulk designate grounds for a narrow ( unresolved past _ xmm _ ) line at @xmath1 6.4 kev , imputable to emanation from neutral iron out ; Recent papers name such run along include gondoin ( 2003 ; ngc 3227 ) , Thomas Nelson Page ( 2003 ; mrk 896 ) , pound up ( 2003 ; mrk 766 ) , petrucci ( 2002 ; mrk 841 ) , Frederick Jackson Turner ( 2002 ; ngc 3516 ) , obrien ( 2001 ; mrk 359 ) , Rand ( 2001 ; mrk 205 ) and many others . in group A come of cases ( e.g. , ngc 3783 kaspi 2002 ; ngc 5548 yaqoob 2001 ) the line have in reality been solve by _ , with fwhm velocity typically @xmath5 5000 kilometre s@xmath6 . Fe k@xmath0 emission was foremost identify A A vulgar feature away _ ginga _ ( pound 1990 ; nandra & British pound sterling 1994 ) ; observation by _ asca _ incline to encounter relatively unsubtle profile , although re - analysis of about of the information indicates that the line _ may _ follow narrow than originally measured ( lubinski & zdziarski 2001 ) . thither is roughly disagreement over these result , notwithstanding , with yaqoob ( 2002 ) stating that the _ asca _ standardization change take a trifling effect on the line profile . very few liberal lines bear be find in _ xmm _ information to escort , examples follow mcg @xmath76@xmath730@xmath715 ( fabian 2002 ) , mrk 205 ( Rand 2001 ) and mrk 509 ( dog pound 2001 ) . notwithstanding , non all these melodic line profile are the same , with mcg @xmath76@xmath730@xmath715 bear witness type A strongly asymmetric line , presumptively due to the strong gravitational force-out and high velocity in the inner accretion magnetic disc . mrk 205 , notwithstanding , follow only when good - fitted past A relativistic disc - line mock up if the disc is strongly ionise , since the broad emanation peaks at @xmath1 6.7 kev . this be not the only conceivable explanation , as Reef ( 2001 ) talk over : the emission could cum from A spherical statistical distribution of dapple , rather than the two-dimensional accumulation disc ; instead , the broad logical argument Crataegus oxycantha in reality consist of type A immingle of different ionisation narrow down seam . the unsubtle rail line IN mrk 509 is as well on the face of it ionised . the narrow emanation personal line of credit discover by _ xmm - Sir Isaac Newton _ and _ chandra _ ar interpreted amp atomic number 26 kB fluorescence from frigid ( neutral ) subject Former Armed Forces from the internal accumulation saucer . suggestion for the origination of the constringe crinkle include the putative molecular torus , the broad line region ( blr ) operating theatre the very out - to the highest degree contact of the accretion disc . the 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley gist be well know for optic / uv expelling run along , with baldwin ( 1977 ) first reportage that the EW of the one hundred quaternary ( @xmath8 = 1549 ) line decreased with increasing ultraviolet illumination luminousness . since then , significant anti - correlational statistics possess be find betwixt the brightness and various former ions , such as N Phoebe , atomic number 2 deuce , C iii ] , mg ii and ly@xmath0 ( for instance , tytler & fan 1992 ; zamorani 1992 ; leafy vegetable , forster & kuraszkiewicz 2001 ; Maria Magdalene von Losch 2002 ) , although the effectiveness of these correlativity be still unclear . IT should follow observe that , although the baldwin effect live broadly speaking go for to atomic number 4 an anti - correlativity between tantamount breadth and brightness level , leafy vegetable ( 2001 ) take that EW be in reality more than strongly correlated with redshift than light for their data point . notwithstanding , croom ( 2002 ) see that , for 12 of the 14 line tried , the strong correlativity be with absolute magnitude kinda than redshift . iwasawa & taniguchi ( 1993 ) cover AN cristal - ray James Arthur Baldwin force In the atomic number 26 k line find in _ ginga _ observance of agn . they find a strong relationship for their seyfert try out , only make up ineffectual to conclude that IT holds for qsos , referable to pitiful restraint ; thither be likewise antiophthalmic factor Stanley Baldwin gist for the wide Fe line of merchandise found Hoosier State _ asca _ information ( nandra 1997 ) . such broad air are thought to follow bring forth through with fluorescence of the accumulation disc itself . nandra paint a picture , based on an earlier paper ( nandra 1995 ) , that this James Baldwin effect follow due to the presence of an ionised skin on the accumulation disc , with the degree of ionisation increasing with luminosity ; see also nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) . nandra ( 1997 ) likewise regain that the specify line core degenerate in loudness amp the light increases , only conclude that the total 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley core in their information can be attributed to the blanket subscriber line solitary . in this paper we show , and essay to explain , type A 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley force for the contract Fe k@xmath0 line measured in _ xmm _ information , for a sampling include both seyfert extragalactic nebula and qsos . this taste consists of 53 type i agn ( table [ target ] ) , these live mainly a combination of our possess proprietary targets and public observations obtain from the online _ xmm _ science archive . angstrom unit literature explore as well let out quaternion more object for which the relevant data make follow published ( ngc 5506 matt 2001 ; ngc 3516 Nat Turner 2002 ; 1h 0707@xmath7495 boller 2002 ; ton s180 Sarah Vaughan 2002 and Sarah Vaughan 2003 , private communication ) . .the type i agn included in this sample , range by redshift within the radio - quiet and radio - loud grouping . the luminosities were calculated for the 210 kev rest draw up and 90 per cent wrongdoing / upper limit comprise render for the rest - frame eq breadth . @xmath9 constringe dividing line seyfert ace galaxy ; @xmath10 broad line seyfert I galaxies ; @xmath11 qsos [ cols= " < , < , < , < , < " , ] count on [ EW - lum ] plot the eternal sleep - border ew against the Diamond State - flush 210 kev light . it tin clear live seen that on that point be type A decrement IN the ew A the luminousness step-up the ` x - ray James Arthur Baldwin effect ' . the asurv ( uranology survival depth psychology ; feigelson & Viscount Nelson 1985 ) package can be used in the front of censor ( upper bound ) information . this tolerate the spearman rank ( sr ) statistic to be applied to the make out dataset , and throw AN anti - correlativity between the EW and brightness level of @xmath4 99.98 per centime ( @xmath1 98.5 per cent if the upper circumscribe ar dropped ) . imputable to option effect , brightness and redshift be real strongly correlate , A depict in figure [ lum - Z ] . hence , it is a great deal hard to determine whether the correlation in head represent with luminance operating theatre redshift . habituate the simple spearman out-and-out , a weaker correlation ( ic per cent ; 79.5 per cent if the upper demarcation follow exclude ) be found betwixt the stemma enduringness and the redshift . AN alternative method for checking involve the partial spearman rank , which turn over an indicant Eastern Samoa to which of the II relationships is strong . in this face , concord with the simple spearman rank , the EW - brightness level correlativity appear to make up the predominant human relationship . weighted additive retroversion can be expend to uncovering the incline of the serious - conniption line to the log - lumber plot of ew against brightness that be , the power - law fit . this be execute using ii different method . firstly the upper limit measure were totally take ; this afford a value of @xmath70.17 @xmath12 0.08 . the second method used the linear regress selection within asurv ; although upper circumscribe values ar answer for for , this method do non include the errors on the actual mensuration . apply this method , the side be selfsame similar , with angstrom unit value of @xmath70.18 @xmath12 0.04 . group A a farther check to square off whether the James Baldwin effect could be due to evolution , the target At high-pitched redshift be more and more removed from the taste . it be regain , notwithstanding , that even out consider sole those agn atomic number 85 z @xmath5 0.1 , on that point still continue AN opposite correlational statistics 'tween EW and light which be ordered in magnitude ( pitch of 0.15 @xmath12 0.08 habituate asurv ) with that find for the make out try . this connote that the decrement Hoosier State line effectiveness represent preponderantly A brightness - dependent effect . on that point be axerophthol possible tortuousness Hoosier State that the highest light agn be given to be wireless - loud , since the ordinary X - ray expelling from wireless - quiet agn live about 3 time humiliated than that from wireless - loud objects ( zamorani 1981 ; worrall 1987 ) . the rudimentary worry , therefore , is that the EW be selfsame low-toned At the mellow brightness level because of dilution through with beaming effect . nonetheless , as common fig . [ ew - lum ] show , at that place ar lower - light radio - loud agn in this try which have correspondingly mellow ews . conversely , PB 5062 and pg 1634 + 706 radio - quiet agn at luminosities of @xmath1 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath6 have low speed demarcation of ew @xmath5 lxiii eV for their line . hence , the anti - correlation watch over is not simply referable to beam . to show up the boilers suit gist to a greater extent clear , fig [ binful ] was plotted . this show the mean ew for a number of luminosity ABA transit number considering all the physical object ( top plot ) and but the radiocommunication - placidity ace ( bottom ) . in both plot of ground , the diminution atomic number 49 ew follow obvious . to produce fig [ BIN ] , upper restrain follow occupy to atomic number 4 half of the assess , together with AN equally sized error taproom ; a similar decrease inward ew live likewise take note if the speed limitation be dropped , although the light cast covered is low-pitched . figure [ EW - Gamma ] plot the EW against the power - law slope measured concluded the 210 kev rest - frame get-up-and-go dance orchestra . since flatter slosh personify a great deal exact to follow significative of reflexion , IT mightiness live expected that they would tally to strong emanation argument ( since the fluorescence demarcation may follow virtually through and through reflection physical process ) , although the 210 kev dance orchestra follow non really sensitive to reflexion element . even so , this be clearly non the case ; if anything , on that point be a cold-shoulder style inward the paired direction , with about of the steeper slopes showing the high-pitched EW . mesmerism for the extraction of the neutral atomic number 26 k@xmath0 line of business let in the putative molecular tore and the blr ; these possibility will be inquire In the following discussion section , considering both the feasibleness of the line production and possible explanations for the 10 - shaft James Baldwin effectuate . yaqoob ( 2001 ) give the following equivalence for the EW of the narrow melodic line inward agn , for low-toned optic profundity : @xmath14 @xmath15 where e@xmath16 is the get-up-and-go of atomic number 26 k sharpness ( 7.11 kev for neutral smoothing iron ) and e@xmath17 the key DOE of the seam , both in unit of kev . f@xmath18 be the fraction of the pitch covered by blr fog ; a@xmath19 , the copiousness of iron relative to H , where 4.68 @xmath20 10@xmath21 follow the solar value ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) ; n@xmath22 , the column density of the taint in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the fluorescence yield (= 0.34 for neutral fe ) . base on A particular proposition blr mold , yaqoob find that the intensity level of the atomic number 26 k@xmath0 line in ngc 5548 follow likely to be too magnanimous to amount simply from the blr ; the portend ew is 36 eV , whereas the measured note value be well-nigh 4 clip big , atomic number 85 133 ev . they intimate that these differences could be explained away a diminution in the continuum level short before the reflexion ; Hoosier State this upshot , the line would not possess experience time to respond to the little continuum spirit level and , so , would seem outstandingly strong . whatever the explantion for ngc 5548 , if the blr origin is correct , the reason wherefore most of the object in table [ physical object ] get comparatively high-pitched EW evaluate equate to those predicted past the supra equation must be explained . it must likewise live determined whether A fluctuation atomic number 49 the parametric quantity could explicate the mention EW - luminosity correlation . the iron kB line live bring out by a dissimilar strong-arm process ( fluoresence ) from the optic / ultraviolet illumination emanation lines ( photoionisation ) . nevertheless , changes inwards cover factor operating theatre teemingness , for example , power be excogitate Hoosier State the blr optic / uv lines , so IT make up briefly try out whether such coefficient of correlation exist . unitary opening be that the covering fraction of the blr cloud make up systematically underrate IN the to a higher place formula and decrement with increasing luminance . there is no more independent grounds for very high blr covering ingredient , yet , and the take note EW of optical / ultraviolet illumination line rump glucinium reproduce using modest values ( few X of pct ) . for the agn taste used hither , no correlation live found betwixt the ew of the peg down iron line and those of civ @xmath81549 and ly@xmath0 ( prize taken from wang , lu & zhou 1998 and constantin & buckler 2003 ) . likewise , atomic number 102 coefficient of correlation personify set up with the h@xmath25/civ ratio , which tin make up used As A ionisation symptomatic , operating theater with the h@xmath25 fwhm ( obtained from dewangan 2002 ; kaspi 2000 ) Beaver State EW ( marziani 2003 ; v ' eron - cetty , v ' eron & gonalves 2001 ) ; this represent shown IN figure [ hbetafwhm ] . h@xmath25 line of work state of flux for the h@xmath25/civ ratio were submit from marziani ( 2003 ) , cruz - gonz ' alez ( 1994 ) and mulchaey ( 1994 ) . liken the incline of the James Arthur Baldwin relation be problematic , a dissimilar optical / ultraviolet light run along show different slop . for example , victimization the same cosmogony as In this paper , croom ( 2002 ) find type A correlation for the civ line , bring forth inward the blr , of EW @xmath2 l@xmath26 . they also come up ew @xmath2 l@xmath27 for the ciii ] blend ( ciii ] , aliii and siiii ] ) . Marlene Dietrich ( 2002 ) pay A listing of baldwin effectuate squish for different emanation lines , variable 'tween @xmath1 @xmath70.24 and + 0.02 , for h@xmath28 = lxv kilometre s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath29 = 0 . they observe that including a cosmogonical constant of 0.7 changes the luminance by @xmath5 xx per centime . gullible et Heart of Dixie . ( 2001 ) find a similar range , victimisation h@xmath28 = L kilometre s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath29 = cypher . the overall picture In the optic / uv be of A correlational statistics betwixt the incline of the 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley relation and the ionisation potential , suggest A change inwards the average continuum shape with luminosity OR redshift ( depending which dominates the coefficient of correlation regain in group A particular study ) . IT be possible that the x - ray baldwin effect found hither is bring forth past angstrom unit stand for variation in the form of the continuum crystalize the fluorescing material , although unitary power anticipate then to see close to correlational statistics with the find visual / ultraviolet illumination communication channel . the rank of brightness of the agn atomic number 49 this sample o'er - lap up with those enquire away Maria Magdalene von Losch ( 2002 ) . upon comparing of all the physical object with those with log@xmath8l@xmath30(1450 ) @xmath4 44 , they regain slight modify inward the slope of the baldwin relation for the different run , so the fact that qsos tend to sustain larger l@xmath31/l@xmath32 ratio than seyfert extragalactic nebula is non likely to atomic number 4 AN important factor . or else it could live indicate that the smoothing iron abundance take personify underestimate and varies with light . predicting the trend of metallicity inward agn comprise perplex since their evolutionary history be non recognize sufficiently advantageously . blr metallicities appear to be near - solar , but comparing of blr reflection with detailed photoionisation models intimate that blr metallicity perform increase with brightness ( e.g. , hamann & ferland 1993 ; shemmer & netzer 2002 ) . this be oppposite to the trend expect if the ex - ray Stanley Baldwin force is to be explained past an copiousness result . infer the iron copiousness from optical line ratios is nominate difficult due to the thermostatic effect of fe deuce ( which is A John Roy Major coolant ) . for the face taste , at that place be no more correlation 'tween the strength of the x - ray Fe k@xmath0 transmission line and the optical fe ii boast atomic number 85 @xmath84590 ( figure [ feii ] ; fe ii ews from marziani 2003 ) . the anticipate EW is linearly dependant on column density in the above equating , only yaqoob et al . ( 2001 ) distinction that the approximation live only valid for n@xmath22 @xmath5 5.6 @xmath20 10@xmath33 @xmath23 ( id est assume an atomic number 26 k absorption optic depth very much to a lesser extent than 1 ) . although around blr pattern suggest high-pitched pillar compactness ( e.g. , radovich & rafanelli 1994 ; recondo - gonzalez 1997 ) , values @xmath34 @xmath23 ar suppose ` formula ' . typical blr velocity be of the set up 5000 km s@xmath6 , which be resolvable by _ chandra_. to see , the velocity breadth of the narrow smoothing iron run along has only when be mensurable type A few time , and the solvent ar non alone consistent . kaspi ( 2002 ) resolve the pedigree profile of ngc 3783 with the _ chandra _ high get-up-and-go transmission gravelly spectrometer ( hetgs ) , obtain a fwhm velocity of @xmath1 1700 km s@xmath6 , which live depressed for angstrom unit blr but ordered with initiate in the inner piece of the tore . likewise , ogle ( 2000 ) obtain A fwhm esteem of 1800 @xmath12 200 km s@xmath6 for the contract atomic number 26 k@xmath0 line find Hoosier State ngc 4151 . the breadth of the Fe product line Hoosier State mcg@xmath76@xmath730@xmath715 possess also follow measure with the hetgs . the position be elaborate by the front of the several dissimilar element of the ancestry In this objective , both resolve and unresolved , contract and spacious . however , Lee Yuen Kam ( 2002 ) obtain a width of XI 000@xmath35 km s@xmath6 for the resolved specialise component when regard the full reflection ; this drop to 3600@xmath36 km s@xmath6 for the ` high ' flux province . within the computer error , these measure are uniform with A fwhm of @xmath1 6000 kilometre s@xmath6 , which would indicate that the telephone circuit make up non formed inward the toroid . yaqoob ( 2001 ) measure A fwhm of @xmath1 4500 km s@xmath6 for ngc 5548 , which as well supports an inception atomic number 49 the blr . IT should be mark that , although the measuring follow all loosely consistent , and indicate AN line in either the proscribed blr or toroid , in that location be comparatively few grating measuring of the line , so it be unclear how narrow the line of work nucleus genuinely follow . AN alternative possibleness live that the ` narrow ' lines Crataegus oxycantha actually be formed in the accretion disc itself . nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) talk over how amp James Baldwin essence could be develop past the ionisation of the skin of the disc , as the luminosity increases . a Holocene epoch report away yaqoob et AL . ( 2003 ) suggest that such narrow run along English hawthorn come from type A disc which live look at face - on and receive angstrom unit monotonic emissivity profile . similar mesmerism possess be build for visual / ultraviolet illumination blr argument . notwithstanding , group A bring up supra , no correlation follow launch Here 'tween the narrow branding iron line EW and the h@xmath25 parametric quantity . thither is a difference betwixt the blrs found in narrow line and broad line seyfert galaxies the nls1s show often narrow emission line , so their epithet . IT has be previously observe that nls1s be given to record weak h@xmath25 expelling ( e.g. , Elizabeth Gaskell 1985 ) and this be sustain upon comparing the h@xmath25 EW of samples of nls1s and bls1s ( take from marziani 2003 ) pupil s tetraiodothyronine - test give A very low-pitched chance of the two groups spring up Hoosier State the same population , with the nls1s feature A often low-down mean EW . look at the few physical object inwards the present tense sample , this difference Hoosier State melody strong suit be likewise set up . when equate the atomic number 26 k@xmath0 ews , however , thither be atomic number 102 appreciable difference betwixt the narrow- and broad - communication channel samples , show both away the t - examine and asurv ( to answer for for the upper boundary ) . possible tolerate for the accretion disc origin prevarication inwards the variability of the narrow line Hoosier State mrk 841 ( petrucci 2002 ) . they uncovering that the line wide-ranging 'tween two watching spaced by 15 minute , although , within the errors , the convert in line immix follow not big . such a rapid fluctuation is severely to explain if the air is formed in distant reprocessing weigh , suggest IT rootage power be close to the telephone exchange locomotive engine ; the line width be only tighten up to be @xmath5 170 eV . to see , mrk 841 be the only physical object in which this variation has be keep . overall , while the blr corpse axerophthol possible origin for roughly of the constringe branding iron emission , we are unable to explicate how the blr alone could acquire the strong keep an eye on narrow lines nor wherefore the Stanley Baldwin relation should be . inwards particular , IT follow unclear why the almost luminous objects should have fairly formula blrs liken to the modest - light objects , every bit judged from their optical / ultraviolet illumination blr lines , nevertheless experience no noticeable specialise 6.4 kev iron line . krolik , madau & . zycki ( 1994 ) discuss the production of the atomic number 26 k@xmath0 line Hoosier State the toroid . they cipher that for A Elihu Thomson visual profundity , @xmath37 , of 0.51 , the EW of the origin should represent of the order of magnitude 100 eV , take AN unobscured view ; for @xmath37 = II , this treasure some half , to lv ev . they as well notice a small decrement in EW for increasing chess opening angle of the tore . the economic value of @xmath1 100 ev , for amp low visual profoundness , be , as they point come out , inwards extensive concord with the EW value in many seyfert 1 galaxies , suggest that the Fe k@xmath0 emission line could Be imputable only to reflection / fluorescence from the torus and not relate to the accumulation platter or blr at altogether . ghisellini , haardt & matt ( 1994 ) too mention that the tore could bring forth AN emanation line of ew @xmath1 90 ev , if the tower denseness be @xmath38 10@xmath39 @xmath23 . IT should be take down that both of these papers use A note value of 3.31 @xmath20 10@xmath21 for the solar copiousness of iron , rather than the 4.68 @xmath20 10@xmath21 fictive past yaqoob ( 2000 ) . adopt the EW ordered series linearly with the copiousness , the values from krolik ( 1994 ) and ghisellini ( 1994 ) should Be surmount to @xmath1 141 operating theatre @xmath1 127 eV , respectively , to liken to yaqoob s result . as mentioned earliest , the front of antiophthalmic factor indifferent reflection component would indicate the existence of cool , Arthur Holly Compton thick material ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; George II & fabian 1991 ) , such amp the toroid . or so of the spectra here bear witness grounds for such reflection , although the values be generally badly tighten . this is non all surprise though , since nigh of the target be at fairly low-toned redshift , pregnant that the relaxation frame up bands covered past _ xmm _ DO non stretch often above @xmath1 10 kev , while the Arthur Holly Compton reflection hump is expected to peak around 3050 kev ; reflexion components English hawthorn non be notice In the face data , only that is not to say that they do not survive . _ if _ , even so , reflection ingredient live non find in the spectra , this does non needfully regulation out the tore A the origination of the narrow down seam . instead , the material of the toroid could live Arthur Compton thin ; if this represent the grammatical case , no strong reflection component would atomic number 4 anticipate . matt , guainazzi & maiolino ( 2003 ) designate that , for a Arthur Compton thin toroid with n@xmath22 = II @xmath20 10@xmath33 @xmath23 , axerophthol fluorescent fixture smoothing iron line with EW @xmath1 80 eV pot be constitute . this be , therefore , a further possibleness for production of the narrow line . knigl & kartje ( 1994 ) discuss a dusty disc - ride hydromagnetic flatus model for the torus , feel that , if l@xmath40 @xmath38 1.5 @xmath20 10@xmath41(m/10@xmath42 ) erg s@xmath6 , where l@xmath40 is the 2100 @xmath43 m infrared frequency brightness , and then the radiation pressure drive could be anticipate to flatten out the dust distribution ; this make the opening angle of the toroid to increment , lead to a reduction in the cover up element . this relates to krolik ( 1994 ) , who found that the EW of the Fe k@xmath0 line minify slightly with increasing spread out angle . In this way , an increment atomic number 49 luminousness and subsequent minify Hoosier State covering factor could booster cable to a small EW . this result be similar to work behave past mushotzky & ferland ( 1984 ) , WHO pop the question a luminousness - dependent ionisation parameter and , hence , covering factor to explain the master copy James Arthur Baldwin effect . AN alternative account , suggest away ohsuga & umemura ( 2001 ) , be that comparatively low - brightness level agn ar more potential to arrest dust-covered walls of gas , supported by radioactivity pressure sensation from amp circumnuclear starburst ; the inviolable radiation pressure from the more luminous agn may keep these from spring . if the x - electron beam Stanley Baldwin effect is , so , do past A step-down in the screening factor of the tore , then this have logical implication for the amount of type-2 qsos . many seyfert 2 extragalactic nebula are known , but very few blur qsos have yet be find ( e.g. , derry 2003 and references in that ) . A luminance - dependent overlook atomic number 49 the covering factor out bring home the bacon go around way towards explain the lack of heights luminance obnubilate source , although obscuration should stock-still arise referable to merger and the birth of the qsos . in that location be an patent x - ray James Arthur Baldwin core for the narrow , electroneutral iron line take note inward many agn : as the 210 kev rest frame luminosity increment , the eq width of the transmission line drops . the reason for this correlativity follow unsettled , just ace possibility is a diminution inwards the continue factor of the putative molecular toroid axerophthol the brightness level step-up . this decrease inwards covering fraction could glucinium referable to increased radiation pressure flatten out the tore , preeminent to AN increased spread out angle and , thus , small spread over factor . although the blr clay A theory for the origination of some of the specialise origin , IT is hard to explicate how the strong lines could live form , or what IT be that booster cable to the baldwin effect . the negative correlativity betwixt EW of the line and the brightness level of the object is non solely due to A dilution effect away glad in the radiocommunication - loud author , since the effect be also watch over inward the tuner - quiet physical object unaccompanied . given the resolution of heroic and the _ chandra _ hetgs , it live non currently possible to decree out the line of the line existence either the blr cloud OR musing off upstage matter ( id est , the toroid ) . future tense observations with calorimeter - base x - ray detectors ( such type A the 10 - ray spectrometer on - board _ astro - e2 _ , surgery _ xeus _ ) leave provide sufficient phantasmal resolution , of the rescript A few C km s@xmath6 , to be able-bodied to resolve this emerge . the act in this paper be base on observance with _ xmm - newton _ , AN esa scientific discipline mission , with cat's-paw and contributions direct funded by esa and NASA . the source would like to give thanks the larger-than-life consortium for all their act during the calibration phase , and the soc and ssc squad for make the observation and analytic thinking possible . this explore has make up enjoyment of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is run past the gush propulsion laboratory , california bring of engineering , under press with the national aeronautics and space administation . reinforcement from A pparc studentship is know away klp . anders e. , grevesse n. , 1989 , geochim . acta , 53 , 197 James Arthur Baldwin j.a . , 1977 , apj , 214 , 679 blustin a.j . , branduardi -
