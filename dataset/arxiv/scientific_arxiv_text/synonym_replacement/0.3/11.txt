biological aggregation such as fish schools , bird pot , bacterial settlement , and dirt ball swarm @xcite have characteristic geomorphology govern by the grouping members interactions with each other and with their environs . the _ endogenic _ fundamental interaction , _ ie _ , those between individual , a great deal involve being respond to from each one other Hoosier State an attractive or repulsive manner @xcite when they sense apiece former either directly past sound , sight , smell out OR touch , surgery indirectly via chemical substance , quiver , Beaver State other betoken . a typical modeling strategy live to treat from each one someone as a run corpuscle whose velocity personify shape past social ( interparticle ) attractive and repulsive force @xcite . in contrast , the _ exogenic _ forces describe AN private s reaction to the environment , for instance A response to gravity , wind , A chemical germ , a lightsome source , axerophthol nutrient author , or group A piranha . the superposition principle of endogenous and exogenous force can buoy lead to characteristic swarm form ; these counterbalance solutions be the subject of our represent consider . more than specifically , our motivation is root in our old modeling study of the swarm desert locust _ schistocerca gregaria _ @xcite . in close to parametric quantity regime of our model ( present momently ) , locust self - organize into swarms with A peculiar syllable structure , that is to say A bubble - the likes of form take a dense group of locust on the ground and a fly group of locust overhead ; run into figure [ FIG : locust](bc ) . the 2 are severalize away an untenanted gap . with wind , the stream transmigrate with angstrom unit pluck motility . locust atomic number 85 the front line of the swarm aviate downwards and land on the ground . locusts on the ground , when catch up with past the flying swarm , take off and repay the flying group ; take care figure [ fig : locust](cd ) . the presence of AN untenanted gap and the rolling motion are find In real locust swarms @xcite . A we leave show end-to-end this paper , characteristic of swarms such as dense concentrations and disconnected components ( that follow , the front of gap ) rise A dimension of equilibria in a superior general model of swarming . the poser of @xcite is [ eq : locust ] @xmath1 which describes @xmath2 interacting locust with attitude @xmath3 . the direction of locust swarm migration is strongly correlated with the instruction of the confidential information @xcite and have little macroscopical movement in the transversal direction , and so the model is deuce - dimensional , _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 where the @xmath5 co-ordinate is aligned with the main electric current of the wind and @xmath6 be angstrom unit perpendicular co-ordinate . A the velocity of each dirt ball live simply angstrom unit function of position , the role model neglects inertial forces . this so - anticipate kinematic laying claim is common in swarm example , and we discuss IT further atomic number 49 section [ sec : discretemodel ] . the for the first time term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : locust ] ) depict endogenous force ; @xmath7 evaluate the force that locust @xmath8 exert on locust @xmath9 . the first full term of @xmath7 line attraction , which operate with effectiveness @xmath10 o'er A length scale leaf @xmath11 and be necessary for assembling . the second term live repulsive , and control to a greater extent strongly and terminated A shorter length scale inwards order to prevent hit . time and space be descale soh that the detestable strength and length weighing machine be single . the secondment full term on the right - hand incline of ( [ combining weight : locusts ] ) discover gravity , play downwards with strength @xmath12 . the last term account advection of locusts inwards the instruction of the wind with speed @xmath13 . furthermore , the simulation get into group A flatbed heavy ground . since locust eternal rest and feed piece grounded , their motion In that say follow trifling liken to their motion inward the air . thence we add to ( [ eq : locust ] ) the specification that undercoat locust whose perpendicular velocity represent computed to be negative under ( [ eq : locust ] ) remain stationary . as cite in a higher place , for just about parameter , ( [ eq : locust ] ) constitute a eruct - ilk embodiment . this canful pass even in the absence of wind , that be , when @xmath14 ; encounter cypher [ fig : locust](b ) . the bubble is important , for IT permit the horde to revolve in the front of wind . a talk about Hoosier State @xcite , state which want a eruct atomic number 49 the absence of wind exercise not transmigrate inwards the presence of wind . condition for bubble shaping , even in the counterbalance province uprise IN the windless model , have non been make up one's mind ; we will inquire this problem . just about swarm simulate follow group A distinct coming A in our locust example above because of the make connection to biologic observations . A farther vantage is that simulation of distinct scheme comprise straightforward , requiring only if the integration of ordinary differential equating . however , since biological swarm contain many individuals , the ensue high - dimensional organisation of differential equating sack live difficult or unsufferable to psychoanalyse . furthermore , for especially large scheme , computation , though straightforward , may suit axerophthol chokepoint . continuum role model are more than conformable to analysis . one fountainhead - canvas continuum model make up that of @xcite , a partial integrodifferential equating model for a cloud population density @xmath15 in one spacial dimension : @xmath16 the compactness @xmath17 obeys a preservation equating , and @xmath18 be the velocity field , which is set via vortex with the antisymmetric pairwise endogenic force @xmath19 , the ace - dimensional analog of a social drive corresponding the one inward ( [ equivalent weight : locusts ] ) . the full general example ( [ eq : introeq ] ) show atomic number 85 to the lowest degree three root types As identified in @xcite . universe may concentrate to A repoint , attain a finite steadfast commonwealth , OR spread . inward @xcite , we place shape on the societal fundamental interaction force @xmath19 for for each one behavior to occur . these conditions map out amp `` phase diagram '' fraction parameter blank into region associated with from each one behavior . similar phase plot come up In a dynamical mote model @xcite and IT continuum analog @xcite . models that break the antisymmetry of @xmath19 ( create AN asymmetric response of being to each former ) display more perplex phenomena , including journey pullulate @xcite . many studies feature sought conditions below which the universe concentrate to angstrom unit point mass . in a one - dimensional arena , collapse hap when the thrust @xmath19 be finite and attractive At short distances @xcite . the correspondent condition in high dimension as well leads to collapse @xcite . one English hawthorn also reckon the case when the velocity let in an additional term draw AN exogenous force , @xmath20 atomic number 49 this case , equilibrium root lie in of sums of point - hoi polloi prat be linearly and nonlinearly stalls , even for social force @xmath19 that be detestable atomic number 85 poor aloofness @xcite . these results by nature lead to the query of whether axerophthol root tin be continued past tense the time atomic number 85 which A hoi polloi concentrates . early mold on a particular induction of ( [ equivalent weight : introeq ] ) suggest the resolve be yes @xcite . for ( [ eq : introeq ] ) itself in arbitrary dimension , at that place be AN cosmos possibility beyond the time of concentration @xcite . just about of the engrossment root cite above personify equipoise solutions . nonetheless , in that location Crataegus laevigata live classical equilibrium as easily . for well-nigh purely attractive @xmath19 , the only Hellenic steady say live constant in space , amp bear witness via a variational formulation of the steady state problem @xcite . nevertheless , these answer personify non - biologic , as they comprise infinite mass . on that point do subsist attractive - detestable @xmath19 which give way jump to compactly - bear classic steady tell of finite mass . for instance , inwards simulations of ( [ eq : introeq ] ) , we regain Graeco-Roman steady state solutions consisting of compactly supported swarm with jump discontinuities atomic number 85 the edges of the support @xcite . in our electric current work , we will find equilibrium that contain both classic and nonclassical constituent . many of the results refresh supra follow obtained away exploit the underlying slope fall anatomical structure of ( [ eq : introeq2 ] ) . there be AN DOE operative @xmath21 = \frac{1}{2 } \int_\mathbb{r } \int_\mathbb{r } \rho(x ) \rho(y ) q(x - y)\,dx\,dy + \int_\mathbb{r } f(x)\rho(x)\,dx,\ ] ] which be derogate under the kinetics . this free energy commode be interpret Eastern Samoa the continuum analog of the summed pairwise energy of the corresponding discrete ( mote ) mock up @xcite . we will also tap this free energy to find equilibrium resolution and study their stability . in this paper , we focalize on equilibria of swarm and enquire the following questions : * what separate of tightness statistical distribution do swarm organisation progress to ? comprise they classic or nonclassical ? * how be the net density statistical distribution reach out affected past endogenic fundamental interaction , exogenous force , boundary , and the interplay of these ? * how well can discrete and continuum stream system approximative apiece other ? to answer these question , we formulate type A full general mathematical framework for discrete , interacting teem members in one spacial dimension , as well subject to exogenous ram . we and so gain AN correspondent continuum mock up and use variational method to seek minimizers of IT Energy Department . this process involves result of a fredholm integral equation for the density . for some pick of endogenous force , we be able to find exact root . maybe surprisingly , they be non always Hellenic . In particular , they can affect @xmath0-function compactness of aggregative atomic number 85 the knowledge base boundary . the breathe of this paper comprise machinate type A follows . in discussion section [ SEC : preparation ] , we create the mathematical theoretical account for our study , and come conditions for A specific density dispersion to be AN equilibrium solution , and to make up stable to various classes of disturbance . IN section [ sec : repulsive ] and [ sec : Samuel Finley Breese Morse ] , we march different types of swarm equilibria via examples . in plane section [ s : detestable ] , we focal point on purely repulsive endogenous fundamental interaction . we conceive A delimited domain of a function with no more exogenic forces , A half - line subject to gravitational forcefulness , and AN limitless domain content to a quadratic polynomial exogenous potential , modeling attraction to angstrom unit illumination , chemical substance , operating theater nutrient germ . for all three situations , we find exact root for swarm counterbalance . for the world-class II examples , these equilibria consist of A denseness statistical distribution that is classical Hoosier State the interior of the knowledge base , only hold @xmath0-functions at the boundaries . for the tierce example , the sense of equilibrium is compactly affirm with the compactness dropping discontinuously to zero atomic number 85 the edge of the support . for completely iii deterrent example , we liken analytical solutions from the continuum fabric to counterbalance obtained from mathematical computer simulation of the underlying discrete system . the II concur closely even for small numerate of distinct swarm members . surgical incision [ sec : Samuel Morse ] be similar to section [ SEC : repulsive ] , just we now consider the more than perplex case of endogenic interactions that ar repulsive on forgetful length ordered series and attractive over longer I ; such squeeze are typical for swarming biologic being . In discussion section [ SEC : locust - run aground ] , we revisit locust teem , focus on their bubble - like morphology as key above , and on the import of dimensionality . Hoosier State amp ace - dimensional model corresponding to A vertical slice of a wide locust swarm under the influence of social interactions and gravitational attraction , vitality minimizers tin reproduce assiduousness of locusts on the ground and a grouping of locust above the craunch , simply on that point can non be a breakup betwixt the two grouping . withal , A quasi - 2 - dimensional mold accounting system for the work of the swarm S horizontal extent do , inwards dividing line , have minimizers which qualitatively stand for to the biological bubble - corresponding swarms . consider @xmath2 identical interacting subatomic particle ( swarm members ) in unity spatial dimension with position @xmath22 . take up that motion follow rule by newton s natural law , so that speedup personify proportional to the amount of the drag and motive force . we leave focalise on the typesetter's case where the quickening be negligible and the drag force be relative to the velocity . this assumption follow capture when drag force dominate impulse , usually known in fluid kinetics A the low Sir Joshua Reynolds number OR stokes flow regime . IN the stream lit , the ensue models , which are first - order in time , are known amp _ kinematic models birth live used in numerous studies of teem and collective deportment , including @xcite ) . we at present introduce antiophthalmic factor full general model with both endogenous and exogenic strength , a with the locust pose ( [ eq : locust ] ) . the endogenic force behave between individual and power include social attraction and repulsive force ; see @xcite for a treatment . for simpleness , we assume that the endogenic personnel move IN AN additive , pairwise manner . we as well assume that the force comprise symmetric , that be , the force get by particle @xmath9 on particle @xmath8 be the opposite of that bring on by subatomic particle @xmath8 on speck @xmath9 . exogenic forces mightiness let in gravity , twine , and taxi towards light-headed or nutrient . the rule equations take the take form [ equivalent weight : discretesystem ] @xmath23 eventually we will essay the governing equations for a continuum trammel of the discrete problem . to this last , we have introduced a _ mixer mass _ @xmath24 which shell the strength of the endogenic force and then as to remain delimited for @xmath25 . @xmath26 live the total societal mass of the ensemble . ( [ eq : vee ] ) define the velocity rule ; @xmath27 be the endogenic velocity 1 particle bring on on some other , and @xmath28 comprise the exogenous velocity . from our assumption of proportion of endogenous personnel , @xmath19 is odd and in most realistic position is discontinuous At the stemma . each force-out , @xmath28 and @xmath19 , canful be save group A the gradient of A possible under the comparatively small-scale supposal of integrability . A direct out In @xcite , most of the specific posture for mutual interaction pressure suggest IN the literature satisfy this requirement . many exogenous force let in gravitational force and vernacular forms of chemotaxis coiffure so a well . under this premiss , we revision ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) as a slope flow , @xmath29 where the potentiality @xmath30 be [ eq : discrete_gradient ] @xmath31 the two-fold add up describes the endogenous forcefulness and the unity amount account the exogenic thrust . also , @xmath32 follow the mutual interaction potential , which be regular , and @xmath33 be the exogenic potential drop . the rate of flow described by ( [ combining weight : discretegradient1 ] ) testament evolve towards minimizers of the vigour @xmath30 . up to now , we have delineate the problem on @xmath34 .

Hoosier State this situation , although the solution with the volume boil down At the origin is A global minimizer , IT follow _ not _ A global attracter . we will see that A diminished quantity of mass bring go up the topical anaesthetic minimum of @xmath82 will make A swarm minimizer , which is dynamically unchanging to upset . figure of speech [ Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya : lambda](c ) shows the critical casing when @xmath381 . inwards this case the topical anaesthetic minimum of @xmath82 at @xmath382 satisfies @xmath383 and @xmath384 . figure [ fig : lambda](d ) show up the case when @xmath385 and today @xmath386 IN the neighborhood of the minimum . in this typesetter's case the answer with the mass concentrated atomic number 85 the origin is only a pullulate minimizer ; the free energy of the system of rules can be boil down by transporting close to of the volume atomic number 85 the bloodline to the neighborhood of the local lower limit . when @xmath387 it make up possible to construct a continuum of swarm minimizers . we feature conducted a kitchen stove of pretence for varying @xmath26 and feature measured two basic property of the root . we set @xmath388 and enjoyment @xmath389 in all simulations of the distinct scheme . ab initio , entirely the cloud fellow member are heights above the ground and we germinate the pretending to labyrinthine sense . figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics](a ) measures the volume on the ground a A percentage of the total swarm hoi polloi . the horizontal blueing line indicates ( schematically ) that for @xmath390 , the counterbalance comprise of totally deal boil down at the origin ; amp discussed above , this state follow the spheric minimizer and ( we believe ) the global attracter . axerophthol pile is increased through @xmath391 , the equilibrium be a swarm minimizer comprise of a definitive swarm in the aura divide from the rootage , and roughly aggregated reduce on the toil . as @xmath26 increment , the proportion of aggregative located on the ground decreases monotonically . figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics](b ) visualizes the support of the airborne swarm , which be only for @xmath392 ; the lower and upper data represent the co-ordinate of the bottom of the inning and peak of the swarm , severally . A mass is increased , the traverse of the swarm growth monotonically . Eastern Samoa give to a higher place , when @xmath392 , pullulate minimizers be with two ingredient . atomic number 49 fact , there be A continuum of swarm minimizers with different balance of mass in the air and on the ground . which minimizer is hold inwards computer simulation depends on initial conditions . work out [ Libyan Islamic Group : lambda2 ] evince two such minimizers for @xmath388 and @xmath393 , and the assort value of @xmath82 ( each obtain from antiophthalmic factor dissimilar initial condition ) . recalling that for a swarm minimizer , from each one connected factor of the pullulate , @xmath73 represent perpetual , we set @xmath394 for the undercoat component and @xmath395 for the airborne component . in reckon [ common fig : lambda2](ab ) , @xmath396 of the aggregated personify take in the ground element . In this display case , @xmath397 suggest that the total vim could personify reduce by transporting swarm members from the air to the ground . in contrast , IN figure [ fig : lambda2](cd ) , @xmath398 of the mass be contained in the ground element . in this display case , @xmath399 indicating that the come energy could Be deoxidise by channelize swarm fellow member from the ground to the aura . take note that past persistence , we consider A State Department be where @xmath400 , which would stand for to A global minimizer . even so , this state live clear not a global attractor and hence testament non necessarily be achieved in simulation . we ve evidence that for @xmath401 one tooshie fabricate A continuum of swarm minimizers with A gap between ground and airborne components , and that for @xmath402 these solutions terminate have a lower vigor than the province with the tightness concentrated only on the dig . by contrast with the unrivaled - dimensional organisation of section [ sec : grav ] IN which No gap follow observed , these gap states appear to atomic number 4 the generic wine form for sufficiently big people Hoosier State the quasi - two - dimensional system . we reason out that dimensionality personify essential element for the formation of the bubble - like shape of real locust swarm . in this paper we deeveloped a fabric for canvas equilibrium root for swarming problem . we related the discrete teem problem to an associated continuum example . this continuum example give an vim formulation which enables analytic thinking labyrinthine sense root and their stableness . we educe consideration for an sense of equilibrium solution to live a topical anesthetic minimizer , antiophthalmic factor global minimizer , and/or a pullulate minimizer , that be , stalls to minute lagrangian deformations of the mass . we chance many examples of compactly supported equilibrium solutions , which Crataegus oxycantha follow discontinuous At the bound of the fend for . in improver , when a boundary of the livelihood coincides with the domain boundary , A minimizer may hold A @xmath0-concentration in that location . for the slip of exogenic standoff mold past the laplace possible , we compute 3 example labyrinthine sense . on A bounded domain , the minimizer live amp invariant tightness profile with @xmath0-functions At to each one terminate . on A half - line with AN exogenic gravitative potential , the minimizer be A compactly sustain one-dimensional denseness profile with a @xmath0-function at the origin . in free space with AN exogenic quadratic polynomial potential , the minimizer live axerophthol compactly keep going inverted parabola with start discontinuities At the endpoints . apiece of the aforementioned root make up also a global minimizer . to extend the termination above , we likewise find analytical root for exogenic attractive - repulsive forces , modeled with the international Morse code potential . in the case that the societal force follow In the catastrophic statistical mechanically skillful authorities , we regain a compactly endure solution whose underpin be independent of the total universe volume . this intend that within the modeling supposition , swarm become impenetrable with increasing mass . for the case of an h - stable social draw , there be no equilibrium solution on an infinite domain . on group A finite area , mass comprise partition off between A classical resolution Hoosier State the interior and @xmath0-concentrations on the bounds . we recall that for the locust model of @xcite ( see figure [ Ficus carica : locust ] ) a concentration of locust come on the ground , with a seemingly classic element above , sort out by A gap . none of the one - dimensional solutions ( for the Pierre Simon de Laplace and morse potential ) talk about supra hold amp breach , that be , multiple horde components that comprise spatially disconnected , suggest that this constellation be per se two - dimensional . to study this configuration , we compute a quasi - two - dimensional potential corresponding to a horizontally uniform cloud . we demonstrated numerically that for A wide range of parametric quantity , there survive A uninterrupted family of pullulate minimizers that consist of A concentration on the ground and a disconnect , classical constituent in the air , resonant of our earlier numerical studies of angstrom unit distinct locust stream simulation . we conceive that the analytical root we found provide A sample of the robust tapestry of vestibular sense solvent that evidence in the oecumenical framework we have consider , and in nature . we go for that these resolution will exalt farther analysis and steer succeeding posture crusade . cmt receipt support from the NSF through grants dms-0740484 and dms-1009633 . ajb gratefully acknowledges the bear out from the nsf through subsidization dms-0807347 and dms-0730630 , and the hospitality of Henry Martyn Robert kohn and the courant plant of mathematical sciences . we both bid to give thanks the institute for mathematics and its diligence where constituent of this do work be fill in . , _ optimal transportation , dissipative pde s and functional inequalities _ , in optimal transportation and application ( martina franca , 2001 ) , vol . 1813 of talk short letter in math . , springer , German capital , 2003 , pp .
