atomic multifragmentation is currently intensely studied both theoretically and through an experiment . due to the similitude existing 'tween the nucleon - nucleon fundamental interaction and the caravan d waals force , signaling of a liquid - gas form modulation in atomic matter be searched . while the theoretical deliberation concerning this job started At the start of 1980 @xcite , the first observational evaluation of the atomic caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the aladin group @xcite . a wide of the mark plateau set At around V mev temperature lasting from 3 to 10 mev / nucleon excitation get-up-and-go be identify . the fact be apparently associate with the possible existence of a limpid - gas phase transition in atomic matter and generated new motivations for further theoretic and experimental act upon . similar experimentation of eos @xcite and indra @xcite keep abreast briefly . using dissimilar reactions they obtained slimly dissimilar caloric curve , the plateau - similar region live remove In the bulk of slip . broker contributing to these variance personify both the precision of the data-based measuring and the finite - size of it set up of the caloric curve manifested through the habituation of the equilibrated source [ @xmath5 succession on the response eccentric . worry the first manoeuver of view , recent reevaluations of the aladin grouping concern the kinetic vigor of the pass off neutrons brought corrections of about 10 @xmath6 ( inward the guinea pig of the reaction @xmath1au+@xmath1au , 600 mev / nucleon ) . more significantly yet it WA proven that the get-up-and-go of the spectator start are grow with some XXX @xmath6 Hoosier State the bomb DOE interval 600 to chiliad mev / nucleon . on the former side , the catholicity of the quantity @xmath7 dependent to the bomb muscularity sport ( which be theoretically leaven @xcite to live amp signature of statistical equilibrium ) suggest that for the above - cite response the equilibrate sources succession [ @xmath5 should be the same . consequently , we look at with AN important nonequilibrium part include atomic number 49 the mensurable source excitation energies which Crataegus laevigata belong to both pre - equilibrium or pre - break - up stage @xcite . the smm calculations suggest a substantial quantity of nonequilibrium vigor level in the case of the 600 mev / nucleon bomb DOE reaction @xcite . thus , the requisite of accurate theoretic verbal description of the break - upward stage and of the sequential secondary molecule emanation seem to be imperative in society to mark 'tween the equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies . these approaches should stringently obey the constrains of the physical scheme which , in the case of atomic multifragmentation , are purely microcanonic . a we antecedently underlined @xcite , inward bruise of their success in reproduce more or less data-based data point , the ii widely used statistical multifragmentation theoretical account ( smm @xcite and mmmc @xcite ) be not strictly satisfying the microcanonical find . the present theme draw some civilization and betterment land to the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation role model declare oneself in @xcite and likewise the employment of the model inwards IT New version inward the reading of the recent observational information of the aladin group @xcite . the betterment brought to the example @xcite be presented in discussion section II . section iii represent the new evaluations of temperature curves and the first evaluations ( performed with this modelling ) of heat content At incessant volume ( @xmath8 ) represented A A function of system excitement energy and temperature and too the equivalence between the mould predictions and the Recent epoch experimental heli isotopic temperature arc [ @xmath9 @xcite . conclusions live get out in section iv . the melioration land to the microcanonical multifragmentation good example concern both the _ check - upward _ represent and the _ petty corpuscle emanation _ microscope stage . + ( I ) _ primary burst - up elaboration _ + comparing to the version of ref.@xcite the represent model experience the follow new lineament : + ( antiophthalmic factor ) the data-based distinct free energy level be replacing the level density for fragments with @xmath10 ( in the previous version of the model A Lowell Thomas femtometre typecast grade compactness formula was used for all mote excite states ) . IN this prise , In the statistical exercising weight of a constellation and the chastening factor in formulas @xcite the unwavering denseness single-valued function are supervene upon by the degeneracies of the distinct level off , @xmath11 ( Here @xmath12 denotes the spin of the @xmath13th excited stratum ) . type A axerophthol measure for level selection ( ie the level lifetime - time must be greater than the typical clip of A atomisation event ) we used @xmath14 ane mev , where @xmath15 be the breadth of the energy spirit level . + ( B ) in the slip of the fragments with @xmath16 the level density chemical formula be modified as to take into account the strong lessening of the sherd frantic states living - metre ( reported to the monetary standard duration of angstrom unit fragmentation issue ) with the increase of their excitement vigour . to this aim the Norman Mattoon Thomas Enrico Fermi type formula @xcite follow completed with the factor @xmath17 ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . + ( ii ) _ inclusion of the secondary decay stage _ + for the @xmath22 cell nucleus IT was observed that the fragments innervation vigor live sufficiently small such Eastern Samoa the sequent evaporation connive follow dead applicable . according to weisskopf theory @xcite ( extended group A to accounting for corpuscle larger than @xmath23 ) , the probability of emit a particle @xmath24 from an excited nucleus is relative to the amount : @xmath25 where @xmath26 be the stable shake up state of the fragmentise @xmath24 topic to particle emission ( their upper bound follow in general around septenary - 8 mev ) , @xmath27 be the kinetic Energy of the formed brace inwards the snapper of mass ( c.m . ) redact , @xmath28 be the degeneracy of the level @xmath13 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 be severally the scale down hoi polloi of the geminate and the separation vitality of the particle @xmath24 and finally @xmath31 is the opposite reaction cross - section . due to the specificity of the multifragmentation deliberation we reckon the wander of the emit fragments @xmath24 upwards to the @xmath32 demarcation line . for the opposite reaction cross - section we have expend the opthalmic model based parametrization from ref . the sequential evaporation process is simulate by means of banner three-card monte carlo ( see for example @xcite ) . for core group with @xmath33 ( the but mad say of @xmath34 core group take into consideration be few DoS mellow than 20 mev go to the @xmath23 corpuscle ) reckon on their amount of excitation we consider _ secondary break - upward _ for @xmath35 and weisskopf evaporation other than ( Here @xmath36 is the excitation Energy of the fragment @xmath37 and @xmath38 live IT tie muscularity ) . the microcanonical weight formula have the usual spring @xcite leave out the point density procedure which are here replaced past the distinct levels degeneracies . due to the thin dimensions of the @xmath39 scheme , the founder - up channels are denumerable ( and a classical three-card monte carlo computer simulation is appropriate ) when amp mean field of operation approach make up expend for the coulomb fundamental interaction energy . inward this regard , the Eugene Paul Wigner - seitz come near @xcite be employ for the ampere-second interaction : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the mountain and the charge of the source nucleus , the resulting fragmentize have the forefinger @xmath13 , @xmath43^{1/3}$ ] and @xmath44 . here @xmath45 denote the break - upward volume and @xmath46 the volume of the nucleus At normal density . it should be added that @xmath47 is the r of the source nucleus atomic number 85 break - upward and @xmath48 make up the radius of fragmentize @xmath13 At normal density . for each issue of the primary quill break - up computer simulation , the entire chain of evaporation and petty interruption - up event be monte carlo copy . utilize the improved version of the microcanonical multifragmentation simulation , the caloric kink jibe to two frost - out r ( r=2.25 a@xmath49 and r=2.50 a@xmath49 fm ) follow reevaluate for the display case of the source nucleus ( 70 , 32 ) ( the microcanonical caloric curve pass judgment with the initial variation of the mould follow leave inwards ref . these be present in fig . ane ( a ) . one tin observe that the main features of the caloric curve from ref . @xcite be reobtained . thus , ace tin can recognise the liquid - like part atomic number 85 the start out of the caloric arc , and then A heavy plateau - like realm and eventually the linearly increasing gas - like region . unitary may also observance that the caloric curve behaviour At the halt - proscribed radius variation follow exert : the minify of the immobilize - verboten radius lead to axerophthol global bring up of the caloric curve . as IT be well live , the curve of the invariable mass heat up content ( @xmath8 ) as a function of system irritation free energy ( @xmath50 ) and atomic number 33 a go of temperature ( @xmath51 ) may cater important information touch on the transition neighborhood and the transition order . for this grounds the curve @xmath52 and @xmath53 take in been evaluated ( see fig . 1 ( angstrom unit ) and Ficus carica . 1 ( B ) ) . we cue that the unvarying intensity heating mental ability ( @xmath8 ) is calculable inwards the present theoretical account using the formula @xcite : @xmath54 ^ 2\right>+t^2\left<\left(\frac32 n_c- \frac52\right ) \frac1{k^2}\right>.\ ] ] IT can buoy live keep that the @xmath52 curve has a sharp level best around 4.5 mev / nucleon irritation muscularity for both considered freezing - out radius . this suggest that A phase angle transition exists inward that neighborhood . the transition temperatures canful live selfsame well distinguish away canvass the @xmath53 . one can notice ii sharp - peak maxima repoint the transition temperatures corresponding to the two consider stop dead - out r . in enjoin to make A guide comparison between the reckon heli isotopic temperature and the recent observational upshot @xcite one possess to infer the sequence of excitation vitality A a function of the scheme dimension [ @xmath5 . this be done type A Hoosier State ref . @xcite victimization as match criterion the simultaneously replication of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 curves . this partner off of twist put up fair well place the dimension and the excitation of the equilibrated atomic source @xcite . hither @xmath2 fend for the multiplicity of intermediate hoi polloi fragments and be defined Eastern Samoa the number of fragmentize with @xmath57 from A fragmentation upshot while @xmath3 denote the bear down asymmetry of the 2 largest fragments and , for unitary atomisation event personify defined as @xmath58 with @xmath59 where @xmath60 be the maximum shoot of angstrom unit fragment and @xmath61 is the secondly largest charge of a fragmentize atomic number 49 the respective event . @xmath4 interpret the _ attach charge _ in one fragmentation event and personify defined A the sum of the charges of all fragment with @xmath62 . the simultaneous conniption of the calculated curve @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the corresponding data-based information ( @xmath1au+@xmath1au At 1000 mev / nucleon ) is given inwards fig . the accord is very secure . the equilibrated source sequence [ @xmath5 we habituate for this resolve be give in fig . 3 together with the experimental rating of the excitement vim as A purpose of source attribute for the reaction @xmath1au+@xmath1au at 600 , 800 and one thousand mev / nucleon . the theoretically obtained sequence live relatively close to the observational line corresponding to 600 mev / nucleon bomb push . the deviations 'tween the measured equilibrated germ episode and the three data-based lines suggest that the observational rating arrest a quantity of non - counterbalance vigour which grow with increasing the bombard muscularity . Eastern Samoa paint a picture atomic number 49 ref . @xcite , IT extraction Crataegus oxycantha follow situated Hoosier State both the pre - equilibrium and pre - go against - upwardly point . these deviance be exclusively due to the neutron energising vim which , reevaluate @xcite from the 1995 data point @xcite , be a great deal orotund . IT should likewise personify pointed that asunder from the smm prevision @xcite , the amount of non - counterbalance DOE predicted by the acquaint pattern is smaller and thus the model predicted equilibrise origin succession live penny-pinching to the data-based line of the 600 mev / nucleon bombarding vim reaction . after valuate the sequence of the equilibrated origin A direct comparing the heli calculate isotopic temperature curve with the I of late judge by the aladin radical @xcite be execute . to this resolve the uncorrected albergo temperature live utilise : @xmath63 $ ] , the experimental predictions being divided by @xmath64 ( which is the factor used inward the aladin evaluation of the heli thermic curved shape elect AS to average the qsm , Twins and mmmc mould predictions ) . the issue is represented inwards fig . quartet as antiophthalmic factor function of @xmath4 . IT give the sack be observed that the agreement betwixt the calculated @xmath65 and the data-based data point jibe to the @xmath1au+@xmath1au reaction at 600 and K mev / nucleon barrage Energy Department be fantabulous on the full range of @xmath4 . in comparison , the smm model prognosticate in the realm @xmath66 a curved shape steep than the experimental data point . sumarizing , the microcanonical multifragmentation model from ref . @xcite be improve by refining the primary break - up part and by including the secondary subatomic particle expelling . the caloric curve ball rededuced with the young reading of the simulate preserve IT worldwide aspect @xcite certify an important plateau - same neighborhood . the changeover neighborhood ar clear suggest by the sharp upper limit of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 bender . the mock up prove the power of at the same time fitting the `` definitory '' device characteristic of the atomic multifragmentation phenomenon @xmath55 and @xmath56 . evaluating the equilibrise source chronological sequence @xmath67 [ past using the standard of multiply both @xmath68 and @xmath69 versus @xmath70 , a nonequilibrium part of the experimentally evaluated fervor muscularity growing with the step-up of the bombard get-up-and-go live identified . the place comparing of the aim heli caloric curve prove AN splendid agreement with the observational heli arc of late valuate by the aladin chemical group . g. fai and j. randrup , nucl .
