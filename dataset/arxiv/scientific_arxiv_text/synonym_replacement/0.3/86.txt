cataclysmic variable ( resume ) are short - period binaries containing A gabardine dwarf ( wd ) master ( with volume @xmath2 ) and antiophthalmic factor low the great unwashed main chronological succession secondary ( with the great unwashed @xmath3 ) . the secondary fills its roche lobe and transference mass to the wd through and through the intimate lagrangian ( @xmath4 ) point . the master features of the orbital period dispersion of cvs with hydrogen rich donors are the lack of organisation IN the ii - 3 hr period run ( the so - call off full point gap ) and the sharp undercut off of the dispersion At around 77 minutes , as can be view inward figure [ combine ] ( upper frame ; e.g. ritter & kolb 1998 ) . so far theoretical example have live unable to procreate the precise position of the observed short - period cut - away and take note shape of the cv orbital period statistical distribution near this cut - turned . this follow resume atomic number 49 enter [ combine ] . systems that evolve below the influence of gravitative radiation ( gr ; kraft paper et al . 1962 ) as the simply sink of orbital angular momentum ( be ) compass type A minimum period atomic number 85 @xmath5 arcminute ( figure[combined ] , middle compose ; paczyski 1971 ; kolb & baraffe 1999).the chance of chance A organization within angstrom unit given geological period grade is proportional to the metre rent to germinate through and through this region . we olibanum get n(p ) , for the number @xmath6 of organisation found within a given orbital period compass around @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the secular period derivative atomic number 85 this period . we thus expect AN assemblage of scheme ( a fortify ) at @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( figure [ combine ] , get down put ) , patch no such spike follow lay out in the keep distribution ( figure[combined ] , upper draw up ) . the orbital period evolution reflects the radius organic evolution of the mass donor , which IN grow is governed by two vie result . mass change perturbs thermic equilibrium and spread out the prima . thermal relaxation reinstate thermic equilibrium and contracts the star back to IT equilibrium radius . the minimum point occurs where the two corresponding time descale , the mass transferral time @xmath11 and the thermal ( K - helmholtz ) time @xmath12 are about equal ( e.g. paczyski 1971 ; queen 1988 ) . if @xmath13 so the star be capable to squeeze in response to mass deprivation , only if @xmath14 the star will not shrink rapidly plenty and will become oversized for IT slew . the position of the minimum full point is thence touch away the take on mass channelise charge per unit , and in particular by the assumed charge per unit of orbital angulate impulse ( be ) losses . in this paper we inquire path to increment the point minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate , and investigate way to `` hide '' the spike by introducing a spread of @xmath9 appraise IN the resume population . in particular , we study the effect of A form of eventful am loss ( caml ) where the am follow deep in thought a amp consequence of the volume transferred from the secondary winding , i.e. @xmath15 ( take care for instance webbink 1985 ) . IN section [ theory ] we outline our general model assumptions and introduce the prescription for caml . in plane section [ sec22 ] we present elaborated calculations of the long - term evolution of resume , and in plane section [ comptest ] we equivalence the observe short period 105 period statistical distribution with several theoretically synthesise mold distributions base on the deliberation in section 2 . atomic number 49 this section we investigate possible solutions to the mismatch betwixt the theoretic and keep lower limit orbital period in resume . the orbital AM deprivation rate @xmath16 of a cv can be written as the sum of 2 terminal figure , = _ sys+_caml , where @xmath17 denote the `` systemic '' atomic number 95 loss value , such A gravitative wave radiation syndrome , that is independent of mass transfer , spell @xmath18 is an expressed function of the mass reassign rate . we stimulate = 0 and _ caml0_20 we believe the full general pillowcase in which the caml mechanism , along with nova mass forcing out , causes a fraction of the change volume to result the system . this fraction may follow greater than unity as the primary English hawthorn lose Sir Thomas More mickle during a nova outburst than be accreted since the last blowup . we utilise A generic prescription of the event of a caml mechanics , thus avoiding the want to specify its physical nature . possible caml chemical mechanism let in a magnetic propellor , id est A system hold a apace birl magnetic wd where just about of the shift material advance angular momentum from the wd twisting by interaction with the wd s magnetic force field ( check e.g. wynn , B. B. King & horne 1997 ) , and AN accretion magnetic disc lead ( see for instance livio & pringle 1994 ) . our caml prescription for the most part follows the annotation of male monarch & kolb ( 1995 ) . the be is assumed to Be lost via mass loss that comprise axis - symmetrical with honor to AN axis A fix At the wd middle but perpendicular to the orbital plane . we delineate @xmath19 As the totality fraction of mass lost from the secondary that leave behind the scheme . we get into further that a fraction @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) of the transplant mass leaves the system with more or less fraction @xmath22 of the angular momentum it had on leaving the @xmath4 indicate . we too consider mass that be lost from the organisation via nova mass ejection , which over the long term can atomic number 4 moot as AN isotropic wander from the primary ( see e.g. kolb et al . this material testament carry away the specific orbital angulate impulse of the primary election and testament account for the fraction ( @xmath23 ) of the mass loss . we thence obtain _ caml = b^2_2 + , where we define @xmath24 A the caml efficiency . for comparison with king & kolb ( 1995 ) we equate this to [ eq : jdotcaml ] _ caml = J , > 0 , and get [ combining weight : nufinal ] = ( 1+q)()^2 + . for our computation shown below we utilization the approximation 1-+-,^3=. this be AN adaptation of the reflexion give in kopal ( 1959 ) and live accurate to within 1% over the range @xmath25 . inward this subsection we nowadays computation of the farsighted - term phylogenesis of cvs as they approach and evolve beyond the period minimum . for the reckoning we used the stellar code by mazzitelli ( 1989 ) , adapt to cvs by kolb & ritter ( 1992 ) . roughly of these evolutionary episode be the basis for the theoretic 105 period statistical distribution we submit In section [ comptest ] below . we calculated the evolution of someone system that are subject to caml concord to equating [ equivalent weight : jdotcaml ] and [ eq : nufinal ] . we select @xmath26 and initial bestower mass @xmath27 , with A range of caml efficiencies @xmath28 as show in figure [ fig : fullcaml ] . the system of rules ab initio develop from long period of time towards the stop bounce ( right to left ) at almost constant great deal transfer rate . the minimum point increase with increasing caml efficiency to A maximum of around 70 min for @xmath29 . mass transfer stability sets an upper define on the caml efficiency . AN obvious upper limit is 1 , where completely the angulate impulse of the transferred material is turf out from the system . although the boot out material may run more angular impulse than be channelize ( as IN the case of a propellor organisation where additional angular momentum be direct from the spin of the wd ) this exercise not affect the net deprivation of orbital angular impulse . the maximum caml efficiency quieten compatible with masses transference stableness could be smaller than unity . the stability parameter @xmath30 which enters the expression for steady - state volume transfer of training , equivalence [ eq : stab ] ( e.g. king & kolb 1995 ) must be greater than zero ; this defines AN upper limit on @xmath31 . [ eq : stab ] -_2=m_2 ( ) a plot of @xmath30 against @xmath32 for AN ab initio marginally unchanging organisation ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) make up give atomic number 49 figure of speech [ fig : dq ] . the scheme initially march oscillation of high-pitched mass channelize rate @xmath36 ( @xmath30 come together to 0 ) and very depressed the great unwashed change rate @xmath37 . the high-pitched state be shortly lived , on the order of @xmath38 year ( see fig [ fig : highmdot ] ) . the scheme finally stabilise with @xmath39 . atomic number 85 around @xmath40 @xmath30 go to decrease farther but forever remains confirming , subsidence atomic number 85 A value around @xmath41 . the tidal deformation of the lowly may deliver AN force on the period minimum . calculations away renvoiz , baraffe , kolb & ritter ( 2002 ) , [ encounter also kolb 2002 ] employ 3dimensional sph example suggest that the secondary follow deform in the non - globose roche lobe such that its volume tantamount radius be around 1.06 times that of the same star in closing off . we mimicker this effect in our 1-dimensional astral construction codification by procreate the reckon radius past group A deformation factor @xmath42 before the mass transfer value is determined from the difference between the radius and the roche lobe radius via -_2=_0(- ) . here @xmath43 is the mass transfer rate of antiophthalmic factor binary inward which the secondary just fills its roche potential and @xmath44 is the photospheric pressure musical scale tiptop of the secondary ( see e.g. ritter 1988 ) . figure [ fig : barraffe ] show the force on the minimum period and hoi polloi transfer rate for system with various deformation factor in @xmath42 , vagabond from 1 ( no deformation ) to 1.24 . the mass transfer value follow seen to decrease with increasing deformation . this tin be read from the operative dependency on orbital period and donor mass in the usual quadrupole expression for the am deprivation rate imputable to gravitative radiation ( see e.g. landau & lifschitz 1958 ) . although the quadrupole formula is strictly valid solitary if both constituent are repoint masse shot , rezzolla , ury & yoshida ( 2001 ) ground that the gr rate obtained habituate a full 3-dimensional mental representation of the donor star differs from the direct mass approximation past less than a few percent . IT can be see from the figure that with the deformation factor in 1.06 the minimum period increases from around 65 min to around ilxx min , consistent with renvoiz et al ( 2002 ) for geometrical upshot alone . a deformation factor of around 1.18 was mandatory to raise the lower limit period of time to the observed economic value of @xmath45 min . this is somewhat larger than the visceral outlook ( ) ^=()^=1.12 from kepler siemens law and roche geometry . inward our calculations we consider the mere suit In which only the geometrical deformation effects are taken into account statement . the inclusion of the caloric personal effects consider by renvoiz et Heart of Dixie ( 2002 ) hold the likely force of reducing @xmath9 , possibly away around 2% compared to the compositor's case with purely geometrical essence unitary possible strong-arm mechanics that could drive amp deformation factor above the value of 1.06 make up magnetic pressure inside the star , a suggest by dantona ( 2000 ) . we note that patterson ( 2000 ) claims to find data-based demonstrate for `` bloated '' secondary winding IN short period of time cvs . on the base of bestower volume estimation from the observed superhump excess period he find that the donors have @xmath46 larger r than predicted from single dimensional . , non deformed astral poser if gravitational radiation live the only personify sink . even if true , this observance can not mark between AN intrinsic deformation of the giver asterisk operating theater the non - equilibrium caused past orbital am losses In excess of the gr rate . to test the statistical implication of the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems skinny the period of time lower limit ( `` period spike '' ) we calculated the period distributions of modelling universe for various assumption astir evolutionary parametric quantity . for apiece parametric quantity a series of evolutionary caterpillar track were bring forth , typically or so 20 . type A systems germinate afterward the lower limit geological period a point is reached ( typically when @xmath47 flow at a lower place @xmath48 ) where mathematical fluctuations inward @xmath47 suit so big that the henyey connive no longsighted converges . the stellar code uses shelve to interpolate / extrapolate the opaqueness and equating of state for from each one iteration , and inwards this part the extrapolations suit rattling uncertain . to extend the racecourse we habituate antiophthalmic factor semi - analytical method Eastern Samoa follow . the data track were terminate at A value of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 be the mass conveyance rate atomic number 85 the minimum menstruum for the caterpillar tread . the r of the lead for the last start of the cut across be approximated past r_2=r_0m_2^ , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are accept to Be never-ending . the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 were determined from the last few data points for for each one track . ( @xmath52 take a typical appreciate of around 0.15 for organization beyond the point bounciness . ) to generate the extension to the track we and so calculate @xmath7 from the roche lobe experimental condition , and @xmath53 by take stationarity as in section [ minpnumeric ] ( look physical body [ combined ] , middle frame for AN example of an poke out track ) . we weight the chances of observation to the bright scheme away take , 1.0 . for the spying chance . we tested the calculated model raise distributions for various economic value of the unfreeze parameter @xmath54 against the celebrate CV period distribution . a k - s ( kolmogorov - smirnov ) run be insensitive to the differences 'tween the bring up distributions . the outstanding departure inwards the cumulative statistical distribution functions ( cdfs ) of the mention and modelled distributions occur At the boundaries of the cdfs , id est in the to the lowest degree raw region for the K - due south test ( press et Camellia State 1992 ) . we gum olibanum decided to habituate the come after modified @xmath55 trial . for for each one raise dispersion 10000 mock up sample for each one carry 134 system were bring forth . ; ritter & kolb 1998 , interior update june 2001 , as of july 2002 the number of systems in this period cooking stove is now 152 though this does alter the value present away the @xmath55 test , the slue and hence the lead remain unaltered ] apiece sample was tested against the mock up raise distribution apply A @xmath55 test , with 1 , 2 and 4 arcminute ABA transit number . this range bridges the require for good result and significance of the @xmath55 test which demand A minimum figure of cvs per bin . the keep point statistical distribution was essay against the mould parent distribution also , afford the subdue @xmath55 value @xmath56 . the fraction @xmath22 of yield samples with A reduced @xmath55 note value less than @xmath56 was used angstrom unit a measure of the significance level of turn down the surmisal that the observed statistical distribution live draw from the parent distribution . in the following we quote the rejection probability pr=@xmath22 . kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) noted that the observe dispersion of non - magnetic CV ( figure [ Libyan Islamic Group : mnmcvs ] , middle frame in ) , and the observed statistical distribution of magnetized cvs ( pattern [ fig : mnmcvs ] , lower frame ) show no significant difference of opinion below the point gap . to run and measure this we compared these distributions for @xmath57 min , giving a reduced @xmath55 chance of 0.1213 . hence we potty non rule out that the dispersion be draw from the same underlying parent statistical distribution . this live bear out past the outcome of equate both dispersion with a parent statistical distribution that be flat In @xmath7 ( consider also shelve [ tab : tabcomb ] , entries f and G ) which apply similar rejection probabilities ( pr=0.709 and pr=0.781 , severally ) . we thus find no significant difference between the II statistical distribution . in the accompany we therefore test models against the combined magnetised and non - magnetized dispersion of discovered systems . the deficiency of whatever distinct features In the combine observed period dispersion ( figure [ FIG : mnmcvs ] , upper frame ) does indeed suggest AN essentially flat dispersion for the underlying parent distribution . the flat dispersion throw atomic number 59 = 0.552 ( for the ane minute ABA transit number breadth , catch table [ tab : tabcomb ] ) . we use this value A a benchmark for the models discuss below . [ cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^ " , ] king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) constructed a ( nearly ) flat period dispersion by superimposing single idealized pdfs with different bounce period @xmath58 according to a suitably tailored weighting . for the duplicate boxful - shaped idealised pdfs sit on the pdf shown atomic number 49 our figure [ fuse ] ( lower frame ) the required burthen follow @xmath59 $ ] ( @xmath60 follow the observed minimum period ) . this weighting role effectively mirrors the shape of the sharply under the weather single pdfs . world-beater et al . ( 2002 ) regain that the range @xmath61 is sufficient to wash tabu the flow spike . IT personify clear that this process affect A sure degree of fine - tune up for @xmath62 if the pattern of the input pdf live given . such a fine - tune up must surprise A the deuce use mired presumptively represent two selfsame different physical force . we applied the burthen @xmath62 cite in male monarch et al . ( 2002 ) to our non - idealized model pdfs that require the caml efficiency and the deformation factor A a means to vary @xmath58 . the weighting produced A marginally defective fit ( @xmath63 versus @xmath64 ; 1 minute binning ) for the caml pdfs compared to the parent universe ground on a flat caml efficiency spectrum we talk over earlier . atomic number 49 part this follow referable to the fact that the upper limit on @xmath31 does non allow A big plenty range of @xmath58 . in the case of the deformation factor pdfs the accommodate marginally improved ( @xmath65 versus @xmath66 ; 1 minute binning , @xmath67 ) . IT be possible to optimise the conniption past adding systems with deformation broker up to 1.42 , and by using the weighting @xmath68 $ ] , only this still gives the fair large value @xmath69 ( check likewise figure [ fig : top executive ] ) . however , such a bring up population be inconsistent with the observed dispersion for longer periods . as hindquarters be seen from project [ fig : barraffe ] scheme that are field to great deformation factor would evolve into the period gap , thus the gap would be inhabit inward this mock up . for completeness we evince inwards figure [ fig : grsum1 ] the result of the superposition evoke by king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) if realistic rather than idealise pdfs be used . this framework assume additional systemic be losses ( @xmath70 ; no more caml , no more deformation factor , @xmath71 ) a the control parameter for vary @xmath58 , and the weighting A in Billie Jean Moffitt King et Al . the pronounced feature article just to a higher place 2 hr orbital period be the result of the adiabatic response of the donor stars atomic number 85 turn - on of mass transfer ( see for instance ritter & kolb 1992 ) . such A characteristic personify abstracted in the observed statistical distribution . if deformation effects be read into account the additional AM losses required to wash out the @xmath9 capitulum would wrap up amp like grasp but at A small magnitude . the ensue stop dispersion would be similar to the ace shown in figure [ fig : grsum1 ] we have investigated chemical mechanism that could step-up the bounce stop for resume from the sanctioned theoretical economic value @xmath0 Fukkianese to the observe prise @xmath72 min , and style to wash away come out the theoretically auspicate accumulation of organisation near the minimum geological period ( the period stiletto heel ) . dissimilar king , schenker & hameury 2002 we focussed on effects other than increased systemic angulate impulse ( am ) losses , ie we assume that gravitative radioactivity be the only systemic sink of orbital Artium Magister . we find that fifty-fifty A maximum efficient consequential am loss ( caml ) chemical mechanism can non gain the bouncing geological period sufficiently . as the real cv population is potential to comprise systems with a range of caml efficiencies we would Hoosier State whatsoever typeface expect to feature a distribution of systems knock down to @xmath0 min , instead than the keep sharp cut - dispatch . we consider presenter stars that are `` bloated '' imputable to intrinsical personal effects , such every bit the tidal deformation found atomic number 49 3-dim . sph computer simulation of roche - lobe fill up star . AN unbelievably vauntingly deformation factor of around 1.18 is needed to obtain a bounce stop of @xmath45 Fukien . A possible choice identification of @xmath9 as an mature limit rather than A period bounce ( male monarch & schenker 2002 ) would boundary the donor volume in whatever resume in antiophthalmic factor 105 universe dominated by hydrogen fertile , unevolved systems to @xmath73 . whatsoever system of rules with donor mass practically less than this would either take an orbital period less than 78 minute of arc or would possess already develop beyond the period minimum . in that respect be indeed system of rules with surmise @xmath74 ; in effect candidates be wz sge ( @xmath75 ; patterson et al 1998 ) and oy car ( @xmath76 ; pratt et Al . 1999 ) . IT is as well possible that systems die Beaver State fade before reaching the period bounce , and hence get undetectable a CV . the fact that the very dissimilar grouping of non - magnetic and magnetic cvs show almost identical value of @xmath9 ( come across count on [ Ficus carica : mnmcvs ] ) strongly suggests that the strong-arm cause for the potential fading would take to be rooted in the conferrer star operating theater the evolution rather than the accumulation natural philosophy or emission properties of the scheme . still if the bound catamenia job live ignore we find in all synthesise modeling universe ( except for the age limit model ) A pronounced left over feature imputable to the accumulation of scheme near the bouncing . we employ A modified @xmath55 test to bar the `` goodness '' of fit against the observed sampling . an F - test ( compact et aluminium 1992 ) was also apply to the absolute majority of @xmath77 mold and the Saame general cut keep . none of our synthesised simulate universe fit as well A the distribution which is simply flat in orbital period ( rejection probability @xmath78 ) . lonesome models where brighter organization convey a far outstanding weight than expected in a mere magnitude limited taste ( selection factor @xmath79 with @xmath80 rather than @xmath81 ) achieve like value for @xmath82 . nonetheless , most of our poser with @xmath83 canot be rejected unambiguously on the basis of this test . role model plan to `` wash drawing out '' the point spike past introducing a large propagate of the caml efficiency DO generally safe than universe fashion model ground on donor stars that are dependent to a enceinte spread of intrinsical deformation factor . for completely framework the rejection chance fall if the full wd mass spectrum live take into calculate , as this present an additional spread Hoosier State the jounce period . simulation populations where whole cvs form at long orbital geological period ( primarily to a higher place the period gap ) give A much sound conniption than example that include newborn baby cvs with small donor mess . adding these systems to the universe introduces a full general step-up of the orbital period distribution towards short period of time , thus making the period spike out Thomas More pronounced . this suggests that most resume must take constitute At long menstruum and evolved through the catamenia gap to become short - period cvs . this be uniform with self-governing prove that cv secondary asterisk are somewhat evolved ( baraffe & kolb 2000 ; schenker et al . 2002 ; thorstensen et aluminium 2002 ) . latterly , male monarch , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) constructed a flat orbital period of time distribution by lay over idealised pdfs that describe subpopulations of CV with amp secure initial bestower mass and initial wd mass , but different bounce period . this superposition required a strongly slump number of organisation with increasing bounce geological period . we repeated this try out with A realistic pdf , but failed to obtain A markedly meliorate go . in finish , we regain that the geological period minimum problem and the period spike problem remain AN opened publication . IT be possible to fabricate cv model universe where the period spike out be lap stunned sufficiently so that it can non follow decree stunned unambiguously on the base of AN objective statisticial test against the observe CV period of time dispersion . we give thanks graham flour wynn , andrew Riley B King and isabelle baraffe for useful word . Saint Andrew the Apostle conway and chris John Luther Jones WHO gave advice on the statistical analysis . we as well give thanks andrew norton for a decisive version of the paper and the referee blue jean - marie hameury for useful comments .
