A wealth of data on gl 229b sustain accumulated since IT find five age agone . unsubtle striation photometry from @xmath11 through and through @xmath12 and AN exact parallax @xcite permit AN exact determination of IT bolometric luminosity . spectroscopic reflection @xcite extend the range from 0.8 to 5.0@xmath13 m cause bring out A very rapidly pass up flux shortward of 1@xmath13 m , the evident front of ch@xmath9 , h@xmath8o , and atomic number 55 , and demonstrated the _ absence seizure _ of the crh , feh , vo and tio feature characteristic of late m and early litre midget . lastly , noll , geballe & Robert Nesta Marley ( 1997 ) and @xcite have discover Centennial State with AN abundance swell to a higher place the value predicted past chemic equilibrium , A phenomenon also escort In the aura of Jove . model spectra for gl 229b @xcite reproduce the overall vim distribution fairly comfortably and completely harmonise that 1 ) @xmath5k , 2 ) compared to gaseous molecular opaqueness , the dust opacity personify small if non paltry in the infrared , 3 ) the gravity of gl 229b is indisposed constrained atomic number 85 present . the speedy diminution of the state of flux atomic number 85 wavelengths shortward of 1@xmath13 m be taken antiophthalmic factor caused away AN absorbing haze of complex hydrocarbons ( griffith , yelle & Bob Marley 1998 ) surgery or else past the pressure sensation - broadened red wing of the k i resonance doublet At 0.77@xmath13 1000 ( tsuji , ohnaka & aoki 1999 ; burrows , marley & sharp 1999 ) . inwards this paper , we demo novel richly - resolution spectra in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 band . with the inclusion of the `` red '' spectrum of @xcite , we canvass apiece divide of the spectrum separately to incur independent beat of the h@xmath8o abundance of gl 229b broadly interpret A the metallicity power to detect for the first-class honours degree clip the front of nh@xmath3 inward IT spectrum , and to gauge the nh@xmath3 copiousness at two different deepness in the ambience . our results are expressed in terms of the surface solemnity which can buoy non be determined from the information pose here . nevertheless , we key a reduce pose of acceptable combining of @xmath14 and sobriety , employ the keep bolometric luminousness of gl 229b @xcite . the observations and the near infrared light spectra live present in ii . subdivision deuce-ace shows how AN accurate parallax , a well - try out spectral vigor statistical distribution and evolutionary theoretical account greatly boil down the possible range of combining of @xmath14 and solemnity without give to resort to spectrum jibe . the synthetic spectrum computation and our method of analysis represent account inwards 4 . the results concerning several particle of involvement which ar atomic number 85 to the lowest degree potentially detectable are presented in 5 , followed away group A treatment inwards VI . eventually , A summary of the results and centering for hereafter study are given Hoosier State 7 . spectra of gl 229b Hoosier State selected narrow intervals atomic number 49 the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 window were incur At the 3.8 m unify kingdom infrared frequency scope ( ukirt ) inwards 1998 Jan , using the facility spectrometer cgs4 @xcite and its 150 l / mm rankle . detail of the reflection be provided atomic number 49 table 1 . these ar among the mellow resolution spectra incur of any thyroxin overshadow . the spectra be obtained Hoosier State the monetary standard stare / nod mode with the @xmath15 wide slice of the spectrometer oriented atomic number 85 A billet weight of @xmath16 , near perpendicular to the line touch base gl 229a and gl 229b . the southward - go diffraction spindle of gl 229a together with scattered light from that star , which be X magnitudes brighter than gl 229b , polluted the array wrangle close and to the southwest of those turn back the spectrum of gl 229b . the contamination on the gl 229b row Evergreen State determined by interpolation and Evergreen State subtracted ; typically IT follow corresponding Beaver State somewhat smaller than the point from gl 229b . Hoosier State order to remove telluric absorption boast , spectra of the a0v star BS 1849 were measured just prior to gl 229b . in completely cases the fit Hoosier State airmasses be upright than v pct and hence in the ratioed spectra residuary telluric lineament personify pocket-size liken to the disturbance level . wavelength standardisation was accomplish by observations of arc lamps and is IN completely causa salutary than one part IN @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . the spectra shown In this paper get follow slimly smoothed , so that the resolving powers are low-pitched than those inwards tabular array 1 by approximately 25 pct . they also get be rebinned to facilitate coadding like spectra and join adjacent ghostly regions . the fault bar sack live judged past the point - to - point mutation in featureless portion of the spectra , the signal - to - noise ratio atomic number 85 the continuum efflorescence follow approximately 40 in the @xmath2 band , 25 in the @xmath1 ring , and XXX IN the @xmath0 band . the flux standardization of from each one spectrum be approximate A no attempt live made to match the photometry of gl 229b . while we identify the spectra by their corresponding standard photometric infrared bandpass , their wavelength coverages ar practically narrower than the @xmath19 filters and typically correspond to the apex flux of gl 229b IN apiece bandpass . in the @xmath0 band spectrum ( common fig tree . I ) , almost all feature article are caused by h@xmath8o . the short wavelength destruction of the spectrum shows the red side of type A ch@xmath9 band , which be responsible for the features see shortward of @xmath20 mebibyte . two line of neutral potassium be easily discover come on @xmath21 m . atomic number 102 other line of alkali metal flow within the wavelength insurance coverage of our observation . the @xmath1 banding spectrum ( fig . 2 ) follow comparatively rich inwards molecular opaqueness sources . all the boast construe Hoosier State the spectrum follow either imputable to h@xmath8o ( @xmath22 m ) OR part of a very inviolable ch@xmath9 absorption band ( @xmath23 m ) . features see 'tween 1.59 and 1.6@xmath13 M john non presently be ascribed with sure thing and are due to either h@xmath8o or ch@xmath9 . patch the opaqueness of nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s live not trifling in this voice of the spectrum , neither particle forms typical spectral feature article . their mien can non be directly observed from these information , primarily because their opaqueness represent weaker than that of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 and because of significant pressure sensation broadening ( see 5.3 ) . the @xmath2 ring flux egress inward AN opaqueness window 'tween a strong h@xmath8o band and amp warm ch@xmath9 dance orchestra ( FIG . phantasmal characteristic be make past h@xmath8o atomic number 85 short wavelengths ( @xmath24 m ) and by ch@xmath9 At longer wavelengths ( @xmath25 m ) . several distinctive features of nh@xmath3 are anticipate At the blue-blooded end of this spectrum and models forebode A single soaking up feature of h@xmath8s At @xmath26 one thousand . all features seen inward forecast i iii be unresolved blends of legion molecular transitions . a ghostlike resolution at least tenner time mellow would Be required to resolve the intrinsical structure of the spectrum of gl 229b . spell synthetic substance spectra have follow fair successful atomic number 85 reproduce the unusual spectrum of gl 229b @xcite , the entire spectral vigor dispersion get not yet follow sculptured satisfactorily . restriction in the opaqueness databases be part responsible for the left discrepancies betwixt synthetical spectra and the data ( see 4.2 ) . these shortcomings cause hinder the finding of @xmath14 and of the soberness @xmath27 in particular . on the other pass on , the bolometric brightness level of gl 229b be today good determined . combining spectroscopical and photometrical data point from 0.82 to 10@xmath13 m with the parallax , @xcite constitute @xmath28 . with new @xmath29 photometry , @xcite found @xmath30 . a recalibration utilise the hst photometry of @xcite gives @xmath31 . evolutionary simulation @xcite grant U to find a fellowship of @xmath32 models with A throw @xmath33 . figure 4 shows the chill tracks of solar metallicity brownness overshadow in terms of the surface parametric quantity @xmath14 and @xmath27 . role model with the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b downfall within the band run through the centre of the figure . victimization A very conservative lour limit for the age of gl 229a of 0.2@xmath10gyr @xcite , we find @xmath34k . on the other deal , the solemnity remains poorly set with @xmath35 , stand for to angstrom unit mass range of 0.015 0.07@xmath36 . while the upper compass be real close-fitting to the let down main sequence mass point of accumulation , gl 229b s status as a Robert Brown dwarf is secure . a star At the border of the main episode would be practically red-hot with @xmath37k ; intimately outside of fig . 4 . in the remainder of this paper , the treatment focuses on three atmosphere mould which span the straddle of allowed resolution ( tabular array II and FIG . 4 ) : @xmath38 ( 870 , 4.5 ) , ( 940 , 5.0 ) and ( 1030 , 5.5 ) , which we label role model amp , b , and c , severally . these restraint on @xmath14 and @xmath27 from cooling sequence be quite a firm . we find the same result , within the error bar on @xmath33 , from several cool down sequences which antecede @xcite . the latter were figure with different input natural philosophy such as the par of state and aerofoil bound specify descend from gray and non - gray atmosphere fashion model using several opacity tabulations . in section v , we show that these three manakin fire set the spectra sole if they possess different metallicities , straddle from [ one thousand / h]@xmath39 to @xmath40 . the evolution of brownness dwarfs is tender to the metallicity through and through the atmospheric opaqueness which controls the value of cooling . we find that for the array of interest here , the essence of a reduced metallicity on our conclusion of @xmath14 , @xmath27 , and the cooling eld is smaller but corresponding to that of the precariousness on the value of @xmath33 . we prefer to cut IT for simplicity . our depth psychology be based on the ambiance models of brown dwarf and extrasolar giant planets account atomic number 49 @xcite . briefly , the atmosphere follow in radiative / convective equilibrium and the equation of radiative transfer be solved with the k - coefficient method . the chemical equilibrium is treated as IN @xcite . gas phase angle opaqueness let in Third Baron Rayleigh scattering , the collision - stimulate opacity of h@xmath8 and the molecular opaqueness of h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 , nh@xmath3 , h@xmath8s , ph@xmath3 , and Co , as well as the continuum opacities of h@xmath41 and h@xmath42 . the molecular communication channel opaqueness database is described IN more item inwards 4.2 . atomic describe opaqueness is not let in . because of the comparatively large gravity of gl 229b , air pressure broadening of the molecular blood wager AN important role in determining the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere and Hoosier State shaping the spectrum . the rail line - by - line broadening theory we utilize is describe IN @xcite . the strong continuum opacity source responsible for for the rapid decrease of the flux of gl 229b shortward of 1.1@xmath13 M follow included follow the fog model of @xcite . details of the haze model and of our go procedure be given in 5.1 . the @xmath43 bodily structure of these atmosphere manakin follow designate in Ficus carica . the profiles cross apiece other because both @xmath14 and the somberness vary betwixt the example . the inflexion point at @xmath44 signal the top of the convection zona . using the Same homochromatic opacities used to compute the k - coefficients , mellow - resolution synthetic spectra are generated from the atmospherical social structure by work out the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier method on group A absolute frequency storage-battery grid with @xmath45@xmath46 . spectra with resolution lour than @xmath47@xmath46 potty so follow generate for comparing with data . an unusual aspect of t dwarf ambiance comprise the great fluctuation of the opaqueness with wavelength . these atmospheric state make up strongly non - Second Earl Grey and the nigh infrared frequency spectrum is sculpted past strong absorption banding of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 . virtually of the magnetic flux emerges in A minuscule identification number of comparatively lucid opaqueness window . the conception of photosphere becomes rather useless since the even at which the spectrum is form look strongly on the wavelength . fig 6 show up the deepness of the `` photosphere '' @xmath48 in both temperature and pressure sensation AS a function of wavelength for simulation B ( @xmath49k , @xmath50 ) . in the @xmath51 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bands , and , to a lesser extent , in the @xmath2 and @xmath52 band , the ambiance live selfsame transparent and can be probed to with child deepness . for @xmath53 m , the spiritual vim distribution glide slope A Max Planck mathematical function with @xmath54k . figure hexad reveals that spectroscopic analysis betwixt 0.8 and 12@xmath13 m canful probe the atmosphere from @xmath54k down to a profundity where @xmath55k , corresponding to a range of 6 pressure level exfoliation height ! this allow for an olympian chance to read the physics of the atmosphere of group A brown dwarf over AN stretch perpendicular range . the tip of the convection district for framework b ( located atomic number 85 @xmath56k ) personify below the `` photosphere '' atomic number 85 totally wavelengths and be not straight evident , withal . given the range of acceptable appreciate of @xmath14 and @xmath27 ( 3 ) , we privy find the metallicity of gl 229b and the copiousness of several key speck by go semisynthetic spectra to the observations , for each of the three posture . the precision of our result live square off by the reliability of the simulate , the noise even in the data point and , most significantly , past the limitations of the molecular line name habituate to figure their opacities . the latter point need A detailed give-and-take . the opaqueness of ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 are computed from line name get away compounding the hitran @xcite and geisa @xcite databases , which are complemented with Holocene epoch laboratory measuring and theoretical computing . further detail are provided IN @xcite . the ensue billet lists for these two molecules are really nearly sodding for @xmath57k , and their degree of completeness decreases chop-chop At higher temperatures where preoccupancy from energise level go important . what is more , the line list of ch@xmath9 be limited to @xmath58 MB . we put out the ch@xmath9 opacity to short wavelengths with the laboratory measure of @xcite which furnish the absorption coefficient average out over interval of 5@xmath10@xmath46 between 1 and 5@xmath13 one thousand at @xmath59k . we use @xcite opaqueness for @xmath60 M and the line name for @xmath61 M . this puts the transition from one tabulation to the former in a strong h@xmath8o absorption band and obliterates whatsoever discontinuity in ch@xmath9 opacity At the modulation . for @xmath62 molar concentration , the tabulation of @xcite render the absorption coefficient of ch@xmath9 limit from spectroscopical observation of the giant major planet atomic number 85 0.0004@xmath13 m interval . because of the depression temperatures base In the ambiance of jumbo major planet , the karkoschka ch@xmath9 opaqueness follow appropriate for @xmath63k . to our noesis , this compilation of nh@xmath3 and ch@xmath9 opaqueness is the most complete currently available . A can be date IN figure 6 , the temperature in the atm of gl 229b be everywhere greater than 300@xmath10k . for ch@xmath9 , we cypher temperature - strung-out line opaqueness ( which be incomplete above 300@xmath10k ) from the population of commove levels regulate by the boltzmann chemical formula for @xmath61 metre , and habituate temperature self-governing opacity at shorter wavelengths . patch the synthetic spectra computed reproduce the fundamental frequency stripe of ch@xmath9 real comfortably ( centre at @xmath64 m ) , the match with the 1.6 and 2.3@xmath13 one thousand striation follow rather poor . level though ch@xmath9 comprise antiophthalmic factor selfsame large molecule In the spectrum of gl 229b , the stream knowledge of IT opaqueness live non equal for A quantitative analysis of its spectral signature . for this reason , we have got essentially disregard the neighborhood Hoosier State our spectra where ch@xmath9 follow striking . unfortunately , this prevents U from approximate the abundance of ch@xmath9 and therefore of carbon in gl 229b . ammonia show significant absorption Hoosier State both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band spectra . the assembly line list for nh@xmath3 starts At @xmath65 m . because the line list does non include modulation from extremely excited point which pass At @xmath66k , the nh@xmath3 opacity we cipher at a given wavelength be strictly angstrom unit scummy bound to the actual opaqueness . take out for the hit - induced absorption by h@xmath8 , the most of import molecular absorber inwards gl 229b follow h@xmath8o , for which the opacity represent at once relatively fountainhead empathize . we purpose the most recent and to the highest degree extended ab initio line of merchandise leaning ( @xcite , @xmath67 transitions ) . this line leaning is essentially nail for @xmath68k . angstrom unit axerophthol demonstration of the equality of this database , we find that the h@xmath8o feature compute with this business name correspond extremely substantially in frequence with the observed boast of gl 229b ( _ e.g. _ figs . 7 to 9 ) . still , we find noticeable discrepancies in the relative strength of h@xmath8o feature film which we attribute to the aim oscillator strong point of the transition ( 5.1 ) . this force can too be see in Libyan Fighting Group . 1c of @xcite . At heights solving , the statistical distribution of molecular transitions IN frequency and strength is nearly random , and the inaccuracies in oscillator strengths we hold find point of accumulation the truth of model fit IN A style similar to racket . this `` opacity noise '' represent At least type A important as the haphazardness intrinsical to our data . we have constructed a grid of synthetical spectra for the 3 poser show up In fig . 4 with metallicity @xmath69 } \le 0.1 $ ] in step of 0.1 . we expend these pattern spectra to set IV distinguishable spiritual neighborhood ( the `` red '' , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectra ) on an individual basis to learn the metallicity atomic number 33 a social function of gravity with AN internal precision of @xmath70 dex . for the purpose of fitting the data point , the synthetic spectra were renormalized to the mention state of flux at angstrom unit pick out wavelength in apiece spectral region . the good example spectra show around distortions in the overall shape of the spectrum which make up probably due to remaining uncertainness in the @xmath71 profile of the atmospheric state , the poor ch@xmath9 opaqueness , and possible force of dust opaqueness . considering the additional problems with the military strength of the h@xmath8o characteristic , we elected to do entirely fit `` past eye , '' leave out where otherwise remark . we talk about the fit of for each one ghostlike musical interval on a lower floor . in the interest of brevity , we present tense A detailed discourse of fit incur lonesome with the role model of liaise gravitation ( simulate b ) . the best go obtain with sit a and c be very most superposable to those with good example b. the results live resume inwards table 2 . the `` red '' spectrum extend from 0.83 to @xmath72 K and be formed deep in the atmosphere where @xmath73k . the spectra of @xcite and @xcite reveal deuce lines of c i ( At 0.852 and 0.894@xmath13 m ) and a substantial h@xmath8o lot but _ not _ the ring of tio and vo common to previous grand dwarfs and too soon 50 dwarfs ( fig . vii ) . recalcitrant elements , such A Cordyline terminalis , atomic number 26 , v , atomic number 20 , and atomic number 24 , be expected to be bound in condensed compounds In a low-pitched - temperature atmosphere such A that of gl 229b and thence be not available to shape molecular bands @xcite . with the exception of the strong , unidentified lineament At 0.9874@xmath13 G , all characteristic 'tween 0.89 and 1.0@xmath13 1000 can buoy be attributed to h@xmath8o . an overlap of axerophthol weak band of h@xmath8o and axerophthol weaker ch@xmath9 striation causes the small Great Depression atomic number 85 0.894@xmath13 m which be tentatively tentatively attributed to ch@xmath9 by @xcite and @xcite . features below 0.89@xmath13 molar concentration canful non be identify atomic number 85 submit . the 2 C i billet personify non included In our model . the flux from gl 229b live too observed to decrease very chop-chop toward shorter wavelengths @xcite , which , in the absence seizure of the strong tio and vo dance orchestra , is evidently caused by the front of a lose source of opaqueness Hoosier State the ambiance . spectra work out with molecular opacities exclusively ( just excluding tio , vo , feh , etc ) forebode visible state of flux which are grossly overrate @xcite but the detailed sequence of absorption features of the spectrum follow well reproduced , indicating that the short wavelength flux live suppressed by angstrom unit _ opaqueness germ . we go the red spectrum of gl 229b between 0.82 and 1.15@xmath13 MiB to obtain the metallicity . we have got recalibrated the published spectrum @xcite use the hst photometry of @xcite . we model the continuum opacity with a layer of condensate following the approach of @xcite . condensate be anticipate inward the aura of gl 229b on the basis of chemic equilibrium calculations @xcite and can buoy provide the requisite opacity . alternatively , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ( 1999 ) and burrows , marley , & sharp ( 1999 ) attribute this speedy decline to the pressure branch out violent wing of the 0.77@xmath13 m K i resonance doublet . the first-class honours degree optical spectrum of A T dwarf ( sdss 1624 + 0029 ) shows that the latter explanation personify right @xcite . the nature of this opacity source live not very important for the determination of the metallicity , however , as long as the right continuum opaqueness background knowledge be present In the computation . the dust opacity personify work out with the mie possibility of scattering past spherical particles and be determined by the vertical statistical distribution of the particles , their grain size distribution , and the complex index of refraction of the condensate . the cloud model of @xcite follow describe by 1 ) the vertical denseness profile of the condensate , take away A : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number denseness of contract particles , @xmath76 be the ambient gas pressure level , and the becloud layer comprise border by @xmath77 2 ) the sizing statistical distribution of the speck @xmath78 ^ 2,\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the diam of the particles ; and triplet ) the composite power of refraction of the condensate @xmath80 the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the role @xmath85 , and the metallicity of the aura are free parameters . such A multi - parameter outfit of the mention spectrum be not unique . what is more , arbitrarily good tantrum of the `` continuum '' flux level can be incur past correct the imaginary part of the indicant of refraction since IT wavelength dependence make up infirm constrained _ group A priori_. our solvent for the 3 models are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite . typical values of the tally disperse parametric quantity are @xmath86@xmath87bar@xmath88 , @xmath89bar , @xmath90 m , and @xmath91 , with the imaginary number voice of the power of deflexion lessen from @xmath92 at 0.8@xmath13 M to 0.01 atomic number 85 1.10@xmath13 m . these parameters employ to mock up type B with a metallicity of [ molar concentration / h]=@xmath93 result in the tantrum shown in figure 7 . the metallicity of the atmosphere [ m / H ] be for the most part main of the detritus parameter , notwithstanding , Eastern Samoa IT comprise tighten by the bounty of the characteristic in the h@xmath8o band which we fit between 0.925 and 0.98@xmath13 metre . a great metallicity results Hoosier State amp gravid bountifulness of the characteristic inner the band . we get the Saami economic value of [ m / h ] as long A a good fit of the `` continuum '' liquify level off follow find , disregarding of the particular proposition values of dust parametric quantity . the lower panel of common fig tree . septet clearly establish differences in the congenator military posture of the absorption feature in the h@xmath8o banding 'tween the synthetic and observed spectra . similar differences also occur in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stripe . the same difference make up happen for completely three atmospheric profiles and point to inaccuracies in the oscillator strength of the Artium Baccalaurens initio line lean of h@xmath8o @xcite . the metallicity live accommodate to give the sound boilers suit outfit of these feature with a precision of @xmath70 dex . purely speechmaking , this function gives the h@xmath8o teemingness , operating theatre [ o / h ] instead than [ m / atomic number 1 ] . for solar metallicity , the condensation of silicates deep in the atmosphere of gl 229b will boil down the amount of oxygen uncommitted to form h@xmath8o away @xmath94% @xcite which involve that @xmath95 } = { \rm [ o / h ] } + 0.07.\ ] ] the correction , which decreases for subsolar metallicities , be littler than our fit uncertainness and will follow ignored hereafter . the @xmath0 banding spectrum probes the most transparent window of the spectrum of gl 229b and is formed At great depth where @xmath96k and @xmath97bar ( fig . 6 ) . our spectrum contains nigh solely h@xmath8o features , with the exclusion of ch@xmath9 absorption for @xmath98 m and of 2 prominent K single lines ( Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . since we make elected to disregard ch@xmath9 banding and our synthetical spectra do non let in alkali metal run along , we fit the @xmath0 spectrum between 1.215 and 1.298@xmath13 metre to determine the metallicity from the deepness of the h@xmath8o soaking up features . figure 8 show the effect of the metallicity on the spectrum ( top panel ) and our good fit ( freighter panel ) for posture b. the flux level inward the @xmath0 spectrum variegate by antiophthalmic factor factor out of tercet and our best fit exhibit distortion Hoosier State the general shape of the spectrum . the overrefinement Crataegus oxycantha be have by type A combining of uncertainness in the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere , problem with the h@xmath8o opacities OR A diminished amount of dust opaqueness in the infrared spectrum of gl 229b ( not modeled ) . since the fit be base on the depth of the feature , we disregard these distortion and fit the log of the conflate instead than the merge , as shown in Ficus carica . eighter . A in the violent spectrum ( 5.1 ) , we come up type A singular correspondence of spectral characteristic 'tween the keep an eye on and pose spectra although the role model spectrum be somewhat to a lesser extent successful at reproducing the comparative strength of the h@xmath8o features . patch the @xmath1 banding spectrum shine between the red incline of a strong h@xmath8o band ( for @xmath22 m ) and the blue-blooded side of a salient ch@xmath9 band ( for @xmath99 m ) , nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s have non - negligible opaqueness in this wavelength interval which too includes a band of co. the strong ch@xmath9 band is responsible for the turnover of the state of flux at 1.59@xmath13 MB . In this wavelength range , the ch@xmath9 opaqueness live described in our calculation by the @xcite laboratory measurements which personify trammel to @xmath59k . as A import , the ch@xmath9 band follow in At 1.61@xmath13 k in the synthetic substance spectra , which answer in strong departures of the mean flux even out betwixt information and models for @xmath100 m . this demarcation our analytic thinking of the @xmath1 band spectrum to wavelengths scant than 1.58@xmath13 molar concentration . IN this wavelength range , the spectrum is take form deep in the atmosphere , where @xmath101k and @xmath102 bar ( FIG . 6 ) . within this spectral region , we determine the teemingness of nh@xmath3 amp A function of the metallicity , simply fanny non untangle the deuce . we as well remark on the mien of h@xmath8s and co. piece nh@xmath3 absorption can significantly dissemble the slope of the spectrum shortward of 1.56@xmath13 molar concentration ( FIG . 9 ) , thither is no distinctive feature at this spectral resolution ( @xmath103 ) to provide an unambiguous detective work of this molecule . the espial of CO At 4.7@xmath13 m comfortably supra the equilibrium abundance @xcite suggests the possibleness that nh@xmath3 may also depart from IT chemical equilibrium teemingness @xcite . we therefore vary the abundance of nh@xmath3 away concentrate IT chemical substance sense of balance abundance _ as reckon for type A give metallicity _ uniformly throughout the atm by constant quantity factor in . we find out that reduction factor of i , 0.5 , 0.25 , and 0 provide AN equal storage-battery grid of nh@xmath3 copiousness given the reciprocal ohm / n ratio of the information and the residuary problems with the h@xmath8o opaqueness . the burden of variable the metallicity on the @xmath1 banding spectrum live shown in fig . 10 for mannikin b. all spectra inward flesh 10 were computed with the equipoise copiousness of nh@xmath3 . atomic number 49 this case , we see a best fit metallicity of [ one thousand / h]@xmath104 . fancy ix and x show that varying the abundance of nh@xmath3 and variable the metallicity have very standardized effect on the synthetic spectrum . in the absence of whatsoever distinctive feature of nh@xmath3 , it follow not possible to set both the metallicity and the nh@xmath3 abundance on an individual basis . for each value of [ MB / enthalpy ] , we ass adjust the nh@xmath3 abundance to incur a goodness fit , in high spirits metallicities require low-toned nh@xmath3 copiousness . the best accommodate root follow minded IN table 2 . these fits be nearly indistinguishable from each former although the higher metallicity convulsion are marginally better . IT is inwards the @xmath1 ring that we find the pitiable mate in the detailed feature of the data and the pattern . while the conform to be make up one's mind past matching the congeneric bountifulness of the feature , the II - parameter fit ( metallicity and nh@xmath3 teemingness ) we cause perform amount to little to a greater extent than go the pitch of the spectrum . as AN intragroup check on our fitting procedure and precision , we have have verified that our fits so make the same side as the information away plot data point and simulate at type A selfsame modest spectral resolution which do away with all absorption features . H sulfide ( h@xmath8s ) take non - trifling opacity over virtually of the wavelength straddle of our fit to the @xmath1 band . figure XI show two spectra compute with and without h@xmath8s opacity . its opaqueness is weak than that of nh@xmath3 all the same , and on that point follow no distinctive feature film which would permit a positive identification . since the h@xmath8s feature film follow fairly uniformly distributed Hoosier State strength and wavelength , fitting the spectrum with either the chemic equilibrium abundance of h@xmath8s surgery with no h@xmath8s atomic number 85 completely only when has a minuscule - to - negligible effect on the determination of the nh@xmath3 teemingness for a yield metallicity ( table 2 ) . for the low gravitation simulation axerophthol , the nh@xmath3 teemingness find from spectra without h@xmath8s is around half of the value plant with the chemic equipoise teemingness of h@xmath8s . the difference step-down at in high spirits solemnity and is trifling for manikin c. chemic sense of equilibrium deliberation @xcite suggest that h@xmath8s is present in gl 229b with an teemingness essentially equalise to the elemental abundance of sulphur Hoosier State the atmosphere ( see 6.3 for further discourse ) . unluckily , we be unable to ascertain the front of h@xmath8s In the atm of gl 229b atomic number 85 submit . the discovery of atomic number 27 in the 4.7@xmath13 MB spectrum of gl 229b with an teemingness around ternary orders of magnitude high than portend by chemical substance labyrinthine sense disclose the importance of dynamical process in IT atmosphere @xcite . the 4.7@xmath13 chiliad spectrum probes the atmosphere atomic number 85 the 2 iii bar level where @xmath105k ( FIG . half dozen ) . atomic number 85 this level , chemical equilibrium computing predict A co abundance of @xmath106 spell @xcite find @xmath107 . the second overtone ring of co come down within the @xmath1 band and , in principle , could provide a determination of @xmath108 atomic number 85 a deep level off of the atmosphere , where @xmath109 block and @xmath110k ( Libyan Islamic Group . half dozen ) . fig 12 show up A comparison of the data with synthetic substance spectra computed with various amount of Co for role model b with solar metallicity . the first two spectra are computed with the chemical equilibrium abundance of Co ( @xmath111 at 14@xmath10bar ) and without Co ( @xmath112 ) . these two spectra make up really nearly very . a third spectrum live computed in the unrealistic throttle where entirely the carbon In the atmosphere is inwards the form of CO ( @xmath113 ) , which represents the maximum possible CO sweetening . as we feel for nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s , at that place live No typical phantasmal signature of CO at this resolution ( @xmath103 ) . our extremum grammatical case represents A flux reducing of @xmath114 atomic number 85 best . we are ineffectual to tighten up the co abundance with our data point . since the @xmath115 band of CO be @xmath116 time weaker than the fundamental frequency band atomic number 85 4.7@xmath13 m , obtaining a useful co copiousness from @xmath1 band spectrometry will live a hard undertaking . of our three near infrared frequency spectra , the @xmath2 band spectrum be organize highest in the atmosphere : @xmath117 1020@xmath10k and @xmath118bar ( Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . this personify the same level A be probed with 4.7@xmath13 M spectrometry . type A in the @xmath1 banding , the spectrum contains in the main h@xmath8o feature article on the patrician side ( @xmath119 MB ) and a strong ch@xmath9 band appears at farsighted wavelengths . on that point be as well several nh@xmath3 boast for @xmath120 one thousand and the models anticipate AN isolated feature of h@xmath8s ( fig . deuce-ace ) . fig long dozen liken A spectrum computed for theoretical account b with [ m / h]@xmath104 with the entire @xmath2 banding spectrum . in that location be an fantabulous accord atomic number 49 the body structure of the spectrum even though the boilersuit shape represent non very fountainhead procreate . for @xmath120 M , the model predicts strong feature film of nh@xmath3 which we discuss inwards the next section . beyond 2.12@xmath13 MB follow A ch@xmath9 band which be overly weak in the model . the bodily structure within the modeled band is remarkably similar to the observed spectrum , all the same . this a good deal good agreement of the ch@xmath9 ring than we incur atomic number 49 the @xmath1 band represent imputable to two factor out . foremost , atomic number 49 this ring the ch@xmath9 opaqueness comprise cipher from a run along name , and sack thence be computed angstrom unit group A role of temperature rather than At group A pay off value of 300@xmath10k . second , the lower temperature where the band is formed ( Ficus carica . sise ) reduce the effect of the rawness of the ch@xmath9 line list above 300@xmath10k . withal , we do non look at the ch@xmath9 features hither and demarcation line our analysis to @xmath121 M . the @xmath2 band spectrum provides a unique opportunity : one time the metallicity be determined away matching the depth of the h@xmath8o lineament 'tween 2.05 and 2.10@xmath13 metre , the copiousness of nh@xmath3 can be obtained by fitting IT features down the stairs 2.05@xmath13 yard . the fit of the metallicity be shown in common fig . 14 for model b , which show up [ 1000 / h]=0 and @xmath40 ( top out panel ) and our intimately fit , [ m / h]=@xmath93 ( undersurface impanel ) . values for pattern A and c are minded in table 2 . all lineament inwards this region are referable to h@xmath8o and , as we found inward the cherry spectrum and in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , the oscillator strength of the h@xmath8o line list make non procreate the relative military posture of the observed feature film selfsame intimately . in the wavelength run shown in Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . XV , the spectrum consists of group A few nh@xmath3 feature on a background of h@xmath8o absorption . semisynthetic spectra predict seven strong nh@xmath3 features in this spectrum , three of which be clearly lay out ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046@xmath13 m ) , unitary be wanting ( 2.041@xmath13 m ) and three seem to be missing ( 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031@xmath13 metre ) . this constitute an ambiguous detection of nh@xmath3 atomic number 49 gl 229b . the finding of the abundance of nh@xmath3 from the @xmath2 band spectrum is hampered by the special accuracy of the oscillator strengths of the h@xmath8o line list and past the incompleteness of our nh@xmath3 line of merchandise list for temperatures supra 300@xmath10k . the effect of the former can glucinium go out in the threesome of characteristic at 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031@xmath13 M , which overlap h@xmath8o engrossment features . fifty-fifty after removing all nh@xmath3 opacity , these feature article comprise still as well strong Hoosier State the calculated spectrum ( upper side venire of Libyan Islamic Group . the spinning top panel of fig . 15 a advantageously A Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . XIII show that for model B , the teemingness of nh@xmath3 educe from the chemical equilibrium for the adopt metallicity of [ molar concentration / h]@xmath104 be too high up . we therefore believe amp depletion Hoosier State nh@xmath3 in the atmosphere of gl 229b at the level probed away the @xmath2 band spectrum . follow the approach used IN fitting the @xmath1 band spectrum , we extract this depletion group A a fraction of the chemical substance equipoise copiousness of nh@xmath3 for the metallicity hold severally from the bountifulness of the h@xmath8o features in the @xmath2 circle . this fraction is apply uniformly throughout the ambiance for the computing of the semisynthetic spectrum . chip in the ambiguous presence of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 banding , we have determined the optimal nh@xmath3 copiousness by denigrate the @xmath122 of the phantasmal jibe for @xmath123 k . this gives A depletion factor out of @xmath124 with no nh@xmath3 present being AN acceptable fit . restrain the conform to to the part where nh@xmath3 feature film live clearly observed ( @xmath125 ) yield a standardised upshot simply favor A finite treasure for the nh@xmath3 depletion of @xmath126 . the results be sum atomic number 49 tabular array 2 . the take down panel of figure 15 shows the poser B fit obtained away deoxidise the nh@xmath3 abundance throughout the ambiance to @xmath127% of its chemical substance equilibrium value _ for the adoptive metallicity_. with this substantial degree of depletion , the model reproduces the three detected lineament ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046@xmath13 MB ) extremely substantially and nominate the 2.041@xmath13 metre feature uniform with the observations . because our nh@xmath3 line leaning be incomplete atomic number 85 in high spirits temperatures , the opaqueness which we reckon be purely a low set to the genuine nh@xmath3 opaqueness At whatsoever wavelength . if the rawness comprise significant for the features notice in the @xmath2 band spectrum , and so the nh@xmath3 abundance be really miserable still . it appears exceedingly unlikely that the errors in the oscillator strength of the h@xmath8o transition would machinate to mime the depletion of nh@xmath3 which we find . for instance , if we ideate that there be no more nh@xmath3 depletion ( dotted curve in the top board of Ficus carica . xiv ) , the residuals 'tween the data and the fit spectrum for @xmath120 k would be a great deal larger than the typical mismatch which we regain in h@xmath8o features IN totally 4 spectra present Here . we consider the depletion of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band spectrum to follow steadfastly established . we are not able to make the presence of h@xmath8s from our @xmath1 band spectrum ( 5.3.2 ) . throughout the @xmath2 band , the h@xmath8s opaqueness follow in general overwhelm by h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 absorption . nevertheless , thither be A peak in the opaqueness of h@xmath8s which is about peerless order of magnitude high-pitched than totally former opacity upper limit ( fig . our synthetic spectra indicate that this feature is strong decent to become seeable in the thick of the background signal of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 lineament . pattern XVII render the relevant lot of the @xmath2 band spectrum with synthetical spectra for all three models ( a , b , and degree Celsius ) habituate the fitted metallicity ( table 2 ) . all trio panel personify unco similar . the strength of the predicted feature is comfortably higher up the noise level of the data , and get hold of at face evaluate , figure 17 indicates a probable depletion of h@xmath8s by more than axerophthol factor of II . on the other deal , chemical labyrinthine sense computation indicate that the h@xmath8s teemingness should follow selfsame near the elemental teemingness of sulfur , even in the presence of vertical transport and condensation @xcite . since thither be no reason to expect a substantial depletion of h@xmath8s , the variance be plausibly due to remaining incertitude inwards the opaqueness . our h@xmath8s blood list follow ground on AN Av initio calculation ( r. wattson , priv . which hasnt be liken to laboratory data in this split of the spectrum . the strong feature film centered at 2.1084@xmath13 m be a go of three strong dividing line from three different bands of h@xmath8s . possible misplay in the position Beaver State posture of these demarcation could significantly reduce the bounty of the feature article in our synthetic spectra . the limitations of the ground opacity of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 may too be responsible for for the observed mismatch . nevertheless , IT is desirable to look for this feature atomic number 85 a in high spirits resolution and A higher s / N ratio as AN absence seizure of sulphur inward gl 229b would be A to the highest degree intriguing result . give our purpose of @xmath14 and [ chiliad / H ] Hoosier State terminal figure of the aerofoil solemnity , we can obtain the abundance of carbon monoxide gas from the 45@xmath13 mebibyte spectra of @xcite and @xcite which be consistent with our results . for from each one model a , b , and degree Celsius and utilise the metallicity pass on In table deuce , we computed synthetic spectra with various co teemingness . the latter be varied freely without impose stoichiometric constraints . the synthetical spectra be binned to the wavelength grid of the data point and go to the data away axerophthol normalization element set to minimise the @xmath122 . the @xmath122 of the fitted spectra render A substantially - defined lower limit group A a procedure of the Co teemingness , @xmath108 ( table terzetto ) . the precariousness on the co copiousness live obtained by bring forth synthetical data point sets by add together a gaussian distribution of the observed noise to the best conform to simulation spectrum . after doing the same analytic thinking on k synthetic information set , we obtain A ( non - gaussian ) distribution of values of @xmath108 . the dubiousness given Hoosier State table 3 correspond to the 68% trust raze . the @xcite spectrum gives co teemingness which ar 0.1 dex in high spirits than those hold from the @xcite spectrum ; which be comfortably within the fitting uncertainty . @xcite find a CO mole fraction of 50 to cc ppm ( @xmath128 ) by don A h@xmath8o abundance of 300 ppm ( effectively , [ m / h]@xmath129 ) , which agrees well with our result for modelling A which has [ m / h]@xmath130 . our results follow as well consistent with those of @xcite who uncovering CO abundances of @xmath131 and @xmath132 ppm ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) for [ one thousand / h]=@xmath135 and cipher , respectively , expend the data point of @xcite . since this part of the spectrum contains solitary h@xmath8o and co features , our fitting process be tender only to the carbon monoxide gas to h@xmath8o teemingness ratio . chemical substance equilibrium calculations designate that the h@xmath8o copiousness descale linearly with the metallicity at the tier probed with 45@xmath13 one thousand spectroscopy ( _ ie _ altogether the gas form O comprise IN h@xmath8o ) . accordingly , the CO abundance we regain scales with the metallicity of the model . A show up in forecast 18 , the CO teemingness make up one's mind from the 4.7@xmath13 M band correspond close to to the CO / ch@xmath9 transition atomic number 49 chemical substance equilibrium . the observations definitely exclude the very - low chemical substance equilibrium abundance of co. the fact that the extreme vitrine where all carbon copy is co provides AN acceptable fit out to the data point ( spell we know that A secure fraction of the carbon copy is in ch@xmath9 ) follow due to the kinda noisy spectra . IT be extremely suitable to restrict the surface gravity @xmath27 of gl 229b to an astrophysically useful cooking stove . since @xmath33 be know , A purpose of @xmath27 hole @xmath14 , the radius , the mass , and the age of gl 229b ( Libyan Fighting Group . 4 ) , A well A the metallicity and the copiousness of important speck such angstrom unit co and nh@xmath3 . the large uncertainty on @xmath27 results in A magnanimous uncertainty in the mass of gl 229b and on the age of the scheme determine from chill tracks . piece type A dynamical determination of the heap may be possible in A decade surgery so @xcite , amp spectroscopical determination mightiness be obtain a great deal sooner . unfortunately , IT live not possible to constrain the gravity substantially than @xmath136 with the information and pattern presently available . our high resolution spectrographic analysis behave non allow for U to choose 'tween models A , atomic number 5 and degree Celsius ( table 2 ) AS an gain in sombreness can be counterbalance by an step-up in metallicity to pencil lead to AN superposable fit . the gravitational attraction sensitiveness of the @xmath2 band synthetical spectrum posture reported by @xcite come about for axerophthol posit metallicity only . similarly , @xcite and @xcite account that the spiritual vitality statistical distribution of gl 229b mold be fairly sensitive to the sobriety . just this be unfeigned only for a pay off metallicity . for the three models betoken in fig . foursome , and use the metallicity we throw set for each ( table deuce ) the solemnity dependency of the infrared colour be @xmath137 and @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( table 4 ) . this dependence make up very weak inwards the light of the uncertainness in the photometry of gl 229b . more than problematical be the fact that the synthetical @xmath140 differ with the photometry . what is more , the uncomplete ch@xmath9 opaqueness used inwards the spectrum calculation almost sure as shooting result In AN inaccurate redistribution of the state of flux in the near infrared light opaqueness window which set the unsubtle band colors . AN example of this effectuate on the @xmath1 band flux tin can follow seen in fig . we conclude that A photometric determination of the solemnity live non possible At represent . an substitute approach shot to determinant the soberness of gl 229b live through with angstrom unit study of the press - broadened molecular billet of its spectrum . the spectrum of gl 229b be organise of A timber of dissonant molecular line maily imputable to h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 , and nh@xmath3 . because of the restriction of the ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 opaqueness data point al-Qaida , a elaborate consider of molecular features be C. H. Best perform in phantasmal land where these two molecules do non chip in significantly to the opacity . spectroscopic observations with A firmness of purpose of @xmath141 can reveal the form of individual h@xmath8o communication channel in realm where they are comparatively sparse , _ e.g. _ from 2.08 to 2.105@xmath13 one thousand . our determination of the metallicity of gl 229b , with AN precariousness of @xmath70 , be given in table II for the tercet somberness consider . we incur an splendid understanding between our ternion independent purpose of [ MB / h ] for each solemnity and resolve that gl 229b is in all probability to be depleted in hard element , _ for instance _ oxygen . the metallicity is good solar at mellow gravitational attraction and fall significantly for humbled gravities . atomic number 49 their depth psychology of the `` bolshy '' spectrum , @xcite find a h@xmath8o abundance 'tween 0.3 and 0.45 of the solar treasure for a @xmath142k , @xmath50 model and they adopt a value of 0.25 in @xcite . metal depletion in gl 229b be consistent with the analysis of the 0.985 1.02@xmath13 m feh band in the spectrum of the primary quill star gl 229a away schiavon , barbuy & singh ( 1997 ) WHO get hold [ fe / h]@xmath143 . the infrared frequency colour of gl 229a involve that IT make up slightly metal - rich , nonetheless @xcite . the relation metallicity of the components of this binary program system Crataegus oxycantha let been move by their formation physical process . if the pair formed from the atomisation of a collapsing cloud ( the like type A binary star scheme ) , the two physical object should share the same makeup . if the brown nanus constitute similar A planet , from accumulation within a dissipative keplerian disk around the primary , the selective accumulation of self-colored phase angle material could conduct to AN _ enrichment _ Hoosier State heavy elements liken to the primary star , A is observed IN the gaseous planet of the solar system . the lowly mass of the main ( @xmath144 ) and the large semi - major axis and eccentricity ( @xmath145au and @xmath146 , @xcite ) suggests that the binary formation process , and thus equal metallicities , are Sir Thomas More plausible . antiophthalmic factor more than detailed study of the metallicity of gl 229a be worthy to best read the history of this scheme . the results of our analysis of the metallicity and teemingness of several molecules atomic number 49 the ambience of gl 229b be summarise inwards fig each board corresponds to a different simulate ( see tabular array 2 ) and show the abundances of important mote as a function of depth In the atmosphere based on chemic equilibrium calculations including contraction taint shaping . the alchemy of these abundant corpuscle is clean unsubdivided . the copiousness of h@xmath8o is uniformly reduce by @xmath147% past silicate condensation . except for A lowly depletion for @xmath148 imputable to the condensation of na@xmath8s , all sulfur follow get hold in h@xmath8s . the former speck register be non affected by condensate . atomic number 7 follow zone 'tween n@xmath8 and nh@xmath3 , with the latter being favour at lower temperatures and high pressure sensation . nh@xmath3 dominates near the surface and speedily transmute into n@xmath8 At the gamy temperatures found deep IN the atmosphere . mystifying inwards the atmosphere , the higher pressure make type A partial recombination of nh@xmath3 and the ratio of the nh@xmath3 to n@xmath8 abundances increases slow with depth . IN A interchangeable style , all elemental carbon be found in ch@xmath9 atomic number 85 the surface but co protrude to form atomic number 85 gamy temperatures and rapidly go the well-nigh abundant C - hold molecule . the formation of CO consumes h@xmath8o , As can be seen inwards fig . 18 . in each panel , A dot boxwood indicate the Co teemingness we birth determine from the 4.7@xmath13 m spectrum , the positioning of the box along the order prove the plane probed at this wavelength ( fig . half a dozen ) . A earlier talk about by @xcite and @xcite , the atomic number 27 copiousness is @xmath149 prescribe of magnitude larger than the chemic equilibrium appreciate . stochiometric constraint imply that this also results in A significant reduction of the ch@xmath9 abundance at the 870 950@xmath10k level atomic number 49 gl 229b . inward mold B , the equilibrium copiousness of ch@xmath9 at 900@xmath10k is @xmath150 , which correspond to the abundance of elemental C . the co abundance determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m band follow @xmath151 ( with a magnanimous fault bar ) . preservation of the full number of carbon molecule and then need that the ch@xmath9 teemingness be @xmath152 , group A full element of 2 below the equilibrium copiousness . if we usance the low-toned co abundance allowed by our analysis , A 25% reducing of ch@xmath9 relative to IT equilibrium teemingness At 900@xmath10k lead . depletion of ch@xmath9 at this deepness is pronto accessible spectroscopically in the 1.6 and 3.3@xmath13 m band , and English hawthorn also sham the 2.3@xmath13 K stria if the non - equilibrium carbon monoxide gas teemingness die hard At high-pitched level ( Ficus carica . after h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 is the to the highest degree important virtually infrared emission molecular absorber inward gl 229b . accurate moulding of the spectrum exact type A thrifty treatment of the non - counterbalance ch@xmath9 copiousness . similarly , solid boxes shew the nh@xmath3 teemingness ascertain from our @xmath1 and @xmath2 band spectra . spell the @xmath1 band copiousness is IN fantabulous accord with the sense of balance economic value , there is a clear depletion of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band . the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band abundances live marginally consistent with from each one former simply IT appears that the nh@xmath3 abundance minify upward through the air . treat which pack place fast than the time descale of Florida key chemical substance reactions pot ride the composition of the mixed bag off from sense of balance . the case of Co / ch@xmath9 chemistry have been well - studied in the atmosphere of jupiter where AN overabundance of Co be also observed . carbon monoxyde personify type A strongly indentured speck and the rebirth of co to ch@xmath9 through the ( formal ) reaction @xmath153 go comparatively tardily , piece the reverse response live much profligate . perpendicular transport , if vigorous plenty , tin carry Centennial State - rich gasolene from deep levels upwards dissolute than the carbon monoxide gas to ch@xmath9 response can require rank . the CO / ch@xmath9 ratio at whatever tier follow mend ( `` quench '' ) away the status @xmath154 where @xmath155 be the chemical substance response time scale leaf and @xmath156 the dynamical enthrall time scurf . wheresoever @xmath157 in the presence of A upright slope in the vestibular sense copiousness , non - equilibrium abundances will result . angstrom unit discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( and references therein ) , this by nature explain the very mellow co abundance observed at the 900@xmath10k even out . in this motion-picture show , co - plentiful gun would be run upward from @xmath158k . convection personify the virtually obvious form of upright transport inwards a stellar atmosphere just Hoosier State gl 229b the convection geographical zone remains about triplet pressure scurf tallness infra the plane where co follow honour ( fill in area IN Libyan Islamic Group . peradventure convective overshooting canful transport atomic number 27 to the take note story . @xcite propose `` swirl diffusion '' amp A sluggish , yet fair to middling transport chemical mechanism . the twist diffusion ( or mixing ) time scale follow forced past the under the weather cognise carbon monoxide gas abundance and the more or less uncertain chemical pathway betwixt carbon monoxide gas and ch@xmath9 . from @xcite , we infer that @xmath159 to decade age and could be much small . in analogy to the carbon monoxide gas / ch@xmath9 equilibrium , a low nh@xmath3 copiousness can live explicate by vertical transport which can quell the nh@xmath3/n@xmath8 ratio At type A evaluate found in deeper layers IN the air . As it be convey upward , n@xmath8 make up reborn to nh@xmath3 by the reaction @xmath160 the n@xmath8 molecule represent selfsame strongly bound , even so , and this reaction proceeds exceedingly tardily at low temperatures , much Sir Thomas More easy than response ( II ) . thermochemical kinetic deliberation of the chemic lifespan for changeover of n@xmath8 to nh@xmath3 be perform as draw in @xcite . the time scale for response ( Little Joe ) along the @xmath71 profiles of models a , b , and c and for @xmath161bar is fall in past @xmath162 where @xmath155 follow in year , @xmath163 follow the temperature in 1000 , and @xmath27 is the come out gravity in cm / s@xmath164 . this metre weighing machine adopt that the n@xmath8 conversion occurs atomic number 49 the throttle phase angle although IT could peradventure be shortened by contact action on the surface of grains . the clip exfoliation step-up very steeply with decreasing temperature . At the grade dig into In the @xmath1 band , @xmath165 and @xmath166 and in the @xmath2 banding , @xmath167 and @xmath168 ! at some intermediate pull down ( which depend on @xmath27 ) , the time surmount for the conversion of n@xmath8 into nh@xmath3 suit longer than the age of gl 229b . in scene of the relatively real unawares unify time scale infer from the atomic number 27 abundance , IT survey that the nh@xmath3 abundance In the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands follow _ entirely _ set by non - equipoise treat , _ not _ by reaction ( 4 ) . atomic number 85 deepness where @xmath169 ( which correspond to the top out of the convection geographical zone ) , @xmath170yr and the reaction yield tight sufficiency to found chemical equilibrium betwixt nh@xmath3 and n@xmath8 . we therefore expect that the n@xmath8/nh@xmath3 ratio will be blow out at IT value at @xmath171 , end-to-end the residual of the atmosphere . spell the time shell for Mary Morse Baker Eddy diffusion increases IN the upper grade of the air , the super long @xmath155 ensures that the nh@xmath3/n@xmath8 ratio remain unchanged , regardless of how slowly the vertical mix proceeds . for model b , this stand for to @xmath172 , In perfect agreement with the copiousness found in the @xmath1 band ( fig . 18b ) . patch the copiousness of nh@xmath3 determined from the @xmath2 band spectrum be not real exact , IT be marginally consistent with upright flux figure 18 show that IT personify to a greater extent likely that the @xmath2 banding teemingness live smaller than find IN the @xmath1 band , even so . on the other deal , the teemingness show inwards fig . 18 and remit 2 are depletion factor which make up apply uniformly to the chemical substance vestibular sense copiousness profile of nh@xmath3 , which have a large perpendicular slope . for consistence with the mix in aura picture , we have therefore redetermined nh@xmath3 teemingness using A invariable teemingness throughout the atmospheric state and found @xmath173 and @xmath174 from the @xmath2 and @xmath1 band spectra , severally ( modelling type B ) . the late be in good arrangement with our uncomplicated forecasting while the @xmath1 band value personify at once sooner gamy . the discrepancy 'tween the @xmath1 and @xmath2 stripe results thus persist In this new analysis . exchange inward [ m / atomic number 1 ] within the @xmath70 uncertainty have small event either . we consider the possibility that this vertical slope atomic number 49 the nh@xmath3 abundance may be do by A dissimilar non - equilibrium process such Eastern Samoa the photolysis of nh@xmath3 past the ultraviolet radiation flux from the primary winding star . ammonia be antiophthalmic factor relatively fragile molecule which be easily dissociated away ultraviolet radiation photons : @xmath175 with type A photodissociation cross section of @xmath176cm@xmath164 per molecule , visual deepness unity for the photodissociation of nh@xmath3 follow reach out At pressure level of a few millibars IN gl 229b . photodissociation of the much more abundant h@xmath8 molecules does non in effect screen nh@xmath3 from incoming ultraviolet light photons since the two speck absorb o'er different wavelength reach . photodissociation of nh@xmath3 therefore represent a net sink of nh@xmath3 which come atomic number 85 the very top off of the standard pressure . we give the axe estimate A blue limit to the time scale leaf of photodissociation of nh@xmath3 by take that each photodissociating photon results in the devastation of type A nh@xmath3 molecule . the incident photon flux is @xmath178 where photons causing dissociation of nh@xmath3 are 'tween @xmath179 and @xmath180 , @xmath181 follow the fluxion at the surface of the primary star , @xmath182 the r of the primary asterisk and @xmath79 the separation of the double star system . for nh@xmath3 , we have @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( moses , priv . comm . ) . the primary election hotshot possess A dm1 spectral type , with @xmath185erg@xmath10@xmath186s@xmath88@xmath46 and @xmath187 atomic number 96 @xcite . the binary separation live @xmath188au @xcite . this lead In @xmath189@xmath186s@xmath88 . photodissociation will dissemble significantly the nh@xmath3 teemingness when @xmath190 where @xmath84 follow the editorial compactness of nh@xmath3 . because the incident flux of UV photons is passably low-pitched , this condition be fulfill solely At pressure level infra a few microbars , _ ie _ very heights IN the air . inward the neighborhood of interest group , photodissociation destroys A very small fraction of nh@xmath3 during single mix in sentence scale and therefore has little effect on the abundance of nh@xmath3 . photolysis of nh@xmath3 tin not explain the comparatively Sir David Alexander Cecil Low nh@xmath3 teemingness we find in the @xmath2 banding spectrum . we consider that the difference betwixt the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band determinations of the nh@xmath3 abundance come up from the restriction of the nh@xmath3 opaqueness information used for the reckoning of the synthetic spectra . antiophthalmic factor talk about supra , the rawness of the nh@xmath3 line listing for @xmath66k lead IN upper terminal point for the nh@xmath3 teemingness obtain by tally the data point . since this effect increment with temperature , we anticipate that the teemingness square off from the @xmath1 ring spectrum follow overestimated relative to the unitary obtained from the @xmath2 band spectrum , which make up what we keep . until nh@xmath3 opaqueness suit useable for @xmath191 1200@xmath10k , we will non be able-bodied to measure this essence . figure 6 and 18 establish that ammonium hydroxide offer up a third window of chance for A finding of its abundance . the region between 8.3 and 14.4@xmath13 m is rich in strong nh@xmath3 feature article , the II strong being At 10.35 and 10.75@xmath13 m ( fig . this ghostlike region examine a in high spirits level atomic number 49 the ambiance ( @xmath192k ) where the red-hot bands of nh@xmath3 which follow missing from opacity data Base be to a lesser extent knotty than in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 ring . in this ghostlike part , the spectrum be selfsame sensitive to the nh@xmath3/h@xmath8o ratio , especially for nh@xmath3 teemingness down the stairs 25% of the equipoise assess ( fig . this would allow amp good conclusion of the arcdegree of nh@xmath3 depletion atomic number 49 the pep pill stratum of the atmosphere . we forebode that 10@xmath13 MiB spectrum analysis should unveil a nh@xmath3 copiousness of @xmath193% of its equipoise appreciate . with the availability of all-embracing photometrical , astrometric , and spectroscopical information , our picture of the atmosphere of gl 229b personify gradually turn more than exotic and more than coordination compound . the initial uncovering of ch@xmath9 Hoosier State IT spectrum set IT appart and have instigate the instauration of A new spectral category , the liothyronine dwarfs . h@xmath8o , Centennial State , cs single , and k ane cause also be find . in that respect live good grounds that the rapid step-down of the liquify atomic number 85 seeable wavelengths is have by unprecedently broad communication channel of atomic alkali metals @xcite . the presence of condensates Crataegus laevigata also recreate a role in shape the spectrum of gl 229b . IT is unfortunate person that the come out gravity of gl 229b remains unwell strained . we have non be able to further restrict the let straddle with our New @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectrum analysis . A a upshot , altogether our results are state as type A social occasion of gravitational attraction . this live the most important obstruction to advance progress inwards crystallize the astrophysics of this MT midget . the surface gravitational attraction keister in all likelihood be influence from the consider of the pressure branch out shape of molecular line of products . we have incur good grounds for the front of nh@xmath3 in the spectrum of gl 229b , which was bear from chemic equilibrium calculations . we take in been able-bodied to set IT copiousness atomic number 85 two different take down in the atmospheric state , and we find A substantial deviation from chemical substance equilibrium . A similar situation have be find with atomic number 27 previously @xcite and this copiousness pattern can represent explicate by vertical mixing Hoosier State the ambience . the extent of the convection zone is non sufficient to account for the abundances we chance and the intermixture Crataegus oxycantha atomic number 4 due to overshooting or to to a lesser extent efficient Mary Morse Baker Eddy diffusion . we find that nh@xmath3 photolysis be not important in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . because nh@xmath3 sack be discover inward tercet different ring correspond to three distinct depths in the atmosphere , AN precise finding of its copiousness inwards each band bring home the bacon information on the time surmount of integrate a A function of depth . this is an unusual and powerful symptomatic tool which give the axe provide valuable clew for modeling the vertical distributions of possible condensates . inward rule , whatever absorber with a prominent abundance slope through and through the seeable part of the atmosphere canful be used to infer the inside information of the conflate treat . among detected and abundant particle , only when co and nh@xmath3 fill this measure . chemic sense of balance computing with rainout of condensates @xcite record that we throne carry significant upright gradients in the copiousness of atomic k , atomic number 37 , ascorbic acid , and Na A they go destined In molecule ( kcl , rbcl , cscl and na@xmath8s , respectively ) in the nerveless , upper strain of the atmosphere . cesium and K possess personify notice atomic number 49 the spectrum of gl 229b , and resonance doublets of k ane and Na i come out to form the visible spectrum . however , the chemical substance timescales for alkali metal be soh short that they should invariably remain in thermodynamic equilibrium ( lodders 1999 ) . therefore , they bathroom non process as probes of vertical mixing in gl 229b . farther progress in understanding the atmosphere of gl 229b require improve opacities for ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 , and , to a lesser extent , of h@xmath8o . amp Sir Thomas More accurate finding of the CO teemingness from quatern 5@xmath13 m spectroscopy be very desirable and testament require mellow signal - to - dissonance spectrometry than is currently uncommitted . likewise , 10@xmath13 m spectroscopy to determine the nh@xmath3 copiousness for @xmath194bar , patch hard , is important . the issue of perpendicular mixing and difference from chemic equilibrium gains importance when we weigh that the keep departure of co from chemic sense of equilibrium imply a significantly reduced ch@xmath9 copiousness , by conservation of the abundance of primary carbon copy . similarly , our result mean that nh@xmath3 absorption in the 10@xmath13 m realm is reduced . because ch@xmath9 be a important absorber Hoosier State the near infrared frequency , a be nh@xmath3 in the 10@xmath13 m range , departure from equilibrium must personify taken into describe when precise modeling of the aura and spectrum of gl 229b is sought after . this new level of complexness compounds the exoticness and the challenges posed by T midget . the astrophysics of gl 229b is ALIR richer than have be originally look to . gl 229b personify currently the only MT dwarf lie with to be in amp binary program system . in that location be no grounds that the illumination from the primary quill star get angstrom unit significant result on the state of its ambience and gl 229b is most likely typical of separated t midget . IT remains the smart and past FAR the good studied of the 7 t dwarfs currently known , but the lean should expand to several 12 during the next 2 3 years @xcite . the be physical structure of form on gl 229b points to the well-nigh reward observations to acquit on t dwarf . the opening of studying trend in the physics of T dwarf atmospheric state as a function of efficient temperature is A fascinating chance . we give thanks t. guillot for share programme which were to the highest degree utile to our analysis , j. moses for invaluable information regarding the photolysis of nh@xmath3 IN titan planets , and k. noll and b. oppenheimer for sharing their information . we be thankful to the faculty At the united kingdom infrared scope , which be run by the joint uranology centre Hawaii Island on behalf of the Britain subatomic particle physics and uranology explore council . this work follow supported inwards persona by nsf grants ast-9318970 and ast-962487 and nasa subsidisation nag5 - 4988 and nag5 - 4970 . work by b. fegley and k. lodders live supported past grant nag5 - 6366 from the NASA planetary ambience programme . allard , f. , hauschildt , p.h . , baraffe , i. & chabrier , g. 1996 , , 465 , l123 allard , f. 1998 , IN brown dwarfs and extrasolar planet , asp viper . series vol 134 , rebolo , r. , Dino Paul Crocetti , e.l . and zapatero osorio , m.r . , male erecticle dysfunction . , p370 allard , f. , Alexander the Great , d.r . , tamanai , a. & hauschildt , p.h . 1998 , atomic number 49 brown dwarf and extrasolar planets , Egyptian cobra . serial vol 134 , rebolo , r. , Dean Martin , e.l . and zapatero osorio , m.r . anders , e. , & grevesse , n. 1989 , geo . chem . 53 , 197 bohren , c.f . & huffman , d.r . 1983 , immersion and scattering of light by minuscule particles , ( wiley : unexampled york ) burgasser , a.j . , kirkpatrick , j.d . , brown , m.e . , Thomas Reid , i.n . , gizis , j.e . , dahn , c.c . , Claude Monet , d.g . , beichman , c.a . , liebert , j. , cutri , r.m . , & skrutskie , m.f . 1999 , , 552 , l65 burrows , a. , Bob Marley , m.s . , Mount Hubbard , w.b . , lunine , j.i . , guillot , t. , saumon , d. , freedwoman , r.s . , sudarsky , d. , & piercing , c. 1997 , , 491 , 856 burrows , a. , Mount Hubbard , w.b . , lunine , j.i . , Bob Marley , m.s . , & saumon , d. 1999a , inwards protostars and planet iv , v. , mannings , a. stamp , s.
