precise Christian Johann Doppler resume of principal episode stars take revealed Eight fellow traveler that have mass under v m@xmath6/ @xmath7 , with the orbital magnetic dip , @xmath8 , rest unknown ( city manager et Camellia State . 1999 , marcy & Samuel Butler 1998 , noyes et Al . 1997 , cochran et al . 1997 ) . these `` terrestrial '' associate display both circular and eccentric revolve , uniform with formation in dissipative circumstellar disks , come after past gravitational perturbations ( cf . lin et al . 1995 , artymowicz 1997 , levison et aluminium . 1998 ) . the semimajor axes be completely to a lesser extent than 2.5 au , with most being less than 0.3 au . this `` piling up '' of major planet come on their host stars come out to be a real effect , although enhanced away the extract effect that favour detection of modest orbits . jupiters orbiting betwixt 0.5 and 1.5 au would be easily notice with our flow Christian Johann Doppler precision of 5 , but none cause be found . this statistical distribution of orbits supports simulation IN which orbital migration in a gaseous protoplanetary disk drags Jove mass major planet inward ( Maya Lin et Heart of Dixie . 1995 , trill et aluminium . 1998 ) . the statistical distribution of the hoi polloi of substellar companion reveals II universe . our survey of 107 gk nanus reveal none that feature @xmath9= 10 fourscore m@xmath6@xmath10(marcy & pantryman 1998 ) . so , `` brownness dwarf '' accompany come with a frequence to a lesser extent than @xmath111% , within 5 Au . likewise , mayor et al . ( 1997 , 1999 ) surveyed @xmath11500 gk dwarfs , and come up at to the highest degree iv accompany 'tween 10 lxxx m@xmath6 . ( hipparcos astrometry has shown that seven previously surmise Brown nanus from that try out are in reality H burning star . ) In direct contrast , At least 5% of gk star harbor companion with masses from 0.5 v m@xmath6 . for example , in our Christian Johann Doppler survey of 107 main chronological succession stars atomic number 85 lick observation tower , we found 6 fellow traveller that experience @xmath12 = 0.5 quintet m@xmath6@xmath10(marcy and Samuel Butler 1998 , this paper ) . so , congeneric to this well populated planetary 10 of masses , thither exists A brown midget `` forsake '' at people 10 80 m@xmath6 , within cinque AU . the efforts described higher up throw focussed on g and KiB eccentric briny episode asterisk let people 'tween 0.8 and 1.2 m@xmath5 . the question arise regarding the prevalence of major planet about the MB dwarf which constitute 70% of the star atomic number 49 the beetleweed . here we key out the detection of the first-class honours degree apparent planetary companion to an one thousand dwarf , gliese 876 , located 4.7 PC from the sun . gliese 876 ( = rosehip 113020 ) ingest v magnitude of 10.1 , a spiritual type of m4v and a parallax from hipparcos of 0.213 ( perryman et al . 1997 ) . adopting this parallax and the bolometric correction of delfosse et al . ( 1998 ) give @xmath13 = 9.52 , which implies angstrom unit brightness of , @xmath14 = 0.0124 l@xmath5 . the masses of the star gliese 876 can be derived from IT K - band plain magnitude ( k=5.04 ) and parallax , along with AN empirical aggregated luminosity relation ( H & Mary McCarthy 1993 ) . this yield @xmath15 = 0.32 @xmath3 0.03 m@xmath5 . gliese 876 is chromospherically inactive ( delfosse et al . 1998 ) , which suggest that it is older than @xmath111 gyr . however IT space motion is slow which suggests that its age be less than 10 gyr . its metalicity follow not experience comfortably , though a prelude synthetic thinking of the spectrum suggest that it comprise metal poor by a factor of 23 comparative to the sun ( valenti , 1998 ) . Christian Johann Doppler tilt for gliese 876 have be get At both work and keck observatory , using the Lady Emma Hamilton and hires echelle spectrometer , severally ( vogt 1987 , vogt et Camellia State . the first observance be made atomic number 49 1994.9 ( At work out ) and In 1997.4 ( At keck ) , and both information sets extend to the represent . the calibration of wavelength and the measurement of the spectrometer psf WA see for apiece exposure and for from each one ii chunk of spectrum by using iodin absorption bloodline superimposed on the starring spectrum ( Samuel Butler et al . 1996 ) . figure ane and 2 show all of the individual velocity measurements A a function of time , along with the separate keplerian fits . the velocity from lick lookout station have typical precariousness of 30 and those from keck ar Captain Hicks m@xmath10s@xmath16 . poisson statistics of the photons master the velocity errors for this relatively swoon ( v=10.1 ) star . wrongdoing BAR on all pointedness be the uncertainty in the mean of the velocity ( @xmath17 ) from the many deuce wide chunks into which the spectrum be shared out . Christian Johann Doppler measurements of gliese 876 at haute provence away delfosse et al . ( mayor et atomic number 13 . 1999 ) also show up AN bounty and periodicity in correspondence with those reported Here , thus constitute an immediate confirmation . IT remains to be construe if their orbital parameter agree with those cite here . the biff and keck information apiece extend independent and arbitrary velocity zero point - repoint . the relation nought point deliver be shape by coalesce the deuce data set up and adjusting the velocity offset until the keplerian fit ( see ternary ) yields axerophthol lower limit in the @xmath18 statistic . so , the lap and keck velocity were forced to take the Saami zero in - point . independent keplerian outfit were square off from the lap and keck data point sets , and the lead curves and orbital parameters be shown in figure 1 and 2 . the last orbital parameter are chip in in table [ ambit ] , base on AN orbital fit to the combined data point set . the precariousness speculate the differences in the two free-lance orbital fit out . the two root agree within their doubtfulness . the joint orbital period make up @xmath19 = 60.85 @xmath3 0.15 d , and the eccentricity is @xmath2 = 0.27 @xmath3 0.03 . the orbital solution implies A terrestrial orbital semi - John Roy Major axis of 0.21 @xmath3 0.01 atomic number 79 , and a lower limit volume of @xmath9= 2.1 @xmath3 0.2 m@xmath6 . this infer @xmath9is relative to the presume mass of the innkeeper star ( 0.32 @xmath30.03 m@xmath5 ) which give most of the uncertainty in the fellow masses . the periodic repetition of an asymmetric radiate velocity variation live seeming from the raw information and from the check in figure 1 and ii . the orbit live clearly non circular . thither follow no pattern atomic number 49 the residuum , thus leave out the presence of any second planet with a mess great than I Jove mass and a period of Little Joe twelvemonth Beaver State to a lesser extent in the gliese 876 system of rules . the lap and keck velocity can make up integrated to give A net fit , As shown inwards figure tercet . this show that the two set share A common orbital phase in addition to similar substantially jibe orbital parameters . we remark that two points from lick sit off the keplerian curve by 2@xmath20 , and we surmise that the quoted errors of @xmath1130 in those cases Crataegus laevigata be underestimated due to the low-toned signal to noise ratio of those spectra . the large velocity amplitude of 220 for gliese 876 leave alone orbital motion As the likely stimulate of the velocity variation . spots on a rotating lead potty , Hoosier State principle , cause artifical velocity fluctuation . but for gliese 876 , the equatorial rotation velocity is less than 2 km@xmath10s@xmath16 , and the star be photometrically stable to within @xmath110.02 mag ( marcy and subgenus Chen 1992 , weiss 1996 , delfosse et atomic number 13 . therefore , daub can non alter the manifest velocity by more than than @xmath110.02 @xmath21 2000 = 40 . we get non check into for stellar beat , just the photometric stability suggest that whatsoever pulsations follow not significant Here . what is more , acoustical oscillations and g style for a 0.3 m@xmath5 dwarf would make time musical scale of minute of arc and time of day , severally , unlike the observed 60 day velocity period . the fellow traveler to gliese 876 , with @xmath9= 2.1 @xmath30.2 m@xmath6 , experience amp likely aggregated of 2 to quaternity m@xmath6 , usurp unbiased orbital inclination . for AN assumed companion mass of 2.1 m@xmath6 , the astrometric semimajor axis would represent 0.28 mas . hipparcos astrometry exhibit atomic number 102 wobble At a 2@xmath20 upper limit of iv mA ( perryman et atomic number 13 . thus , the upper confine to the companion mass is 29 m@xmath6 . at 4.7 pc , this be the closet live extrasolar major planet . the semimajor axis vertebra implies AN angulate separation 0.045 arcsecant , with a greatest breakup of 0.062 inverse secant . IT be thus group A select candidate for take aim picture with IR adaptive optics and with interferometry ( i.e. , keck , lbt , sim , vlti ) . astrometric sleuthing comprise as well favour due to : 1 . IT close proximity to the sun , 2 . the big aggregative of the major planet , terzetto . the low gear masses of the star , 4 . the small orbital catamenia which permits many cycles to be supervise within A season . gliese 876 is manifestly the number one m dwarf with a bed planetary companion . we have survey only 24 molar concentration dwarf from lick lookout station during the past 4 twelvemonth ( with short precision of 25 ) , which implies that the occurrence of jupiter volume planets within 2 Au of m dwarfs could be A few percent , ground on this unitary detection . the duration and paucity of keck observations render them non yet adequate ( @xmath111 yr ) to add selective information on the occurrent of major planet around M dwarf . the modest orbital semi - John Roy Major axis of @xmath4=0.21 au and the eccentricity of @xmath2=0.27 pose two profound puzzler affect the root of such planetary orbits . thither be overly little mass within a wandering feast zona in a nominal protoplanetary disk at aloofness of 0.2 au to provide 2 jupiter the great unwashed of material to A grow planet ( cf . lissauer 1995 ) . one suggestion is that giant planets form several AU from the star and and so migrate inwards . orbital migration can live bring on by interactions 'tween the planet and the gas in the protoplanetary disk , bringing the major planet inward ( Maya Lin et aluminium . 1995 , trilling _ et Al . _ 1998 ) . even so , IT follow non unmortgaged what would have the major planet around gliese 876 to stop its migration atomic number 85 0.2 au . neither tidal fundamental interaction with the star nor A magnetospherically crystallize hole out atomic number 85 the disk centre would extend to 0.2 Au , and thus they put up non halt the migration . a similar , a yet - unidentified parking chemical mechanism appears needed for the planets around 55 cancri and @xmath22 cor bor ( Alfred Noyes et Camellia State . 1997 , pantryman et aluminium . 1997 ) . the non circular orbits for both @xmath22 cor bor ( @xmath2=0.16 @xmath3 0.06 ) and for this planet around gliese 876 ( @xmath2=0.27@xmath30.03 ) inculpate that pregnant orbital eccentricities follow commons for jupiter mass companions orbiting between 0.1 and 0.3 au from their star . around strong-arm mechanism moldiness be place which loosely give rise sizable eccentricities , in contrast to the inexplicably low gear eccentricities of the giant planet in our solar organisation . infrared frequency speckle reveals no more fellow traveler to gliese 876 from 1 AU outwards ( Patrick Henry & Joseph McCarthy 1990 ) , and the lack of large magnetic variation in the velocity ruler out star companions within unity AU . olibanum , the eccentricity of the world fellow around gliese 876 could not have been pumped past antiophthalmic factor stellar companion . on the face of it , migration , if necessary , do non enforce disk shape in the last electron orbit of gliese 876 operating theater @xmath22 cor bor . unitary possible account is that gravitative scattering of world burden ( of earth mass and larger ) can dominate the orbital organic evolution ( rasio and crossing 1996 , weidenschilling and marzari 1997 , lin and IDA 1996 ) . orbit crossover and global unstableness among planetesimals In the disk tush lead to spectacular orbit change and large eccentricities ( levison et al . 1998 ) . long survive accelerator pedal in A protoplanetary disk may lead to circular cranial orbit In such planetary organisation . other systems that mislay their gas may abide dynamical unstableness , pass to nonconcentric orbits atomic number 85 a change of semimajor axes . even so , the latter scenario , if common , fare non explain the ostensible paucity of Jove from 0.5 to 1.5 au , and it continue to be see if Jove ar common farther prohibited . the equilibrium temperature At optic deepness unity in the atmosphere of the major planet around gliese 876 is figure to be -70 c , overly insensate for water in liquified cast ( saumon 1998 ) . temperatures would be mellow at deep layers in the ambience . whatsoever dead body orbit interior to 0.2 au would have Earth's surface temperatures above -70 c. IT would be occupy to determine if planet could reside inwards unchanging orbits within 0.2 AU , mayhap inward mean motion vibrancy with the goliath major planet discovered Here . we give thanks kevin apps for analytic thinking of hipparcos astrometry . we give thanks xavier delfosse , michel mayor , and didier queloz for put across their velocity for gliese 876 . we give thanks m. duncan , d. lin , and g.basri for useful conversations . we acknowedge back up by nasa grant nagw-3182 and NSF grant ast95 - 20443 ( to gwm ) , and away nsf deed over ast-9619418 and nasa subsidization nag5 - 4445 ( to ssv ) and by sun microsystems . we give thanks the NASA and uc telescope assigning commission for allocation of telescope time . lcc orbital period @xmath19 ( Clarence Shepard Day Jr. ) & 60.85 & 0.15 + velocity trucking rig - bounty @xmath23 ( ms@xmath16 ) & 239 & 5 + eccentricity @xmath2 & 0.27 & 0.03 + longitude of periastron @xmath24 ( deg ) & 24 & sixer + periastron particular date @xmath25 ( Julian the Apostate particular date ) & 2450301.0 & 1.0 + @xmath26 ( m@xmath6 ) & 2.11 & 0.20 + semimajor axis of rotation a ( Au ) & 0.21 & 0.01 +
