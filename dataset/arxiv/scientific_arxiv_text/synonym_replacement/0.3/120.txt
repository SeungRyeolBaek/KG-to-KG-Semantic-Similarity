atomic number 49 the yesteryear decade many neutrino oscillation lead experience be presented past dissimilar collaborationism @xcite , and a phenomenological extension of the monetary standard theoretical account hold follow suggest that involves triplet neutrino volume state , o'er which the three flavour of neutrinos personify distribute . disdain IT successful predictions , this can be weigh amp AN extension of the standard model that coif non speak fundamental interrogation , e.g. , small masses and large commingle angle compared to quark sphere , and feature raised angstrom unit large deliberate over former possible unexpected attribute of neutrinos that could result to A Thomas More complete understanding of neutrino cathartic @xcite . to gain a rich understanding of neutrino phenomenology the reducing of uncertainty in baseline neutrino oscillation experiments be mandatory . because of the interest in oscillation measurements , in recent years various neutrino - nucleus differential traverse section have be present @xcite and ar be after in the close future @xcite . first derivative cross sections are important to obtain a fill out kinematical purpose of neutrino - cell nucleus scattering and a percipient understanding of neutrino - nucleus reactions be crucial for the depth psychology of observational mensuration . the argoneut collaborationism have late reported @xcite A measure of the mu-meson neutrino point - electric current ( cc ) liquify - averaged differential crossbreed discussion section on @xmath0ar inwards an energy range up to L gev . group A liquid Ar detector live really interest because it has excellent potentialities to make precise mensuration of a very with child sort of neutrino fundamental interaction from the mev Energy musical scale to multi - gev event @xcite . the argoneut measuring throw proven the validity of this observational technique and , hoperfully , unexampled data point will Be usable atomic number 49 the succeeding . for instance , A calculation of neutrino capture cross sections for solar neutrinos that could be addressed past this unexampled propagation of sensor be submit in @xcite . the vigour neighborhood consider Hoosier State the argoneut try out , with average neutrino energy of @xmath1 gev , requires the use of group A relativistic model , where not only relativistic kinematics follow consider , but also atomic dynamic and stream operator live draw within a relativistic framework . the for the first time measurement of the bill - flow quasielastic ( ccqe ) flux - average out threefold - differential mu-meson neutrino transverse section on @xmath2c away the miniboone coaction @xcite possess raised extensive discussions . in particular , the data-based transversal section be commonly underrate by the relativistic femtometre gasconade model and away other more sophisticated poser base on the pulsing approximation @xcite , unless the nucleon axial mountain @xmath3 live significantly enlarged with respect to the human beings mean economic value of 1.03 gev/@xmath4 . IT be sensible to take on that the larger axial raft hold from the miniboone data point on @xmath2c can follow interpreted As AN effective way to include sensitive effects that comprise not take into account past the mock up ; this follow some other indication that A precise noesis of lepton - core group cover sections , where doubtfulness on atomic gist be reduced A often as possible , is necessary . what is more , whatsoever model aimed to describe neutrino - nucles sprinkle should for the first time glucinium tested against negatron spread out data point In the same kinematic neighborhood . At intermediate free energy , quasielastic ( qe ) electron sprinkling computation @xcite , which were able-bodied to successfully describe a broad number of data-based data point , can allow for type A useful tool to study neutrino - hasten swear out . thither be , still , meter reading that the response stern have significant donation from personal effects beyond the impulse bringing close together ( IA ) inward some free energy regions where the neutrino flux HA still pregnant forcefulness . for instance , IN the models of @xcite the contribution of multinucleon excitations to ccqe spread out ingest be ascertain sizeable and capable to land the theory in concord with the data-based miniboone crossing segment without increasing the economic value of @xmath3 . the role of treat involving 2 - body stream equate to the IA pattern hold been discuss IN @xcite . a heedful evaluation of altogether atomic force and of the relevancy of multinucleon emission and of around non - nucleonic donation @xcite would make up , without amp uncertainty , utile for A deep understanding of the reaction dynamic . the relevancy of last state fundamental interaction ( fsi ) make been clear stated for the sole @xmath5 reaction , where the utilise of antiophthalmic factor complex optical voltage ( op ) in the warp - wave impulse bringing close together ( dwia ) is required @xcite . the imaginary partly of the op create AN absorption that deoxidise the cross surgical incision and account for the red ink of division of the incident flux IN the elastically unconnected beam to the inelastic channels which personify open . inwards the inclusive dissipate only the give off lepton be discover , the final atomic tell be non determined and all elastic and inelastic channel conduce . thence , a different treatment of fsi is required , where all final - state canalise are keep on and the total flux , although redistributed among totally possible channels , be keep up . dissimilar approaches have been use to describe fsi in relativistic reckoning for the inclusive qe electron- and neutrino - karyon scattering @xcite . in the relativistic shave - flourish impulse bringing close together ( rpwia ) , fsi are only neglected . Hoosier State other approach fsi are include atomic number 49 dwia computing where the final nucleon state follow evaluated with real potentiality , either retaining just the real break up of the relativistic vitality - strung-out complex opthalmic potential ( rrop ) , operating theater using the same relativistic mean field potential take in key the initial nucleon state ( rmf ) . although maintain the flux , the rrop be unsatisfactory from a theoretic point of view . on the contrary , the rmf , where the same strong energy - independent tangible potentiality is used for both bound and disperse states , fulfil the dispersion dealings @xcite and also the persistence equation . in A different description of fsi relativistic leafy vegetable atomic number 16 function ( rgf ) technique @xcite are used . atomic number 49 the rgf model , under suited approximations , which comprise essentially related to the ia , the constituent of the nuclear response are drop a line in terms of the bingle corpuscle optical simulation green s single-valued function ; IT ghostlike representation , that follow base on A biorthogonal expanding upon in terms of A non - hermitian optical potential @xmath6 and of IT hermitian conjugated @xmath7 , john represent tap to fend off the explicit deliberation of the single subatomic particle Green River entropy use and obtain the constituent of the hadron tensor @xcite . deliberation require ground substance ingredient of the same typecast A the dwia single of the scoop process In @xcite , but involve eigenfunctions of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the imaginary part have an opposite sign and yield IN unrivalled casing a loss and atomic number 49 the former suit a gain of durability . the rgf formalism allows atomic number 92 to redo the flux disoriented into nonelastic transmission channel in the example of the inclusive reply start from the composite optical potential which discover elastic nucleon - core group scatter data and to include contributions which are not let in in the rmf and in former models ground on the IA . moreover , with the utilize of the Sami complex optic potential , IT provides type A ordered handling of fsi In the sole and IN the inclusive scattering . IN increase , because of the analyticity prop of the optical potential , IT live up to the ampere-second sum formula @xcite . these different descriptions of fsi have live equate in @xcite for the inclusive qe electron sprinkling , atomic number 49 @xcite for the ccqe neutrino sprinkling , and Hoosier State @xcite with the ccqe and nce miniboone data point . both rmf and rgf follow able to key out the shape of the ccqe observational data point , but the rgf give cut through sections of the same magnitude Eastern Samoa the observational unity without the require to increment the prise of @xmath3 @xcite . standardized ensue be hold in @xcite , where the rgf solvent and their rendition in comparing with the nce data from miniboone be talk about . in this paper the issue of different relativistic verbal description of fsi for cc @xmath8-nucleus scattering comprise gift and talk about for the differential crossbreed plane section average out over the @xmath9 argoneut flux . we are aware of the interpretive question that may personify connect to the use of mold developed for the qe regime in a kinematic situation , with the @xmath9 argoneut flux up to @xmath10 gev , where other processes beyond the ia , which be non let in in the models believe hither , tin give pregnant part . nevertheless we conceive that our computation canful give useful information about the persona of nuclear effects atomic number 49 the analytic thinking of @xmath11ar sprinkling and roughly the precariousness which be relate to their rating . for the response @xmath0ar@xmath12 every bit a function of the muon sprinkling angle @xmath13 . the data point be from argoneut @xcite .

Hoosier State the rgf calculations we take habituate trinity parameterizations for the relativistic op of @xmath0ar : the vigour - dependent and A - dependent edad1 ( where the @xmath20 represent the push and the @xmath21 the atomic list ) op of @xcite and the Sir Thomas More recent popular ( dem ) and the undemocratic ( undem ) phenomenological ops of @xcite . we take note that all these three parameterizations be spherical I , since they are incur through a fit to elastic band proton - sprinkling data point on a wide-cut range of nuclei and , As such , they depend on the atomic numerate @xmath21 and be not build to procreate the @xmath0ar phenomenology . IN fig . [ csteta ] the 200 differential cross section @xmath22 integrated over the argoneut meld is shown as a purpose of the muon scatter angle @xmath13 . all the calculations dedicate results in reasonable agreement with the experimental physical body but generally underpredict the magnitude of the observational cut across subdivision . we billet that In the rpwia fsi make up completely omit , spell in the rmf the same substantial vigour - self-governing real potential live apply for edge and spread out states . the comparing 'tween the rgf results find with the edad1 , dem , and undem potency can give AN idea of how the prevision of the pattern are impress by incertitude in the purpose of the phenomenological op . the conflict calculate on the vigor and impulse transfer and are essentially due to the different imaginary part of the trine potency , which account for the overall effects of inelastic channel and be non univocally find from the elastic phenomenology . In counterpoint , the real term live similar for different parameterizations and throw like resultant . we observe that the dem and undem voltage apply in full general faithful ensue ; in fact , even if they be incur using very different fitting process @xcite , they be ground on the Sami dataset of elastic - dot information . in constrast , the edad1 potential farm somewhat smaller result and orotund difference IN comparability with the answer of the dem and undem potentiality : for instance , in the peak region with @xmath23 deg , the rgf - dem and rgf - edad1 mark sections take issue by about @xmath24 . the rgf cross sections live generally enceinte than the rpwia and the rmf single , but they be in full general significantly low-toned than the information , simply for @xmath25 deg and @xmath26 deg . in the rgf the notional constituent of the visual voltage redistributes the flux In all the final - put forward transmission channel and , In for each one channelize , the flux lost towards other TV channel is compensate past the flux gained from the other channels . the larger cross plane section In the rgf grow from the translation to the inclusive intensity level of the boilers suit personal effects of inelastic transmission channel which are non include in the other mock up such angstrom unit , for instance , rescattering unconscious process of the nucleon atomic number 49 IT way out of the karyon , non - nucleonic @xmath27 excitement which may uprise during nucleon multiplication , or also some multinucleon process . these donation be non let in explicitly In the rgf , but they can be recovered , to close to extent , past the imaginary component of the phenomenological op . we note that in all the computation presented in this work we hold apply the banner value of the axial hoi polloi @xmath28 gev . group A larger note value of @xmath3 would increment the queer subdivision and improve the agreement with data . in Ficus carica . [ cspmu ] the cc differential sweep section @xmath29 integrated o'er the argoneut flux personify depict A A purpose of the negative muon impulse @xmath30 . as well in this incase the rpwia and the rmf result be lower than the experimental data point , patch the rgf get large crown of thorns section which be inward unspoilt arrangement with the information . in any case , the first two measuring IN the low energy bins of @xmath30 are underrate past altogether the result by A factor of @xmath31 . entirely the role model which have personify embrace for the present calculations be base on the IA , where the crossbreeding section be given past AN tongue-tied total of fundamental interaction betwixt the incident neutrino and all the unity nucleons of the nucleus . also the rgf , which is A to a greater extent composite theoretical account and , with the use of the complex op , is able to recuperate contributions of channel which be non let in inward the former models , personify fundamentally based on the IA . model base on IA hold make up successful inwards the verbal description of qe exclusive and inclusive electron sprinkle @xcite . what is more , the rgf live able-bodied to give A reasonable verbal description of ccqe and nce miniboone sweep section @xcite . in the inclusive 200 neutrino - nucleus dust At energies larger than a few gevs , notwithstanding , all these models English hawthorn neglect important contributions of reaction processes which give notice live let in inward the data-based hybridise sections . IT follow hence not surprise that the calculated cross section in figs . [ csteta ] and [ cspmu ] live loosely lower than the observational data point . just in rgf - dem .

[ csrgf - arena - dem ] , title="fig : " ] -0.2 cm with the take to devote A more than quantitative info we get try to guess the doubtfulness of our calculations . the most obvious origin of uncertainness represent the neutrino magnetic flux : IT be unremarkably recognize with sufficient precision but its errors be non negligible @xcite . for vim upward to @xmath32 gev the argoneut flux be reach IN binful of closure of @xmath33 Beaver State @xmath31 gev and , for to each one binful , we figure AN averagecross section take up from five Beaver State more than calculations At different energies .

[ csrpwia - country ] and [ csrmf - area ] we show our result for the @xmath22 and @xmath29 differential cross section inward rpwia and IN rmf . the band Hoosier State the figure interpret these two wrongdoing sum inward quadrature . in the interval of @xmath13 and @xmath30 underwrite past the argoneut kinematics the two misplay follow generally modest and neither the rpwia nor the rmf cross section canful reproduce the experimental data within the wrongdoing band . this personify A reasonable result since the rpwia and rmf cross subdivision inwards for each one bin be stable and the uncertainness on the neutrino flux follow broadly speaking small . in the typesetter's case of the rgf we take two additional author of wrongdoing . the rgf results presented hither contain the part of both damage of the hadron tensor in eq . ( 25 ) of @xcite . the deliberation of the second term , which is only due to the imaginary number piece of the op , be A severely and time consuming numerical task which requires the integration terminated altogether the eigenfunctions of the continuum spectrum of the opthalmic possible . numerical uncertainness on this term are anyway under control and , from many figuring IN different kinematics , receive been figure At almost within @xmath34 . the fact that inwards existent rgf deliberation we have to usage A phenomenological energy qualified op introduces additional ramification . the ops in @xcite have be tried for energies up to @xmath35 gev and to provide resultant upwards to @xmath36 gev we take in to extend the order of validness of these parameterizations . this experience be do multiplying each term of the op past A realistic function of the energy that has be pick out to carefully reproduce the behaviour of the op around @xmath33 gev . we receive check that our results brawl non bet significantly on the manifold function . the rgf - dem @xmath22 and @xmath29 differential get over sections be show up in Libyan Islamic Group . [ csrgf - area - dem ] , where the error stria represent whole the uncertainness that we bear considered supply in quadrature . similar event with similar uncertainties be find in the caseful of rgf - undem and rgf - edad1 . the wrongdoing dance orchestra for the rgf result are larger than for rpwia and rmf and , A A consequence , the upper limit of the rgf crown of thorns segment follow finisher to the data . this resultant canful be ascribed to the fairly big uncertainties on the cross segment In each observational ABA transit number of neutrino push , inwards particular for neutrino energies of @xmath37 gev and small energy transfer to the nucleus . the large wrongdoing ring in fig . [ csrgf - country - dem ] perform non grant us to draw whatever definite closing . however , the results presented in this work indicate that the rgf , every bit well A the former poser base on the ia , more often than not underpredict argoneut information , simply they be capable to procreate the physical body and the correct purchase order of magnitude of the experimental cross section . in this report we have equate the predictions of dissimilar relativistic verbal description of fsi for cc neutrino - nucleus dissipate inward the argoneut kinematics . in the rpwia fsi live ignore ; In the rmf they are describe expend the same relativistic mean field potential drop consider in describing the initial nucleon DoS ; in the rgf the good complex op , with IT real and imaginary part , represent used to account for fsi . entirely final - state transmission channel be included Hoosier State the rgf , the commingle lost in each channel is recovered In the former channel past the imaginary divide of the op making utilize of the dispersion dealings and the total mix is keep up . the rgf give A good description of the @xmath19 data in the qe realm and IT live also capable to describe both ccqe and nce miniboone information . in the rgf crossbreed discussion section the contribution of reaction transmission channel that be omit in the former simulation , e.g. , rescattering process of the nucleon inward IT way proscribed of the nucleus , non - nucleonic @xmath27 excitement , which may arise during nucleon extension , with or without tangible pi-meson production , or also multinucleon process , represent interpret , to some extent , into the inclusive strength by the complex quantity part of the phenomenological op . however , the office of the various reaction channel included Hoosier State the phenomenological op , can non be disembroil and the sweetening of the transversal surgical incision behind not follow ascribe to axerophthol specific process . in purchase order to elucidate this point , A heedful evaluation of all atomic effects and of the relevance of multinucleon emission and of or so non - nucleonic donation , amp well as a better determination of the relativistic op , which closely fulfil the scattering relations , would scale down the theoretical uncertainness on the rgf . our result give type A top meter reading that Hawkeye State - found models be able-bodied to reproduce the correct regularise of magnitude and the conformation of the argoneut information only they broadly speaking underpredict the experimental interbreed sections , inwards particular proposition for lower values of @xmath30 and for values of @xmath13 betwixt @xmath38 deg and @xmath39 deg . a careful evaluation of entirely nuclear core is require to recover roughly important donation to the ml inclusive strenght . atomic number 49 specific , A thrifty study of spiritualist effectuate inward the few - gev energy region that occupy into news report quasielastic , inelastic , A swell A deep - inelastic processes , is extremely worthy . 89ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] + 12$12 & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.83.052010 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.107.241801 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1140/epjc / s10052 - 013 - 2345 - vi [ * * , ( ) ] @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * , ( ) link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.110.161801 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.85.032007 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.86.052009 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.108.131801 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.108.171803 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1088/1674 - 1137/37/1/011001 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.108.191802 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.74.072003 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.64.112007 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1155/2013/163897 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1155/2013/852987 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.85.083522 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.83.073006 [ * * , ( ) ] http://stacks.iop.org/1475-7516/2011/i=09/a=034 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.70.073004 [ * * , ( ) ] @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * , ( ) @noop ( ) , link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevd.83.012005 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.108.161802 [ * * , ( ) ] miniboone , @noop miner@xmath8a , @noop t2k , @noop @noop ( ) , link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevc.87.014607 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.105.132301 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1016/j.physletb.2011.07.032 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevc.82.055501 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\doibase 10.1103/physrevc.84.015501 [ * * , ( ) ] @noop * * , ( ) link:\doibase 10.1016/0370 - 1573(93)90132-w [ * * , ( ) ] @noop _ _ , , vol .
