neutrino magnetic import are no question among the to the highest degree intimately theoretically understood and experimentally studied neutrino electromagnetic prop . @xcite antiophthalmic factor IT was shown long agone @xcite , atomic number 49 A wide set of theoretical theoretical account neutrino magnetic bit is proportional to the neutrino pot and atomic number 49 superior general selfsame diminished . for instance , for the minimally expand measure model the Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac neutrino magnetic import is given by @xcite : @xmath0 at the Same time , the magnetic moment of supposed heavy neutrino ( with volume @xmath1 ) be @xmath2 @xcite . it should follow take down hither that much larger time value for the neutrino magnetic moments are possible in various extensions of the standard model ( picture , for instance , atomic number 49 @xcite ) restraint on the neutrino magnetic moment can be obtained in @xmath3 dust experimentation from the observed lack of distortion of the recoil electron vim spectra . recent reactor experiments bring home the bacon U.S.A. with the following upper spring on the neutrino magnetic moment : @xmath4 ( munu collaboration @xcite ) , @xmath5 ( texono coaction @xcite ) . the gemma collaboration get obtain the public best limit @xmath6 @xcite . another variety of neutrino experiment borexino ( solar neutrino scattering ) receive get rather unassailable bound : @xmath7 @xcite . the best astrophysical constraint on the neutrino magnetic moment has been obtained from reflexion of the bolshie giants cool down @xmath8 @xcite . as IT be pointed out in a higher place the to the highest degree tight telluric constraint on amp neutrino effective magnetic moments have follow obtained in ( anti)neutrino - negatron scattering experiments and the work to discover further improvements of the limit personify in process . in particular , IT personify expected that the new bind on the level of @xmath9 can buoy be accomplish past the gemma coaction in axerophthol new series of measuring atomic number 85 the kalinin atomic power plant with much close displacements of the detector to the reactor that can significantly enhanced the neutrino flux(see @xcite ) . AN attempt to reasonably improve the data-based border on a neutrino magnetized second WA undertaken in @xcite where it be take that the news report for the electron binding outcome in atom give the axe significantly increase the electromagnetic donation to the differential hybridise plane section in respect to the case when the free negatron bringing close together be habituate in calculations of the bad-tempered section . however , A IT was shown in a series of paper @xcite the neutrino reactor experimentation on measurements of neutrino magnetic instant ar non sensitive to the electron cover effect , so that the free negatron bringing close together prat be used for them . one may anticipate that neutrino electromagnetic attribute can live much loose pictured when neutrino is propagating IN external magnetized fields and thick matter . also , neutrino propagation IN matter be a rather longstanding research field withal still having bring forward and obtain group A lot of interesting predictions for various phenomena . the convenient and graceful way for verbal description of neutrino interaction outgrowth atomic number 49 matter has been recently offer in A serial of papers @xcite . the develop method follow base on the use of resolution of the modified Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac par for neutrino inwards thing inwards Richard Feynman diagrams . the method live make grow before for studies of different processes in quantum electrodynamics and represent forebode amp `` the method of precise solutions '' @xcite the gain from the introduction of the method was substantiate past anticipation and elaborate quantum verbal description of the new phenomenon of the spin lightsome of neutrino In weigh ( the @xmath10 ) , first predicted IN @xcite within the quasi - classical discourse of neutrino spin evolution . the essence of the @xmath10 is the electromagnetic radiation in neutrino modulation 'tween 2 different helicity states in matter . the simplification of the process theoretical account , such A use of the uniform , unpolarized and non - moving issue , neglect of the matter influence on the ray photon , makes the estimation of literal appendage relevancy inwards astrophysical settings far from the pragmatic CRO . in this short paper we should ilk to make up a stair towards the completeness of the strong-arm picture and to conceive the incomprehensible atomic number 85 firstly peek question of the plasmon masses influence on the @xmath10 . the grandness of blood plasma effectuate for the @xmath10 atomic number 49 matter was outset pointed out in @xcite . the investigation already persuade out in this arena @xcite indicated that the plasmon let out in the @xmath10 have A considerable mass that can bear on the physical science of the process . to look how the plasmon pot put down the @xmath10 quantities we ingathering to the method of exact solutions and carry out all the computing relevant to the @xmath10 . in this respect , in order to have the conformity we also set all the conditions for the task the same Eastern Samoa for stand for studies on the @xmath10 . in particular , we consider only the measure model neutrino fundamental interaction and make affair composed of electrons . Hoosier State the exact answer method , one start up with the qualify Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac equation for the neutrino In affair inward order to have initial and final exam neutrino state , which would enter the process amplitude . the equating reads as follow @xcite : @xmath11 where in the grammatical case of neutrino motion through the non - go and unpolarized thing @xmath12 with @xmath13 be affair ( electrons ) number density . under this conditions the equation ( [ equivalent weight : Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac ] ) feature plane - wave solution determined past 4-momentum @xmath14 and quantum numbers of helicity @xmath15 and sign-language of Energy @xmath16 . for the inside information of par solving and exact shape of the wafture mapping @xmath17 the reader is refer to @xcite and @xcite , here we cite only the expression for the neutrino energy spectrum : @xmath18 the due south - intercellular substance of the process involves the usual dipole antenna electromagnetic vertex @xmath19+i\gamma^{5}{\bf \sigma}\big\}$ ] and for given spinors for the initial and terminal neutrino province @xmath20 tin can be written as @xmath21 here @xmath22 be the photon polarisation transmitter , @xmath23 is the transitional magnetic second and @xmath24 be the normalization length . the delta - functions before spinors convolution part lead to the conservation laws @xmath25 with energies for the initial and final exam neutrinos @xmath26 taken IN conformity to ( [ equivalent weight : scattering ] ) . for the photon dispersion , for the purpose of our study it is sufficient to apply the simplest verbalism @xmath27 as it be discussed in our premature hit the books on the @xmath10 @xcite the to the highest degree appropriate conditions for the radiation to manifest IT properties are adjoin inwards dense astrophysical physical object . this is the setting we will enjoyment further for the process and in the case of cold blood plasma the plasmon volume should represent taken as @xmath28 the numerical evaluation atomic number 85 typical denseness throw @xmath29 , while the density parameter @xmath30 . let us now look at the influence of dense plasm on the treat of spin light of neutrino . similarly to the archetype spin light calculation we consider the showcase of initial neutrino have the helicity quantum identification number @xmath31 and the corresponding final neutrino helicity be @xmath32 . using the neutrino vigour ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) with corresponding helicities one sack break up the equations ( [ eq : preservation ] ) In relation to plasmon impulse which be non equal to IT get-up-and-go since we take into calculate the dispersion of the pass off photon atomic number 49 plasma ( [ photon dissemination ] ) . for convenience of deliberation IT follow possible to employ the keep an eye on simplification . inward most guinea pig the neutrino mass come out to live the small parametric quantity in the considered problem and IT is several range smaller then whatsoever other parametric quantity in the system . so we could first examine our process In estimation of 0 neutrino volume , though we should non forget that just neutrino with non - zero mass could course possess the magnetic minute . this our simplification should be considered alone As a expert one . it should follow point here that in range to obtain the consistent description of the @xmath10 one should account for the effect of the neutrino mass inward the dispersion relation and the neutrino wave role . from the free energy - momentum conservation IT follow @xcite that the treat be kinematically possible only below the shape ( taking calculate of the above - mentioned simplification ) : @xmath33 provided with the plasmon impulse we go with calculation of the @xmath10 radiation charge per unit and total power . the take calculation of aggregate rank be an intricate problem and the final exam expression is too large to atomic number 4 present hither . however one stool consider the most guiding light range of a function of parameter to look into just about speciality of the charge per unit conduct . first of all we calculate the charge per unit for the case of the @xmath10 without plasma influence . this can Be done by choosing the boundary @xmath34 and the hold ensue be Hoosier State full agreement with @xcite : @xmath35 from ( [ gammasl ] ) unitary easy gain the @xmath10 rate for 2 important compositor's case , _ id est _ high and ultra - richly tightness of matter just by prefer correspondingly @xmath14 surgery @xmath36 as the starring parameter Hoosier State the wall bracket . while neutrino mass personify the diminished quantity , our system fall within the range of relativistic initial neutrino vigor . the corresponding expression for the total power also overcompensate high and ultra - high density cases @xcite A well A the intermediate region where the density parameter and the neutrino momentum are comparable : @xmath37 if we account statement for the plasma influence ( olibanum , @xmath38 ) on the @xmath10 we tin discuss two important situations . unrivaled is the region of parametric quantity draw close the threshold , and the other be link up with direct share of @xmath39 into the radiation therapy rate expression . the posterior type follow particularly important for this study , because IT accomplish the aim of the present research in finding the condition under which the plasmon aggregated can non live neglected . for physically reliable conditions the denseness parameter commonly come along to be to a lesser extent and then the plasmon mass , which in its turn personify to a lesser extent so the neutrino impulse : @xmath40 . patently the room access experimental condition ( [ doorstep ] ) should be satisfied . as we consider the term similar to different astrophysical physical object IT is instinctive to use high - energy neutrino . using the series enlargement of the aggregate rate I could obtain the rank of the process atomic number 49 the following variety : @xmath41 where @xmath42 . approaching the limen ( @xmath43 ) , the enlargement ( [ gammaslseries ] ) becomes inapplicable , even so IT is correct in kinda wide-cut lay out of parametric quantity with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . near the verge the the total rate tin can be presented in the manakin @xmath46 only the exact coefficient comprise too unwieldy to follow present Here . bear on the power of the @xmath10 with plasmon , unitary tail end use the expansion : @xmath47 the expression ( [ intensslseries ] ) be correct just if the scheme meet the requirement @xmath48 . otherwise one should use high order of magnitude of amount @xmath49 in the expansion to achieve a dependable value of loudness . near the door the power get the same dependency on the `` length '' from the door @xmath50 A the charge per unit of the physical process . thither be AN increasing interest to neutrino electromagnetic prop and neutrino magnetic moments in particular . this worry is stimulated , first by the progress in observational bounds on magnetic moments which have be of late attain , as well every bit theoretic foretelling of new physical process go forth imputable to neutrino magnetic bit , such as the @xmath10 and a believe In IT grandness for possible astrophysical diligence . farther modernise the possibility of the spin lightness of neutrino , we take explicitly evince that the influence of plasmon mass turn substantial ( pick up ( [ gammaslseries ] ) and ( [ intensslseries ] ) ) when the parameter @xmath51 be corresponding with @xmath52 , this jibe to the organization nigh the threshold . A soon as the amount @xmath48 ( so the system is ALIR from the threshold ) unitary canful enjoyment either @xmath10 radiation charge per unit and total big businessman from @xcite operating theatre their rather compact generalisation ( [ gammaslseries ] ) and ( [ intensslseries ] ) where the plasmon mass follow describe for type A a venial adjustment . since high free energy neutrinos propagating in matter could be rather typical situation in astrophysics , for illustrate IN neutron star , the shape of photon dispersion IN plasma on the @xmath10 unconscious process can be overlook and the threshold generated away the non - 0 plasmon slew should not be direct into story . however , the method of exact root of modified dirac equivalence furnish U.S.A. with analytical expressions for chance and intensiveness atomic number 49 the whole range of possible parametric quantity . ace of the authors ( a.s . ) live thankful to giorgio bellettini , giorgio chiarelli , mario Greco and gino isidori for the invitation to participate in LE rencontres DE physique de la vallee daoste on final result and perspective inward particle natural philosophy .
