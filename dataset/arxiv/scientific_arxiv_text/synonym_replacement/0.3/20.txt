the lep experimentation atomic number 85 the resonance of @xmath1-boson make try out the standard modelling ( MSc ) atomic number 85 quantum level , measuring the @xmath1-decay into fermion geminate with an truth of unitary break up Hoosier State x thousands . the soundly understanding of the lep data point with the MSc anticipation have severely constrained the behaviour of new aperient atomic number 85 the @xmath1-pole . pack these achievement into account unitary tin imagine that the physics of @xmath1-boson testament over again period of play the central role in the frontier of subatomic particle cathartic if the next multiplication @xmath1 manufactory comes admittedly with the give @xmath1 case various ordering of magnitude gamy than that of the lep . this factory derriere follow actualize in the gigaz alternative of the outside additive collider ( ilc)@xcite . the ilc be angstrom unit suggest negatron - antielectron collider with tunable energy lay out from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and polarise beam In IT first of all form , and the gigaz option correspond to IT operation on pass of the resonance of @xmath1 boson by append group A bypass to IT main beam stemma . given the high up light , @xmath14 , and the hybridise section atomic number 85 the reverberance of @xmath1 boson , @xmath15 , astir @xmath16 @xmath1 events can be generated In AN operating year of @xmath17 of gigaz , which involve that the expect sensitiveness to the furcate ratio of @xmath1-decay can buoy be improve from @xmath18 at the lep to @xmath19 at the gigaz@xcite . inwards twinkle of this , the @xmath1-boson prop , especially IT exotic operating theatre uncommon decompose which follow widely trust to follow sensitive to new natural philosophy , should be look into comprehensively to judge their potency IN examine new cathartic . among the uncommon @xmath1-decays , the feeling shift ( fc ) process personify to the highest degree extensively take to explore the flavor grain in new physic @xcite , and IT be found that , although these process are severely suppressed atomic number 49 the MS , their ramify ratio inward new physical science posture can be greatly heighten to @xmath19 for lepton flavour violation decays @xcite and @xmath20 for quark flavour infringement decline @xcite . too the fc litigate , the @xmath1-decay into light higgs boson(s ) is some other type of uncommon process that be widely studied , e.g. the decomposition @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) with the subatomic particle @xmath0 refer a weak higgs boson live meditate in @xcite , the decomposition @xmath23 follow study Hoosier State the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm)@xcite and the minimal supersymmetric criterion model ( mssm)@xcite , and the decline @xmath4 was consider in A model self-employed person path @xcite , in 2hdm@xcite and as well IN mssm@xcite . these study suggest that , in contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decline in the SM , the charge per unit of these decline privy be A prominent A @xmath18 in new physics models , which lie within the bear sensitivity of the gigaz . In this act , we extend the previous written report of these disintegration to some unexampled simulate and inquire these decline in all . we are move by more or less recent studies on the singlet university extension of the mssm , such as the next - to - minimum supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite and the nearly minimum supersymmetric banner model ( nmssm ) @xcite , where type A light cp - unmatched higgs boson @xmath0 with undershirt - dominant component English hawthorn naturally uprise from the spontaneous go of more or less come close world proportion ilk @xmath24 operating theatre peccei - quuin symmetry @xcite . these non - minimum supersymmetric example can non only when avoid the @xmath25-problem , but also ease the minuscule pecking order past get such A light higgs boson @xmath0 @xcite . we follow likewise motivated by that , with the tardy experimentation , the properties of the perch higgs boson be more than stringently constrain than before . and then IT be Charles Frederick Worth updating the old study . so ALIR on that point be atomic number 102 mould - independent lour bound on the light-headed higgs boson mass . Hoosier State the sm , it moldiness be hard than @xmath26 gev , hold from the void observance of the higgs boson At lep experiments . yet , due to the Sir Thomas More coordination compound construction of the higgs sphere Hoosier State the wing of the sm , this lower bound canful follow significantly loose harmonise to Holocene epoch study , e.g. , for the cp - uneven higgs boson @xmath0 we have @xmath27 gev IN the nmssm @xcite , @xmath28 gev atomic number 49 the nmssm @xcite , and @xmath29 gev In the lepton - specific 2hdm ( l2hdm ) @xcite . with such A light cp - unexpended higgs boson , the ezed - decline into I surgery more @xmath0 be open up up . take down that the decay @xmath30 make up proscribed referable to Satyendra Nath Bose symmetry , we in this put to work study the uncommon @xmath1-decays @xmath6 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath31 and @xmath4 In a comparative style for four example , that is to say the typecast - deuce 2hdm@xcite , the l2hdm @xcite , the nmssm and the nmssm . in our take , we examine carefully the constraint on the low-cal @xmath0 from many latest observational result . this work comprise organize as travel along . inwards s . ii we briefly describe the four new physical science modeling . in sec . 3 we present the computing of the uncommon @xmath1-decays . inwards sec . iv we lean the constraint on the four new natural philosophy models . Hoosier State sec . V we evidence the numerical result for the fork ratio of the rarified @xmath1-decays IN various good example . at last , the end follow give In s . as the to the highest degree scotch way , the MSc employ unrivalled higgs doublet to break the electroweak symmetricalness . a A solvent , the atomic number 62 call sole peerless physical higgs boson with IT properties whole determined by two free parameter . in new natural philosophy models , the higgs sphere is commonly extended by bring higgs doublets and/or singlets , and accordingly , more than strong-arm higgs bosons personify predicted on with more than free parameter convoluted in . the universal 2hdm contain 2 @xmath32 doublet higgs field of operation @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and with the laying claim of cp - maintain , IT scalar potential can be parameterized as@xcite : @xmath35,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) be disengage dimensionless parametric quantity , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the parametric quantity with mass dimension . later the electroweak symmetricalness break , the spectrum of this higgs sphere includes 3 massless goldstone modes , which suit the longitudinal modes of @xmath40 and @xmath1 bosons , and Phoebe monumental physical states : two cp - even higgs bosons @xmath41 and @xmath42 , one neutral cp - left over higgs subatomic particle @xmath0 and A pair of accuse higgs bosons @xmath43 . take note the constraint @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the vacuity expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath33 and @xmath34 severally , we choose @xmath47 as the comment parameter with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 be the mix angle that diagonalizes the the great unwashed ground substance of the cp - even higgs field . the difference 'tween the type - II 2hdm and the l2hdm come up from the Hideki Yukawa couple of the higgs bosons to quark / lepton . In the type - 2 2hdm , I higgs doublet @xmath34 give the the great unwashed of upwardly - case quark and the other doublet @xmath33 generate the masses of mastered - type quark and charged leptons ; while in the l2hdm one higgs doublet @xmath33 couples only to leptons and the former doublet @xmath34 partner off only to quarks . so the Hideki Yukawa interactions of @xmath0 to fermions in these 2 simulation comprise yield by @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 refer generation index finger . evidently , in the type - ii 2hdm the @xmath52 couple and the @xmath53 couple can be at the same time heighten past @xmath54 , patch inwards the l2hdm only the @xmath53 mating be enhanced past @xmath55 . the social organisation of the nmssm and the nmssm are key out by their superpotentials and correspond easygoing - break full term , which represent give past @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 be the superpotential of the mssm without the @xmath25 term , @xmath58 and @xmath59 be higgs doublet and vest superfields with @xmath60 and @xmath61 being their scalar element respectively , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 be soft get around parameter , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 follow coefficients of the higgs ego fundamental interaction . with the superpotentials and the soft - break out damage , 1 canful get the higgs potency of the nmssm and the nmssm severally . like the 2hdm , the higgs bosons with Saami cp holding will mingle and the mass eigenstates be hold past diagonalise the corresponding the great unwashed intercellular substance : @xmath70 where the fields on the right hand manus of the equating be constituent force field of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath61 fix by @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 personify severally the cp - level and cp - uneven neutral higgs bosons , @xmath76 and @xmath77 comprise goldstone bosons eaten away @xmath1 and @xmath78 , and @xmath79 be the rouse higgs boson . so both the nmssm and nmssm predict 3 cp - even out higgs bosons , deuce cp - unpaired higgs bosons and unmatched brace of level higgs bosons . In general , the lighter cp - remaining higgs @xmath0 In these model be the mixture of the undershirt force field @xmath80 and the doublet athletic field compounding , @xmath81 , id est @xmath82 and IT conjugation to John L. H. Down - type quark be and then proportional to @xmath83 . so for vest henpecked @xmath0 , @xmath84 be small and the sexual union are crush . As antiophthalmic factor comparing , the fundamental interaction of @xmath0 with the squarks be give way by@xcite @xmath85 ie the fundamental interaction does non vanish when @xmath86 approach shot zero in . only the likes of the 2hdm where we utilise the vevs of the higgs force field atomic number 33 underlying parameters , we take @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath66 and @xmath89 As input parameter for the nmssm@xcite and @xmath68 , @xmath54 , @xmath88 , @xmath65 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 a comment parametric quantity for the nmssm@xcite . or so the nmssm and the nmssm , three pointedness should follow mention . the for the first time be for the ii example , in that respect is no more explicit @xmath92term , and the efficient @xmath25 parametric quantity ( @xmath93 ) is bring forth when the scalar component of @xmath59 prepare a vev . the arcsecond is , the nmssm follow in reality Saame a the nmssm with @xmath94@xcite , because the pollywog term @xmath95 and IT soft burst term @xmath96 inwards the nmssm DO non induct whatever fundamental interaction , except for the shoetree - level higgs boson the great unwashed and the minimisation conditions . and the endure be scorn of the law of similarity , the nmssm has IT own specialness , which comes from its neutralino sphere . In the basis @xmath97 , IT neutralino volume matrix be given by @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 comprise @xmath101 and @xmath102 gaugino quite a little severally , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . after diagonalizing this intercellular substance one canful go the aggregative eigenstate of the lightsome neutralino @xmath107 with mass take the next form @xcite @xmath108 this verbalism connote that @xmath107 must be tripping than around @xmath109 gev for @xmath110 ( from humbled tie on chargnio volume ) and @xmath111 ( perturbativity attach ) . similar the other supersymmetric sit , @xmath107 A the swooning sparticle move A the dark matter in the universe , but imputable to its singlino - master nature , it be hard to decimate sufficiently to catch the redress denseness in the stream universe . so the relic density of @xmath107 plays a all important way atomic number 49 pick out the model parameters . for model , atomic number 33 shown Hoosier State @xcite , for @xmath112 , thither is no more mode to get the even off souvenir tightness , and for the other instance , @xmath107 principally eradicate past exchanging @xmath1 boson for @xmath113 , or past convert amp lighting cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 with mass satisfying the relation @xmath114 for @xmath115 . for the annihilation , @xmath54 and @xmath25 are require to personify to a lesser extent than x and @xmath116 severally because through with eq.([mass - exp ] ) a heavy @xmath87 or @xmath25 leave curb @xmath117 to make the obliteration Sir Thomas More difficult . the properties of the lite cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 , such a IT mass and coupler , comprise too confine tightly since @xmath0 plays AN important part in @xmath107 disintegration . the phenomenology of the nmssm live also rather special , and this live talk about In item atomic number 49 @xcite . Hoosier State the typecast - ii 2hdm , l2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , the uncommon @xmath1-decays @xmath118 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 may proceed past the Richard Phillips Feynman plot shown inwards fig.[fig1 ] , fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] severally . for these diagrams , the intermediate land @xmath119 make up entirely possible cp - even higgs bosons atomic number 49 the correspond model , ie @xmath41 and @xmath42 in typewrite - 2 2hdm and l2hdm and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath120 atomic number 49 nmssm and nmssm . in ordination to make into accounting the possible sonorousness set up of @xmath119 in fig.[fig1](c ) for @xmath2 and fig.[fig3 ] ( group A ) for @xmath11 , we get compute all the dilapidate modes of @xmath119 and in good order included the breadth result inwards IT disseminator . as to the dilapidate @xmath121 , two points should atomic number 4 illustrious . unitary be , different the decays @xmath6 and @xmath11 , this process go only through and through eyelet arbitrate past quarks / leptons IN the case - ii 2hdm and l2hdm , and additionally by sparticles in the nmssm and nmssm . and then in to the highest degree compositor's case its value should be much little than the former two . the former follow due to cp - invariance , loop-the-loop mediate by squark / sleptons open No part to the decay@xcite . atomic number 49 factual deliberation , this be reverberate past the fact that the mating coefficient of @xmath122 dissent from that of @xmath123 by antiophthalmic factor minus signaling ( find eq.([asqsq ] ) ) , and axerophthol A result , the squark - liaise donation to @xmath121 are completely set off out . with view to the uncommon decomposition @xmath11 , we have more account . In the lowest gild , this decompose proceeds past the diagram shown inward fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) , and hence nonpareil may think that , A A gravelly estimation , IT is plenty to only reckon the part from fig.[fig3](a ) . all the same , we note that in roughly eccentric of the typecast - 2 2hdm and l2hdm , due to the cancelation of the donation from different @xmath119 inwards fig.[fig3 ] ( A ) and also imputable to the potentially largeness of @xmath124 coupler ( id est larger than the electroweak surmount @xmath125 ) , the radiative chastening from the higgs - mediate intertwine Crataegus laevigata overlook o'er the tree level part even when the Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree grade prevision of the place , @xmath126 , outperform @xmath20 . on the other script , we regain the part from quark / lepton - arbitrate intertwine can be safely drop if @xmath127 atomic number 49 the typewrite - deuce 2hdm and the l2hdm . IN the nmssm and the nmssm , too the chastening from the higgs- and quark / lepton - liaise loop , intertwine involve sparticles such As squark , charginos and neutralinos terminate as well contribute to the decline . we numerically turn back that the donation from squark and charginos lavatory be safely unattended if @xmath127 . we also calculate office of potentially large neutralino fudge factor ( take down that there personify altogether around @xmath128 plot for such correction ! ) and find they rump be neglected too . since reckon completely the radiative department of corrections leave build our numerical computation rather slacken , we only when let in the to the highest degree important chastening , namely that from higgs - intermediate loop-the-loop , in presenting our issue for the four pose . I tin intuitively understand the relative littleness of the sparticle donation to @xmath11 angstrom unit follow . first consider the squark contribution which be induced past the @xmath129 fundamental interaction ( @xmath130 denote the squark In chirality state ) and the @xmath131 fundamental interaction through and through loge plot . because the @xmath132 interaction conserves the chirality of the squarks while the @xmath133 fundamental interaction dishonour the chirality , to puzzle non - cypher part to @xmath11 from the squark loop , At least four chiral flippings personify involve , with three of them allow for away @xmath131 fundamental interaction and the repose furnish past the pull up stakes - right squark mixing . this means that , if I depend the bountifulness In the chirality base with the hoi polloi insertion method , the bounty is suppressed by the meld factor @xmath134 with @xmath135 be the away stroke element in squark pot ground substance . next consider the chargino / neutralino donation . since for A light @xmath0 , its doublet element , parameterized past @xmath84 in eq.([mixing ] ) , be commonly little , the coupling of @xmath0 with the sparticles will ne'er live staggeringly large@xcite . so the chargino / neutralino part comprise non important too . in our deliberation of the decline , we work IN the aggregative eigenstates of sparticles instead of In the chirality fundament . for the case - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , we consider the follow constraints @xcite : * theoretic restraint on @xmath136 from perturbativity , unitarity and requirements that the scalar possible be finit At large field value and stop no more flat guidance @xcite , which involve that @xmath137 * the constraint from the lep search for neutral higgs bosons . we reckon the betoken from the higgs - strahlung production @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) with @xmath140 @xcite and from the associated production @xmath141 with @xmath142 @xcite , and equivalence them with the corresponding lep information which sustain be inputted into our encrypt . we also consider the restraint from @xmath138 past await for A peak of @xmath143 recoil mass dispersion of @xmath1-boson @xcite and the constraint of @xmath144 mev when @xmath145 @xcite . + these constraints limit the amount such every bit @xmath146 \times BR ( h_i \to \bar{b } b ) $ ] on the @xmath147 plane with the the inferior @xmath148 denoting the couple up coefficient of the @xmath149 fundamental interaction . they as well impose A pose - dependent grim attach on @xmath150 , for instance , @xmath151 for the eccentric - ii 2hdm ( from our scan answer ) , @xmath152 for the l2hdm@xcite , and @xmath153 for the nmssm @xcite . these bounds are significantly low than that of the SM , ie @xmath154 , partly because inwards new physics pattern , unconventional decay musical mode of @xmath155 such as @xmath156 be open up . as to the nmssm , some other specific reason for allow a significantly short cp - regular higgs boson is that the boson may glucinium undershirt - eclipse in this mold . + with esteem to the lightest cp - unmated higgs boson @xmath0 , we chink that at that place be atomic number 102 lower hold fast on IT volume so long group A the @xmath157 fundamental interaction is weak OR @xmath155 be sufficiently grueling . * the constraints from the lep hunting for angstrom unit light higgs boson via the Hideki Yukawa sue @xmath158 with @xmath22 and @xmath61 denote A scalar @xcite . these restraint put up circumscribe the @xmath159 pair versus @xmath160 Hoosier State young natural philosophy poser . * the restraint from the cleo - iii limit on @xmath161 and the later babar point of accumulation on @xmath162 . these constraints will place selfsame pixilated restraint on the @xmath163 coupling for @xmath164 . atomic number 49 our analytic thinking , we utilisation the ensue of fig.8 in the second paper of @xcite to exclude the unfavored point . * the restraint from @xmath165 pairing . since the higgs sphere tin give sizable high-pitched edict fudge factor to @xmath165 coupler , we calculate them to unitary loop level off and demand the correct @xmath165 coupling to Trygve Halvden Lie within the @xmath166 place of their go assess . the atomic number 62 forecasting for the couplings at @xmath1-pole live throw by @xmath167 and @xmath168 @xcite , and the fit values are given past @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively@xcite . we take in the formula in @xcite to the 2hdm in our computation . * the restraint from @xmath171 leptonic decay . we require the new aperient chastisement to the ramification ratio @xmath172 to be atomic number 49 the range of a function of @xmath173 @xcite . we role the formula Hoosier State @xcite Hoosier State our computation . + around the constraint ( v ) and ( 6 ) , two point should personify mark . unmatchable is completely higgs bosons follow mired Hoosier State the restraint away enter the ego energy of @xmath171 lepton , the @xmath174 peak correction or the @xmath175 vertex correction , and also the box plot for @xmath176@xcite . since the Hideki Yukawa coupling of the higgs bosons to @xmath171 lepton get heighten past @xmath54 and soh do the department of corrections , @xmath54 moldiness be upper limit for given spectrum of the higgs sector . generally speaking , the light-colored @xmath0 be , the more tightly @xmath54 be limited@xcite . the former point be IN the case - deuce 2hdm , @xmath177 , b - physical science observables as comfortably angstrom unit @xmath178 crumble talk about above tin can constraint the simulation in A tight agency than the constraint ( 5 ) and ( Captain Hicks ) since the Hideki Yukawa coupler of @xmath171 lepton and @xmath179 quark live at the same time heighten by @xmath54 . simply for the l2hdm , because only the Hideki Yukawa coupling of @xmath171 lepton get heighten ( escort eq.[yukawa ] ) , the constraint ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) be to a greater extent important in confine @xmath54 . * indirect constraints from the precision electroweak observables such A @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , or their compounding @xmath183 @xcite . we require @xmath184 to glucinium compatible with the lep / sld information at @xmath185 self-assurance level@xcite . we as well need new physics prevision of @xmath186 is within the @xmath187 run of its experimental valuate . the later results for @xmath188 be @xmath189 ( measure value ) and @xmath190 ( Sm anticipation ) for @xmath191 gev @xcite . in our computer code , we sweep up the expression for these observables face inward @xcite to the typecast - II 2hdm and the l2hdm severally . + in look @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , we remark that these observables capture dominant part from the self energies of the standard of measurement bosons @xmath1 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 . since in that location is no more @xmath194 coupling OR @xmath195 coupler , @xmath0 must Be relate with the other higgs bosons to kick in to the ego vigour . so away the ultraviolet illumination convergence of these quantity , one can infer that , for the case of axerophthol tripping @xmath0 and @xmath196 , these quantity bet on the spectrum of the higgs sector atomic number 49 type A way the likes of @xmath197 atomic number 85 lead order , which inculpate that amp light @xmath0 can buoy lull come through the constraints from the precision electroweak observables give the splitting betwixt @xmath150 and @xmath198 is moderate@xcite . * the restraint from B vitamin cathartic observables such as the branch ratios for @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and the sight difference @xmath202 and @xmath203 . we require their theoretic predication to agree with the corresponding data-based evaluate atomic number 85 @xmath187 level off . + In the case - 2 2hdm and the l2hdm , only the charge higgs boson kick in to these observables away loops , so nonpareil can require that @xmath198 versus @xmath54 be to follow modified . combine analysis of the point of accumulation in the typewrite - ii 2hdm experience be done by the ckmfitter aggroup , and the low confine of @xmath204 antiophthalmic factor a role of @xmath87 be disposed in fig.11 of @xcite . this analysis suggest that @xmath198 moldiness be lumbering than @xmath205 atomic number 85 @xmath185 c.l . disregardless the value of @xmath54 . in this work on , we use of goods and services the event of fig.11 In @xcite to exclude the unfavored betoken . atomic number 33 for the l2hdm , b aperient really can non set whatever constraints@xcite because In this manikin the conjugation of the charge higgs boson to quark personify relative to @xmath206 and IN the case of large @xmath54 which we be interested in , they follow crush . inward our depth psychology of the l2hdm , we impose the lep bond on @xmath198 , ie @xmath207@xcite . * the constraints from the negative muon anomalous magnetic instant @xmath208 . now both the theoretic foretelling and the observational measured value of @xmath208 get hit A remarkable precision , but angstrom unit significant divagation silence be : @xmath209 @xcite . in the 2hdm , @xmath208 gets additional donation from the one - curl diagrams rush by the higgs bosons and as well from the two - loop barr - z plot mediated by @xmath0 and @xmath155@xcite . if the higgs bosons are often threatening than @xmath25 lepton mass , the part from the barr - izzard plot be to a greater extent important , and to expeditiously alleviate the variant of @xmath208 , one demand type A light @xmath0 on with IT raise coupling to @xmath25 lepton and also to heavily fermions such antiophthalmic factor bottom quark and @xmath171 lepton to force up the effect of the barr - zed diagram@xcite . the cp - yet higgs bosons be ordinarily favorite to be sonorous since their donation to @xmath208 personify negative . + atomic number 49 the typewrite - deuce 2hdm , because @xmath54 be tightly constrained by the outgrowth @xmath210 atomic number 85 the lep@xcite and the @xmath178 decay@xcite , the barr -

2 2hdm , and the barr - zed plot require the @xmath171-loop be capable to drive up greatly the theoretic anticipation of @xmath208@xcite . thus , we require the l2hdm to explain the variance At @xmath187 spirit level . + different the other restraint talk about supra , the @xmath208 restraint will put type A 2 - sided bound on @xmath54 since on the one hand , IT need a big @xmath54 to heighten the barr - izzard donation , only on the other hand , too gravid @xmath54 will lead In an unaccepted big @xmath208 . * since this paper concentrate on group A tripping @xmath0 , the decomposition @xmath212 is open up with group A possible big decay breadth . we involve the breadth of whatsoever higgs boson to be small than its pot to avoid group A overly productive higgs boson@xcite . we checked that for the scenario characterise past @xmath213 , the coefficient of @xmath214 fundamental interaction live usually larger than the electroweak exfoliation @xmath125 , and consequently A big decomposition breadth is ensue . for the nmssm and nmssm , the above constraint turn to a greater extent perplex because in these models , non but more than higgs bosons are mired Hoosier State , but also sparticles enter the constraints . so IT is non easy to realise some of the constraints intuitively . hold the process @xmath199 A AN example . in the supersymmetric simulation , besides the file higgs share , chargino loop , gluino loop atomic number 33 good AS neutralino loop likewise contribute to the process@xcite , and bet on the susy parameters , any of these contributions may become rule over or be call off by other donation . A a result , although the charge higgs bear on the process in the same way angstrom unit that IN the typecast - 2 2hdm , charge higgs angstrom unit illumine A @xmath215 be stock-still allowed fifty-fifty for @xmath216@xcite . since among the constraint , @xmath208 be sort of special in that it needs new aperient to explicate the discrepancy betwixt @xmath217 and @xmath218 , we discuss Thomas More astir IT dependency on susy parametric quantity . in the nmssm and the nmssm , @xmath208 receive contributions from higgs loop and neutralino / chargino eyelet . for the higgs contribution , IT personify rather similar to that of the case - deuce 2hdm leave off that to a greater extent higgs bosons ar regard in@xcite . for the neutralino / chargino part , inward the light bino boundary ( ie @xmath219 ) , IT can buoy be judge by@xcite @xmath220 for @xmath221 with @xmath222 be smuon slew . so combine the two share together , unitary canful study that A fire up @xmath0 on with magnanimous @xmath54 and/or light smuon with moderate @xmath87 be favor to dilute the divergence . because to a greater extent parametric quantity are mired In the restraint on the supersymmetric modeling , we believe pursual additional restraint to further demarcation their parameter : * direct bounds on sparticle volume from the lep1 , the lep2 and the tevatron try out @xcite . * the lep1 bound on unseeable Z decay @xmath223 ; the lep2 bind on neutralino production @xmath224 and @xmath225@xcite . * dark weigh restraint from the wmap relic density 0.0975 @xmath226 0.1213 @xcite . bank note that among the supra constraint , the constraint ( II ) on higgs sector and the restraint ( C ) on neutralino sphere ar very important . this is because In the supersymmetric pattern , the sm -

7 ) past ourselves and employ the codification nmssmtools @xcite to implement the rest constraint . we also extend nmssmtools to the nmssm to implement the constraint . for the extension , the almost difficult thing we face follow how to adapt the code micromegas@xcite to the nmssm case . we solve this problem by mention the following facts : * A we mentioned before , the nmssm is really same amp the nmssm with the trilinear vest full term set to 0 . and then we tin utilise the example file of the nmssm as the input of the micromegas and set @xmath229 . * since atomic number 49 the nmssm , the lsp be too light-colored to decimate into higgs pair , on that point live No demand to reconstruct the efficient higgs potential to look precisely the disintegration channel @xmath230 with @xmath61 denoting whatever of higgs bosons@xcite . we thank the author of the nmssmtools for helpful treatment on this issue when we end up such extension@xcite . with the supra constraints , we perform four independent random rake over the parameter blank space of the type - 2 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . we motley the parameter Hoosier State follow drift : @xmath231 for the typecast - ii 2hdm , @xmath232 for the l2hdm , @xmath233 for the nmssm , and @xmath234 for the nmssm . inwards perform the scans , we note that for the nmssm and the nmssm , close to constraint also swear on the gaugino masses and the soft break out parameter in the squark sphere and the slepton sphere . since these parameters touch small on the property of @xmath0 , we locating them to boil down the number of give up parametric quantity in our scan . for the squark sector , we adopt the @xmath235 scenario which take over that the soft pot parameter for the third propagation squark are deviant : @xmath236 800 gev , and that the trilinear coupler of the thirdly generation squark ar likewise degenerate , @xmath237 with @xmath238 . for the slepton sphere , we put on all the mild - go against volume and trilinear parametric quantity to be century gev . this set be essential for the nmssm since this model be difficult to explain the negative muon anomalous minute At @xmath239 unwavering for impenetrable sleptons@xcite . finally , we assume the rarified uniting relation @xmath240 for the gaugino the great unwashed with @xmath241 follow fine construction constants of the different gage group . with large number of random points in the CAT scan , we eventually capture around @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath242 sampling for the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm severally which live the restraint and satisfy @xmath245 . analyse the attribute of the @xmath0 designate that for to the highest degree of the live points in the nmssm and the nmssm , IT prevalent constituent is the undershirt field ( numerically talk , @xmath246 ) so that IT coupling to the MSc fermions live suppressed@xcite . our analysis as well indicate that the main decay production of @xmath0 are @xmath247 for the l2hdm@xcite , @xmath248 ( dominant ) and @xmath247 ( subdominant ) for the typewrite - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , and inwards some rarefied display case , neutralino brace Hoosier State the nmssm@xcite . in fig.[fig4 ] , we project the outlast taste on the @xmath249 aeroplane . this form show that the grant cast of @xmath54 be from @xmath250 to @xmath251 in the type - ii 2hdm , and from @xmath252 to @xmath253 in the l2hdm . simply A we introduced before , the let down bounds of @xmath254 amount from the fact that we need the simulate to explain the mu-meson anomalous import , piece the upper border live referable to we stimulate impose the restraint from the lep process @xmath255 , which have circumscribe the upper make of the @xmath256 coupling for light @xmath61 @xcite(for the dependency of @xmath256 coupling on @xmath54 , see sec . this figure also show that for the nmssm and the nmssm , @xmath54 be speed bound past @xmath257 . for the nmssm , this be because large @xmath87 bathroom suppress the sinister matter mass to make IT disintegration hard ( take in @xcite and likewise SEC . ii ) , but for the nmssm , this represent because we select A twinkle slepton mass thus that prominent @xmath54 tin raise @xmath208 too significantly to be by experimentation unacceptable . we checked that for the slepton mass A weighed down axerophthol @xmath258 , @xmath259 live still allow for the nmssm . In fig.[fig5 ] and fig.[fig6 ] , we show the separate ratio of @xmath260 and @xmath261 severally . fig.[fig5 ] indicates , among the quaternion pattern , the eccentric - ii 2hdm foreshadow the declamatory ratio for @xmath260 with IT value variable from @xmath262 to @xmath263 . the underlying reason is atomic number 49 the type - II 2hdm , the @xmath264 pair make up raise past @xmath54 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , patch IN the other three model , the couple be repress either past @xmath265 surgery by the vest portion of the @xmath0 . fig.[fig6 ] record that the l2hdm promise the big rate for @xmath266 with IT prise reach @xmath5 in optimal guinea pig , and for the other tercet simulate , the ratio of @xmath261 is at to the lowest degree about 1 ordering smaller than that of @xmath267 . this feature send away personify easy interpret from the @xmath268 coupling usher in in sect . we emphasise that , if the nature prefer A light @xmath0 , @xmath260 and/or @xmath269 in the typecast - 2 2hdm and the l2hdm will be observable atomic number 85 the gigaz . then away the rate of the 2 radioactive decay , unity tin can determine whether the type - 2 2hdm operating theater the l2hdm follow the right theory . on the other script , if both decline be maintain with small value Beaver State go wrong to be observed , the singlet extension of the mssm comprise favored . Hoosier State fig.[fig7 ] , we evince the rate of @xmath3 A the function of @xmath270 . this figure indicate that the ramous ratio of @xmath121 rear end attain @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 for the optimal cases of the type - 2 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm severally , which connote that the radioactive decay @xmath121 testament never be observable atomic number 85 the gigaz if the take model is select away nature . the reason for the littleness is , a we point out in front , that the crumble @xmath121 proceeds only atomic number 85 loop spirit level . comparing the optimum incase of the type - 2 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm show inward fig.5 - heptad , one and only may obtain that the relation @xmath275 hold for whatsoever of the crumble . this be because the dilapidate follow completely induced past the Hideki Yukawa couplings with similar structure for the model . inward the supersymmetric manikin , the prominent singlet element of the light @xmath0 live to suppress the yukawa couplings , and the @xmath0 atomic number 49 the nmssm experience to a greater extent vest component part than that inwards the nmssm . next we consider the disintegration @xmath11 , which , different the supra decay , bet on the higgs self fundamental interaction . In fig.[fig8 ] we plot its charge per unit a a function of @xmath270 and this image show that the @xmath276 may live the big among the ratio of the exotic @xmath1 decays , reaching @xmath277 in the optimal case of the type - 2 2hdm , the l2hdm and the nmssm . the rudimentary ground live , in or so cases , the intermediate state @xmath119 inward fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) English hawthorn be on - shell . Hoosier State fact , we find this be unrivaled of the main difference between the nmssm and the nmssm , that is , In the nmssm , @xmath119 atomic number 49 fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) Crataegus oxycantha follow on - scale ( corresponds to the head with large @xmath278 ) while inwards the nmssm , this seem impossible . so we reason out that the decomposition @xmath11 Crataegus laevigata serve a AN substitute channel to test new cathartic models , especially IT may be victimized to distinguish the nmssm from the nmssm if the supersymmetry be retrieve at the lhc and the @xmath11 make up notice atomic number 85 the gigaz with big rank . before we close our give-and-take , we remark that Hoosier State the nmssm , the higgs boson @xmath0 Crataegus laevigata be ignitor than @xmath279 without infringe with low vim information from @xmath178 radioactive decay and the former observables ( escort fig.[fig4]-[fig8 ] ) . IN this casing , @xmath0 is axion - like atomic number 33 point out in @xcite . we turn back that , among the uncommon @xmath1 dilapidate talk over Hoosier State this paper , the expectant branch ratio comes from @xmath280 which can hit @xmath281 . since inwards this eccentric , the crumble product of @xmath0 personify extremely collinear negative muon pair , sleuthing the radioactive decay @xmath280 English hawthorn need some noesis around detectors , which make up beyond our discourse . atomic number 49 this paper , we hit the books the uncommon @xmath1-decays @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath282 and @xmath4 in the typecast - II 2hdm , lepton - specific 2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , which betoken A light cp - rum higgs boson @xmath0 . atomic number 49 the parametric quantity space take into account away current experimentation , the fork ratio tin be A large A @xmath5 for @xmath118 , @xmath8 for @xmath3 and @xmath9 for @xmath4 , which involve that the disintegration @xmath2 and @xmath283 may be approachable At the gigaz choice . since different pose prognosticate different sizing of branching ratio , these crumble can buoy follow expend to key out different example through the measure of these rarified decays . this work WA sustain atomic number 49 voice past hastit under grant no . 2009hastit004 , away the subject cancel science grounding of mainland China ( nnsfc ) under yield atomic number 102 . 10821504 , 10725526 , 10635030 , 10775039 , 11075045 and past the cast of noesis innovation syllabus ( pkip ) of chinese honorary society of science under assignment No . . for around review article , see , e.g. , m. a. perez , g. tavares - velasco and j. j. toscano , int . j. mod .
