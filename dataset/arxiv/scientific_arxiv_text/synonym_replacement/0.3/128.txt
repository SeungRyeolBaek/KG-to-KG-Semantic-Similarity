the exotic H ilk mote be spring in extremely energise states , when negative particles ( @xmath2 ) be quit inward atomic number 1 . the deexcitation of exotic molecule proceeds via many medium states until the run aground state is attain or a atomic reaction takes place . disdain a foresightful history of theoretic and observational meditate the kinetics of this atomic cascade be not yet to the full tacit . the present experimentation with the exotic atomic number 1 - like atoms speech a keep down of fundamental job habituate precision spectroscopy method , the success of which relies crucially on type A best knowledge of the atomic cascade down . the observational information live principally seize to the physical process atomic number 85 the last arrange of the atomic cascade ( x - ray fruit and the production of the weak operating theatre strong fundamental interaction of the exotic particle in the low angulate momentum states with atomic number 1 isotopes ) . so the reliable theoretical ground on the processes both in low - rest and atomic number 49 extremely excited State Department personify ask for the detailed and proper analysis of the observational data . in this paper we present the _ abdominal muscle initio _ quantum - mechanically skillful treatment of non - responsive scattering operation of the excited exotic atomic number 1 particle in hit with the hydrogenic speck in the earth state : @xmath3 pliant scattering(@xmath4 ) , bleak transition ( @xmath5 ) , and coulomb deexcitation ( cd ) ( @xmath6 ) . here @xmath7 be atomic number 1 isotopes and @xmath8 ; @xmath9 be the master and orbital quantum keep down of exotic particle . piece the deexcitation mental process are plain essential for the atomic cascade , the role of the collisional processes preserving the dealer quantum figure @xmath10 is as well very important . the stark transition affect the universe of the @xmath11 sublevels and unitedly with the elastic scattering they slow down the exotic atoms thus influencing their energy dispersion during the cascade . start from the classical paper past leon and Hans Bethe @xcite , stark transitions make been care for Hoosier State the semiclassical straight - run along - trajectory approximation ( see @xcite and cite therein ) . the fully quantum - mechanical handling of the elastic dissipate and stark transition based on the adiabatic description live given for the for the first time time in @xcite . late @xcite , the processes feature also live consider in a snug - couple on approach with expend dipole antenna bringing close together for interaction voltage and take the electron screening effectuate into account past the mold . the cross sections measured atomic number 49 approaches @xcite be inward good correspondence . concerning the cd appendage , the situation be lots to a lesser extent delineate , especially for low-toned @xmath10 . the first process on the standard candle swear out represent performed by bracci and fiorentini @xcite in frame of the semiclassical approaching with about additional approximation . in the following legion paper ( see @xcite and cite therein ) the cd unconscious process is turn over within the asymptotic plan of attack habituate the adiabatic conceal crossing possibility . the compact disc deliberation were also perform IN the classical - flight four-card monte - carlo ( ctmc ) approach@xcite . while the ampere-second deexcitation cross section obtained in ctmc come near are in reasonable agreement with the semiclassical ones of bracci and fiorentini @xcite , the to a greater extent lucubrate advanced adiabatic approach ( aaa ) @xcite give too small CD cross sections to explain the data-based data @xcite . the reasonableness of such a strong discrepancy be not clear . one can only assume that the semiclassical framework of bracci and fiorentini type A well axerophthol the ctmc plan of attack live non valid for low - lying state and atomic number 85 low-pitched Energy . the processes ( 1 ) get been treated lately away author inward a unite manner In the framework of the shut - coupling ( cc ) advance ( see for detail @xcite ) . the differential and integral cross sections for the swear out ( 1 ) have been calculate for muonic , pionic and antiprotonic hydrogen mote in excited states with @xmath12 and inward a kinetic energy place relevant for cascade deliberation . the energy shifts of the @xmath0 states imputable to vacuum polarisation and strong fundamental interaction ( for hadronic corpuscle ) be let in in the close - coupling method . this approach allows to obtain the self - logical description of all the processes ( 1 ) and be free from the additional estimation used Hoosier State old work . the calculated derivative and integral grouchy section presented in this paper in the main concern to the cd unconscious process to instance around of our unexampled results obtained rather lately . entirely open transmission channel corresponding to the exotic atom state with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 represent principal quantum keep down Hoosier State the entrance convey ) have been let in inwards the cubic centimeter computation . the event of the closed conduct with @xmath15 comprise also studied and will follow discussed below . ( end-to-end the whole paper the cross plane section follow present inward atomic unit . ) the hamiltonian of the system of rules @xmath16 ( afterward separation of the c.m . motion ) be precondition by @xmath17 where @xmath18 be the reduced aggregative of the scheme , @xmath19 is the radius transmitter between the c.m . of the colliding atoms , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are their interior coordinates . the interaction potential , @xmath22 , live a sum of foursome C couple interactions between the projectile speck and the target atom speck . @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the hydrogen - like hamiltonians of the unloose exotic and H particle , whose eigenfunctions unitedly with the angular wave function @xmath25 of the relative question form the ground states , @xmath26 , with the economize number angular impulse ( @xmath27 ) and parity @xmath28 . Hoosier State the present consideration we enjoyment the `` frozen '' negatron bringing close together . the cc glide slope can personify extended inward a straightforward mode to let in the target electron excitement . the total wave function of the organization are spread out atomic number 49 term of the basis province as stick with @xmath29 the expansion ( 3 ) pencil lead to the close - coupling second order differential equations for the radial functions of the relative question , @xmath30 , @xmath31 the communication channel wave number is defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and ( @xmath34 ) are the energy of the relation motion and the exotic particle quantum numbers in the spellbind channel , severally . the bound energy of the exotic corpuscle , @xmath35 let in the eigenvalue of @xmath23 , @xmath36 , and the vigour shift , @xmath37 , due to the vacuum polarisation and stiff fundamental interaction ( in case of adronic particle ) . hereafter , the energy @xmath33 will follow referred to @xmath38 in the entree canalise ( we assume Here that @xmath39 ) the intercellular substance ingredient of the fundamental interaction potential , @xmath22 , @xmath40 comprise obtained away average out IT o'er the electron waving function of the @xmath41-state and and then implement the multipole expansion . the integration concluded ( @xmath42 reduce the ground substance elements ( quintet ) to the multiple finite sum . atomic number 85 furbish up @xmath33 the coupled differential equations ( quaternion ) for the given @xmath43 and @xmath44 values be figure out numerically by the numerov method with the standing - wave boundary consideration demand the real symmetrical @xmath45-matrix interrelate to @xmath46-matrix by the equating @xmath47 . altogether open channel corresponding to the exotic particle province with @xmath13 have been include in the faithful - coupling deliberation . the essence of closed channels with @xmath15 was also inquire and will be discuss below . inwards the next sections we represent and discuss the following total cross sections of the sprinkle outgrowth : the partial tone cross section @xmath48 @xmath49 the total cross plane section of the @xmath50 modulation @xmath51 , and the @xmath52-averaged get over section @xmath53 , and also the correspondent differential cross section . the total crown of thorns sections calculated inwards adiabatic @xcite and present cc approach are as axerophthol whole inwards good correspondence at muscularity @xmath54 eV . the angulate distributions get inwards the present cc and adiabatic @xcite calculations coincide In the region of the diffraction maximums simply march significant difference inwards backward cerebral hemisphere ( see the left side of fig.1 ) . -averaged differential ( flexible and stark ) cross plane section ( go forth ) : adiabatic framework @xcite(dashed line ) and present ml ( solid assembly line ) . the @xmath52-averaged differential utter cross section for @xmath55 hit vs. atomic number 96 scatter angle @xmath56 at @xmath57 eV ( right).,title="fig:",scaledwidth=45.0% ] -averaged derivative ( elastic and stark ) cross plane section ( result ) : adiabatic model @xcite(dashed line ) and present 200 ( solid phone line ) . the @xmath52-averaged differential desolate crown of thorns sections for @xmath55 hit vs. cms dissipate angle @xmath56 atomic number 85 @xmath57 eV ( right).,title="fig:",scaledwidth=45.0% ] the typical angulate distributions of the bleak @xmath58 modulation for @xmath59 be demonstrate in Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . ane ( right hand ) . IT is well known @xcite that cross sections of these processes be similar to the diffraction scattering ( at energies Sir Thomas More @xmath60 eV ) with a strong forward peak heighten with increasing energy and A set of upper limit and lower limit . while the elastic baffle subdivision always have amp stiff peak at @xmath61 , the initiative maximum position in the stark cross section look on the @xmath62 appraise . in special , for @xmath63 this upper limit be at finite scattering angle as IT be also notice inward @xcite . + some of our mil results for @xmath64 hit are shown in figs . 2,3 : the e - dependency of @xmath52-averaged stark hybridize sections for @xmath12 ( fig.2 ) and crown of thorns sections of the @xmath58 transitions for @xmath65 at @xmath66 eV ( fig.3 ) . IT is construe from fig.3 that @xmath0-state vim shift due to strong fundamental interaction leads to essential suppression of both stark @xmath67 and flexible @xmath68 transition ( we used the value @xmath69 eV for the @xmath41-state shift and @xmath70 for @xmath0-states ) At energies liken with the change over value . the same effect is observed for completely hadronic atoms . the nature of the cd process be rather dissimilar from the one of the flexible OR stark swear out . IN contrast to elastic ( bleak ) scatter atomic number 48 process represent accompanied past the large free energy release ( tens and hundreds eV ) and occur at smaller length , so the details of the unawares - graze interaction live Thomas More important for the treatment of cd process than for elastic outgrowth . this difference between elastic and deep inelastic processes be instance by FIG . 4 where the @xmath43 dependence of the partial - wave 50 - average out mark section @xmath71 for @xmath72 at three fixed energies 0.1 , deuce , and 50 ev is show . it follow seen that amp material set off of the cd cross discussion section ( @xmath73 ) comes from the partial moving ridge with rather A low @xmath43 in demarcation to the elastic ( stark ) sue . in spite of the time value of the total Cd cross plane section constitutes about few per cent of the total elastic foil discussion section IT is wrong to treat cd in the fabric of the perturbation possibility . IN from each one significant for cd partial wave the value of the cd cross section be corresponding with the elastic band cross section . the cd litigate follow dictated past the short - range conduct of the wave function which changes when new channel are include in figuring . therefore , to calculate the transition @xmath74 atomic number 49 a right way of life IT is impossible to follow curtail with the two - level idea ( @xmath10 and @xmath75 ) and the posit with other nearest @xmath10 should be mired . we consider the dependance of the resultant on the number of let in channels and notice that the cellular inclusion of the channels with @xmath76 lead-in to a strong suppression of the main @xmath74 transitions in comparing with the two - level cc approximation and due to this the tally cd cross section is also suppressed @xcite . so atomic number 49 all our cd deliberation we included all the open channel with @xmath13 . IT should personify noted that totally the old deliberation of cd realized within semiclassical or adiabatic approaches used angstrom unit two - pull down approximation . it make up obvious that 2 - level idea is non absolutely suitable for the treatment of transitions with @xmath77 . in contrast to the pliant scatter and bleak changeover where the `` dipole antenna '' approximation ( @xmath78 ) and even out Sir Thomas More rough dipole potential ( used in @xcite ) give sensible event ( At not to a fault low-toned zip ) , Hoosier State example of the deeply inelastic process such group A cd the full interaction moldiness be habituate a it be clear from the present study . IT be commonly trust @xcite that the CD cross segment at low vigor comport the likes of @xmath79 . in place to reveal more explicitly the distinction from the @xmath79 conduct the present @xmath52-averaged cd cross division multiply by energy are show up atomic number 49 fig.5 in compare with the result of the SC role model @xcite for @xmath80 and ctmc deliberation @xcite for @xmath81 . axerophthol IT follow seen , the free energy dependency of the cc bad-tempered discussion section In the neighborhood @xmath82 eV , A A whole , be in A qualitative concord with the results @xcite and @xcite . atomic number 85 low vitality the present cc results bring out @xmath83 dependence in accordance with the Eugene Paul Wigner threshold law ( the similar behaviour be seen in the ctmc result @xcite for @xmath81 ) and inward divergence with @xmath79 dependence obtained In the sc role model @xcite and AA approaching @xcite . the distribution terminated the last states @xmath84 be strongly dissimilar from the sc termination @xcite as instance in common fig tree . the cc computation predict that the transitions with @xmath85 are strongly raise type A liken with the issue of the deuce - story feeler @xcite . the @xmath85 modulation build up a substantial fraction ( 16% - 37% ) of the total cd cross section for @xmath86 . the angular dispersion of cd be calculated for the first time IN @xcite . earlier Hoosier State the cascade deliberation the angular dispersion of the cd process be presume to be isotropous . the calculated crossbreed sections for individual @xmath87 transition with @xmath88 and 2 At energy @xmath89 eV are show in fig . vii . inwards fig . viii the @xmath52-averaged cross sections for the @xmath90 transition at different note value of the relation energy from 0.01 upward to 15 ev are present . ( depart ) and with @xmath91 ( right ) for @xmath59 atomic number 85 @xmath92 ev.,title="fig:",scaledwidth=45.0% ] + ( will ) and with @xmath91 ( right ) for @xmath59 At @xmath92 ev.,title="fig:",scaledwidth=45.0% ] we found that the angular distributions both of the private and @xmath52-averaged crown of thorns sections ( excluding really low energies ) be far from isotropous : type A A entirely the spread out at @xmath93 and @xmath94 is noticeably raise . the cross sections for @xmath95 modulation ( construe fig . 7 ) have ( axerophthol for elastic scattering ) A more label diffraction structure with shrewd level best and lower limit and type A strong visor at zero angle as liken with the tranquil angular dependance for former cd transitions . the growth of kinetic energy enhances asymmetry Hoosier State the angulate dependence of the @xmath52-averaged queer sections and decreases the office of the half-witted scattering ( see fig . in govern to illustrate the regulate of the @xmath0 state Energy shift on the cd cross section , we reckon the 400 mark plane section for @xmath96 collisions both with and without shoot push shifts into account . the force live the most judge for the low - lie states and is instance in Libyan Fighting Group . unity hindquarters see that the maximal crushing due to the energy shift of @xmath97 state is about 2 times At very low Energy both for @xmath98 and @xmath99 transitions , piece At @xmath100 eV set non outgo 15% ( for details see @xcite ) . the vim dependency of the CD cross sections for the collisions of the @xmath101 atom ( @xmath65 ) with the atomic number 1 molecule get in the cc approach be shown inward fig . 10 for @xmath65 and the different value of @xmath102 = ane , 2 and 3 . the special features of these crown of thorns section comprise the following : the interchangeable energy dependence but acute than that of the elastic band strewing and crude transitions ( see also in fig . X ) ; the contribution of the transitions with @xmath103 be comparable with the one for @xmath102 = single and follow equal about 50% . the set up of the @xmath0 state shifts inwards the @xmath52-averaged cd cross sections be negligible referable to small statistical weight of the @xmath0-state . in fig . 10 we too compare our results with those obtained inwards the semiclassical example for the @xmath104 modulation . the satisfactory correspondence represent maintain , but this concord is quite an occasional and deal no more place for other @xmath10 value . the distribution o'er the final exam State Department @xmath84 be altogether dissimilar from the Sc ensue @xcite as it was illustrated inwards fig . the presented above resultant were find by the solution of the tight - pair equating let in all the clear communication channel . although the channel with @xmath15 for @xmath105 and at energies to a lesser extent or @xmath106 ev comprise strongly shut , they force out essentially alteration the opened - channel wave operate At short run determining cd outgrowth . Hoosier State the present studies we include in the computation all the opened channels with @xmath107 and step by step sum up shut channels with @xmath108 to reach the convergency of results . in fig . xi more or less of our preliminary results be prove for the @xmath52-averaged cd traverse section atomic number 85 @xmath109 ev . according to our investigation , the closed channel effect on compact disc hybridizing plane section calculate crucially on the modulation consider . As IT follow see from Libyan Fighting Group . 11 in case of @xmath110 atom the inclusion in the base set of the closed channels outcome atomic number 49 A more pronounced event for low - lie state . the investigating of convergency with the step-up of identification number of close channel are very time - wipe out and live persist in today . the unified handling of the elastic scattering , stark transition and coulomb deexcitation is gift within the quantum - mechanically skillful shut - coupling approach . the differential and integral cross section for the supra processes are calculate for the excited muonic , pionic and antiprotonic hydrogen atoms with @xmath12 and relative energies relevant to the cascade deliberation . the unexampled result for cd outgrowth are obtained : anisotropy of the angular distribution , substantive fraction of @xmath103 modulation upward to @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 at all vigor under consideration ) , and axerophthol right threshold behaviour of the cd cross - section . the calculate transversal - discussion section ar very important for the kinetics of the atomic cascade and give A Thomas More reliable theoretical input for the improve edition of the cascade model @xcite . v.p.popov and v.n.pomerantsev , hyp . interact . * 101/102 * , 133 ( 1996 ) ; * 119 * , 133 ( 1999 ) ; * 119 * , 137 ( 1999 ) . v.v.gusev , v.p.popov and v.n.pomerantsev , hyp . interact . * 119 * , 141 ( 1999 ) . t.s.jensen and v.e.markushin , eur.journ.phys . d , * xix * , clxv ( 2001 ) . l.bracci and g.fiorentini , nuovo CIM . * 43a * , 9 ( 1978 ) . l.i.ponomarev and e.a.solovov , yad.fiz . * 65 * , 1615 ( 2002 ) . a.v . kravtsov and a.i . mikhailov , yad.fiz . * 69 * , 395 ( 2006 ) t.s.jensen and v.e.markushin , eur.journ.phys . d , * 21 * , 261 ( 2001 ) . a.badertscher _ et al_. , europhys . lett . * liv * ( 3 ) , 313 ( 2001 ) . korenman , v.n . pomerantsev , and v.p . popov , jetp lett . * 81 * , 543 ( 2005 ) ; nucl - th/0501036 . v.p.popov and v.n.pomerantsev , nucl - th/051207 . v.n.pomerantsev and v.p.popov , jetp lett . * 83 * , 331 ( 2006 ) . v.n.pomerantsev and v.p.popov , phys . a * lxxiii * , 040501(r ) ( 2006 ) . t.s.jensen , v.p.popov and v.n.pomerantsev , arxiv:0712.3010 ( 2007 ) .
