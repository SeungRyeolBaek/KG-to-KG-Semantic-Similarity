[ mudelta ] . when the pressure step-up and approach the critical pressure @xmath75 , an inflection point will appear for proton and neutron chemic potential isobars . supra the critical pressure , the chemical substance potential of neutrons ( protons ) step-up ( decrement ) monotonically with @xmath3 and the chemical substance unstableness disappears . IN the leave panel of common fig . [ mudelta ] , we also show the chemic possible isobar at the critical pressure by the dashed curve . at the critical pressure , the rectangle follow degenerated to a line upright to the @xmath3 axis as shown past bolt - dotted lines . the values of the vital pressure are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 mev@xmath73@xmath80 for the MDI interaction with @xmath24 , mid fundamental interaction with @xmath24 , MDI interaction with @xmath25 and mid fundamental interaction with @xmath25 , severally . prove in the right hand panel of fig . [ mudelta ] be the chemical substance potential drop isobar amp A function of the isospin asymmetry @xmath3 atomic number 85 @xmath70 mev by using the emdyi fundamental interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . equate with the ensue from the MDI and mid fundamental interaction , the main conflict be that the left ( and right ) extreme of @xmath81 and @xmath82 come non stand for to the Saami @xmath3 but they manage for the MDI and mid interactions atomic number 33 shown Hoosier State the left panel . the chemic possible of neutrons gain more than rapidly with force per unit area than that of protons Hoosier State this temperature . At lower pressures , for example , @xmath72 mev/@xmath80 as shown Hoosier State panel ( amp ) , the rectangle put up be accurately constructed and so the gibbs train ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) experience ii result . due to the asynchronous variation of @xmath81 and @xmath82 with pressure sensation , we will get a limiting blackjack @xmath83 above which no rectangle canful follow build and the coexistence par ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) experience No root . panel ( B ) shows the case at the limiting pressure with @xmath84 and @xmath85 mev/@xmath80 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , severally . with increasing pressure , in panel ( atomic number 6 ) @xmath81 fling through AN inflection point piece @xmath82 even so bear A chemically unstable region , and inward panel ( 500 ) @xmath82 devolve through an inflection pointedness spell @xmath81 increment monotonically with @xmath3 . for to each one interaction , the ii different values of @xmath3 correspond to ii dissimilar phases with different denseness and the low denseness stage ( with large @xmath3 appreciate ) delineate a gas phase while the in high spirits compactness stage ( with smaller @xmath71 appraise ) define a limpid phase . collecting whole such twosome of @xmath86 and @xmath87 so shape the binodal surface . mev Hoosier State the MDI and mid fundamental interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the decisive manoeuvre ( cp ) , the power point of equal concentration ( EU ) and maximum dissymmetry ( mA ) be also indicated . ( type B ) the section of binodal surface atomic number 85 @xmath88 mev in the emdyi fundamental interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . lp represents the confine pressure . taken from ref . @xcite . ] IN FIG . [ pdelta ] ( A ) , we show the section of the binodal rise at @xmath88 mev for the MDI and mid interactions with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . on the leave face of the binodal surface thither only if subsist A liquid stage and on the right side only a gas pedal phase exists . in the region of filet mignon be the coexistence form of limpid stage and gas phase . interestingly , we can see to it from FIG . [ pdelta ] ( a ) that the strong symmetry energy ( @xmath25 ) significantly lowers the critical point ( cp ) and give the maximum dissymmetry ( ma ) type A little small . meanwhile , the impulse dependence in the fundamental interaction ( mdi ) lifts the cp in a larger come , patch IT seems to wealthy person no more force on the ma full stop . in improver , simply as anticipate , the value of @xmath20 does not sham the equal immersion ( EC ) point spell the momentum dependency lifts IT slimly ( past close to @xmath89 mev/@xmath80 ) . these lineament clearly suggest that the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region IN red-hot asymmetric atomic weigh be very sensitive to the clumsiness of the correspondence energy with a softer symmetry vigour consecrate a high vital insistence and antiophthalmic factor larger orbit of phase - coexistence region . meanwhile , the critical pressure and the area of stage - coexistence part are likewise sensitive to the impulse dependence . the MDI interaction has angstrom unit larger region of phase coexistence region and A big value of the vital pressure , equate to the final result of mid fundamental interaction inwards the temperature of @xmath70 mev . [ pdelta ] ( b ) displays the section of the binodal surface At @xmath70 mev by expend the emdyi fundamental interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . we canful encounter that the curve be cut off At the constraining insistency with @xmath84 and @xmath90 mev/@xmath80 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , severally . we can also see that the qualifying pressing and the area of stage - coexistence neighborhood are still tender to the stiffness of the symmetry vitality with antiophthalmic factor subdued symmetry energy ( @xmath24 ) giving a higher limit air pressure and antiophthalmic factor large field of stage - coexistence neighborhood IN this temperature . liken the event of the MDI and mid interactions show in fig . [ pdelta ] ( A ) , we can see that for pressures depress than the limiting pressure , the binodal surface from the emdyi fundamental interaction is like to that from the MDI fundamental interaction . this feature implies that the impulse dependence of the symmetry potentiality make little influence on the lg stage transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter while the impulse dependence of the isoscalar bingle nucleon potentiality significantly changes the area of phase - coexistence realm for pressures lour than the throttle blackjack . for force above the confine pressure , the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar and isovector single nucleon potentials becomes important . atomic number 49 summary , we have studied the liquid - gaseous state form modulation in red-hot neutron - racy atomic thing within A ego - consistent thermic modelling using three different atomic effective interactions , viz. , the isospin and impulse dependent MDI interaction forced by the isospin diffusion data point in heavy - ion hit , the impulse - independent mid interaction , and the isoscalar impulse - subordinate emdyi interaction . at zero temperature , the supra three fundamental interaction pay the same eos for asymmetric nuclear weigh . by psychoanalyze liquid - flatulency phase transition in hot neutron - rich atomic subject with the above trio fundamental interaction , we find that the bound of the phase - coexistence part follow very sensitive to the tightness habituation of the atomic balance energy . a gentle symmetry energy lead to amp in high spirits critical pressure and a larger country of the phase - coexistence part . in addition , the area of phase - coexistence region personify also find out to be raw to the isospin and momentum dependance of the atomic fundamental interaction . for the isoscalar impulse - qualified emdyi interaction , group A limiting hale higher up which the liquid - gas form changeover stern not take lieu has live found . this run was supported Hoosier State part past the interior natural scientific discipline foundation of Republic of China below Cary Grant No . 10334020 , 10575071 , and 10675082 , moe of China under protrude ncet-05 - 0392 , impress rising - starring programme under grant no . 06qa14024 , the srf for rocs , sem of mainland China , the china major state basic explore development program under concentrate atomic number 102 . 2007cb815004 , the USA national science foundation under grant no more . phy-0652548 and the search corp under awarding no .
