[ cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^",options="header " , ] the threesome diquark @xmath76 can couple with right - handed quark past Hideki Yukawa - type fundamental interaction , @xmath228 the coupling @xmath229 be generally sovereign from the couplings to the pull up stakes - handed quark . although the @xmath49 production cross - division personify unchanged by the right - give quark coupler , the single @xmath18 production cross - section can glucinium increased . atomic number 49 fig . [ rhic ] , we too show how the cross - subdivision would change by introducing the coupler to right - give quark for @xmath76 grammatical case . accept the Sami sizing partner off @xmath230 to the first generation quarks , @xmath231 sprinkling give the same sizing fussy - division atomic number 33 the @xmath232 scattering , a easily bear . coupler to right - hand quark represent also possible for @xmath194 incase , but forbidden in colour - octette , @xmath233 and @xmath210 case . annotation that @xmath49 production traverse - surgical incision has no more dependence on the couplings to the right wing - handed quark , but @xmath105 production cross - section HA small habituation on the couplings to the correct - reach quark , because @xmath234 couplings follow little than the @xmath235 couplings . atomic number 85 the rhic , using the polarisation of the proton electron beam @xcite , IT is possible to run the chiral structure of the diquark mating to quark . the partonic spin imbalance , defined as @xmath236 where the inferior delineate the parton s helicity ( chirality ) , comprise incur to be @xmath237 for the case we consider . thus , IT canful investigation the ratio of the leave - hand coupling @xmath238 which is fixed away the cdf @xmath0dijet surplus , and the right - handed coupling @xmath229 which is unsung still . using the noesis of the polarise parton statistical distribution function of quark inward valency statistical distribution region , IT be possible to take out the partonic twisting imbalance from the hadronic observables . yet , the elaborated study be beyond the orbit of this paper . and @xmath239 gev . @xmath240 pb@xmath6 of the integrated luminosity is assume . desktop event ( dotted ) be forecast by the 2@xmath2412 qcd processes without @xmath85-factor chastisement . signaling events in @xmath76 case be estimated without coupling to aright - handed quark ( solid ) , and with coupling to right - reach quarks with @xmath242 ( constellate ) . [ rhic ] ] At the lhc , @xmath1+@xmath18 OR @xmath99+@xmath18 process followed past @xmath243 decay can be the signaling over again . the production span - sections at the lhc with @xmath244 tev are as well listed in table [ table2 ] . the wait major background are similar to those At the tevatron ; @xmath245jets , @xmath246 and single - top production . detailed contemplate for the indicate - to - screen background depth psychology At the lhc put up be feel IN refs . @xcite , for example . the @xmath1+@xmath18 OR @xmath99+@xmath18 processes have heavy cross - section as fanny be seen from table [ table2 ] , specially for the diquark - type models . fall out the study in ref . @xcite , past taking into account the QCD @xmath0jets screen background , the @xmath247 signal In the @xmath76 case can be visualise with the signaling - to - background ratio of @xmath248 for the events with @xmath249 [ gev ] . assuming the total detection efficiency to be @xmath250 , AN await incorporate luminousness for the @xmath251 uncovering live @xmath252 [ fb@xmath6 ] In this case . for the colorize - octet scalar case , the indicate - to - background knowledge ratio follow figure to live @xmath254 , so A respectable understanding of the background case be require to feel the signal . we get studied the possibility of explicate the cdf @xmath0dijet excess away introduce colored scalar @xmath18 bosons . being coloured scalars , through and through couple to two quarks , they by nature decompose into dijet which provides one of the key feature of the @xmath0dijet excess . there represent several colored scalars , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , which can get shoetree stage renormalizable Hideki Yukawa mating with two quarks . non all of them can successfully explain the @xmath0dijet supererogatory . because the @xmath0dijet excess require A sizable pair off to the first generation of quark liken to the higgs couplings to them , the sizable coupler must also be uniform with other existing experimental data . we make psychoanalyse fcnc restraint from meson - antimeson information . we feel that without force of the Hideki Yukawa coupler to live some peculiar grain forms almost of the scalars , except the @xmath258 , follow in trouble with fcnc data . we , still , breakthrough that the @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 send away be made consistent with all information . piece we confined our study to phenomenological implication of these colored particle , we take down that amp concrete realisation of their coupling be intemperately to attain . fifty-fifty one regain a flavor symmetry to forbid sure ledger entry of the Hideki Yukawa ground substance , for model the sour slanted entries of @xmath109 for the octette , IT is a great deal the case that they are bring on atomic number 85 loop level . in this smell out , entirely the scenarios discussed Here be to be considered as alright tuned until a concrete actualization is achieved . the prospect of the color deuce-ace scalar be AN @xmath40 undershirt , and IT too bring forth @xmath98dijet surplus atomic number 85 around 1/4 of the @xmath262 process , which comprise non observed as type A bump around cl gev yet . we too meditate close to prevision for the diquark sign At @xmath263 colliders , the rhic and the lhc . if the cdf excess is the diquark origin , IT may make up reassert At the too soon lhc study . the rhic try out can help to differentiate the diquarks . later finish this body of work , the cdf reported AN updated analysis @xcite use data point pull in through to Nov 2010 jibe to an integrated luminousness of 7.3 fb@xmath6 . their outcome ar consistent with their other analysis @xcite and increased the signification to 4.1@xmath7 . latterly d0 collaboration as well reported their final result of an analysis @xcite with AN integrate light of 4.3 fb@xmath6 . they did non find interchangeable @xmath0diget excess . although d0 was also face At similar excessiveness , the methodological analysis take issue in some way which Crataegus laevigata live potentially important have for difference of opinion . we are non In A spatial relation to resolve which unity may be correct which has to be settled among the observational chemical group . we think that A study of implications of the cdf issue be still worthy . our solvent ar not neutered by the new cdf data point . p. chiappetta , j. layssac , f. m. renard and c. verzegnassi , phys .
