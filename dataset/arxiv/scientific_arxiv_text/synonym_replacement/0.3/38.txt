atomic number 49 solid - core photonic crystallization fibre ( pcf ) the aviation - silica microstructured cladding ( regard fig . [ fig1 ] ) gives rising slope to a sort of novel phenomena @xcite include large - mode expanse ( lma ) continuously - single modal value operation @xcite . though pcfs typically get opthalmic property very different from that of banner fibers they of course ploughshare some of the boilersuit properties such every bit the susceptibleness of the attenuation to macro instruction - bending . macrobending - make attenuation Hoosier State pcfs have be direct both through an experiment A well as theoretically / numerically in A identification number of paper @xcite . notwithstanding , forebode bend - loss is no simple labor and typically regard a wide-cut numerical solvent of J. C. Maxwell s equations A good as use of angstrom unit phenomenological release parameter , _ e.g. _ an effective core r . In this paper we revisit the job and show how macro - bend loss measure on high - quality pcfs can be predicted with high truth using easy - to - evaluate empirical relations . foretelling of macro - bending induced fading inward photonic crystal fibre have been make using several come near include feeler - theory for out to standard fibers @xcite , mate - length standard @xcite , and phenomenological mock up within the tilted - index number delegacy @xcite . Here , we also apply the feeler - theory of sakai and kimura @xcite , only contrary to refs . @xcite we make a full shift of banner - fiber parametric quantity such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 @xcite to fibre parametric quantity appropriate to high - indicator contrast pcfs with a three-sided arrangement of aura cakehole . in the big - musical mode area limit we get ( see vermiform process ) @xmath3 for the powerfulness - dilapidate , @xmath4 , on the fiber . for a changeover to a db - scale leaf @xmath5 should be procreate by @xmath6 . in combining weight . ( [ alpha_lma ] ) , @xmath7 is the bending r , @xmath8 live the effectual country @xcite , @xmath9 be the index of silicon dioxide , and @xmath10 be the latterly present efficacious V - parametric quantity of A pcf @xcite . the strength of our formulation is that it contains no free parametric quantity ( such as an arbitrary core radius ) and what is more empirical expression , depending only on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , ingest been given late for both @xmath8 and @xmath13 @xcite . from the function @xmath14 we Crataegus oxycantha derive the parametric dependency of the critical bend wheel spoke @xmath15 . the part increase dramatically when the argument be to a lesser extent than I and hence we may define angstrom unit decisive bend radius from @xmath16 where @xmath17 . typically the pcf personify operated close to rationalise - sour where @xmath18 @xcite so that the parameter may be written A @xmath19 this dependence was maiden account and through an experiment reassert past birks _ et al . _ @xcite and recently a pre - factor of ordination unity be also retrieve through an experiment in ref . we get construct 3 lma fibers away the stack - and - pull method and characterise them using the conventional cutting - back technique . whole iii fibers receive A three-sided air - hole raiment and A solid core formed past A single missing air - hole in the center of the structure , see fig . [ fig1 ] . for the lma-20 macro - bending red ink has be mensurable for stoop radius of r=8 cm and r=16 centimetre and the result be shown in common fig tree . the predictions of equivalent weight . ( [ alpha_lma ] ) be also included . it is emphasized that the predictions be based on the empirical relation for @xmath8 and @xmath13 allow Hoosier State refs . @xcite and @xcite severally and thus make not require whatever numerical deliberation . similar results are shown IN fig . [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for the lma-25 and lma-35 fiber , respectively . the pcf , in possibility , exhibit both a short and long - wavelength stoop - edge . nonetheless , the ensue present here only designate a unawares - wavelength twist - edge . the reason for this live that the long - wavelength curve - inch come for @xmath20 @xcite . for typical lma - pcfs IT is therefor set in the non - lucid wavelength authorities of silicon oxide . inwards conclusion we let march that macro instruction - bending loss measure on high - prize pcfs canful live predicted with ripe truth using easy - to - value empirical relations with only @xmath21 and @xmath22 as input parameters . since macro instruction - bending fading for many purposes and application live the throttle factor we believe that the present result will make up useful atomic number 49 practical designs of optical system of rules engage photonic quartz fiber . the starting point be the deflexion - loss pattern for A gaussian modal value IN A standard - fiber @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath8 be the effective orbit , @xmath24 is the nucleus radius , @xmath7 is the bending r , and the standard - fiber parameters are apply past @xcite @xmath25 stand in these parameters into eq . ( [ alpha1 ] ) we get @xmath26 in the relevant limit where @xmath27 . Here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in eqs . ( [ alpha_lma ] ) and ( [ v_pcf ] ) have be introduced . for large - modal value area fibers we get a further simplification for the isolated extension constant ; using that @xmath30 we arrive atomic number 85 eq .
