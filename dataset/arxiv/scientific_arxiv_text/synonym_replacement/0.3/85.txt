A geodesic flux atomic number 49 A given direction on a translation Earth's surface get on a transverse segment AN separation exchange map . dynamical of such translation take be extensively studied during these last thirty yr allow for applications programme to billiards in rational polygons , to measured foliations on surface , to teichmller geometry and dynamic , etc . separation switch translation be closely related to abelian differentials on riemann surfaces . IT be intimately known that the continued fraction encode cut sequence of inflated geodesic line on the poincar upper half - plane . likewise , the rauzy - veech elicitation ( correspondent to euclidean algorithmic program ) provide a distinct model for the teichmller geodesics flow ( @xcite ) . apply this recounting h. masur Hoosier State @xcite and w. a. veech inwards @xcite have severally prove the keane s conjecture ( unique ergodicity of well-nigh all musical interval exchange transformations ) . utilise combinatorics of rauzy class , kontsevich and zorich classified advertisement the connected components of strata of the moduli blank of abelian differentials @xcite . Thomas More of late , avila , gouzel and yoccoz try the exponential decompose of coefficient of correlation for the teichmller geodesic current also using angstrom unit renormalization of the rauzy - veech induction ( take in @xcite ) . avila and viana habituate combinatorics of rauzy - veech induction to prove the simplicity of the essential role of the lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic line flow on the social class of abelian differential ( see @xcite ) . recently bufetov and gurevich proven the beingness and uniqueness of the step of maximum S for the teichmller geodesic flow on the moduli space of abelian differentials @xcite . avila and forni evidence the light intermixture for almost all interval interchange translation and displacement flows @xcite . these example show that rauzy - veech induction which was initially elaborated to leaven ergodicity of interval exchange translation and ergodicity of the teichmller geodesic feed be , really , very efficient FAR beyond these initial problems . yet , all the aforementioned issue business organization only the moduli space of abelian differentials . the agree questions for stratum of strict quadratic differentials ( i.e. of those , which live non global square up of abelian first derivative ) remain open . note that the ( co)tangent bundle to the moduli space of curves live course identify with the moduli blank of _ quadratic _ derivative . from this point of thought , the stratum of abelian differential interpret special orbifolds of high codimension atomic number 49 the total space of the tan sheaf . our interest in teichmller kinetics and geometry of the stratum of strict quadratic polynomial first derivative follow i of the principal need for arise rauzy - veech induction for quadratic differential . instinctive generalization of musical interval interchange transmutation were innovate by danthony and nogueira in @xcite ( catch likewise @xcite ) group A cross section of measured leafing on surface . they introduce the whimsy of additive elaboration , as well a the whim of rauzy inductive reasoning on these maps . studying lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic line menses kontsevich and zorich have got perform series of computer experiments with additive involution correspond to quadratic differential @xcite . these experimentation indicated appearance of attractors for the rauzy - veech induction , every bit well a representative of generalized permutations such that the corresponding additive enfolding live minimum for angstrom unit area of parameters of prescribed measure , and non minimum for angstrom unit completing land of parametric quantity also of overconfident measure ( example of this type are presented in compute [ rauzy : class:2ii ] and figure [ fig : rauzy:2 ] in cecal appendage @xmath2 ) . only At this power point , there was no combinatorial explanation . thus , in order to generalize technique of rauzy - veech inductance to quadratic differentials atomic number 49 a consistent mode it live essential to find out combinatorial criteria take into account to identify generalized switch , which belong to attractors and those ones , which represent traverse section of vertical foliage of quadratic first derivative . it be too necessary to distinguish those generalised permutation which give rise to minimum linear involution , and to specify the domains of appropriate parameters . inwards this paper we ground correspond combinatory touchstone , which enable us to develop technique of rauzy - veech inductance for quadratic differentials . partial ensue in this direction were obtained past the second author in @xcite . we also study sexual congress betwixt combinatorics , geometry and dynamics of linear enfolding . to compare similarities and differences betwixt running involution correspond to abelian and to quadratic differential net ball us initiative briefly critical review the situation inwards the classic guinea pig . AN interval exchange transmutation is encoded away amp combinatorial information ( permutation @xmath3 on @xmath4 elements ) and away A uninterrupted data point ( length @xmath5 of the interval ) . callback that the keane sulphur property ( see below ) be a touchstone of `` irrationality '' ( which , in particular , implies minimality ) of AN interval exchange transmutation . this attribute is satisfied for almost totally parametric quantity @xmath6 when the permutation @xmath3 be irreducible ( i.e. @xmath7 , while when @xmath3 be reducible , the corresponding interval exchange map is _ ne'er _ minimal . on the other hand the irrational interval interchange maps are precisely those that rise as cross surgical incision of minimum vertical flows on well prefer transverse intervals . the rauzy - veech initiation comprise inward taking the first return mathematical function of AN interval exchange shift to an conquer low separation . this elicitation can buoy be look at group A A dynamical scheme on a finite - dimensional infinite of interval interchange map . the behaviour of AN electron orbit of the induction provides important info on dynamics of the musical interval switch transformation make up the start point . this information be especially utile when all restate personify well delineate and when the length of the underlying subintervals tends to nought . AN musical interval exchange shift satisfy the latter condition be say to have _ property_. for A yield irreducible permutation @xmath3 , the subset of parameters @xmath6 which give rise to separation change transmutation gratify keane s belongings curb completely irrational parameters , and thus it be a full lebesgue measure subset . moreover , for the space of separation exchange transmutation with irreducible combinatory data point , the renormalize generalisation process follow recurrent with respect to the lebesgue bar ( and even ergodic by a theorem of veech ) . note that the corresponding constant measuring have non-finite total mass . in this report we use the definition of _ running involution _ be the involution of @xmath8 given by @xmath9 . A additive involution be A map @xmath10 , from @xmath8 into itself , of the pattern @xmath11 , where @xmath12 be an participation of @xmath8 without fixed dot , uninterrupted omit atomic number 49 finitely many points , and which preserves the lebesgue bar . in this theme we will only deliberate elongate intricacy with the additional precondition . the differential of @xmath12 be @xmath13 at @xmath14 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 go to the Saame connected component , and @xmath13 otherwise ; see as well convening [ convention : orientate ] . ] proposed by danthony and nogueira ( see @xcite ) . amp above , A _ linear involvement _ follow encoded by a combinatorial information ( `` generalised permutation '' ) and past uninterrupted data . group A generalise permutation of typewrite @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 ) is a two - to - unitary map @xmath18 to AN alphabet @xmath19 . A generalized permutation be forebode _ irreducible _ if on that point be a elongate intricacy connect to this generalised permutation , which make up an appropriate cross section of the vertical foliation of roughly quadratic differential coefficient . axerophthol generalized permutation be called _ dynamically irreducible _ if there exists amp minimum analog involution associate to this generalized permutation . IT be leisurely to show that any irreducible generalized permutation comprise dynamically irreducible ; the discourse represent non true in full general as we will see . irreducible and dynamically irreducible generalised switch can be characterize by natural standard express In elementary combinatorial terms . the like standard are posit type A definitions [ def : irred ] and definition [ def : dyn : irr ] severally . look at a dynamically irreducible extrapolate replacement @xmath3 . the parameter infinite of normalized elongate enfolding link up to @xmath3 is play by a hyperplane discussion section of A simplex . we describe an explicit process which associate to for each one generalized permutation @xmath3 an open subset atomic number 49 the parametric quantity space defined past a scheme of analog inequalities set by @xmath3 . this subset personify called the readiness of _ admissible parameters_. when @xmath3 live irreducible , the go under of admissible parametric quantity coincides with intact parameter blank ; in general it personify small . the next result gives angstrom unit Sir Thomas More precise financial statement than theorem @xmath2 Hoosier State the dynamically irreducible case . @xmath20 ace . if @xmath3 be not dynamically irreducible , or if @xmath3 live dynamically irreducible , but @xmath6 does not belong to the set of admissible parameter , the analog involution @xmath21 is non minimum . if @xmath3 be dynamically irreducible , and then for most altogether admissible parametric quantity @xmath6 the additive involution @xmath21 satisfies the keane s attribute , and thence be minimal . since the rauzy - veech induction commute with distension , IT projectivizes to group A map @xmath22 on the space of normalise linear enfolding ; we shall call this map the _ renormalize rauzy - veech induction_. let t be a running enfolding on the social unit interval and allow U look at A sequence @xmath23 of iterates by the renormalized rauzy - veech generalisation @xmath22 . 1 . if @xmath10 has the keane S property , so there be @xmath24 such that @xmath25 follow irreducible for all @xmath26 . the renormalise rauzy - veech induction , delineate on the set @xmath27 , be recurrent . having axerophthol generalise transposition @xmath3 we can define 1 surgery ii other vulgarise permutation @xmath28 and @xmath29 reverberate the opening for the simulacrum of the rauzy - veech induction @xmath30 . these combinatorial rauzy mathematical operation delineate a partial order In the set of irreducible switch represent past AN oriented graph . rauzy social class _ be a link up constituent of this chart . note that geometry of the rauzy graphs is very different and to a greater extent rarify than in the typesetter's case of `` admittedly '' permutations since for some irreducible generalized permutations single of the rauzy military operation power live non defined . from theorem @xmath31 we testament deduce that A rauzy class be AN compare class for the compare relation apply away these combinatorial operations ( look proffer [ prop : sort out ] ) . inwards analogy with the case of the `` straight '' permutations , we preface unitary more than combinatorial mathematical operation on generalized permutations and delineate _ extend rauzy classes _ As minimum subsets of irreducible vulgarize replacement invariant under these corresponding 3 operations . the moduli spaces of abelian differential and of quadratic polynomial differential are stratified by multiplicity of the cipher of the gibe differential . we denote group A stratum of the moduli space of strict quadratic differential coefficient ( with atomic number 85 most unproblematic poles ) past @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the multiplicities of the zero point ( @xmath34 correspond to amp magnetic pole ) . extend rauzy course of study of irreducible generalise permutations be in unitary - to - one correspondence with relate components of stratum atomic number 49 the moduli blank of quadratic polynomial differential . historically , go rauzy classes where used to show the non - link of some layer of abelian differentials . for switch of a small number of elements , IT is easy to fabricate explicitly the subset of irreducible permutations and and then using the rauzy operations to decompose it into A disjoint brotherhood of extend rauzy classes . employ this draw near veech proven that the minimum stratum in genus @xmath35 take in two connected components and arnoux prove that the minimum layer atomic number 49 genus @xmath36 birth III connected element ( for abelian differential ) . get found an explicit combinatorial standard of irreducibility of a generalise transposition ( videlicet theorem @xmath2 ) unity crapper hold theorem @xmath37 to classify the connected portion of all stratum of quadratic differentials of sufficiently small dimension . this justifies , in finicky , the come after data-based result of zorich . each of the following four exceptional layer of quadratic polynomial derivative @xmath38 and @xmath39 contains exactly II connect components . annotation that axerophthol theorem of the secondment author @xcite classifies totally connected components of completely other social class of meromorphic quadratic differential with at to the highest degree simple poles . these strata are either link , or hold exactly II connect element one of which being hyperelliptic . the same theorem @xcite prove that each of the remaining quaternary exceptional strata mightiness experience atomic number 85 most two plug into constituent . notwithstanding , the only currently useable substantiation of the fact they are disconnected personify the unitary based on expressed calculation of the extend rauzy classes and correspond to the theorem of zorich . IT would be worry to make an algebraical - geometrico proof of the last theorem ; viz. a topological invariant type A inward the kontsevich - zorich sec classification @xcite . note also that amp paper of zorich @xcite cave in explicits representative elements for each expand rauzy class . look also @xcite for programs concerning calculations of these rauzy division . inward section [ SEC : iem ] we call back staple properties of flat surface , moduli blank and separation convert maps . IN specific we call back the rauzy - veech initiation and IT dynamical belongings . we interrelate these properties to irreducibility . + inward subdivision [ sec : giem ] we recall the definition of A elongate involvement and give staple property . then in segment [ combinatoric ] we delineate amp combinatory notion of irreducibility , and prove the first split of theorem @xmath2 . the main tool we use to prove this theorem live the presentation proposed away marmi , moussa and yoccoz which appears in @xcite + in section [ sec : dyn ] we present the keane sec property for the one-dimensional involution and show the second part of theorem @xmath2 , that is theorem @xmath40 . for that we show that @xmath10 satisfies the keane s dimension if and only when if the rauzy - veech installation is always intimately defined and the length parameter tends to zero . and then if @xmath10 execute non satisfy the keane s property we show that at that place exists @xmath24 such that @xmath41 represent dynamically reducible which and so implies that @xmath10 live likewise dynamically reducible . + in segment [ dyn : rauzy : veech ] , we study the dynamic of the renormalized rauzy - veech map on the space of the running involution , and shew theorem @xmath31 . for that we utilisation the teichmller geometry and the finiteness of the volume of the stratum proven away masur and veech ( see @xcite ) . + discussion section [ rauzy : grade : giem ] is commit to angstrom unit proof of theorem @xmath37 on extend rauzy family ; we present a lead of zorich ground on an expressed computation of these family inward Sir David Low genera . + in the vermiform process we represent some explicit rauzy course As illustration of the job which seem in the full general case . we also give a property concerning the extend rauzy course of instruction . we thank anton zorich for useful discourse . we thank arnaldo nogueira for comments and input on a prelim version of this textual matter . + this act be partially supported by the anr `` teichmller projet blanc '' anr-06-blan-0038 . inward this discussion section we review canonical opinion concerning flat surface , moduli space and musical interval exchange maps . for superior general references see aver @xcite and @xcite . inward this paper we will more often than not keep abreast notational system represent atomic number 49 the paper @xcite , surgery equivalently @xcite . a _ level surface _ be a ( real , compact , link ) genus @xmath42 surface fitted out with A flat metric ( with isolated conical uniqueness ) such that the holonomy grouping belongs to @xmath43 . hither holonomy intend that the collimate transport of A vector on a long loop impart the vector back to itself operating theatre to its opposite . this implies that altogether retinal cone angles be whole number multiples of @xmath3 . equivalently A flat surface is amp three-bagger @xmath44 such that @xmath45 be a topologic thick connect surface , @xmath46 follow a finite subset of @xmath45 ( whose elements personify call up _ uniqueness _ ) and @xmath47 personify an atlas of @xmath48 such that the modulation maps @xmath49 are translations or half - turns : @xmath50 , and for for each one @xmath51 , in that respect is a neighborhood of @xmath52 isometric to A euclidean cone . therefore we receive A _ quadratic polynomial differential _ delineate locally Hoosier State the co-ordinate @xmath53 by the formula @xmath54 . this form extends to the full stop of @xmath46 to nought , simple pole Beaver State mark peak ( see @xcite ) . we will sometimes use the annotation @xmath55 operating theatre simply @xmath45 . observe that the holonomy is lilliputian if and only if there exists axerophthol sub - telamon such that altogether transition functions live translations Beaver State equivalently if the quadratic differentials @xmath56 be the spheric square of AN abelian differential . we will and so say that @xmath45 personify a displacement surface . for @xmath57 , we delineate the moduli infinite of abelian differential @xmath58 A the congeal of twin @xmath59 modulo the equivalence relation bring forth by : @xmath60 if thither be an analytic isomorphy @xmath61 such that @xmath62 . + for @xmath63 , we as well delineate the moduli space of quadratic differentials @xmath64 atomic number 33 the moduli blank space of mate @xmath65 ( where @xmath56 be non the worldwide square toes of whatsoever abelian differential coefficient ) modulo the par relation generate by : @xmath66 if at that place subsist an analytic isomorphy @xmath61 such that @xmath67 . the moduli space of abelian differential ( respectively quadratic derivative ) is stratified past the multiplicities of the zeroes . we will denote by @xmath68 ( severally @xmath69 ) the stratum consisting of holomorphic one - form ( severally quadratic differential ) with @xmath70 naught ( OR poles ) of multiplicities @xmath71 . these stratum ar non - connected in ecumenical ( for a complete classification see @xcite in the abelian differential case and @xcite In the quadratic polynomial differentials case ) . the linear accomplish of the @xmath72-parameter subgroup of diagonal ground substance @xmath73 on the plane surfaces pose a particular involvement . it yield a measure - preserving catamenia with respect to group A raw measure @xmath74 , preserving apiece stratum of region unitary flat tire surface . this flow be known A the _ teichmller geodesic flow_. masur and veech establish the following theorem . the teichmller geodesic flow playact ergodically on from each one connected element of apiece social class of the moduli spaces of region ane abelian and quadratic derivative ( with respect to axerophthol finite measure In the lebesgue year ) . this theorem be turn up by masur @xcite and veech @xcite for the @xmath68 case and for the @xmath75 pillow slip . + the ergodicity of the teichmller geodesic line current is bear witness inwards full generality In @xcite , theorem @xmath76 . the finiteness of the measure seem inwards II @xmath77 preprints of veech : dynamical system of rules on analytical manifold of quadratic polynomial differentials i , ii ( see also @xcite p.445 ) . these preprints make be write IN @xmath78 @xcite . in this segment we recall in brief the theory of musical interval exchange represent . we testament render that , below simple combinatorial check , such translation uprise naturally A poincar return maps of assess leafing and geodesic line flows on interlingual rendition Earth's surface . moreover we will present the rauzy - veech initiation and IT geometrical and dynamical property ( go out @xcite for to a greater extent inside information ) . net ball @xmath79 be an open musical interval and let u choose a finite subset @xmath80 of @xmath81 . its accompaniment is axerophthol matrimony of @xmath82 give subintervals . an interval convert map is a nonpareil - to - 1 single-valued function @xmath10 from @xmath83 to A co - finite subset of @xmath81 that is group A translation on to each one subinterval of its definition domain . IT be gentle to see that @xmath10 is exactly determined away the keep abreast information : axerophthol replacement @xmath84 that encodes how the musical interval are commute ( expressing that the K - th interval , when numerated from the allow for to the right , be ship past @xmath10 to the order @xmath85 ) , and a transmitter with positive entries that encodes the length of the separation . follow marmi , moussa , yoccoz @xcite , we denote these interval by @xmath86 , with @xmath19 A finite alphabet . the length of the intervals is a transmitter @xmath87 , and the combinatorial data point be a couple @xmath88 of i - to - i represent @xmath89 . so @xmath84 is A one - to - I map out from @xmath90 into itself yield past @xmath91 . we will unremarkably represent such a permutation away A table : @xmath92 [ example : permutation ] let U consider the next alphabet @xmath93 with @xmath94 . and so we delineate A replacement @xmath3 every bit follow . @xmath95 inward this section we introduce the notion of winner and also-ran , following the nomenclature of the paper of avila , gouzel and yoccoz @xcite . for @xmath21 we define the _ type _ @xmath96 of @xmath10 away @xmath97 . we will and so say that @xmath98 be the winner and @xmath99 personify the also-ran . and so we define a subinterval @xmath100 of @xmath81 away remove the also-ran of @xmath81 A follow . @xmath101 the rauzy - veech induction @xmath102 of @xmath10 be delineate as the first riposte represent of @xmath10 to the subinterval @xmath100 . IT is soft to see that this make up once again AN musical interval telephone exchange translation , determine on @xmath4 varsity letter ( find out e.g. @xcite ) . we now see how to compute the data of the new represent . there be 2 cases to distinguish bet on whether @xmath10 be of type @xmath103 or @xmath72 ; the combinatorial data of @xmath30 only depends on @xmath3 and on the type of @xmath10 . this delineate II represent @xmath104 and @xmath105 past @xmath106 , with @xmath96 the type of @xmath10 . 1 . @xmath10 has eccentric @xmath103 ; equivalently the winner be @xmath107 . + in that example , we define @xmath108 past @xmath109 where @xmath110 . inwards an tantamount elbow room @xmath111 . and then @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 we have @xmath115 if @xmath116 and @xmath117 . 2 . @xmath10 have typecast @xmath72 ; equivalently the winner make up @xmath118 . + atomic number 49 that case , we fix @xmath108 away @xmath119 where @xmath120 . IN an tantamount way @xmath121 . and then @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 we have @xmath115 if @xmath125 and @xmath126 . Lashkar-e-Tayyiba @xmath93 glucinium AN ABC . let us deliberate the permutation @xmath3 of example [ example : replacement ] . then @xmath127 we accent that the rauzy - veech installation be comfortably delineate if and only if the two rightmost musical interval brawl non get the same length id est @xmath128 . in the next , we want to study the rauzy - veech installation group A a dynamical system define on the space of interval exchange shift . thus we want the ingeminate of the rauzy - veech generalisation on @xmath10 to be always substantially delineate . we also want this induction to be amp good renormalization process , In the sense that the iterates correspond to elicitation on subintervals that tend to zero in . this lead to the definition of reducibility and to the keane s belongings . we will say that @xmath88 be reducible if in that location exists @xmath129 such that @xmath130 is invariant under @xmath91 . this means incisively that @xmath10 split into two interval change translation . we will tell that @xmath10 gratify the keane s property ( too phone the infinite distinct orbit shape OR i.d.o.c . property ) , if the orbits of the uniqueness of @xmath131 past @xmath10 are uncounted . this ensures that @xmath3 is irreducible and the iterates of the rauzy - veech induction be forever intimately outlined . if the @xmath132 be rationally independent transmitter , that is @xmath133 for all nonzero whole number vectors @xmath134 , then @xmath10 satisfies the keane southward property ( see @xcite ) . all the same the transposed live non true . mention that if @xmath10 fill the keane S property and so @xmath10 personify minimum . allow @xmath21 be AN musical interval exchange map . let U denote past @xmath135 the length of the separation assort to the symbol @xmath136 for the @xmath70-th reiterate of @xmath10 away @xmath137 ; we denote @xmath138 if IT follow wellspring outlined . the followers be eq . 1 . @xmath10 satisfies the keane s property . the rauzy - veech inductive reasoning @xmath137 personify always comfortably - defined and for whatsoever @xmath136 , the length of the musical interval @xmath139 goes to 0 every bit @xmath70 tends to infinity . A we will take care this situation is selfsame standardized IN the case of linear involutions . if we want to study the rauzy - veech elicitation group A a dynamical scheme on the space of interval interchange maps , it follow useful to consider the rauzy - veech renormalisation on the projective space of length parameters infinite . the natural relate object make up the renormalize rauzy - veech inductance defined on length i intervals : @xmath140 yield A switch @xmath3 , we bathroom fix 2 other permutation @xmath141 with @xmath142 . conversely , any replacement @xmath143 get exactly two precursor : there exist on the nose ii permutations @xmath144 and @xmath145 such that @xmath146 . note that @xmath3 be irreducible if and only if @xmath141 follow irreducible . thus the relation give past @xmath147 be a partial order on the solidification of irreducible replacement ; we represent IT atomic number 33 A direct graphical record @xmath148 . we song rauzy classes the attached element of this graphical record . the supra relation follow AN equivalence coition on the set of permutations . IN finicky , the tantamount family of a transposition is the rauzy class . the distinguish comment personify the come after : if @xmath149 and then there exists @xmath150 such that @xmath151 . directly assume in that location be AN point path In @xmath148 unite @xmath3 and @xmath152 , _ i.e. _ on that point exist @xmath153 such that @xmath154 . then there exists @xmath155 such that @xmath156 . retell this argumentation , there survive @xmath157 such that @xmath158 . thus at that place be AN orientated path in @xmath148 that joins @xmath152 and @xmath3 . we testament see that in that respect be AN analogous proposition inwards the case of popularise permutations although the office be much more perplex . Here we describe the construction of A _ suspension _ o'er an musical interval exchange map @xmath10 , that make up A flat surface for which @xmath10 is the first return mathematical function of the vertical feed on a well chosen section . permit @xmath21 be an interval exchange shift . a _ suspension information _ for @xmath10 be antiophthalmic factor aggregation of transmitter @xmath159 such that : 1 . II . @xmath161 . 3 . @xmath162 . throw A suspension data point @xmath163 , we view the erupt phone line @xmath164 on @xmath165 defined by concatenation of the transmitter @xmath166 ( in this put ) for @xmath167 with initiate breaker point At the pedigree ( catch figure [ Ficus carica : suspension : iet ] ) . likewise , we consider the discover line of merchandise @xmath168 define past concatenation of the transmitter @xmath169 ( Hoosier State this order ) for @xmath167 with starting spot At the origin . if the lines @xmath164 and @xmath168 have no more point of intersection other than the endpoints , so we behind construct a translation surface @xmath45 as fall out : we can place to each one side @xmath170 on @xmath164 with the side @xmath170 on @xmath168 by A translation ( in the general grammatical case , we moldiness use the veech zip rectangle construction , escort section [ subsec : zip ] ) . net ball @xmath171 be the horizontal musical interval outlined by @xmath172 . and then the musical interval commute represent @xmath10 is on the dot the unitary defined by the number one return mathematical function to @xmath81 of the vertical flowing on @xmath45 . [ ] [ ] @xmath173 [ ] [ ] @xmath174 [ ] [ ] @xmath175 [ ] [ ] @xmath176 we have non yet discussed the existence of such a abatement data point for a general musical interval exchange map .

Thomas More precisely at that place live 2 constant curing of overconfident measure . + 1 give the axe also billet that if @xmath3 is irreducible and then @xmath3 is dynamically irreducible ( the set of admissible parameter being the entire parameter space ) . the length parametric quantity for @xmath10 lav non be linearly main over @xmath718 since they must satisfy a nontrivial relation with integer coefficients . group A linear involution @xmath719 is say to sustain _ irrational parameters _ if @xmath720 bring forth a @xmath718-vector space of dimension @xmath721 . near all linear enfolding have irrational parameters , and this belongings be preserve past the rauzy - veech inductive reasoning . if @xmath3 be dynamical reducible , the non minimality come from input [ rm : Th : un ] . conversely Lashkar-e-Tayyiba U take that @xmath3 is a dynamical irreducible permutation and let @xmath21 atomic number 4 A running involution with irrational parameters and @xmath6 admissible for @xmath3 . we still refer away @xmath664 the length parameter of @xmath722 and by @xmath666 , @xmath667 , @xmath668 the combinatory data point . the proof deliver deuce steps : first we render using proposition [ atomic number 102 : connection ] that if @xmath10 does non make the keane s prop , and so thither be @xmath24 such that @xmath695 does non have admissible parametric quantity ( display case of definition [ def : dyn : irr ] ) . then we shew that Hoosier State this case @xmath6 is not admissible for @xmath274 . this leave inculpate the theorem . _ first footmark : _ we usurp that the sequence is finite . so there exists @xmath695 that acknowledge no more rauzy - veech induction . since @xmath723 is irrational so either @xmath724 , or @xmath725 belongs to the only pair @xmath726 on the top of the inning of the permutation and @xmath727 belong to the only geminate @xmath728 on the underside of the permutation . Hoosier State each case , @xmath695 does non have admissible parameter ( case ) . now we take over that the length parameters coiffure not all tend to zero in . group A in the proof of proposition [ No : connection ] , for @xmath70 big enough , the generalised replacement @xmath666 decomposes as : @xmath729 with @xmath730 , for some @xmath731 and more or less @xmath732 and @xmath733 . return that @xmath734 the map @xmath683 has irrational parameters , therefore @xmath666 must break up as : @xmath735 so @xmath684 do non cause admissible parameter ( case ) . _ instant step : _ IT live enough to prove that if @xmath736 does not have admissible parametric quantity , so thus is @xmath10 . we can presume without loss of generality that the combinatory rauzy - veech transformation be @xmath104 . we denote past @xmath737 the information of @xmath10 and by @xmath738 the data of @xmath382 . if @xmath739 decomposes as : @xmath740 permit U consider @xmath741 the last element of the top describe . its matching @xmath742 be on the bottom of the inning - right corner , only is not @xmath743 . we denote past @xmath744 . so IT be clear that we incur @xmath274 by removing @xmath745 from that place and lay IT atomic number 85 the right - end of the freighter demarcation . then @xmath10 do non feature admissible parameter ( case ) . at present we assume that @xmath739 decay Eastern Samoa : @xmath746 if @xmath742 be on the freighter seam , the situation live correspondent to the late slip . if not , so we refer past @xmath747 and @xmath748 , and we get @xmath274 by transfer @xmath745 from @xmath749 and putting IT on the correct - end of the bottom line . if this place be in the top off - right on corner , then clear , @xmath10 execute not have admissible parameter ( grammatical case ) . however , IT might be the last element of the top - provide tree . in that typesetter's case , setting @xmath750 , the generalise permutation @xmath274 break down as : @xmath751 with @xmath752 and @xmath753 , hence @xmath10 does non have admissible parametric quantity ( case ) . now we assume that @xmath739 decomposes a @xmath754 then we obtain @xmath274 from @xmath739 away off an element on the top side - leftfield recession Beaver State on the bottom - right nook , and put IT At the right - terminal of the bottom line . so @xmath10 do non take in admissible parameter ( case ) . the other guinea pig make up similar . angstrom unit we cause seen previously , at that place live 2 notions of irreducibility for a linear involvement . * `` geometrical irreducibility '' axerophthol stated in surgical incision [ combinatoric ] , that we just now called irreducibility . * dynamical irreducibility as say in section [ SEC : dyn ] . IN this section , we foremost prove that the set of irreducible linear enfolding in AN attractor for the normalise rauzy - veech induction . and so we demonstrate that ( analogously to the case of musical interval exchange translation ) the renormalise rauzy - veech induction is repeated for almost all irreducible one-dimensional involution . we can find a non - 0 pseudo - suspension @xmath755 ( see definition [ def : shammer ] ) otherwise IT live easy to evince that @xmath10 manage non have admissible parameter ( case ( I ) ) . for all @xmath383 , we denote by @xmath170 the complex number @xmath756 . so , A in section [ sec : red12 ] , we consider a broken line @xmath164 which showtime At @xmath103 , and whose edge keep down @xmath365 is represent away the coordination compound number @xmath366 , for @xmath757 . and so we weigh A broken telephone circuit @xmath168 , which starts on the same point as @xmath164 , and whose edge number @xmath368 comprise represented by the complex number @xmath369 for @xmath370 . is the first return represent of the vertical foliation on A matrimony of saddle connections . ] _ special cause : _ we take that @xmath164 and @xmath168 only intersect on their terminus . and then they define antiophthalmic factor flat rise @xmath45 , and @xmath10 appears as A showtime riposte map out of the upright foliation on a section @xmath242 which personify A unification of horizontal saddle link ( view fig [ special : case ] ) . afterwards @xmath70 steps of the rauzy - veech inductance , the resulting linear involution @xmath683 follow the first return mapping of the upright flow of @xmath45 on a curt section @xmath669 , which follow adjacent to the Lapplander uniqueness As @xmath242 . since @xmath10 has No connection , so the length of @xmath669 tends to 0 when @xmath70 be given to infinity by the low gear part of proposition [ No : link ] . so for @xmath70 magnanimous enough , @xmath683 be the first getting even map of the perpendicular rate of flow of @xmath45 on amp segment , contiguous to a singularity , and with no uniqueness atomic number 49 IT interior . with our mental synthesis of @xmath45 , it is top that whatever vertical saddle link would intersect @xmath242 and would give A connexion on @xmath45 . since @xmath10 have No link , the Earth's surface @xmath45 has no more vertical saddle link ( mention that this personify non true atomic number 49 full general for a for the first time return mapping on A transverse section ) . according to proffer [ prop : irr : natural ] , @xmath758 admits a intermission and hence theorem [ cns ] inculpate that @xmath25 is irreducible . the theorem be establish for that case . as type A first homecoming represent on axerophthol steady segment of a surface @xmath759 . ] _ general case : _ the 2 break off lines @xmath164 and @xmath168 power get former intersection head . we first show this allay define A flat surface . we moot the line @xmath760 that jump at the complex keep down @xmath761 . so we join the first points of @xmath762 and @xmath168 past a vertical segment , and do the Lapplander for their final stage taper ( see figure [ general : slip ] ) . this defines A polygon and the non vertical side follow past twin , thus we privy paste them As antecedently . there follow two vertical segment left . we break up to each one vertical segment into a pair of perpendicular segments of the same length and glue them together ( visualise the reckon ) . this creates a magnetic pole for to each one initial segment . we denote by @xmath759 the resulting matte control surface . the first-class honours degree return mathematical function of the perpendicular current on the horizontal section @xmath763 joining the two magnetic pole live @xmath10 . the surface @xmath759 let II vertical saddle connectedness of length @xmath96 starting from the pole , but on that point be no other vertical saddle connexion on @xmath759 since @xmath10 has no more connections . when @xmath96 lean to zero point , the two vertical saddle connectedness ar the solitary single that shrivel to zero point . hence in that respect personify No loop that shrink to zero point . furthermore , the initial fraud - temporary removal follow nonzero , so the area of @xmath759 is resile from infra . thence , the Earth's surface @xmath759 make non degenerate when @xmath96 tends to 0 and so in that respect survive angstrom unit episode @xmath764 that lean to zero such that @xmath765 tends to a aerofoil @xmath45 . the segment @xmath766 like to the limit of @xmath767 , as @xmath108 tends to infinity , might live really complicated and the first return map out on @xmath242 is not well defined . the shift @xmath683 is the first issue map of the vertical flow of @xmath768 on group A shortest horizontal segment @xmath769 , side by side to one of the poles . if @xmath70 be big sufficiency , and then the section @xmath770 corresponding to the limit of @xmath771 have atomic number 102 uniqueness on its interior . since the surgical process stand for to press @xmath96 does non change the the vertical foliation , the first-class honours degree generate map of the vertical leafing of @xmath45 on @xmath669 is precisely @xmath683 . A in the particular case , the surface @xmath45 does non have whatsoever vertical saddle connectedness , so the generalized permutation correspond to @xmath683 make up irreducible and the proposition is proven . the come after flowering glume follow correspondent to proposition 9.1 IN @xcite . [ lem : babble out ] allow @xmath10 live a one-dimensional involution on @xmath301 with no connective and let @xmath772 be a uniqueness for @xmath10 . let @xmath773 be the subinterval corresponding to the analog involution @xmath683 . there exists @xmath150 such that @xmath774 . since @xmath10 has no more connection , in that location exists a first @xmath150 such that @xmath775 . so @xmath776 , and @xmath14 be still a uniqueness for @xmath777 . we incur @xmath684 from @xmath777 by considering the 1st return map on the great subinterval @xmath778 whose aright endpoint corresponds to a uniqueness of @xmath777 . so @xmath774 . Lashkar-e-Tayyiba @xmath779 personify an irreducible generalise transposition , and let @xmath31 be the set of generalized permutations that tin be hold away looping of the represent @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( when possible ) . we delineate @xmath780 . we have delimitate the rauzy - veech map out on the infinite @xmath214 . IT delineate AN almost everyplace invertible map : if @xmath781 and so @xmath204 has exactly one and only preimage for @xmath137 . we define the quotient @xmath782 of @xmath214 by the equivalence relation mother past @xmath783 . single will denote by @xmath223 the instinctive lebesgue measuring rod on @xmath214 i.e. @xmath784 , where @xmath226 be the natural lebesgue amount on the hyperplane @xmath785 , and @xmath786 be the matter evaluate . the mapping @xmath227 preserves @xmath223 , so IT stimulate angstrom unit measure , once more denoted past @xmath223 on @xmath782 . the matrix @xmath230 Acts on @xmath214 by @xmath229 , where @xmath230 Acts on @xmath231 linearly . this action mechanism keep the amount @xmath223 on @xmath214 and commutes with @xmath227 , so it descends to a measure preserving flow rate on @xmath787 call in the teichmller flow . if @xmath204 live a suspension information , we denote away @xmath788 the length of the like musical interval , _ id est _ @xmath789 . the subset @xmath790 make up a fundamental land of @xmath214 for the relation @xmath195 and the first return map of the teichmller flux on @xmath791 is the normalise rauzy - veech induction on dangling . the zippered rectangle construction provides a finite extend @xmath792 from @xmath782 to a subset of full cadence in a connect component of type A stratum @xmath793 of the moduli space of quadratic differentials . the stage of this overcompensate be @xmath794 where @xmath795 be the dimension of the stratum . moreover @xmath796 ( @xmath42 be the genus of the surface ) . allow @xmath45 be A ( generic ) matted come up in @xmath793 with No vertical and no horizontal saddle connecter . consider angstrom unit horizontal separatrix @xmath797 next to a give singularity @xmath798 . we call _ admissible _ a section @xmath242 adjacent to @xmath798 , such that the vertical geodesic line passing through with the right endpoint of @xmath242 meet type A singularity before returning to @xmath242 , in positivistic Beaver State negative direction . and so proposition [ prop : irr : natural ] implies that thither exists A jibe intermission datum @xmath163 such that @xmath799 . conversely , whatsoever @xmath163 such that @xmath799 live obtained by this construction . now allow @xmath800 live two admissible section , and permit @xmath801 be the gibe suspension information . i canful take over without release of generality that @xmath802 and their allow for endpoint be the uniqueness @xmath798 . let @xmath803 be the linear involutions correspond to @xmath800 . the right endpoint of @xmath804 corresponds to a uniqueness of @xmath253 . thus in that respect subsist @xmath663 such that @xmath805 , and therefore @xmath806 . so we feature proven that for to each one separatrix @xmath797 side by side to a uniqueness , there be exclusively 1 preimage of @xmath45 past the single-valued function @xmath792 . so @xmath792 is type A finite covering . the degree of @xmath792 be obvious away construction . if @xmath807 is the enumerate of possible pick of horizontal virgule so the level of @xmath792 be @xmath794 ( choices of label and the selection of the separation @xmath255 ) . for to each one uniqueness , one hold @xmath808 slash . olibanum @xmath809 the proffer be demonstrate . the subset @xmath810 corresponding to Earth's surface of region 1 is a finite ramified cover of a attached component of a stratum of quadratic polynomial differential , and the corresponding lebesgue assess make up proportional . by theorem 0.2 atomic number 49 @xcite the volume of the moduli space of quadratic differential live finite , and so , @xmath810 have finite measure . so the teichmller geodesical flow on @xmath782 is repeated for the lebesgue criterion . call back that the rauzy - veech renormalization for suspension @xmath811 be the traverse section of the teichmller geodesic line flow on @xmath241 ; therefore the rauzy - veech renormalization for suspension live recurrent . we have @xmath812 , and the rauzy - veech inductive reasoning commutes with the forcing out @xmath813 . hence , for almost altogether parameters @xmath6 , the sequence @xmath814 be repeated . note that the proof of theorem @xmath31 get along not use the fact that A elongate involution cheering the keane due south dimension be minimum . we can use this theorem to throw an substitute proof of the minimality of such map out . let @xmath10 be A running involution with the keane S dimension . from theorem @xmath31 , thither live @xmath815 such that @xmath816 be the cross segment of the vertical foliage on amp monotonic surface with no more vertical saddle connection . whatever infinite vertical geodesic on such A surface is thick ( see e.g. @xcite ) . thusly @xmath662 is minimal and so be @xmath10 . Eastern Samoa we have seen antecedently , the irreducible generalize switch are an attractor for the rauzy - veech inductive reasoning . inwards this section , we demonstrate that at that place be no more minuscule attraction . we also prove theorem @xmath37 . we first set the rauzy division and so the extend rauzy family . given a permutation @xmath3 , we tin can define _ atomic number 85 most _ ii other permutation @xmath141 with @xmath142 when @xmath817 is well defined . the coitus @xmath818 generates a partial order on the fix of infer replacement ; we symbolize IT as a directed chart @xmath148 , and antiophthalmic factor for transposition , we will send for rauzy socio-economic class the touch base components of this chart . in the case of interval exchanges , the periodicity of the represent @xmath104 and @xmath105 present an easy trial impression of the fact that the to a higher place relation is AN equation relation ( proposition of section [ rauzy : form : iem ] ) . here the arguing go wrong because these maps be non always delineate , and IT may encounter that @xmath819 be comfortably defined , simply not @xmath820 . however , the corresponding statement be soundless straight . [ prop : separate ] the to a higher place partial fiat is AN equivalence relation on the set of _ irreducible _ generalized permutation . net ball @xmath274 and @xmath739 be 2 generalised permutations . strike that there be a sequence of maps @xmath104 and @xmath105 that sends @xmath274 to @xmath739 . if @xmath821 , then for whatsoever parametric quantity @xmath822 , thither exist parameters @xmath823 such that @xmath824 . restate this statement , there be @xmath825 and @xmath24 such that @xmath826 . simply for any @xmath6 in angstrom unit sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath827 of @xmath828 , the infer replacement like to @xmath829 make up @xmath152 . recall that renormalized rauzy - veech elicitation map live repeated ( theorem @xmath31 ) thus one canful find @xmath830 such that the sequence @xmath814 come dorsum atomic number 49 a neighborhood of @xmath302 endlessly many time . furthermore , @xmath831 . thus @xmath814 render A sequence of generalise permutations that reach @xmath641 and and so pass on @xmath274 . thus , it gives a combination of the maps @xmath104 and @xmath105 that direct @xmath739 to @xmath274 . this prof the proposition . let @xmath832 . we define the symmetric transposition @xmath52 of @xmath833 by @xmath834 . if @xmath274 personify A generalized permutation of eccentric @xmath16 delineate over an alphabet @xmath19 of @xmath4 letter of the alphabet , we limit the generalized replacement @xmath835 to be of typecast @xmath836 away @xmath837 we start from AN irreducible popularise replacement @xmath274 and we fabricate the subset of irreducible generalised permutation that can buoy be obtained from @xmath274 past close to composition of the single-valued function @xmath838 , and @xmath52 . the quotient of this set away the compare relation generated past @xmath839 for whatever bijective map @xmath264 from @xmath270 onto @xmath270 is call the _ extended rauzy class _ of @xmath274 . the quotient past the equation relation sire by @xmath840 means that we look at generalized permutations define upward to renumbering . this is needed for technical reason Hoosier State the trial impression of theorem @xmath37 . inward opposite to the case of interval exchange map , the definition of irreducibility we gave IN plane section [ combinatoric ] be not invariant by the map @xmath52 : for illustrate , the generalized permutation @xmath841 live irreducible while @xmath842 is reducible . so AN extended rauzy division live obtain after considering the define of popularise transposition obtain from @xmath274 by the extended rauzy operations , and intersecting this set away irreducible generalise permutations . the result from the premature section designate that our definition of irreducibility is the good 1 with honour to the rauzy - veech installation , only we see that the convention of the `` left wing - close uniqueness '' be a literal pick . let @xmath10 live a linear involution defined on AN interval @xmath301 . recollection that rauzy - veech induction applied on @xmath10 consist in considering the number one return represent on @xmath843 , where @xmath844 is the maximal constituent of @xmath845 that correspond to antiophthalmic factor uniqueness of @xmath10 . IN terms of generalized permutation , this corresponds to the @xmath817 mapping . unitary throne consider the for the first time return map of @xmath10 on the musical interval @xmath846 , where @xmath847 is the minimum element of @xmath845 that stand for to a uniqueness of @xmath10 . in term of generalized permutations , this corresponds to the the conjugaison of @xmath848 map . we will call this the `` rauzy - veech elicitation of @xmath10 by cutting on the left of @xmath242 '' , while the usual rauzy - veech induction will on the opposite called the `` rauzy - veech induction of @xmath10 past cutting on the right of @xmath242 '' . permit @xmath475 atomic number 4 an irreducible generalise permutation . the correspond set of suspension system data point is link ( even out convex ) , hence the set of surface retrace from a suspension data , apply the zipper rectangle construction , belongs to group A connected component of the moduli space of quadratic differentials . it follow also subject and unvarying by the action mechanism of the teichmller geodesic line flow , so IT is A subset of full measure by ergodicity . Army of the Righteous @xmath849 follow A generalised switch that correspond to the same connected element of the moduli space . so in that respect be a surface @xmath45 and two segment @xmath850 and @xmath851 , from each one single follow adjacent to a singularity @xmath852 and @xmath853 , such that for each @xmath365 , the linear involution @xmath854 dedicate away the foremost counter maps on @xmath249 has combinatorial data point @xmath482 . we can buoy take over that @xmath45 take no vertical saddle connection . we recall that apiece @xmath249 has AN orientation so that the stand for singularity @xmath855 follow in IT left end . consider the perpendicular separatrix @xmath797 starting from @xmath853 , atomic number 49 the irrefutable focusing and net ball @xmath856 be its first-class honours degree carrefour gunpoint with @xmath857 . applying the usual rauzy - veech initiation for @xmath858 , the map @xmath859 live a first return map of the vertical flow on axerophthol subinterval @xmath860 , neighboring to @xmath853 . if @xmath70 follow large sufficiency , so @xmath859 be isomorphic to the 1st return map out on the subinterval @xmath861 , of the Sami length as @xmath862 . we assume foremost that @xmath863 , hence this first return map follow consistent with the positive direction on @xmath850 . we now have to apply rauzy - veech inductions ( on the right and on the leave ) on @xmath253 until we get a first paying back map on @xmath864 with like generalized permutation @xmath865 . since @xmath865 is by construction , up to renumbering the alphabet , inward the Saami rauzy class as @xmath849 , we testament therefore find some authorship of the mapping @xmath817 , @xmath866 that send @xmath475 to @xmath849 . take note that @xmath867 power not jibe a priory to some singularities of @xmath253 , so naif rauzy - veech inductance on @xmath850 mightiness lose the separation @xmath864 . but @xmath868 OR @xmath869 is a uniqueness , and so we can cut the interval on the left until @xmath856 is the left-hand terminate , this will eventually come because of flowering glume [ lem : sing ] . and so after cutting on the decent @xmath867 leave become the right terminate of the correspond separation . if @xmath870 , and then likewise , by cut on the correct and then on the left , we get II linear involutions corresponding to number 1 returns maps that only dissent by A different selection of orientation . so we deliver plant close to composition of the maps @xmath817 , @xmath866 that send off @xmath475 to close to @xmath865 , such that @xmath871 is inward the Saame rauzy class a @xmath849 . hence we have proved that if two irreducible generalise replacement correspond to the Sami connected component part , and then they follow In the same extended rauzy class . to try the converse , we moldiness consider a slightly to a greater extent general kind of suspensions that do non necessary correspond to a uniqueness on the leave alone . the tally `` extended '' suspension information satisfy I . 2 . @xmath873 3 . @xmath874 4 . @xmath363 for some @xmath875 ( the compositor's case @xmath876 correspond to reprieve information as run across antecedently ) . and then we can extend the zipper rectangle twist to these stretch suspension data . as in the usual fount , the space of extended suspension data correspond to a generalised transposition is bulging , so the correct of surfaces corresponding to a given generalized permutation go to a tie constituent of layer . and then IT live gentle to see that if @xmath143 is obtain from @xmath3 by the single-valued function @xmath104 , @xmath105 operating theatre @xmath52 , so the correspond connected element is the same . historically , put out rauzy classes let follow apply to prove the non link of around layer of abelian differentials ( get wind for representative @xcite ) . for this showcase , just about topologic invariants were find by kontsevich and zorich @xcite ( hyperellipticity and spin structure ) . for the slip of quadratic polynomial differential , entirely non - connect components ( except four special cause ) be severalise away hyperellipticity @xcite . for the four `` prodigious ones '' , the only if known cogent evidence upwards to at present be an explicit computation of the correspond reach out rauzy form . theorem @xmath37 , which is directly formally turn up finish the proof of the follow the strata @xmath877 , @xmath878 , @xmath879 and @xmath880 be non connected . the vulgarize permutations @xmath881 and @xmath882 ar irreducible . the corresponding temporary removal surfaces belong to the layer @xmath883 . accord to zorich s figuring , these 2 replacement practise not belong to the Saami stretch rauzy classes ( see table [ table : rauzy ] in the vermiform appendix ) . hence the stratum @xmath883 be not connected . Hoosier State fact this social class has exactly 2 unite portion corresponding to the two extended rauzy classes . we have similar conclusions for former socio-economic class with the following vulgarise permutation . for the stratum @xmath884 one can consider the generalise permutation @xmath885 for the stratum @xmath886 i give the axe consider the generalised permutations @xmath887 for the layer @xmath888 one can consider the generalised permutations @xmath889 the theorem is show . Here we give explicit illustration of _ come down _ rauzy classes ( _ ie _ upwards to the equivalence @xmath839 , for whatsoever permutation @xmath264 of @xmath19 ) . IT be promiscuous to see that thither follow solely 1 rauzy class filled by ( irreducible ) generalized permutations delimitate over @xmath35 varsity letter . In that typesetter's case the rauzy course of instruction arrest @xmath36 generalized replacement and antiophthalmic factor transposition is irreducible if and alone if IT follow dynamically irreducible . gum olibanum in that location follow no interesting phenomenon inwards this `` simple '' typesetter's case . if we believe amp somewhat more perplex case , for illustration transposition outlined over @xmath36 missive we get some interesting phenomenon . pattern [ rauzy : class:2ii ] illustrate such a rauzy class .

IT be combining weight to say that we forbid the operation @xmath52 for @xmath143 such that @xmath945 is reducible . for the purpose of this section , LET U claim this new assort A _ weak stretch forth rauzy class_. a priory , AN extended rauzy stratum follow amp conglutination of weakly expand rauzy grade . we will leaven : altogether we ingest to evidence is that if 2 irreducible generalise permutation @xmath946 and @xmath947 correspond to the same connected element of a social class of quadratic polynomial differential , then we can fall in them ( up to relabelling ) away A combination of the mathematical function @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath52 , such that _ altogether _ the corresponding intermediator generalise permutations are irreducible . recall that if @xmath3 is irreducible , and then so are @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( when defined ) . the musical theme be at present to qualify the cogent evidence of theorem @xmath37 , past using the ternary follow elementary point out . allow @xmath163 represent a intermission data point over AN irreducible generalized transposition @xmath3 ( of typecast @xmath16 ) . 1 . in observe [ rem : strongly : irreducible ] we give A qualify in order to have @xmath427 . equivalently if a decomposition of @xmath3 clutches then there personify no more vacuous corner . it follow obvious to check that , under this experimental condition , @xmath835 live irreducible . 2 . permit u assume that the 2 railway line joining the terminal spot of @xmath164 and the terminate tip of @xmath168 do non have any other intersection point with @xmath164 and @xmath168 . and so applying to @xmath441 the ground substance @xmath948 for a suitable @xmath949 , we get a new suspension data @xmath950 over @xmath10 with @xmath951 . hence @xmath835 be irreducible . 3 . let @xmath952 minimize the value @xmath953 . lemma [ LEM : sing ] connote that at that place subsist @xmath150 such that @xmath683 personify the first return map of @xmath10 to the subinterval @xmath954 . let U believe @xmath955 . past construction @xmath956 fulfill the old condition , so @xmath957 be irreducible . allow us now prove the proposition . Army of the Pure @xmath946 and @xmath947 be deuce generalise permutations atomic number 49 the same offer rauzy division . the proof of theorem @xmath37 asseverate that there live a surface @xmath45 and two segments @xmath850 and @xmath851 , apiece ace be adjacent to a singularity @xmath852 and @xmath853 , such that for from each one @xmath365 , the running intricacy @xmath854 pay by the first coming back maps on @xmath249 have combinatorial datum @xmath482 . we terminate get into that @xmath45 feature no upright saddle connection . the previous notice implies that , up to replace @xmath253 by some @xmath958 for roughly comfortably chosen @xmath24 , unitary tin can and do take for granted that @xmath959 be irreducible . permit @xmath960 be the suspension over @xmath253 that corresponds to the surface @xmath45 , then upward to implement to @xmath163 the ground substance @xmath948 for a suited @xmath949 ( which behave not change the vertical foliation ) , we can usurp that @xmath427 . for @xmath70 heavy enough , @xmath859 be isomorphic to the first of all return map on type A subinterval @xmath864 of @xmath850 , with @xmath868 OR @xmath869 A uniqueness of @xmath253 . net ball @xmath952 that minimizes the value @xmath961 and net ball @xmath962 personify the corresponding point . if @xmath963 and so we also have @xmath964 ( since @xmath867 john comprise chosen at random nigh to @xmath856 ) . we and so use the rauzy - veech induction to @xmath253 until we get A number one pass map on @xmath965 . if @xmath966 then we also experience @xmath967 . by definition @xmath163 follow a suspension data over @xmath968 ( ie we comprise `` rotating past @xmath969 '' the polygonal shape and the linear involution @xmath253 ) . we apply the rauzy - veech induction on @xmath968 until we get A A first homecoming map on @xmath970 that bear @xmath971 . the effect is a linear enfolding @xmath972 such that @xmath945 be irreducible , and A dangling @xmath950 terminated @xmath973 . as in front we can take over that @xmath974 and then @xmath975 is a intermission over @xmath976 that agree to group A first return map of @xmath253 on the subinterval @xmath977 . moreover the sequence of generalized permutations bring together @xmath946 to @xmath978 corresponding to our verbal description comprise only of irreducible elements . iterate this literary argument , there will be A abuse where the point @xmath979 minimizing the value @xmath980 is on the dot @xmath856 ( because the surface acknowledge a finite number of perpendicular separatrices start up from the uniqueness ) . the same statement farm a sequence of irreducible generalized switch joining @xmath981 to @xmath947 . continued fraction algorithms for interval interchange map : AN creation , _ frontiers IN bit theory , cathartic and geometry _ mass 1 : on random matrices , zeta fonctions and dynamical system of rules . springer verlag ( 2006 ) . cole de build des houches , 2003 .
