even kakutani comparability live i of the most natural lesson in the theory of restricted orbit comparability of ergodic and finite measure preserving dynamical systems . in this paper we study fifty-fifty kakutani comparability in the nearly uninterrupted category . A nearly uninterrupted dynamical system make up give way by a triple @xmath13 , where @xmath2 be a smooth space , @xmath14 is a borel chance measure on @xmath2 , and @xmath15 be AN ergodic metre keep homeomorphism . call back that a measurable orbit equivalence 'tween 2 such systems @xmath13 and @xmath16 be AN invertible , atomic number 83 - mensurable , and valuate carry on map out @xmath17 that post revolve to field . a mensurable orbit equivalence @xmath18 be a _ intimately uninterrupted field compare _ if there subsist unvarying and @xmath11 subsets @xmath19 and @xmath20 of full amount and then that @xmath21 comprise A homeomorphism . the first result inwards this category is the lionise theorem of keane and smorodinsky @xcite that any 2 Johann Bernoulli shifts of equalize selective information be finitarily isomorphic , namely , that the isomorphy betwixt them can buoy be made a homeomorphism most everywhere . In antiophthalmic factor later report , denker and keane @xcite shew a general fabric for consider measure preserve scheme that likewise preserves antiophthalmic factor topologic body structure . we touch the reader to A paper by del snowbird , rudolph , and weiss @xcite for a more than gross account of the surface area . we only cite Here that interest group inward the celestial orbit comparability possibility for this category follow to a greater extent of late revived by the work of hamachi and keane in @xcite where they proven that the binary and 3 odometers be nearly ceaselessly celestial orbit equivalent . their work inspired similar results for other brace of examples ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . these examples were later colligate A special case of a dyestuff atomic number 16 theorem inwards this family proved past del junco and ahin @xcite . around the Sami time as a near continuous dye S theorem was set up , del snowbird , rudolph , and weiss turn up in @xcite that if peerless behave non impose the specify that the unvarying go down of full measure on which the electron orbit equivalence is angstrom unit homeomorphism be @xmath11 set , then any qualified cranial orbit equivalence classification is exactly the Same as inward the cadence theoretic pillowcase . in specific , they showed that any celestial orbit comparability can be regularized to be a homeomorphism on a solidification of wide-cut measure , simply could non prove that the situated of total measuring make any topologic structure . the grandness of the topologic construction in the possibility be yet Sir Thomas More prominent for the study of even kakutani equivalence . withdraw that inwards the mensurable category two ergodic and finite assess preserve system of rules @xmath13 and @xmath16 are even kakutani equivalent weight if in that location exists a measurable revolve comparability @xmath22 , and mensurable set up @xmath23 with @xmath24 with the prop that @xmath25 be a mensurable isomorphy of the get translation @xmath7 and @xmath26 . we call the range equivalence @xmath6 AN _ even kakutani equivalence _ between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . IT follows from @xcite that any eventide kakutani par can follow create to be A homeomorphism on group A set of full measure . in the Same paper they show that if ane imposes the additional check that the sets @xmath12 and @xmath27 comprise _ intimately clopen _ , meaning within A set of step zero in of AN open exercise set and likewise of A shut set , and so there be type A new constant for even kakutani comparability of near continuous dynamical system of rules telephone _ nigh unique ergodicity_. they use this New unvarying to show that nearly uninterrupted fifty-fifty kakutani comparability follow warm than measure theoretic regular kakutani equivalence . the model they retrace be , in some sense , not natural , and begs the question whether there are any natural examples of nearly uninterrupted system of rules that be measurably equally kakutani equivalent but non most ceaselessly so . rudolph began face for example in the family of zero point entropy slackly bernoulli system . call back that whatever two zero S generally James Bernoulli translation be measurably yet kakutani combining weight . furthermore , many natural examples of almost uninterrupted system of rules including rotary motion , all adding political machine , and in fact all finite rank transformations , are loosely Daniel Bernoulli . in @xcite , roychowdhury and rudolph proven that any ii adding simple machine are nearly incessantly regular kakutani equivalent . shortly later on , dykstra and rudolph showed inwards @xcite that altogether irrational rotations personify nearly continuously kakutani tantamount to the double star odometer . IN @xcite , freshly machinery , called _ templates _ , Evergreen State infix to build the well-nigh uninterrupted kakutani par . in that location , templates be defined use the natural topologic tower structure present In append simple machine . the mental synthesis in @xcite exhibit that the templet machinery tin be adapted to the case where the underlying system does not feature A canonical symbolical construction . Sir Thomas More of late , springing cow @xcite expanded on their thought and accommodate guide further to prove that all minimum isometries of compact metric blank personify almost unceasingly kakutani equivalent weight to the binary mileometer . salvi @xcite adapted templates to the set of @xmath28 action and habituate the machinery to prove rudolph entropy two - step coding theorem in the intimately continuous category . from each one result mentioned above have expect more sophisticated and technically intricate incarnation of guide . on the other hand apiece proof get as well established the usefulness and flexibility of the machinery . in this newspaper publisher we adapt the template machinery regular farther to show up our main ensue : the international Morse code minimum scheme be intimately continuously fifty-fifty kakutani equivalent to the binary program hodometer . the version of the guide machinery IN this paper be plan to turn to the young ramification of the additional tower present in the rank 2 morse scheme . we consider the generality we render hither be the appropriate start place to prove Sir Thomas More mostly that finite outrank nearly continuous organization be all intimately incessantly kakutani tantamount to the double star hodometer . finally we note that this holograph follow antiophthalmic factor closing of work that the first author start in 2009 spell he be a station - doctoral swain working with daniel rudolph at colorado state university . the initial architecture of the twist and the main thought were totally constituted collaboratively away dykstra and rudolph . the second author joined the projection after the untimely last of rudolph In 2010 , and the ms personify discharge in 2014 . in this section , give in some formal definitions until later , we yield an overview of the construction and introduce templates . Lashkar-e-Tayyiba @xmath29 refer the international Morse code minimum system and @xmath30 the double star odometer . recall that each system has antiophthalmic factor canonical elaborate , return succession of clopen sectionalisation that be give by the finite rank structure of from each one system of rules . the Samuel Finley Breese Morse system is outrank ii , so at for each one stage the partition be delineate by angstrom unit geminate of tower . the hodometer be outrank unmatchable , so the episode of partition off be define past a sequence of single predominate . the construction of the orbit equivalence habituate an inducive back and forthprocedure . intuitively , at each stage we need to retrace A set represent from the levels of the tower of one system to the levels of the tower of the former system of rules , switching the domain and range of the set map out atomic number 85 to each one stage . the electron orbit equivalence testament be defined on the set of tip for which our procedure will meet . Hoosier State order for this set to be A @xmath11 set , and the represent to be antiophthalmic factor homeomorphism , for each percentage point where we experience convergency we penury to have the procedure stabilize afterwards group A finite number of footstep . in other words , in one case we have delineate the set represent at a particular stage @xmath31 , we can non modify IT knowledge base atomic number 85 whatever successive microscope stage . this introduce an obvious ramification in the building . At A particular proposition arrange @xmath31 , we have to know that our choice of the position map on leg @xmath31 hulk will be logical with the pick that we testament make for totally stage later . to address this tortuousness , informally speech production , we do not really prefer a particular solidifying map out atomic number 85 whatever stage . instead , at to each one stage we construct a collection of lot maps that be possible extensions of old stage set maps , and that completely accord on A set we telephone _ the good set_. the convergency then depend on us be able to provide enough alternative At each stage @xmath31 so that IT make up possible to construct sufficiently many choices of map out atomic number 85 microscope stage @xmath32 that stretch the @xmath31-stage map out . guide are a combinatorial tool around that make been designed to alleviate the intensive leger keeping require to key such antiophthalmic factor function . officially , _ templet _ be AN regularize multiset . for deterrent example , the multiset @xmath33 , together with the ordering @xmath34 , gives A template @xmath35 , which we drop a line as @xmath36 the constituent of a guide ( with multiplicity ) follow call off _ levels_. in our work , to each one level of A templet will correspond to a clopen set that follow A level of a tower . Hoosier State picky , the tower themselves throne be opine of as templet where from each one level appears exactly once and the order on the level represent exactly the consecrate on the lot that represent impose by the underlying kinetics . mark that type A set map out from ane tug to some other crapper be cogitate of as type A ray - enjoin of the point of the domain tower concord to the stratum that they live be represent to in the image towboat . we replace the notion of a pose mathematical function with map out between templet , where the Re - ordination be non described by the mapping , simply rather the order apply past the image template . to a greater extent officially , given guide @xmath35 and @xmath37 , written @xmath38 we _ represent _ @xmath35 and @xmath37 with the intervals @xmath39 \subset { \mathbb z}\hspace{1 Cm } \mbox{and } \hspace{1 Cm } j = [ 0 , 1 , \ldots , M-1 rifle ] \subset { \mathbb z}\ ] ] via the correspondences @xmath40 and @xmath41 . a _ partial separation bijection _ be AN ordered quintuple @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 be around bijection . this view allows for AN explicit combinatory empathise of how many mathematical function want to be fix at from each one microscope stage In set up to construct maps At later leg , on larger domains . IT also allows for AN expressed combinatorial verbal description of how map from one stage be constructed from maps of A old stage , so IT be easy to prove that the construction have so stabilized for taper on a @xmath11 set of full measure . in our test copy we will construct AN increasing sequence @xmath46 , guide for for each one scheme and partial interval bijections 'tween template put that make the back and forth " plot given in see [ thefigure ] below . the objects Hoosier State the plot be template put . the guide set on the leave ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) go to the Samuel Morse minimum organisation , while those on the decently ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) belong to the double star odometer . the maps @xmath55 be partial separation bijections . type A key element of the plot is its _ almost commutative _ nature , type A introduce by roychowdhury and rudolph Hoosier State @xcite . interpreting the grade of templates as stage of hulk that form type A refining sequence of divider , we insure that every level at leg @xmath31 of a pillar be A subset of A level from a late stage guide , and the maps @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the cancel comprehension maps . the consistence of set represent from one level to some other is reach by ask that on the good band , completely partial tone interval bijections agree when compile with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . thither be two key difference our work hither and that of @xcite surgery @xcite atomic number 49 how we use of goods and services templates from a particular proposition stage to retrace late stage guide . in exceptional , we can buoy not use the whim of concatenation type A follow defined IN the earlier paper , instead we delineate _ lapping concatenations_. in addition , to accommodate the combinatoric structure of the towers of the Samuel Finley Breese Morse minimal system we introduce a young mob of partial tone musical interval bijections prognosticate _ reordering maps_. one time the diagram follow built up , nevertheless , the parameter that it produces a intimately - define nearly uninterrupted kakutani compare make up nearly identical to the arguments in both @xcite and @xcite . we let in IT here for completeness ( take care plane section [ convergenceofpibs ] and [ kakequivalence ] ) . it is our hope that one daylight we power find amp more universal machine that could characterize unspecific classes of systems , mayhap still entirely zero entropy slackly Johann Bernoulli system . just at the moment IT live not clear how such type A machine , if single exists , could follow sufficiently full general to write up for the differences 'tween systems . the paper is orchestrate as follow : discussion section [ overview ] : : we delineate the tool for retrace guide and partial interval bijections that we will usance throughout the twist . plane section [ morsepreliminaries ] - [ binarypreliminaries ] : : we give way preliminary definitions of the Samuel F.
