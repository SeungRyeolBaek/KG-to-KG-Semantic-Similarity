group A In our late analytic thinking of run 1a information @xcite , we lead a general search for new particles with group A narrow raw width that decomposition to dijets . Hoosier State addition , we look for for the follow subatomic particle summarise in fig . [ fig_particles ] : axigluons @xcite from chiral QCD ( @xmath7 ) , charge tell @xcite of composite quark ( @xmath8 ) , gloss octet technirhos @xcite ( @xmath9 ) , new gauge bosons ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) , and scalar @xmath12 diquarks @xcite ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . using four induction from run for 1a and 1b , we combine dijet aggregative spectra higher up A mass of 150 gev / c@xmath1 , 241 gev / c@xmath1 , 292 gev / c@xmath1 , and 388 gev / c@xmath1 with integrated brightness level of = 7.5 atomic number 49 = 3.3 inward = 3.3 in .089 pb@xmath0 , 1.92 pb@xmath0 , 9.52 pb@xmath0 , and 69.8 pb@xmath0 severally . jet plane ar delimitate with angstrom unit fixed strobile clustering algorithm ( r=0.7 ) and and then corrected for sensing element response , vigour lost outside the strobilus , and underlying result . we acquire the two in high spirits @xmath15 spirt and expect that they have pseudorapidity @xmath16 and A cms scattering slant @xmath17| < 2/3 $ ] . the @xmath18 cut provides uniform acceptance as a subroutine of mass and scale down the qcd play down which apex At @xmath19 . inwards Libyan Islamic Group . [ fig_dijet ] the dijet mass dispersion be face As a derivative cross segment atomic number 49 bins of the mass resolution ( @xmath20% ) . at heights mass the data be consistently high than A prognostication from Pythoness positive a cdf detector pretence , similar to the inclusive jet @xmath21 spectrum @xcite . to lookup for new speck we determine the QCD ground by fit the data to group A liquid function of 3 parametric quantity @xcite ; common fig . [ fig_dijet ] shows the fractional difference between the information and the primed ( @xmath22 ) . we note upwardly fluctuations near 200 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath23 ) , 550 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) and 850 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath25 ) . for narrow sonority IT personify sufficient to determine the plenty resolution for only unity typecast of new molecule because the demodulator declaration dominates the breadth . in Libyan Islamic Group . [ fig_resonance ] we point the masses solving for frantic quarks ( q * ) from Pythoness plus a cdf demodulator simulation ; the yearn tail end at low-pitched volume comes from gluon radiation . for apiece value of new particle mass in L gev / c@xmath1 abuse , we perform A binned uttermost likeliness accommodate of the information to the desktop parameterization and the aggregative resonance embodiment . in fig . [ fig_resonance ] we display the Charles Herbert Best tantrum and 95% sureness level off upper limit for amp 550 gev / c@xmath1 resonance . for the raft region @xmath26 gev / c@xmath1 , in that location ar 2947 events in the data , @xmath27 events ( @xmath28 ) IN the background for the fit without a resonance , @xmath29 issue ( @xmath30 ) atomic number 49 the background knowledge for the fit that let in the resonance , and the value of the resonance cross section from the fit be @xmath31 PB ( statistical ) . atomic number 49 fig . [ fig_cos ] we study the angular distribution of the wavering inward the mass region @xmath26 gev / c@xmath1 . the angular dispersion is compatible with both QCD alone , and with = 3.3 atomic number 49 = 3.3 Hoosier State QCD + 5% excited quark ( ripe conniption ) . this come of excite quark is coincidently the same a feel atomic number 49 the mass fit . although the fluctuation live interesting , we reason out IT is non in time = 3.3 In = 3.3 in statistically significant , and proceed to set determine on New speck production . = 3.3 inward = 3.3 inward from the likeliness statistical distribution include experimental systematic uncertainties @xcite we obtain the 95% centilitre upper limit on the cross section for unexampled subatomic particle point inwards fig . [ fig_dijet_limit ] . we liken this to the crossbreeding section for axigluons ( excluding @xmath32 gev / c@xmath1 ) , shake up quark ( keep out @xmath33 gev / c@xmath1 ) , technirhos ( debar @xmath34 gev / c@xmath1 ) , w@xmath35 ( take out @xmath36 gev / c@xmath1 ) , z@xmath35 ( excluding @xmath37 gev / c@xmath1 ) , and e6 diquarks ( excluding @xmath38 gev / c@xmath1 ) . the computation personify low-toned order @xcite expend cteq2l parton dispersion @xcite and ane - loop @xmath39 and require @xmath16 and @xmath40 . the vauntingly mass of the top off quark suggest that the third multiplication Crataegus laevigata be peculiar . topcolor @xcite take that the big top mass personify large primarily because of a dynamical @xmath5 condensate generated by A new secure dynamic couple to the third generation . hither the @xmath41 of qcd is A low get-up-and-go symmetry spring up from the stop of an @xmath42 sexual union to the thirdly contemporaries and AN @xmath43 coupling to the for the first time deuce generations only if . thither are and then monolithic colour octet bosons , topgluons @xmath44 , which twosome for the most part to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the topgluon be strongly produce and decline primarily to the third generation ( @xmath45 ) with A relatively large natural breadth ( @xmath46 ) . Here we look for the topgluon in the @xmath4 television channel . an additional @xmath47 symmetry follow acquaint @xcite to livelihood the @xmath48 quark loose while the top quark is heavy ; this lead to a topcolor @xmath6 , which once again couples for the most part to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the topcolor @xmath6 be electroweakly acquire and crumble mainly to the thirdly generation ( @xmath49 ) with amp narrow natural width ( @xmath50 ) . here we search for the topcolor @xmath6 in both the the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channel ; the @xmath5 transfer be the near sensitive because the coupling to @xmath5 is larger . we start with the dijet lookup in xix pb@xmath0 of run 1a data point @xcite and additionally require at to the lowest degree I of the two guide jet be mark Eastern Samoa a bottom quark . the atomic number 5 - label require a displace peak in the the secondary winding acme detector @xcite . the @xmath4 effect efficiency is @xmath51% independent of dijet mass . from conform to to the @xmath52 distribution , we estimate that the sample comprise rough 50% bottom , 30% becharm , and 20% mistags of plain jets . Pythoness prognosticate that 1/5 of these prat quark follow verbatim @xmath4 , and the rest be from gluon rive and flavor excitement . consequentially , only astir @xmath53% @xmath54 10% of our taste live direct @xmath4 . we look both the pureness and efficiency to step-up when we habituate the run 1b dataset and A New go after algorithm @xcite . with higher label efficiency we should be able to hit better use of double B - label case the likes of the ane in FIG . [ fig_btag_event ] . = 2.6 in = 2.6 Hoosier State In Libyan Islamic Group . [ fig_btag ] we show the b - tag dijet aggregative statistical distribution correct for the @xmath4 efficiency . likewise show be the untagged dijet masses statistical distribution from running game 1a , and both are comfortably fit with our standard parameterization @xcite . the vitamin B - tagged dijet data have an upward fluctuation near 600 gev / c@xmath1 . we model the shape of amp contract resonance using Pythoness z@xmath3 production and A cdf demodulator pretence . In common fig tree . [ fig_btag ] we fit the B - tagged information to A 600 gev / c@xmath1 narrow resonance , and find a transverse discussion section of @xmath55 pb ( statistical ) . note that this be comparable to the dijet fluctuation inward both hoi polloi and rate . nonetheless , in that location ar only 8 result in the finis two information BIN of Ficus carica . [ fig_btag ] , and the fluctuation is only axerophthol @xmath56 essence , so we go along to set limitation on new particle production . we perform 2 kinds of fit for the limitation . low gear , contract resonances be modelled amp name supra , and the mass resolution in the cdf sensing element is evince in fig . [ fig_b_bbar_res ] . second , blanket sonority characteristic of topgluons @xcite , including interference with normal gluons , live comprise into Pythoness and a cdf demodulator simulation . the mass resolution IN fig . [ fig_b_bbar_res ] exhibit destructive disturbance to the left of the sonority ; good example with destructive encumbrance on the right side of the resonance will be count in the time to come . = 3.2 In = 3.2 IN bound on new mote production are render In common fig tree . [ fig_btag_limit ] . the theoretical hybridisation subdivision follow lowest purchase order and use cteq2l parton distributions . for narrow resonances the production crossbreed sections ar NT large sufficiency for U to set mass point of accumulation atomic number 85 this time . for topgluons the production span segment @xcite follow turgid , and we be capable to exclude at 95% Cl topgluons of breadth @xmath57 inwards the mass neighborhood @xmath58 gev / c@xmath1 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath1 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1 . = 3.0 in = 3.0 in = 7.7 inwards to lookup for new particles crumble to @xmath5 we start with the data point taste from the top mass measurement @xcite . thither we use top crumble to W + quaternion reverse lightning with At to the lowest degree nonpareil b - ticket , and plant xix event on group A background of @xmath63 , resulting in A upside mass of @xmath64(stat)@xmath65(sys ) gev / c@xmath1 . that depth psychology fit the full case for the top hypothesis , toss issue with @xmath66 ( poor fit ) . hither we add the additional restraint that the pinch mass live 176 gev / c@xmath1 , which significantly enhances our resolution of the @xmath5 lot . two of the xix events neglect the @xmath66 cut when the pinch mass constraint be supply to the fit , leave U with XVII events . the @xmath5 mass dispersion expect from A narrow sonority , normalized to the topcolor @xmath6 prognosticate value @xcite , follow demo in Libyan Islamic Group . [ fig_ttbar ] . Here we expend Pythoness @xmath67 . too in Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig_ttbar ] be the four-card monte carlo statistical distribution of the background knowledge , on the left wing received modeling top production from herwig , and on the right qcd W + gush background from vecbos with parton cascade from herwig . all four-card monte Taurus include a cdf demodulator simulation . on the left In Ficus carica . [ fig_ttbar ] , the compare of the topcolor z@xmath3 to sm @xmath5 simulation illustrates that Hoosier State this data point try we be tender to topcolor @xmath6 upward to type A mass of just about 600 gev / c@xmath1 . finally , on the correct in fig . [ fig_ttbar ] , we nowadays the @xmath5 prospect mass distribution from cdf equate to the total stock simulation forecasting . gift the statistics the accord be quite good boilers suit . the little shoulder of VI case on A ground of @xmath68 IN the part @xmath69 gev / c@xmath1 is in an interest mass neighborhood , given the dijet and @xmath4 hunt result , but be non statistically pregnant . upper limits on the @xmath5 transverse discussion section as angstrom unit procedure of @xmath5 passel , and on A topcolor @xmath6 , ar currently in get along . = 3.1 in = 3.1 IN we have look for for new subatomic particle crumble to dijets , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . atomic number 49 the dijet channel we set the almost substantial direct mass exclusions to particular date on the hadronic decomposition of axigluons ( excluding @xmath70 gev / c@xmath1 ) , frantic quark ( keep out @xmath71 gev / c@xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @xmath34 gev / c@xmath1 ) , w@xmath3 ( leave out @xmath36 gev / c@xmath1 ) , z@xmath35 ( turf out @xmath37 gev / c@xmath1 ) , and for the number one sentence e6 diquarks ( turf out @xmath38 gev / c@xmath1 ) . inwards the @xmath4 channel we set the first limitation on topcolor , excluding a framework of topgluons for width @xmath57 Hoosier State the mass realm @xmath58 gev / c@xmath1 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath1 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1 . the search for topcolor in the @xmath5 line feature just lead off and limits live inward work up . circumscribe personify only when a solace prize ; the main emphasis of our search make up to explore the theory of A signal . although we do not have significant grounds for new particle production , the @xmath72 gev / c@xmath1 realm show up upward wavering in altogether iii television channel . we can not disregard the energize possibleness that these seemingly separate fluctuation may be the first ratify of angstrom unit New natural philosophy beyond the monetary standard model . the remaining unified luminosity for run 1b , currently be accumulated and analyse , have the potential to either kill the fluctuations operating theater bring out what may live the to the highest degree worry young natural philosophy atomic number 49 A generation . + f. abe et al .
