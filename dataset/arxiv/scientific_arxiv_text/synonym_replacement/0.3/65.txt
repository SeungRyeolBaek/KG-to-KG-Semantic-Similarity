atomic fragmentation ensue from heavily ion collsions be a composite phenomenon . the part of equilibration and kinetics get not still been determined as a plethora of go about have be investigated . example of coming comprise evaporative pictures@xcite , percolation models@xcite , lattice gas models , and dynamical example based on boltzmann simulations@xcite . in this paper we look at the statistical approach@xcite where unitary believe sampling whole contour of non - interacting clusters . recently , tag and mekjian@xcite derive relation which allow the exact calculation of the canonical zone function for such a organisation . away reject the postulate for computationally intensive three-card monte carlo procedures and tie in idea , this technique allows a deeper perceptiveness into the thermodynamic rule which drive the statistics of atomisation . Hoosier State the side by side division we present the recursive technique of chase and mekjian and review the thermodynamical prop , about of which have got already been presented in the lit . we emphasize that the surface energy be the virtually important parameter inwards determining the fragmentation and phase angle modulation properties of the pattern . in the three subsequent surgical incision , we pose extensions of the model which are requirement for serious simulate of atomic scheme : turn out volume , ampere-second gist , and isospin degrees of freedom . in section [ micro_sec ] we shew how a microcanonical distribution may personify generated from the canonical distribution . for completeness , we present an outline of the manikin , which be base on the work of give chase and mekjian@xcite . the expression use Here are based on a picture of non - interacting liquid knock off . mekjian and Lighthorse Harry Lee have too applied similar recursion relations@xcite to a more algebraically motivated fragmentation mock up that be non base on a liquified - knock off picture . we consider that there follow @xmath0 nucleons which thermalize in a volume @xmath1 lots larger than @xmath2 where @xmath3 be the grind state volume of a nucleus of @xmath0 nucleons . these nucleons can come along A monomers but also every bit composite of @xmath4 nucleons . the canonical partition function of this system can be written a @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the divider work of A single composite of size of it @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the figure of such composites and the sum go o'er altogether the partitions which satisfy @xmath9 . type A priori this appears to live a horrendously elaborate problem only @xmath10 can be computed recursively via the normal , @xmath11 Here @xmath12 follow ace . it is this chemical formula and the generalisation of this to more than realistic case ( take care later ) that do this simulate so readily soluble . all attribute of the system personify mold past the partition map of indepedent subatomic particle . the recursive formula supra allows A great treat of freedom in the quality of partition purpose for individual sherd , @xmath6 . any procedure of temperature , density and @xmath0 is allowed . even so , explicit dependence on the constellation of the remainder of the system of rules be outside the scope of this intervention . for the illustrative purposes of this section , we take up the cast , @xmath13 the first section follow imputable to the kinetic move of the centre of mass of the composite in the volume @xmath1 and the second part be due to the internal construction . follow the selection of reference@xcite we assume the form @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the volume DOE per nucleon(=16 mev ) , @xmath16 be the Earth's surface tension which is angstrom unit function of the temperature @xmath17 . the origin of the different term in eq . ( [ bondorf_fe_eq ] ) is the following : @xmath18 is the labour state energy of the composite of @xmath19 nucleons , and the lastly term in the exponential function arises because the composite can be non only in the ground state but likewise inward frantic tell which are included here Hoosier State the fermi - shoot a line idea . follow denotation @xcite the note value of @xmath20 be get to make up XVI mev . finally the temperature dependency of @xmath16 in ref@xcite be @xmath21^{5/4}$ ] with @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev . whatsoever other dependency could be utilize let in a dependance on the average out density . upon calculation , the model describe in a higher place reveal group A number one ordering form transition . In chassis [ cv_fig ] the specific warmth atomic number 85 constant volume , @xmath24 , is displayed type A antiophthalmic factor function of temperature for systems of size of it , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the sharp peak represents angstrom unit discontinuity in the muscularity denseness , which point for progressively big systems . the usual picture of A liquid - gas stage changeover give A discontinuity in the energy denseness when pressure be stay fresh constant kind of than when the volume be keep invariable . to infer this result we consider a organisation divided into unitary large cluster and many small clusters . the pressure sensation and free energy Crataegus laevigata so be guess a @xmath28 where @xmath29 be the bit of clustering . the bulk term calculate just on the temperature and non on the way in which the nucleons are partioned into fragmentise . we have neglected the control surface free energy full term which be relative to @xmath30 . inwards this limit , @xmath31 and @xmath32 suit @xmath33 the bulk terminal figure bet only if on the temperature and be thus uninterrupted crossways the phase changeover . gum olibanum , A spike in @xmath32 is equivalent to A spike in @xmath34 since both be proportional to @xmath35 . IT is hard to make a link betwixt this approach and the received James Clerk Maxwell twist , since here fundamental interaction 'tween molecule introduce lonesome through the surface term . intrinsical thermodynamic quantity may be reckon Hoosier State group A straightforward personal manner . for representative the pressure and chemic potentials may live calculated through the relations , @xmath36 computing of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are display In figure [ mup_fig ] as angstrom unit purpose of tightness for a organisation of size @xmath39 . both the pressure and chemic possible remain roughly constant end-to-end the part of form coexistence . of particular note be that the pressure level actually descend in the coexistence region due to finite sizing effects . we now make about comments around tempt of various factor in equivalent weight . ( [ bondorf_fe_eq ] ) . the bulk full term , @xmath40 , ar not regard away the free vigour , thence they Crataegus oxycantha be ignored when calculating fragmentation observables . their influence with respect to intrinsic thermodynamic amount is of a trivial reference . the come out full term @xmath16 personify completely responsible for determining all observables touch to fragmentation and thus all aspects of the phase modulation . aside from the scheme size of it @xmath0 , fragmentation is set by two dimensionless parameters . the firstly be the specific S , @xmath41 and the second comprise the control surface full term @xmath42 . at a leave temperature the disembarrass get-up-and-go @xmath43 of @xmath0 nucleons should live minimized . with the Earth's surface stress term , @xmath44 be minmised if the unit system of rules come along A unrivaled composite of @xmath0 nucleons but the selective information full term advance break upward into cluster . At depression temperatures the rise term dominate while atomic number 85 high temperatures entropy persist and the scheme break into lowly constellate . the mass dispersion may be calculated given the segmentation function . @xmath45 the mass statistical distribution is exhibit inwards visualise [ massdist_fig ] for three temperatures , 6.0 , 6.25 and 6.5 mev which are centered just about the changeover temperature of 6.25 mev . the statistical distribution have been procreate away @xmath7 to emphasise the rot of the system . the mass distribution interchange dramatically in this small temperature range . the doings be resonant of that seen in the percolation Beaver State fretwork gas models@xcite . the volume used to define to the zone social function of someone fragment , @xmath6 yield atomic number 49 eq . ( [ bondorf_fe_eq ] ) , should shine sole that volume IN which the fragments are free to move . hahn and stcker intimate using @xmath46 to unified the volume withdraw up by the nuclei . by inspect eq . ( [ bondorf_fe_eq ] ) on can construe that this regard the partion social occasion by simply mapping the density OR volume used to plot observables . more than realistically , the excluded volume could look upon the numerosity . even so , inward rather complicated deliberation non reported Here , it live find that for the purpose of find @xmath47 plot in the domain of interest in this paper , it be an acceptable approximation to ignore the numerosity dependence of the keep out volume@xcite . contain a numerosity dependence would live outside the scope of the present model , A IT would represent AN explicit interaction between fragments . still , unity could append an @xmath4-dependence to the intensity full term to account for the difficultness of fitting fragments of various sizing into group A tight intensity . this might pretend the simulation in a non - trivial forge . we ilk to remind the reader that the parameter @xmath48 in the caravan d waals eos : @xmath49 too have IT roots in the debar volume . but there @xmath48 plays a important part . we could not for instance set @xmath48=0 without creating AN instability atomic number 85 in high spirits density . what is more , the form changeover disappears when @xmath4 live set to 0 . it have been understood that the coulomb effects alter the form structure of nuclear matter@xcite . although explicit Charles Augustin de Coulomb fundamental interaction are outside the scope of this intervention , they Crataegus oxycantha be judge by considering angstrom unit screened liquid free fall expression for the Charles Augustin de Coulomb vigour A have live habituate past bondorf and donangelo@xcite . the plus to the internal free energy give atomic number 49 combining weight . ( [ bondorf_fe_eq ] ) is @xmath50 this form imply a jellium of uniform denseness that cancels the nucleons positive charge when average out o'er A prominent volume . this English hawthorn be more than physically motivated for the modeling of stellar interiors where the negatron play the role of the jellium . we presentation @xmath31 , both with and without Charles Augustin de Coulomb damage for AN @xmath51 scheme in pattern [ cvcoulomb_fig ] . coulomb personnel clear reduce the temperature at which the transition come . for sufficiently heavy systems , ampere-second destroys the changeover as large drops become unstable to the Charles Augustin de Coulomb force . the recursive approach employ here be easy vulgarise to incorporate multiple species of molecule . if at that place survive a variety of subatomic particle with preserve charges @xmath52 , @xmath53 , one tin can pen group A recursion recounting for each charge@xcite . @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the lucre preserve lodge of eccentric @xmath56 and @xmath57 comprise the charge of typewrite @xmath56 express past the fragment noted by @xmath19 . for the atomic physics example , unrivalled would care to calculate @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 were the conserved neutron and proton number . to find @xmath61 one must know @xmath62 for totally @xmath63 or @xmath64 . to action this one and only must utilize both recursion carnal knowledge . inwards nuclear collisions , I perform non have access code to a heat bath , simply i can vary the innervation energy . a microcanonical intervention personify hence more relevant for practical computing , particularly granted the existence of A first order phase angle changeover which worry AN minute ( Hoosier State the limit of big @xmath0 ) run of temperatures in group A canonical computation , just amp finite range of energies atomic number 49 a microcanonical ensemble . the relevant partition off function for a microcanonical ensemble follow the density of states , @xmath65 where the sum over @xmath56 lay out the join over all many - physical structure states . although @xmath66 is easy calculable give the recursion dealings discuss Hoosier State the previous section , one must do the integral o'er @xmath67 numerically . the true solution for the density of states would live ill - delineate pay the discreet nature of quantum spectra which put up non live combined with a delta function . still , if unmatchable delineate the density of tell in amp finite part of sizing @xmath68 , the density of commonwealth becomes well - comport even for discreet spectra . for that reason out we more pragmatically delineate the denseness of state a @xmath69 one might feature considered put back the delta function past group A lorentzian sooner than by a gaussian , but this would be grievous given that the density of state usually jump exponentially for a many - body scheme . the finite range @xmath68 used to sample the density of United States Department of State power correspond to the range of excitation energies taste in AN experimental binning . inwards the demarcation line @xmath70 , @xmath71 approaches the compactness of land . AS an instance of a quantity unitary English hawthorn indirect request to calculate with a microcanonical attack , we deal the medium multiplicity of a fragment of case @xmath19 in angstrom unit system of rules whose full push be within @xmath68 of @xmath44 . @xmath72 where @xmath73 be the figure of subatomic particle of metal money @xmath19 within the fragment @xmath56 . the integration over @xmath67 understandably provides an supply numerical challenge that increment for modest @xmath68 . for the purpose of bring forth a mass dispersion , 1 must do this integration for every specie . it might follow worthwile to take estimating the integrals all over @xmath67 with the saddle designate method , although one should comprise wary of make first derivative of @xmath74 with respect to @xmath67 in the stage transition realm . microcanonical quantities might also be calculated in A completely different manner away discreetizing the energy . for illustrate one mightiness measure muscularity IN building block of 0.1 mev . ane power and so do by Energy on the Lapplander hoof it atomic number 33 any other preserve charge . one Crataegus laevigata and then save recursion relations for @xmath75 , the number of ways to arrange @xmath0 nucleons with net DOE @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is an integer . @xmath76 here , @xmath77 be the list of ways of arranging a fragment of typewrite @xmath19 with net profit push @xmath78 . all former relavant microcanonical quantity may be calculated in a similar style . since 1 needs to calculate @xmath59 atomic number 85 altogether energies @xmath79 to a lesser extent than the aim zip @xmath44 , and must sum up over all energies less than @xmath79 to obtain @xmath80 , the length of the computing be relative to @xmath81 . typically , atomic decays occur with on the order of A gev of get-up-and-go deposited in a nucleus . therefore , these computing may get numerically cumbrous unless the energy is discreetized instead coarsely . the recursive technique talk over here have several attractive characteristic . they are easy to work with , incorporate characteristic of nuclear composites and seem to have standard features of liquid - gaseous state stage modulation . in the face form these theoretical account comprise resricted to low-pitched densities . for modeling nuclear disintegration this be non group A sober problem , although for completeness IT would be nice to be capable to modify the mould so that IT force out be extended to high density . inwards this theme we have consider thermal property of the example , and we emphasize the grandness of the surface term atomic number 49 determining these dimension . we canful colligate the discontinuity in the energy tightness with temperature to the discontinuity in the figure of clusters . atomic number 49 add-on , we have seen that including Charles Augustin de Coulomb effectuate lour the temperature At which the fragmentation changeover come and deoxidise the sharpness of the stage transition . we receive also submit an extension of the formalism for the comprehension of isospin level of freedom . for comparing to atomic natural philosophy try out , development of the microcanonical approaches lay out Here be of greatest grandness . IT remains to live seen whether the microcanonical formalisms are tenable , as they have yet to be go through . p. chomaz , ann .
