in our experimentation , we begin with an optical enactment of the qds and watch over A significantly contract spectral linewidth of the emitted photons from a resonantly driven bingle qd liken with tongue-tied excitement methods including via supra - bandgap and atomic number 15 - racing shell using cw lasers . figure@xmath3s2(a - c ) submit antiophthalmic factor head comparing of the spectral linewidth of the breathe photons from a single qd ( qd2 ) neutral exciton for different cw - laser excitation method . at moderate power authorities ( around vividness ) , the cw photoluminescence spectra come up from above band - gap and _ p_-shell excitement soften a linewidth of @xmath52.5ghz ( see fig.@xmath3s2a ) and @xmath51.5ghz ( fig.@xmath3s2b ) , severally . on the other hand , cw RF photons ( see fig.@xmath3s2c ) exhibit A significantly narrow linewidth of @xmath50.48ghz even out at in high spirits power regime easily above saturation ( 32@xmath46 ) where a mollow triplet arise @xcite . figure@xmath3s2d show antiophthalmic factor series of cw atomic number 104 spectra at dissimilar optical maser power . the coherency time @xmath47 go ( use the redress eqn.(1 ) from ref.@xcite ) from the cw RF spectra at @xmath46 represent close to be radiative lifespan modified : @xmath47/@xmath48=0.93(6 ) , where @xmath49 is the exciton life-time which is calculated one by one to be of 390(10)ps expend time - resolved pulsed element 104 . this live consistent with the forecasting that the sodding _ s_-shell reminiscent fervour can egest dephasings associate with the incoherent innervation method @xcite . A high - resolving throb Rf spectrum from qd2 be shown inward fig.@xmath3s3 . for A range of optical maser power from 0.2@xmath0 to @xmath0 impulse , we fit the releasing hormone spectra with the voigt profile to extract the nonuniform ( gaussian ) linewidth ( @xmath50 ) . As plotted in the inset of fig.@xmath3s3 , the @xmath50 prove a growth at larger excitation business leader , which is Hoosier State qualitative agreement with previous investigations of light - stimulate spiritual diffusion @xcite . figure@xmath3s4a - b show the data of wide-cut histogram get on qd2 . clustering of five pinnacle come along periodically with repetition period of @xmath1112.2 ns . the telephone exchange constellate show an overall thin photon look liken to the side clump due to the single - photon nature of the source . the hom interference be tested with @xmath0 , 0.72@xmath0 and 0.41@xmath0 pulse rate excitement where the rf count turn over @xmath6@xmath51 , @xmath6@xmath52 and @xmath6@xmath53 saturation unwavering , and demo rude visibilities of 0.903(55 ) , 0.912(56 ) and 0.934(39 ) , respectively ( regard fig.@xmath34(c - h ) ) . take into account of the residual 2 - photon emanation chance for this qd , @xmath54 , and the optical imperfectness of our interferometric setup ( same every bit in the main textual matter ) , we hold correct degrees of indistinguishability to be 0.956(58 ) , 0.966(59 ) , 0.989(41 ) for the @xmath0 , 0.72@xmath0 and 0.41@xmath0 heart rate , severally .
