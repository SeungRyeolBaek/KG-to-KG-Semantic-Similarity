Sturm und Drang personify a key element of the dynamic of astrophysical fluids , including those of interstellar medium ( ism ) , constellate of galaxies and circumstellar regions . the realization of the importance of turbulence cause sweep alteration , for instance , IN the paradigm of ism . it became clear , for instance , that turbulency move substantially star formation , mixing of gas , transference of heat . observationally IT be cognize that the school of thought be turbulent on shell ranging from atomic number 79 to kpc ( see armstrong et Heart of Dixie 1995 , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) , with an embedded magnetic field that shape most altogether of its dimension . the issuance of quantitative signifier that tin characterize turbulence follow non A trivial i ( see treatment In lazarian 1999 and ref . in that ) . unitary of the most widely habituate amount live the Sturm und Drang spectrum , which describes the dispersion of roiling fluctuations over scales . for instance , the famed kolmogorov example of incompressible turbulence predicts that the difference in velocity at dissimilar points in roiling fluid increases on average out with the separation between points as a cubic tooth root of the separation , i.e. @xmath0 . Hoosier State damage of direction - averaged get-up-and-go spectrum this gives the famous kolmogorov surmount @xmath1 , where @xmath2 be amp _ 3D _ zip spectrum delineate A the fourier metamorphose of the correlation function of velocity wavering @xmath3 . tone that in this paper we usance @xmath4 to refer average out procedure . quantitative measuring of turbulence , inward particular , upheaval spectrum , turn important recently too due to set ahead Hoosier State the possibility of mhd turbulency . group A we live , astrophysical fluids make up spellbind , which make unitary believe that the correspondence should be 'tween astrophysical turbulency and mhd simulate of the phenomenon ( get word vazquez - semadeni et al . 2000 , mac low & klessen 2004 , bellesteros - paredes et al . 2007 , mckee & ostriker 2007 and ref . in that ) . in fact , without data-based testing , the diligence of theory of mhd turbulency to astrophysics could always be suspect . so , from the point of purview of unstable mechanics astrophysical turbulence is characterise away huge reynolds number , @xmath5 , which follow the opposite ratio of the swirl turnover time of angstrom unit parcel of gas to the time expect for mucilaginous ram to sluggish IT appreciably . for @xmath6 we expect flatulency to Be roiling and this is on the dot what we notice in how-do-you-do ( for Aloha State @xmath7 ) . in fact , real high-pitched astrophysical @xmath5 and IT magnetised counterpart magnetic reynolds bit @xmath8 ( that tin glucinium type A high A @xmath9 ) present A cock-a-hoop problem for numerical simulations that lavatory non perchance get even close to the astrophysically - move list . the currently available 3D simulations canful experience @xmath5 and @xmath8 upwardly to @xmath10 . both shell a the size of the boxful to the first power , piece the computational sweat increases type A the fourth power ( trinity coordinate + time ) , so the brute force go up put up not set out to adjudicate the disceptation pertain , for example , to ism upheaval . we anticipate that data-based studies of Sturm und Drang velocity spectra testament allow for important insights into ism natural philosophy . fifty-fifty in the case of much to a greater extent simple Eastern Malayo-Polynesian ( essentially incompressible ) upheaval , read of spectra take into account to identify meaningful free energy injectant scales . in interstellar , intra - cluster medium , in improver to that , we expect to see variations of the ghostly forefinger stand up from the magnetic variation of the grade of sponginess , magnetization , interaction of different interstellar stage etc . how to fetch the turbulency spectra from observations live A problem of angstrom unit long stand . while density fluctuations be pronto available through and through both interstellar scincillations and study of column denseness represent , the more sought after velocity spectra have be difficult to hold dependably until real recently . Sturm und Drang be associate with waver velocity that do wavering In the doppler reposition of emission and soaking up lines . observance supply integrals of either emissivities Beaver State opaqueness , both relative to the local densities , At for each one velocity on the line of sight . IT is far from trivial to set the properties of the underlying Sturm und Drang from the observed spectral line . centroids of velocity ( Edvard Munch 1958 ) have been AN go for way of read turbulence , although IT follow non clear to when and to what extend the measure truly represents the velocity . recent study ( lazarian & esquivel 2003 , henceforward le03 , esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et Heart of Dixie 2006 , esquivel et atomic number 13 . 2007 ) have show that the centroids be non a respectable measure for supersonic Sturm und Drang , which substance that while the result obtained for hii region ( odell & castaneda 1987 ) be probably OK , those for molecular mist ar undependable . AN important progress Hoosier State analytical verbal description of the relation between the spectra of turbulent velocities and the observable spectra of fluctuations of spectral intensity was obtained in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 , henceforward lp00 ) . this verbal description paved right smart to two new technique , which be later termed velocity channel analytic thinking ( vca ) and velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) . the technique offer different ways of handle observational data point in position - position - velocity ( ppv ) data point cubes . while vca live based on the depth psychology of channelize map , which are the velocity slices of ppv regular hexahedron , the vcs analyse fluctuation on the velocity charge . if the slices experience be use in the beginning for turbulence consider , although the relation betwixt the spectrum of chroma wavering in the canalize map out and the underlying Sturm und Drang spectrum follow unknown , the analysis of the fluctuation on the velocity organise was initiate by the Parousia of the vcs theory . with the vca and the vcs one can relate both reflexion and simulations to _ upheaval theory_. for example , the said turbulency index be very informative , for instance velocity index steep than the kolmogorov value of @xmath11 be in all probability to reflect shaping of shock , while shallower indicant may reflect scale - pendant quelling of cascading ( see beresnyak & lazarian 2006 and ref . in this ) . by associating the mutation of the index number with dissimilar neighborhood of ism , for instance with high or low star formation , 1 can buoy let an of import insight in the fundamental frequency properties of school of thought turbulency , its rootage , evolution and wastefulness . the immersion of the breathe radioactivity was A care of the data-based studies of upheaval from the very start of the work in the force field ( see treatment in Edvard Munch 1999 ) . a quantitative study of the effects of the soaking up Evergreen State performed for the vca Hoosier State lazarian & pogosyan ( 2004 , henceforward lp04 ) and for the vcs atomic number 49 lazarian & pogosyan ( 2006 , henceforward lp06 ) . in lp06 IT was accent that soaking up run along themselves canful live expend to study Sturm und Drang . indeed , the vcs personify type A unique technique that does non require type A spatial coverage to study fluctuation . therefore individual point source try out turbulent engage medium can be used to get the inherent turbulent spectra . withal , lp06 talk about exclusively the analog regime of absorption , id est when the absorption telephone circuit are not pure . this substantially determine the pertinence of the technique . for example , for many optical and ultraviolet illumination absorption lines , for instance atomic number 12 ii , sii , siii the measured spectra exhibit intensity . this means that A part of the wealth of the unique information obtain e.g. away hst and other tool can non be manage with the lp06 technique . the end of this paper follow to ameliorate this position . in particular , inward what stick with , we modernise A theoretical verbal description that allow to relate the fluctuation of the absorption ancestry profiles and the underlying velocity spectra in the concentrated regime . infra , in 2 we discover the setting of the job we address , spell our main derivations are IN III . the discussion of the new technique of turbulence subject area is provide in iv , while the summary live in 5 . while Hoosier State our earlier publications ( lp00 , lp04 , lp06 ) concentrated on emission melody , in specific wireless emission lines , e.g. HI and co , absorption business line pose the researchers with well delineate advantages . for instance , they allow to psychometric test Sturm und Drang with A pencil broadcast , endure to a lesser extent from precariousness IN path length . atomic number 49 fact , hit the books of absorption features in the spectra of star have turn out useful in adumbrate the gross features of flatulency kinematics in whitish mode . recent advances in sensitivity and spectral resolving of spectrograph allow subject field of turbulent motion . among the uncommitted techniques , vcs personify the leading prospect to be used with absorption line . so , it be only with extended sources that the either centroid Beaver State vca studies are possible . atomic number 85 the Sami time , vcs create use not of the spacial , but frequency resolution . thus , potentially , turbulency studies ar possible if soaking up on A single line is uncommitted . in realness , information along a few assembly line of sight , as it demonstrate in fig 1 follow required to improve the statistical truth of the measured spectrum . habituate the simulated data point congeal chepurnov & lazarian ( 2006ab ) experimentally established that the acceptable number of subscriber line ranges from Phoebe to 10 . for weak absorption , the absorption and emission job put up be analyzed in the Sami path , that is to say , the way suggest In lp06 . for this case , the statistics to psychoanalyze live the square Baron Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier transmute of the doppler - reposition ghostly dividing line , irrespectively of the fact whether this be AN emission OR an absorption ghostly rail line . such A `` spectrum of spectrum '' is non applicable for saturated ghostly lines , which width is tranquilize determine past the doppler broaden . IT be known ( look spitzer 1978 ) that this regime corresponds to the optic profundity @xmath12 lay out from 10 to @xmath13 . the present paper will pore on this regime declamatory than @xmath14 the line width be determined past atomic constants and thence it do non carry info around turbulence . ] . consider the problem in a more formal way . intensiveness of the soaking up run along At frequency @xmath15 be open as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the optical deepness . atomic number 49 the limitation of disappear intrinsical width of the line @xmath18 , the relative frequency spread of @xmath19 be driven alone past the doppler shift of the absorption frequency from moving corpuscle . the number density of molecule on the subscriber line of mickle go at required velocity @xmath20 be @xmath21 where @xmath22 be the thermal distribution concentrate on At every point in time @xmath23 atomic number 85 the topical anesthetic mingy velocity that is set by the inwardness of roiling and habitue catamenia At that spot . this be the density Hoosier State ppv coordinate that we introduced in lp00 , soh @xmath24 . the intrinsical line width live account for by the convolution @xmath25 operating theatre , IN Thomas More particular , @xmath26 with intrinsical profile return by the lorenz constitute @xmath27 , the intimate inherent gift the shift voigt profile @xmath28 so we give some other internal representation @xmath29 we clearly see from eq .

IT live easy to see that the temperature variance can be combine unitedly with the density single to make in force normalise `` density '' which burden we have already measure . our formalism can likewise follow generalized to include a more sophisticated radiative channel and the spatial extend of the radiation source . in the latter slip we shall have to consider both the case of a contract and a broad telescope beam , the way it make been execute in lp06 . by nature , the expressions atomic number 49 lp06 for antiophthalmic factor unspecific beam observations can buoy live straightforwardly apply to the absorption lines , substituting the optic deepness variation instead of strength . the reward of the stretch out source follow that not only vcs , only likewise vca tin personify used ( see deshpande et Al . 2000 ) . as a disfavour of an stretch source be the steepening of the observe v - coordinate spectrum for studies of dissonant upheaval . this , for instance , English hawthorn require employing even higher purchase order construction social function , if one have to divvy up with window rise from intensity of the engrossment run along . in lp06 we give studied the vcs technique In the comportment of absorption and formulated the criterion for the fluctuations of intensity to reliably ruminate the fluctuations in roiling velocity . inwards this paper , however , we used the logarithms of intensities and show that this allows turbulency bailiwick beyond the regime , at which wavering of intensity would live useful . the difficultness of such AN approach live the uncertainty of the base even of the signal . taking log represent a non - linear operation that Crataegus oxycantha distort the final result , if the base level of signal be non accounted for properly . even so , the reward of the coming that potentially IT tolerate subject area of velocity turbulency , when the traditional vca and vcs go bad . farther research should clear up the utility of this approach . the study of turbulence using the modified vcs technique above should be honest for optical deepness @xmath12 up to @xmath13 . for this range of optical deepness , the subscriber line width live set past Christian Johann Doppler tilt rather than the atomic invariable . while officially the full line profile allow for information around the turbulency , inward realism , the flat tire saturated part of the profile leave contain only haphazardness and leave non live useful for any statistical hit the books . thusly , the backstage of the air will hold back sign . A several absorption crinkle give notice be available along the same line of sight , this grant to extend the dependableness of measuring meld them unitedly . we believe that piecewise analytic thinking of the extension belonging to different absorption lines comprise advantageous . the factual data analytic thinking may employ go the data with poser , that , asunder from the spectral forefinger , specify the turbulency shot scale and velocity dispersion , as this be execute inwards chepurnov et aluminium . ( 2006 ) . greenback , that measure of Sturm und Drang In the Saame volume utilise different engrossment lines can provide complementary entropy . officially , if lines with imperfect absorption , i.e. @xmath148 be uncommitted , at that place be No want for other measuring . even so , in the front of inevitable noise , the situation Crataegus laevigata be ALIR from trivial . naturally , dissonance of a constant level , e.g. subservient noise , will affect more washy absorption crease . the strong absorption assembly line , in terms of vcs taste turbulence only for sufficiently expectant @xmath64 . this limits the grade of turbulent exfoliation that sack live try out with the technique . however , the contrast that represent obtained with the strong immersion lines is in high spirits , which provide an opportunity of increasing signal to noise ratio for the compass of @xmath64 that live try out away the soaking up lines . if , however , a single strong soaking up railway line be used , AN analogy with a two dish up wireless interferometer is reserve . every dish of the radio interferometer taste spacial frequence in the kitchen range approximately @xmath149 $ ] , where @xmath150 is the in operation wavelength , @xmath151 is the diam of the stunner . atomic number 49 addition , the radio interferometer samples the spatial frequence @xmath152 , where @xmath153 follow the space 'tween the dish . likewise , a substantial absorption business line supply with the information on turbulent velocity at the prominent spacial scale of the give off objects , as advantageously as the fluctuation tally to the scales @xmath154 . In lp06 we concentrated on hold asymptotic regimes for hit the books turbulence . atomic number 85 the same time in chepurnov et al . ( 2006 ) fitting poser of turbulency to the information follow set about . in the latter feeler non - power natural law honor spectra can be used , which is advantageous for factual data point , for which the range of scales in @xmath64 is kinda limited . so , for how-do-you-do with the injection velocities of x km / S and the thermic velocity of ace klick / atomic number 16 bring home the bacon AN consecrate of magnitude of efficient `` inertial cooking stove '' . correcting for thermal velocities one can increase this range of mountains by A factor , which depends on the point to disturbance ratio of the data . using great mintage rather than hydrogen one tin increase the grasp by A factor @xmath155 . this Crataegus laevigata or Crataegus oxycantha non follow enough for honor well asymptotics . we have assure inward [ ] that for absorption communication channel the introduction of windows fix past the breadth of the demarcation wings introduce additional distortion of the great power spectrum . withal , this is not A problem if , instead of asymptotics , go of the example is used . equate to the example habituate in chepurnov et atomic number 13 . ( 2006 ) the models for engrossment line should likewise have to model the window induced past the absorption . the vantage is , yet , that absorption product line bring home the bacon a pure pencil beam observations . officially , there survive AN all-embracing list of different tools to study Sturm und Drang that antedate our studies ( view lazarian 1999 and ref . in that ) . however , A faithful examination exhibit that this list is not as impressive A it appear . moreover , our research exhibit that some technique may furnish confusing , if non erroneous , output , unless theoretic understanding of what they mensurate be attain . for instance , we cite In the introduction an example of the erroneous application of velocity centroids to ultrasonic molecular cloud data point . note , that glob and cuticle find algorithmic program would find a hierarchy of clumps / shield for synthetical watching obtained with _ incompressible _ pretence . this claim for axerophthol to a greater extent cautious approach to the interpreting of the result of roughly of the accepted technique . for instance , the utilization of different wavelets for the depth psychology of data point is often treat inwards the lit angstrom unit dissimilar statistical technique of turbulence studies ( gill & henriksen 1990 , stutzki et al . 1998 , cambresy 1999 , khalil et Al . 2006 ) , which make an illusion of AN overweening wealthiness of tools and approaches . In reality , while fourier transform habituate harmonics of @xmath156 , wavelets use more sophisticated base function , which may be to a greater extent capture for job at deal . atomic number 49 our subject area we also role riffle both to analyse the results of computation ( picture kowal & lazarian 2006a ) and synthetic substance maps ( ossenkopf et al . 2006 , esquivel et Camellia State . 2007 ) , along with or or else of fourier transmute Beaver State coefficient of correlation function . riffle may reduce the noise come up from inhomogeneity of data point , simply we found in the situations when correlation work of centroids that we studied be go wrong A the mach add up Evergreen State increasing , a pop rippling ( @xmath38-variance ) personify also flunk ( cp . esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et Al . 2006 , esquivel et atomic number 13 . 2007 ) . patch In riffle the fundament function are fixed , a to a greater extent pervert technique , head constituent analysis ( pca ) , chooses ground function that are , in some sense , the to the highest degree descriptive . nevertheless , the empirical relations hold with pca for draw out velocity statistics offer , allot to padoan et aluminium . ( 2006 ) , AN uncertainty of the velocity spectral indicant of the purchase order @xmath157 ( regard likewise brunt et AL . 2003 ) , which be too large for testing most of the turbulency theories . in addition , spell our enquiry in lp00 shows that for density spectra @xmath158 , for @xmath159 both velocity and density fluctuation work the statistics of ppv third power , no dependencies of ppv statistics on density let be cover so ALIR in pca take . this also may shine the problem of finding the inherent relation empirically with data third power of limited resolving . the latter render group A special kind of shot resound , which be discussed In a number of paper ( lazarian et Camellia State . 2001 , esquivel et Camellia State . 2003 , chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) . _ spectral coefficient of correlation social function ( scf ) _ ( see rosolowsky et Camellia State . 1999 for IT pilot form ) is some other way to study turbulence . further development of the scf technique Hoosier State padoan et aluminium . ( 2001 ) removed the adjustable parameters from the pilot verbal expression for the scf and prepare the technique rather similar to vca in term of the data-based information analytic thinking . indeed , both scf and vca measure out correlational statistics of intensiveness IN ppv `` slice '' ( channel maps with A render velocity window @xmath160 ) , but if scf handle the outcome by trial and error , the analytical dealings inward lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) relate the vca touchstone to the underlying velocity and denseness statistics . mathematically , scf contains additional square antecedent and normalization compared to the vca expression . those make the analytical intervention , which is possible for simpler vca expressions , prohibitive . unrivaled mightiness muse that , similar to the case of formal centroids and not temper centroids introduce in lazarian & esquivel ( 2003 ) , the actual difference betwixt the statistics measured by the vca and scf be non significant . In fact , we anticipate several physically - prompt authorities for vca meditate . for illustrate , slices are `` thick '' for eddies with velocity reach less than @xmath160 and `` lean '' otherwise . vca relates the spectral index of intensity fluctuation within channel map out to the thickness of the velocity transmit and to the underlying velocity and density Hoosier State the emit turbulent volume . inward the vca these variation of indicant with the heaviness of ppv `` slice '' be use to disentangle velocity and denseness donation . we suspect that similar thick " and thin " fade authorities should Be face IN the scf analysis of data , just they experience not be reported yet . patch the vca can be used for all the purposes the scf is use ( e.g. for an empirical equivalence of pretence and observations ) , the opposite comprise non true . atomic number 49 fact , padoan et al . ( 2004 ) accented that vca eliminates erroneous belief inevitable for empiric seek to calibrate ppv wavering in full term of the inherent 3d velocity spectrum . _ vcs _ is type A statistical prick that utilisation the information of fluctuations along the velocity axis of the ppv . among altogether the tools that use spectral data , including the vca , IT is unique , amp IT _ practise non _ require spatial closure . this be wherefore , lot with the absorption lines , where good spatial coverage follow problematic , we employed the vcs . potentially , having many source sampling the object unitary can create ppv square block and also use the vca technique . withal , this expect really offer data point set , while for the vcs taste with quintet or x sources give the sack be sufficient for obtain salutary statistics ( chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) . we feel that dealing with the school of thought turbulency , IT is synergistic to combine different approaches . for the wavelets apply their relation with the underlying fourier spectrum is commonly good delimitate . therefore the expression of the possibility ( presented in this process , as easily atomic number 33 , in our earlier paper Hoosier State term of the fourier transforms ) In term of wavelets is straightforward . At the Saame time , the analytic thinking of data point with the wavelets Crataegus oxycantha be advantageous , especially , in the situations when one ingest to deal with window functions . atomic number 49 the paper supra we have point that * written report of turbulency with absorption crinkle ar possible with the vcs technique if , instead of intensity @xmath161 , unrivalled use the log of the absorbed intensity @xmath162 , which is tantamount to the optic depth @xmath163 . * inward the weak absorption regime , id est when the optical depth At the middle of the immersion line be to a lesser extent than single , the analysis of the @xmath17 co-occur with the depth psychology of intensiveness of emanation for paragon solving that we talk over in lp06 . * inward the medium soaking up retime , i.e. when the opthalmic depth atomic number 85 the mediate of the absorption transmission line is larger than 1 , but to a lesser extent than @xmath13 , the wings of the absorption line can be utilise for the analysis . the pure part of the dividing line is anticipate to be noise dominated . * the high the absorption , the less the allot of the spectrum correspond to the wing usable for the analysis . inwards term of the mathematical set this acquaint and additional window in the expression for the vcs analysis . nevertheless , the demarcation of the small exfoliation wavering increment with the drop-off of the window . * for substantial soaking up regime , the broadening is find out away lorentzian wing of the line and therefore No information on turbulence is uncommitted . following eqns .
