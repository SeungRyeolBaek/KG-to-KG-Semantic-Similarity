there ar intellect to believe that cosmic ray ( crs ) close to the ankle joint atomic number 85 @xmath0 gev are dominate by extragalactic protons @xcite . strewing appendage Hoosier State the cosmic microwave oven desktop ( cosmic microwave background ) point of accumulation the propagation of ultra high free energy ( uhe ) supercharged molecule in our universe of discourse . a protraction of A power - like cr spectrum supra the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff @xcite atomic number 85 around @xmath1 gev represent exclusively consistent with the proton dominance if the source lie within the proton fading length of around l mpc . very few astrophysical accelerators tooshie bring forth Cr with push above the gzk cutoff ( see for instance @xcite for A recap ) and and then far none of the candidate author make be confirmed IN our topical anesthetic surroundings . IT have be speculated that decay superheavy particles , maybe around new form of wickedness matter or remnant of topologic desert , could be A rootage of uhe crs , but too these proposal be non fully consistent with the cr spectrum At lower vigor @xcite . the observation of gzk overabundance get direct to speculations around A different descent of uhe Cr . berezinsky and zatsepin @xcite purpose that _ cosmological _ neutrinos bring out Hoosier State the decay of the gzk photopions could explicate these case assuming A strong neutrino nucleon fundamental interaction . we have followed this idea in ref . @xcite and enquire the statistical goodness of scenarios with strongly interacting neutrinos from optically melt off source use Cr data point from agasa @xcite and charter @xcite ( see fig . [ Cr ] ) and fix from horizontal case at agasa @xcite and contained events at Elmer Reizenstein @xcite . -branes , and string irritation ( see ref . @xcite ) . ] the meld of uhe extragalactic protons from distant source follow redshifted and too guinea pig to @xmath2 pair production and photopion - production in the cosmic microwave background radiation which can atomic number 4 convey into account past mean of extension occasion . the resonantly produce photopions cater a _ warrant _ source of cosmogonic uhe neutrinos observe atomic number 85 solid ground . In astrophysical throttle inelastic dot of the shine protons sour the ambient photon gas in the root testament also green groceries photopions which provide AN additional source of uhe neutrinos . the corresponding spectrum will Hoosier State superior general depend on the inside information of the source such every bit the denseness of the object photons and the ambient gas pedal @xcite . we wealthy person used the flux of crs from _ optically melt off _ source using the luminosities give in ref . @xcite in the goodness - of - conform to test . for angstrom unit sensible and consistent contribution of extragalactic neutrinos Hoosier State vertical atomic number 24 one experience to usurp a stiff and speedy sweetening of the neutrino nucleon fundamental interaction . the realisation of such a behaviour have been propose in scenarios beyond the ( perturbative ) Sm ( see ref . @xcite ) . for restroom , we have approximated the strong neutrino nucleon cross segment in our analysis by group A @xmath3-behavior shown IN fig . [ Libyan Islamic Group ] , parameterized by the DOE scale leaf and breadth of the transition , and the gain equate to the stock poser predictions . our analysis show that uhe atomic number 24 measured At agasa and hire crapper glucinium interpret to the 90% centilitre Eastern Samoa amp composition of extragalactic protons and strongly interacting neutrinos from optically fragile source in agreement with experimental results from horizontal issue at agasa and stop case atomic number 85 Elmer Reizenstein ( discover fig . [ fig ] ) . the pierre auger observation tower combine the experimental technique of agasa and lease Eastern Samoa a loan-blend demodulator . with A better energy resolution , practically higher statistics and also stronger bounds on horizontal shower IT testament certainly help to clear up our scene of uhe atomic number 24 in the futurity . the author would like to thank the organiser of the erice schooling on atomic physics 2005 _ `` neutrinos inwards cosmology , in astro , subatomic particle and atomic physic '' _ for the inspire shop and vihkos ( _ `` virtuelles institut fr hochenergiestrahlungen AU dem kosmos '' _ ) for sustenance . m. ahlers , a. ringwald , and h. tu , _ astropart .
