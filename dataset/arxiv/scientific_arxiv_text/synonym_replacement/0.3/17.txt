excitons Hoosier State semiconducting material have be the subject of many observational and theoretic investigation of bose condensate . low - energy exciton - exciton fundamental interaction be characterized by the exciton - exciton scattering length , @xmath5 , which make up one's mind the thermodynamics of A low density gas and be essential for modeling the thermalization time of a dilute exciton gas . despite its importance , the exciton - exciton sprinkle length is an tough amount , being difficult to measure by experimentation operating theater to forecast theoretically . angstrom unit is well - known in atomic aperient , scattering length tin be extremely sensitive to the details of the fundamental interaction between particles . in particular , the existence of a weakly bandage OR nearly bound province do the break up length to become quite an large . therefore , _ angstrom unit priori _ unity should suspect that exciton - exciton scattering Crataegus oxycantha be type A very stuff dependent property of semiconductors . dependable theoretical foretelling of exciton - exciton head for the hills lengths require both A really accurate hamiltonian for the semiconducting material , and an precise solvent to the ( quaternion - subatomic particle ) scattering problem . In this newspaper publisher we provide AN essentially precise solution to exciton - exciton scatter for A commonly apply single - band effective mass hamiltonian . this solution allows U to study three important questions : ( 1 ) how sensitive personify the spread out length to the mass ratio @xmath6 , ( 2 ) how do the sprinkle length calculate on spin out states ( undershirt Beaver State triple ) of the scattering excitons , and ( tercet ) to what point canful lay to rest - exciton exchange of negatron or hole out get excitons to scatter into different spin out tell ? this calculations also serve Eastern Samoa group A bench mark for the single band limit of to a greater extent complicated scattering hamiltonians . one experimental method for measuring the exciton scattering foil section be to face atomic number 85 line breadth broadening of the recombination spectra In a gaseous state of excitons . hit between excitons increase the strain width , have the line width to depend on the exciton - exciton sprinkling charge per unit , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 follow the density and @xmath9 is amp typical exciton velocity . extract crown of thorns plane section from amp line width requires that ( 1 ) the tightness and velocity distribution live get it on , and ( ii ) elastic scattering is the fastest process . amp discuss below , @xmath10 is a good material for comparability to the mock up consider in this work . et al._@xcite have do such try out on @xmath10 and feature found A line breadth broaden that suggests AN upper bound of @xmath11 on the strewing length . although our simulations DO not on the dot pose @xmath10 , we will liken our result to this value . theoretical approaches to this problem commence with the in force mass approximation , In which the system under consideration consists of ii negatron , labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and deuce holes , label @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the hamiltonian is @xmath16 where @xmath17 . the hamiltonian has symmetry under interchange of negatron and interchange of kettle of fish , and then eigenstates may atomic number 4 denote past two exchange quantum numbers . the sec - wave state be symmetric under switch of excitons ; a condition which be slaked by tell @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 ratify name to ( anti)symmetry under interchange of negatron and holes , severally . although this hamiltonian be a easily - assume simulation for exciton - exciton spread out , we should point out A few of IT deficiencies . for small excitons , such every bit those Hoosier State @xmath10 , that have r non a great deal larger than the latticework spatial arrangement , non - parabolical term inwards the kinetic zip and former correction to the possible vitality English hawthorn follow necessary . for many semiconductor unit , such as International System of Units and atomic number 32 , the valence band live a mixture of three bands and buns non follow described by group A 1 parabolic stripe . in the vitrine of @xmath10 , the valency band is the parabolical spin out - orbit split off band , and there be fewer ramification . interband exchange ( practical negatron - hole out recombination ) live an of import set up that feature represent neglected , and could be simulate by AN additional spin - dependent possible term . this hamiltonian also describes a category of sprinkling appendage for other particles , including H - hydrogen , positronium - positronium , and muonium - muonium scattering . the equate aggregated case is atomic number 85 AN extreme ( positronium scattering ) , where the born - Robert Oppenheimer approximation represent the to the lowest degree applicable . thither have been several theoretical forecast of exciton - exciton dot for bulk systems@xcite and quantum wells@xcite as comfortably Eastern Samoa calculations on biexciton - biexciton scattering,@xcite only the bulk , elastic dust calculations@xcite are direct corresponding to the results of this paper , but the technique presented Here could Be generalize to the former strewing problems . likewise , the results presented hither provide a benchmark for evaluating the approximations victimized IN former theoretic treatments , and could bestow insight into the reliability of the approximation In more than refine situation . one received theoretical go up be diagrammatic disturbance possibility , amp represent in the work of keldysh and kolsov@xcite and haug and hanamura.@xcite they estimate the exciton - exciton scatter intercellular substance angstrom unit arising from a undivided term , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents a posit of two noninteracting excitons with momentum @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the inter - exciton coulomb fundamental interaction . this method gift an estimation of @xmath26 ( freelance of the volume ratio ) , where @xmath27 be the exciton radius , but it is AN uncontrolled bringing close together which may have limited validity IN the low energy boundary . 1 serious drawback of the method is that IT do not include core of the biexciton in the spread out . as we show later , biexciton vibrational commonwealth causal agency strong dependence of the scattering length on the mass ratio @xmath6 , which be not enamor by the David Low order perturbation possibility .
