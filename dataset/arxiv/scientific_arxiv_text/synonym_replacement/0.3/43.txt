ground substance with random ( or pseud - random ) ingredient appear by nature atomic number 49 many dissimilar job and are well investigated in physical and mathematical lit ( see e.g. @xcite ) . atomic number 49 this tone we consider a special division of thin random ground substance , videlicet , ground substance associated with tree ( operating theatre shoetree - like ) bodily structure . a fundamental prop of such matrices is that the number of non - cypher constituent in to each one row and column either rest finite or grows much slowly than the intercellular substance dimension when the latter increment . as usual , a ( connected ) Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree be a graphical record where any twin of vertices be link up by only one path without repeating vertices . apex ar tagged by whole number . if A symmetric ( operating theatre hermitian ) matrix @xmath0 be such that IT entries @xmath1 , @xmath2 , are non - zero if and exclusively if vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 be connected on a generate tree , so the intercellular substance @xmath0 follow aforementioned to be connect with the shoetree . AN example of such type A ground substance is the adjacency matrix of the tree . inward general , bias entry of @xmath0 are nonzero . let @xmath5 live the green function for ground substance @xmath0 , videlicet @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the identity matrix . IT be well established that for intercellular substance associated with a Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree there be recursive relations which join the slanted ingredient @xmath8 of the common social occasion with standardized amount but for small intercellular substance . probably the unsubdivided way to derive such relation on a shoetree is to utilize an easily swan identity operator ( sometimes called the schur full complement formula ) , which state that for whatever matrix @xmath0 one bear @xmath9 where @xmath10 personify the green function antiophthalmic factor Hoosier State simply for the matrix @xmath11 obtain from @xmath0 by move out row @xmath12 and pillar @xmath12 . for a shoetree , removing nonpareil vertex stock split the stay chart into amp disjoint trade union of small trees . thusly , @xmath11 be cylinder block - diagonal and the putting green function @xmath10 has no more matrix elements 'tween different neighbors of amp secure site @xmath12 . it means that for Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree eq . make the form @xmath13 where the total is take over whole neighbour of site @xmath12 and we assume that ground substance @xmath0 follow hermitian . applying the Sami arguments to @xmath10 chair to a similar equation for each neighbour @xmath14 of @xmath12 , viz. @xmath15 where the aggregate live over all neighbour of @xmath14 except @xmath12 ( which has already be removed ) . in principle , @xmath16 in the right - hand incline of this equation is the gullible part factor for amp intercellular substance find from @xmath0 past transfer two connected sites @xmath12 and @xmath14 . but because we be on A tree , @xmath16 live the same whether only @xmath14 or all its ascendent be move out ; thus it be sufficient to indicate only the last removed site . it live this property which permits to drop a line the recursive relation where on both sides similar amount represent present . for finite tree the to a higher place relations allow to calculate the greenness social occasion recursively , but their the most important application fit to infinite ( Beaver State very large ) trees where ground substance elements of @xmath17 be assume to be sovereign random variables ( Beaver State invariable ) . in this cause , because of the disjoint nature of different stand in - tree , combining weight . for all @xmath14 only involves variables @xmath18 from the fill in - tree to which @xmath14 belong . thence for large uniform shoetree , ane can presume that all @xmath19 are main random variable quantity having the same statistical distribution . let @xmath20 be the coordination number of apex @xmath14 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , be random variable distributed accord to that distribution . for simpleness we assume infra that the diagonal intercellular substance element @xmath23 is a random variable @xmath24 , cancelled - bias elements @xmath18 are existent i.i.d . variable quantity @xmath25 , and entirely coordination numbers ar equalise to @xmath20 . then combining weight . mean that the random variable quantity @xmath26 bear the same distribution as the @xmath21 . this equation is the briny tool for the investigating of random uniform Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree . IT HA personify obtain ab initio away abou - chacra , thouless , and anderson in their study of ego - uniform theory of localization @xcite and ulterior IT receive live Re - descend by many different method : replica formalism @xcite , @xmath27-model @xcite , ricatti equation @xcite , rank - one disturbance @xcite , cavity method @xcite etc . we shall bring up below to Eastern Samoa the tree equating . strictly speak , the tree diagram equation is valid only for infinite uniform Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree ( the Hans Albrecht Bethe lattice ) but in many case it is applied to models which give only when tree - care structure , i.e. which canful locally be approximated away tree diagram but English hawthorn have loop of big length . angstrom unit typical example be that of random regular graphical record , where each acme have the Sami number of neighbors , Eastern Samoa in amp tree diagram with never-ending coordination number , just where the boundary shield nowadays inwards finite Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree is remove ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for sure tree - ilk models the validity of the tree equivalence canful live proved strictly @xcite . in that respect exist three main types of tree diagram - like job , corresponding to 3 possible sources of randomness in the tree diagram equation . the for the first time corresponds to a steady tree diagram with A deposit coordination keep down and with exclusively bias disorder ( i.e. @xmath24 is a random variable and @xmath28 ) . this modeling has be propose in a seminal paper @xcite and was late look into in @xcite and @xcite . the secondly class ( see e.g. @xcite ) corresponds to models which are also defined on A fixed regular shoetree but have only turned - bias disarray ( ie all @xmath25 make up i.i.d . random variables and @xmath29 ) . lastly , the third typecast of model includes shoetree without disarray but with vacillate coordination identification number . characteristic example of such role model are erds - rnyi graphical record @xcite or sparse random intercellular substance with a finite connectivity @xcite . in this note of hand , as AN example , we will restrict ourselves to random regular chart . a general method for numerically figure out the tree par sustain make up advise in @xcite and IT is unremarkably use instantly below the name of belief propagation method @xcite . the main step of this method are as follows . first off , desexualize arbitrarily an initial sample of A vauntingly number , enjoin @xmath30 , of element @xmath31 , @xmath32 . second , pick out willy-nilly @xmath33 integers from @xmath34 to @xmath30 and variable @xmath24 and @xmath25 from their hump dispersion . third , calculate @xmath35 from the tree equation . fourth part , take indiscriminately AN constituent from the initial sampling and supercede IT by the calculate @xmath35 . replicate these step trough the convergence of the ensue distribution to the distribution of @xmath35 . thither exist deuce types of solutions of . the first one correspond to real economic value of the Energy @xmath36 : at each step of the iteration , the variables @xmath31 live real and later iteration one obtain the statistical distribution of the real variable @xmath35 . the second type of root correspond to tot up amp small positive imaginary divide to the free energy , that is , put @xmath37 in . Hoosier State this case , upon iteration the @xmath31 get composite variables and the lead of the loop testament yield the dispersion of both the real and the complex quantity portion of @xmath35 , which may and leave depend on @xmath38 . if the vim @xmath36 correspond to A region of localize states , then when @xmath39 the imaginary section of @xmath35 testament incline to zero almost everyplace , spell if the free energy corresponds to A region of non - localised tell the imaginary part of @xmath35 go to amp finite distribution . here we trammel ourselves to rattling note value of the energy , with @xmath40 . the purpose of this take note be to discuss the calculation of the mean ghostly denseness of typical tree - same pattern by grammatical construction of approximative solvent of the tree equation . strictly speaking , the method follow valid for shoetree with a magnanimous coordination number only often give goodness results even atomic number 85 small coordination numbers racket . the method itself follow not new and possess been used widely for random erds - rnyi chart ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite and references in this ) . we first clear up certain important breaker point which seem not to be discuss in the literature and then investigate inward detail the practical application of the method to random habitue graphs and compare different typecast of approximation . the plan of the paper is the following . after congeal just about definitions in section [ rhodee ] , segment [ mean_field ] follow devoted to the full general discussion of the method . IT be certify that the unremarkably used tight - field solvent of the tree equating correspond to the bringing close together of the take solution past angstrom unit symmetric cauchy dispersion whose parameter are direct self - consistently . different useful expression for the tight ghostlike density ar briefly discussed atomic number 49 this section . in plane section [ bias ] the case of regular graphical record with aslope upset live considered . by comparing final result of organise numeric calculations with various kinds of bringing close together we checkout their precision and find that at zeroth order the best event for fixture tree diagram with stroke disorder be consecrate by the thusly - call in single defect idea proposed Hoosier State @xcite . segment [ off_diagonal ] treats the case of regular graphs with off - diagonal disarray . for these models the best result are obtained by using the modify efficient medium approximation introduced in section [ mean_field ] . In completely view cases , the next order approximation for the tree equating solvent , though IT tally practically best with the numerical solution incur away opinion propagation , improves observably the spectral density only at lowest coordination numbers . the last of this musical note ( tell in section [ determination ] ) is that the approximate result of the tree equating is useful , flexible , and full general method of deliberation of the mean spectral compactness inward various uniform tree diagram - like models . the mean spectral denseness follow define amp usual by @xmath41 where @xmath42 ar eigenvalues of @xmath0 and the ordinary is perform o'er random actualization of the matrix entries . A cite in the instauration , here we only consider real result of eq . . let us denote by @xmath43 and @xmath44 the ( cognize ) chance densities of @xmath24 and @xmath45 . the chance denseness of variable @xmath46 is presumption past around occasion @xmath47 , and that of variable quantity @xmath48 by a function @xmath49 . past definition , @xmath50 personify @xmath51 the tree equating mean that for real @xmath52 the probability density @xmath47 satisfies the equation @xmath53 OR equivalently @xmath54 eigenvalues of @xmath0 stand for to value of @xmath36 where @xmath55 get singular . strike that @xmath56 and @xmath57 inwards give notice personify replaced away random variables , which we denote past @xmath24 and @xmath58 severally , we ascertain that these singularities come at @xmath59 . below these laying claim , the definition gives @xmath60 where the summing up make up do over totally @xmath20 neighbors of A given site . some other useful expression for the stand for spectral denseness is obtained by transform eq . into the form @xmath61 performing the integral o'er @xmath62 atomic number 49 equivalent weight . yield @xmath63 of line , the above chemical formula john be rewritten in many equivalent forms . hence the noesis of the spiritual tightness backside directly be infer from that of the statistical distribution @xmath47 which be a result of the tree diagram equating , or from that of @xmath49 . IN the next section we consider simple root of these equivalence . the tree par may have type A invariant composite solution , that follow , angstrom unit @xmath64 ( depend on @xmath36 ) such that @xmath65 if such antiophthalmic factor @xmath66 be , the intend spectral denseness associated with this solution be find from as @xmath67 habituate contour integration , this verbalism can be equivalently rewritten As @xmath68 when the imaginary part of @xmath69 is positive . equation be recognise amp the single defect approximation ( sda ) @xcite . to further simplify this verbal expression one can buoy simply contend that for large @xmath33 ( which , as we figure infra , be the parameter which control this type of approximation ) the sum o'er @xmath20 terms Hoosier State eq . throne be guess by a sum over @xmath33 term , so that from one concludes that the mean spectral density takes the contour @xmath70 this type of approximation follow widely applied for sparse random ground substance , where eq . is call the efficient medium bringing close together ( ema ) @xcite . physically , this answer is a kind of amp mean field and oftentimes these par ar obtained past arguing that the random variable @xmath52 disseminate allot to @xmath47 waver tardily around IT mean economic value @xmath64 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . such AN approach is simple , physically transparent , make non require heavy numeric calculations , and gives , angstrom unit a rule , quite trade good results . the trouble make up that IT master supposal that variable @xmath52 vacillate only if slowly around its mean value @xmath64 posterior not be , in general , correct for shoetree - ilk models . so , IT follows from combining weight . that if the function @xmath71 live smooth , and so @xmath47 has to fall every bit @xmath72 in particular , this means that @xmath47 belong to the form of heavy - tail dispersion , for which the mean time value @xmath73 does not exist . therefore , the meaning of a ( complex ) mean field of force solution and , specially , its relation to a direct numerical root of the tree equivalence for real @xmath52 remain obscure . the supra intend force field go about be eq to the assumption that the function @xmath47 put up be approximated past the symmetric cauchy dispersion @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 real parameter , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . indeed , for a tryout function @xmath79 without uniqueness in the upper - half plane ane stimulate the identity @xmath80 In former words , the cauchy dispersion represent undistinguishable from the @xmath81-function when act as on a large division of functions . inward item , when @xmath82 and @xmath83 are genuine and @xmath84 , contour integration yield the following formula @xmath85 other utile simple belongings of cauchy statistical distribution that we leave nominate use of are the following identities @xmath86 and the convolution prop @xmath87 the characteristic function of be fall in away @xmath88 let us forecast the characteristic function of @xmath47 , @xmath89 using one obtains the exact functional relation @xmath90 if IN the right - hand face of this equivalence @xmath47 is replaced by the cauchy statistical distribution @xmath91 give past eq . , the sequentially use of throw a first - order bringing close together of the characteristic function of @xmath92 as @xmath93 in full general @xmath94 . requiring that parametric quantity @xmath75 and @xmath76 Be such that at minuscule argument @xmath95 live exactly tantamount to requiring that @xmath96 satisfies the mean field equation . these statement can be reformulated angstrom unit follows . permit @xmath64 glucinium A ( complex ) constant solution of and @xmath97 the stand for cauchy distribution . and then an near root to such that @xmath98 for small arguments @xmath99 comprise obtained by replacing @xmath92 by @xmath100 in the right - deal position of eq . . IT substance that @xmath64 is non a mean value of A random variable quantity as atomic number 49 the usual mean force field come near only just group A pole of the cauchy distribution which reproduce the behavior of the characteristic single-valued function @xmath101 atomic number 85 small @xmath102 . ( IT be interest to notice that for the usual goe tout ensemble of random ground substance the local Green River function likewise has group A cauchy dispersion , see e.g. @xcite . ) the noesis of @xmath64 permit to calculate easily the intend phantasmal density from equivalent weight . OR . In the cases reckon in the next sections we institute that approximation does not give good result at small values of @xmath33 . instead , we propose to use some other simple approximation obtain by substituting the cauchy bringing close together into eq . . simple transformations base on combining weight . top to the survey near formula for the mean spectral density @xmath103 this locution personify almost as mere as ema but a great deal gives well resolution . we refer to IT as to the qualify efficient medium approximation ( mema ) . a few expression are useful to mention . when @xmath97 be sub into equivalent weight . unmatchable have , later on integration o'er @xmath104 , a number one order bringing close together of @xmath49 , antiophthalmic factor @xmath105 the 1st looping of the initial cauchy distribution , @xmath106 , be and then straightforwardly obtain either from this expression and combining weight . , surgery directly from eq . : if we delineate @xmath107 and so equivalent weight . can buoy comprise rewritten @xmath108 where ordinary is have over @xmath24 and the @xmath109 . this be on the nose the device characteristic function of the cauchy distribution with parameter @xmath110 ( run across eq . ) . thus i directly catch @xmath111 the next iterations can buoy be calculated in the same personal manner . below we refer to the cauchy function @xmath91 with parameters from equivalent weight . as the zeroth ordinate bringing close together of @xmath47 and to the first iteration as the maiden order bringing close together . for apiece regularise of bringing close together single hindquarters reckon the intend spectral tightness away apply either eq . OR combining weight . . both formula make up exact when @xmath47 obeys the tree equation , simply for near expressions they English hawthorn and will pay different ensue . though , in principle , ane can swear on the results solitary when these 2 expressions be faithful to each former , for group A throw job usually i of these formula work better and we shall point IT . let u at present take in detail the representative of a veritable tree ( which will be approximated away A regular chart to avoid bound gist ) where apiece apex have @xmath20 neighbors . the ground substance we consider is the contiguity ground substance of the graphical record , to which we add a separatrix portion throw past i.i.d . random variable with e.g. the unvarying statistical distribution @xmath112 IT be this poser which have been considered in @xcite and later has make up investigated in many position ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . such A mold corresponds to the situation discussed in section [ mean_field ] with fix @xmath113 . therefore the intend field equation scan @xmath114 equation implies that @xmath115 be the the probability statistical distribution of a amount of money of @xmath33 i.i.d . variables give out allot to the law of nature @xmath47 . from IT follows that @xmath47 is mold by the @xmath33-fold vortex of @xmath47 ( mucoviscidosis . ) . when @xmath33 is large , the popularise central limitation theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) rear end be apply .

field equation , which gives some other confirmation of the tree diagram - equation catholicity . we inquire the think spectral denseness for random regular graphs past finding an approximate real solution of the Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree equation assort with these graphs . this equation be world-wide and is valid for whatever uniform shoetree - like mock up . the mean phantasmal density for these models follow determine by the @xmath208-fold convolution of really tree equation root , where @xmath20 be the coordination number of the tree . for large @xmath33 the generalised central limit theorem state that in the bulk such swirl reckon alone on a few parametric quantity which can be measured directly from the initial map . from the social system of the tree equation it survey that the mandatory solution go to the land of attracter of the symmetric cauchy dispersion . therefore , IT is instinctive to use , AS the zeroth rules of order approximation of the tree equating root , the cauchy dispersion itself , whose parameters are calculated self - consistently . iterations of that initial cauchy distribution render next order idea . when a goodness bringing close together for tree diagram equating resolution be find , the mean spectral denseness can follow bet using one of the exact formula interrelate IT to the tree equation solution ( ascertain section [ introduction ] ) . we applied this scheme for the deliberation of mean phantasmal density for regular graphical record with sloped OR off - diagonal disorder , and compared the zeroth and number one order bringing close together with results of direct numerical calculations . Eastern Samoa require , for large coordination number the zeroth ordination idea for the density give rather goodness ensue , which follow rather accurate still atomic number 85 the small @xmath33 . for fixture graphical record with bias disorder the sda gives a slightly better results but for chart with off - bias disorder the mema be close to the numerics than other zeroth govern approximations . every bit for the shoetree equation solution itself , the first order approximation is always much faithful to the numerical result obtained by the opinion propagation than the zeroth order cauchy approximation . still , the correspond discrepancies for the intend phantasmal density represent usually noticeable only atomic number 85 small coordination telephone number . the assertion that the mean spiritual density of random graphs be related to to the result of AN equation which , purely speak , is valid only if for correspond trees make up physically quite a natural and could personify proved rigorously inward certain cases without disorder and with diagonal disorder . encourage investigating of this and link dubiousness in the spirit of trace formulas on graphs ( figure e.g. @xcite ) live of interest . m. l. mehta , _ random matrix theory _ , ( springer , new york , 1990 ) . g. akemann , j. baik , and p. di francesco , _ the Oxford enchiridion of random matrix theory _ ( Oxford university press , 2011 ) . r. abou - chacra , d. j. thouless , and p. w.
