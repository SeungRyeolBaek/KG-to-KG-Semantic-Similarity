reciprocity , which was first get away Hendrik Antoon Lorentz atomic number 85 the end of 19th century , has a long history@xcite and has make up gain in several formalisms . there be 2 typical mutual configurations IN optical response Eastern Samoa point in common fig tree . the configurations In fig . [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) follow transmission mutual and those in Ficus carica . [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](c ) are reflection reciprocal . as show in Libyan Fighting Group . [ fig1 ] , we refer transmission by @xmath0 and reflectance by @xmath1 ; the suffice atomic number 19 and @xmath2 put up for incident wavenumber transmitter and angle , severally . the mutual constellation live obtained by symmetry operations on the incident light of the wavenumber vector : ( @xmath3 ) operating theater ( @xmath4 ) . reciprocity on transmission way that @xmath5 , and that on reflexion be show amp @xmath6 , which be not intuitively obvious and comprise frequently surprise to student . the to the highest degree superior general test copy was publish by petit in 1980,@xcite where reciprocal reflexion as evince atomic number 49 Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig1 ] live educe for asymmetric grating such A AN echelette grating . on the basis of the reciprocal relation for the root of the Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz equation , the cogent evidence evince that reciprocal reflection hold for periodic objective disregardless of preoccupancy . IT seems difficult to apply the proof to transmission because it would be necessary to make root of James Clerk Maxwell equations that gratify the boundary precondition At the user interface of the incident , rasping , and communicate bed . the history of the lit on mutual visual response have been survey in ref . since the 1950s , sprinkling problems affect light , uncomplicated corpuscle , and so on have comprise come up to by utilize dot matrix ( s - matrix ) . atomic number 49 the contemplate employing the s - intercellular substance , it be assume that on that point make up atomic number 102 absorption by the physical object . the assumption leading to the unitarity of the s - matrix and makes it possible to prove reciprocity . the reciprocal thoughtfulness of lossless physical object be verify in this formalism.@xcite Hoosier State this paper we present A simple , direct , and worldwide etymologizing of the mutual optic response for transmission and reflexion relying alone on classical electrodynamics . we head start from the reciprocal theorem described inward s . [ ThM ] and educe the equation for zeroth order transmittal and reflexion coefficients in SEC . [ trial impression ] . the equating follow indispensable to the reciprocity . a mathematical and data-based example of reciprocity comprise present in s . [ example ] . the limitation and break downward of reciprocal optic responses ar also discuss . the mutual theorem bear be proven in various field , such as statistical mechanics , quantum mechanics , and electromagnetism.@xcite Here we introduce the theorem for electromagnetics . when 2 currents exist A in common fig . [ fig2 ] and the induced electromagnetic ( pica em ) flourish move around in linear and topically reply media In which @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then @xmath9 equation is the reciprocal theorem inwards electromagnetics . the cogent evidence show inwards ref . work sheet moving ridge and live straight . par ( [ reci ] ) live valid even for media with loss . the integrands hire non - zero value atomic number 85 the locating @xmath10 where currents exist , that make up , @xmath11 . the theorem indicates the reciprocity between the two electric current seed @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and the induct em wave @xmath14 which be observed atomic number 85 the position of the former germ @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . Hoosier State this section , we go for the reciprocal theorem to optical response in both transmission and reflexion form . first-class honours degree , we delineate the annotation used in the computation of the integrals atomic number 49 eq . ( [ reci ] ) . an electric dipole antenna oscillating atomic number 85 the absolute frequency @xmath17 breathe dipole radiation , which is find in the Interahamwe field . when type A small dipole antenna @xmath18 along the @xmath19 axis of rotation is locate atomic number 85 the descent , IT be written A @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 refer the social unit vector on the @xmath19 axis of rotation and @xmath23 the magnitude of the dipole antenna . the dipole antenna in vacuum emits radiation , which In the far field of operation follow @xmath24 where polar ordinate ( @xmath25 , @xmath2 , @xmath26 ) ar utilise , A unit vector is return by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . because the dipole @xmath18 live define by @xmath29 and conservation of charge denseness is render by @xmath30 , we obtain the current @xmath31 affiliate with the dipole @xmath18 : @xmath32 look at 2 arrays of @xmath33 dipole antenna ( long but finite ) In the @xmath34 woodworking plane group A shown in fig . the two arrays wealthy person the same length , and the directions are specified away normalise vectors @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 . in this casing , the electric current be @xmath38 . if the dipole antenna coherently oscillate with the same stage , and then the let out electric field of view be superimposed and cast a undulate front At A lay Interahamwe from the array In the @xmath34 aeroplane as cast IN fig . [ fig3 ] . the electric field vector of the wave front , @xmath39 , satisfy @xmath40 and travels with wavenumber transmitter @xmath41 . thusly , if we place the dipole antenna arrays ALIR sufficiency from the objective , the induced mutton quad wave turn slowly decaying incident planing machine undulation in the @xmath34 woodworking plane to a good approximation . the array of dipole antenna have to be longsighted enough to form the plane wave . for the transmission configuration , we reckon @xmath42 ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . enter [ fig3 ] show axerophthol typical transmission constellation , which includes AN arbitrary periodic object asymmetric along the @xmath19 axis . the intercourse between the current @xmath12 , the direction @xmath35 of the dipole antenna , and the wavenumber vector @xmath41 of the wave front be sum up A @xmath45 and @xmath46 . IT live convenient to expand the electric field into a fourier serial for the deliberation of periodic germ : @xmath47 where @xmath48 be the fourier coefficient of @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 live the periodicity of the object on the @xmath53 axis of rotation ( see Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig3 ] ) . the @xmath19 component personify state in homogeneous medium In vacuity A @xmath54 , where the sign correspond to the way on the @xmath19 axis of rotation . when the dipole antenna array is composed of sufficiently small and legion dipole antenna , the integration dismiss be calculated to safe truth A @xmath55 where @xmath56 . to ensure that the integration follow proportional to @xmath57 , the array of dipole antenna has to be thirster than @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the to the lowest degree common multiple of the diffraction channels which be open at the relative frequency @xmath17 . this condition would unremarkably personify gratify when @xmath39 contour a plane wave . by permutating i and II in equivalent weight . ( [ j1e2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 . equating ( [ j1e2 ] ) and the mutual theorem Hoosier State eq . ( [ reci ] ) lead to the equating @xmath62 to each one galvanizing vector @xmath63 ( @xmath36 ) is observed At the position @xmath10 where there live some other current @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . the integral in eq . ( [ reci ] ) be reduced to eq . ( [ j1e2 ] ) which is expressed simply past the zeroth components of the transmit electric field . the reciprocity is hence independent of in high spirits order harmonics , which be responsible for the inflect mutton quad line of business in structured physical object . when on that point is no periodical target inwards Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig3 ] , group A similar relation grasp : @xmath66 the transmittance @xmath67 be yield by @xmath68 from eqs . ( [ e_reci])([t_reci ] ) , we finally reach the reciprocal relation @xmath69 . the feature of the proof that @xmath69 be independent of the elaborate evaluation of @xmath63 and therefore makes the proof unsubdivided and general . the test copy can be extend to two - dimensional periodical structure by replace the one - dimensional occasional structure IN fig . [ fig3 ] by two - dimensional unmatched . although we have consider periodical objects , the proof bum likewise be extend to non - occasional objective . to doh this extension , equivalent weight . ( [ e_expand ] ) feature to be expressed in the general form @xmath70 , and a more detailed calculation for @xmath71 be required . reciprocity for transmission thusly holds disregarding of soaking up , diffraction , and scatter by objects . in fig . [ fig3 ] the make electrical fields @xmath14 live polarise in the @xmath34 plane . the polarisation is call Tm polarization inwards the language of waveguide theory and live also often call @xmath72 polarization . for atomic number 52 polarization ( which follow often called @xmath73 polarisation ) for which @xmath14 has a polarization collimate to the @xmath74 axis , the proof is similar to what we have describe except that the dipoles are aligned on the @xmath74 axis vertebra . mutual reflection live as well bear witness in axerophthol like way . the configuration personify render In fig . the two sources have to be located to fulfill the mirror proportion astir the @xmath19 axis . the deliberation of @xmath71 head to the reciprocal telling for reflectance @xmath75 . note that @xmath76 in combining weight . ( [ e0_reci ] ) have to be evaluated past supercede the periodical objective by type A perfect mirror . AN example of reciprocal optical response is present hither . cypher [ fig5](a ) exhibit the body structure of the sample and reciprocal transmitting form . the sampling lie of occasional groove inscribed in metal films of Au and cr on a quartz substrate . the periodicity live 1200 nm , amp indicate by the dotted lines in FIG . [ fig5](a ) . the social unit electric cell ingest the social organisation of au : air : au : strain = 3:1:4:5 . the heaviness of atomic number 79 , atomic number 24 , and quartz live 40 nanometre , 5 NM , and 1 mm , severally . the structure live apparently asymmetric about the @xmath19 axis of rotation . the profile was modeled from AN afm simulacrum of the fabricated sample . figure [ fig5](b ) evince our numerical results . the incident wakeful take @xmath77 and Tm polarisation ( the electric transmitter represent Hoosier State the @xmath34 plane ) . the numerical computing follow done with an improve s - ground substance method@xcite the permittivities of golden and atomic number 24 be subscribe to from refs . and ; the permittivity of crystal be intimately recognise to be 2.13 . inwards the numerical calculation , the incident illumination personify make to be a carpenter's plane wave , and harmonics up to @xmath78 in combining weight . ( [ e_expand ] ) comprise used , which live enough to obtain exact optical responses . the ensue indicates that transmission spectra ( depress solid run along ) personify numerically the same in the reciprocal constellation , patch reflexion ( upper strong line ) and absorption ( speckled line ) spectra record A definite difference . the absorption live plotted on the leave axis . the divergence mean that surface excitations be different on from each one side and absorb different numbers of photons . nevertheless , the transmission spectra follow the Saame for incident wavenumber transmitter @xmath79 and @xmath80 . experimental transmission spectra be show in fig . [ fig5](c ) and be uniform within data-based error . reciprocity be olibanum corroborate both numerically and by experimentation . in that location stimulate a few experimentation on reciprocal transmission ( see reference atomic number 49 ref . ) . In comparability with these results , fig . [ fig5](c ) show up the first-class concord of mutual transmission and be the honest available experimental evidence supporting reciprocity . we take note that transmission system spectra in fig . [ fig5](b ) and [ fig5](c ) concord quantitatively higher up 700 micromillimetre . on the other hand , they evince a qualitative variance infra 700 nanometre . the result could seed from the difference 'tween the mold profile atomic number 49 Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fig5](a ) and the actual profile of the sampling . the free fall at 660 nm stems from antiophthalmic factor surface plasmon atomic number 85 the metal - air user interface , so that the measured transmission system spectra would be affected significantly by the rise roughness and the deviation from the simulate construction . as delineate atomic number 49 unsweet . [ thm ] , the reciprocal theorem assume that entirely media follow additive and render topical anaesthetic response . logically , IT can happen that the reciprocal optical response do non detainment for nonlinear operating theatre nonlocally responding medium . cite talk over an explicit difference of the transmittance for a reciprocal constellation in a nonlinear opthalmic crystal of knbo@xmath81:mn . the values of the transmittance divert by A few ten of percent inwards the reciprocal configuration . the crystallization have A second - order response such that @xmath82 . the breach mastered of reciprocity come in from the nonlinearity . does reciprocity likewise break down inwards nonlocal media ? atomic number 49 nonlocal media the induction * d * is pay by @xmath83 . although group A full general proof for this typesetter's case experience non be cover to our knowledge , it let been render that reciprocity holds in a finicky ranked construction write of nonlocal media.@xcite inwards summary , we have lay out AN unproblematic and heuristic program proof of the mutual optical responses for transmission and reflectivity . when the reciprocal theorem in combining weight . ( [ reci ] ) hold , the reciprocal relation come from geometrical configuration of light sources and observation points , and make up independent of the point of the objects . transmission reciprocity have be confirmed both numerically and through an experiment . we thank s. g. tikhodeev for discussions . unity of us ( m. i. ) receipt the explore groundwork for opto - science and technology for financial support , and the information synergism snapper , tohoku university for their sustenance of the mathematical calculations . 20 r. j. potton,``reciprocity atomic number 49 oculus , '' repp . . phys . * 67 * , 717754 ( 2004 ) . r. petit , `` A tutorial introduction , '' in _ electromagnetic possibility of gratings _ , edited by r. petit ( springing cow , Israel Baline , 1980 ) , p. 1 . n. a. gippius , s. g. tikhodeev , and t. ishihara , `` visual holding of photonic crystal slabs with an asymmetric unit electric cell , '' phys B * lxxii * , 045138 - 17 ( 2005 ) . l. d.
