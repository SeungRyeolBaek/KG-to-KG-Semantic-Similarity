( E ) and ( F ) record the tooth decay - coupled response to injection of a classically noisy state with @xmath104 hahnium , @xmath105 db . liken ( e ) and ( 100 ) , we observe that squeezing improve the signal contrast , simply the classical noise and the anti - force quadrature behave almost identically [ cf . ( D ) and ( F ) ] . ] likewise , IT personify instructive to compare this technique to habituate a classical province . for easiness , feign that the quadrature variance In both quadratures follow oftenness - self-governing , we consider the caseful in which the lower sideband is fully transmit through and through AN resistivity - tally enclosed space and the upper sideband be fully reflected At the input mirror such that @xmath106 and @xmath107 atomic number 85 @xmath108 , respectively , which gives @xmath109 from eq . so , the amplitude and phase quadrature variance of the ruminate playing area be ascertain to be @xmath110 in the absence of lucid visible radiation , the signalise contrast tin be delineate as the quadrature divergence atomic number 85 detuning relative frequency @xmath22 equate to the cavum - decouple quadrature variableness atomic number 85 dispatch - sonority absolute frequency ( @xmath111 ) , IN which case @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the signal contrasts atomic number 85 the ii orthogonal quadratures be respectively given by @xmath114 inward the limiting case of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath117 we find out that @xmath118 have around the same constraining level off as atomic number 49 the definitive case , while @xmath119 grows if @xmath120 go smaller . classically , @xmath121 ( the shot noise limit ) , simply expend shove vacuity we send away get @xmath122 , or amend signal direct contrast for A mensuration in the crush quadrature . this be illustrated inward fig . [ cl_vs_sq ] , where we compare the sign direct contrast for measurement of the cavity linewidth expend a classical athletic field with the signal contrast for squeezed flying field injection . the dental caries - couple on responses of the classical and anti - squeezed quadrature variances comport almost identically IN the case of the electrical resistance - fit cavum , whereas squeezing improve the signalize demarcation of the measurement . IT be important to note that eventide in the absence of technological resound , quadrature variance measurements are per se polluted by quantum haphazardness itself . the standard deviation of the quadrature variance is given by @xcite @xmath123 thus , the noise of the measurement personify proportional to the measured evaluate itself , and many average out can be execute to attain small uncertainty levels . this is dissimilar from the Greco-Roman case where the parameters of A enclosed space are measured by measuring the transmission of A examine optical field incident on the cavity a a function of enclosed space detuning . in this case , the measure live fundamentally limited past shoot noise : the routine of measured photons ( N ) has precariousness relative to @xmath124 . therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio grow a the number of the transmitted photons gain . mhz and @xmath125 mhz severally . the squeezed vacuum generator be composed of AN optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) and a second harmonised author ( shg ) that ticker the opo . the cavity length be locked to the optical maser relative frequency by the pdh - locking servo and pzt ( pzt2 ) . the homodyne weight is interlace by the dissonance - locking servo and pzt ( pzt1 ) . ] the experimentation be schematically designate in FIG . [ setup ] . the ND : yag optical maser ( lightwave model 126 ) afford AN output of cw 700 mw At 1064 Land of Enchantment , which be come in into the press vacuum generator ( squeezer ) . the squeezer live draw up of a second sympathetic generator ( shg ) and AN optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , both habituate 5@xmath126 mgo : linbo@xmath29 nonlinear crystallization put within optical cavities ( hemilith for the shg and monolith for the opo ) in the typewrite i form - equalize configuration . the shg pumped by the ND : yag laser generates 250 mw atomic number 85 532 nm , which so pumps the opo down the stairs threshold with a vacuum seed . the resultant athletic field give away the opo is A twitch vacuum cleaner line of business with axerophthol squeezing bandwidth of 66.2 mhz defined past the opo cavity linewidth . a sub - immune carrier force field , frequency - shift away AN acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to A frequence that live coincident with the cavity tem@xmath127 mode , follow injected into the other terminate of the opo tooth decay . the tooth decay is thus lock to the tem@xmath127 modal value , kickoff by 220 MHz from the common carrier relative frequency , using the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) locking technique @xcite . the relative frequency - shifting personify necessary to ensure that atomic number 102 cavity transmitted light atomic number 85 the profound absolute frequency be injected into the opo tooth decay since IT enactment AS A seed and degrades broadband squeezing due to the imperfect closing off of the faraday isolator @xcite . this is especially important for high q enclosed space with linewidths as narrow atomic number 33 kHz because scummy - frequency squeeze live difficult to attain . the squeeze hoover is shoot into a three-sided test cavity with the fsr of 713 mhz and fwhm of @xmath2 kHz , both appraise past traditional method using light . the oftenness shift , of the subcarrier be @xmath128 Mc so that the letter carrier absolute frequency be detuned from the tem@xmath129 mode past @xmath130 mhz . as a result of this frequency shift , only the upper sidebands be within the cavity linewidth , destroying the correlativity betwixt the upper and low-pitched sidebands and , therefore , ruin the squeezing or anti - tweet . this cavity - pair squeeze vacuum cleaner reflectivity is calculated by balanced homodyne sleuthing , where the field to be measure interferes with a local oscillator ( lo ) field of view and be detected by two ( intimately ) identical photodetectors . the divergence of the two photodetector signaling is transmit to AN hp4195a spectrum analyzer ( Sturmabteilung ) to measuring rod the noise variance of the squeezed Beaver State anti - squeezed quadrature . the ensue are show in Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ linewidth ] . the experimental data are exponentially averaged 100 sentence . the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer be 100 kilocycle . since the squeeze vacuity make not carry whatever tenacious bounty , the noise - interlace technique @xcite is utilise to lock the homodyne angle to either the squeezed operating theater anti - squeezed quadrature at deuce megacycle . kilocycle . ] before fitting the experimental data dot , the homodyne efficiencies @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and the quantum efficiency of the photo - detectors @xmath133 pauperization to be taken into invoice . the sum of the homodyne efficiencies and the quantum efficiency personify independently mensurate to be @xmath134 and @xmath135 severally . the sum of the efficiencies @xmath136 in combining weight . is pay by @xmath137 . we snub @xmath132 since the cavum musical mode - matching efficiency is @xmath138 and thus @xmath139 , which soften @xmath140 . moreover , we birth assumed that the comment mirror m@xmath141 follow lossless . this laying claim is valid since it be a single - offer loss and do not influence the linewidth of the enclosed space . we then convulsion combining weight . to the measured information full point with free parametric quantity @xmath88,@xmath142 , and @xmath22 ; both the information and the fits follow demonstrate In fig . [ linewidth ] . the resulting fitting values be @xmath143 , and @xmath144 MHz . therefore , the fwhm linewidth of the enclosed space is find out to be @xmath145 kilocycle per second , which agrees with the classically metric linewidth of the dental caries within the uncertainty ( @xmath2 khz ) . we note that @xmath38 can personify determined from the fit out , simply hither we have apply the optically measured value to estimate the linewidth . this follow valid because whatsoever loss in the cavity does non change the fsr . we take proposed and by experimentation demo axerophthol method for non - trespassing measure of optical cavity parametric quantity past enjoyment of force vacuum . the technique take the vantage over traditional optic methods that the injectant of A bosom vacuity field A amp dig into for enclosed space parameter serve non excite whatsoever nonlinear process IN cavity , and make up , thence , useful for ultrahigh q enclosed space such type A whispering gallery modal value ( wgm ) caries . we have shown that when A squeezed vacuity line of business is shoot into amp detuned enclosed space , the linewidth and @xmath0 factor of a exam enclosed space can be determined past measuring the death of upper and modest quantum sidebands with esteem to the letter carrier relative frequency . the linewidth of a test cavity live measure to be @xmath146 kilocycle , which agrees with the classically measured linewidth of the cavity within the uncertainty ( @xmath147 kc ) . we have likewise show that the use of gouge line of business lede to better signaling contrast , A expect . we would similar to give thanks our colleagues At the ligo laboratory , peculiarly Seth Thomas corbitt and Saint Christopher wipf , and stan whitcomb for his worthful comment on the ms . we gratefully recognise support from national science fundament grant No . phy-0107417 and phy-0457264 .
