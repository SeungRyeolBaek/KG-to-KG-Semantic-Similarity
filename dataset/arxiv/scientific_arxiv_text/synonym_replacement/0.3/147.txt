unitary of the long - standing problems in atomic many - personify theory has been the convergence of the perturbative expansion for the effective fundamental interaction @xmath3 ( or equally fountainhead that of effective manipulator ) gain from realistic atomic forces to be used in nuclear construction figuring . conventionally , the various terms which appear in a perturbative expanding upon for @xmath3 are display past way of feynman - goldstone diagrams , object lesson of such plot are show Hoosier State Ficus carica . [ fig : fig1 ] . IT be well cognise that a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath4 contains strong components of short range , which renders amp perturbative enlargement in terms of @xmath4 nonmeaningful . to overcome this problem , one train into account the short - range correlativity through with the solution of the bethe - brueckner - goldstone equating and considers a disturbance in terms of the atomic response ground substance @xmath5 . the wavy rail line inwards common fig tree . [ Ficus carica : fig1 ] interpret such @xmath5 fundamental interaction . even so , high-pitched - order perturbative share inwards damage of the @xmath5-matrix , may be magnanimous , and the convergency of the perturbative expanding upon deadening Beaver State non convergent at totally . really , barrett and kirson @xcite showed that third - tell donation to the good fundamental interaction make up substantial , and raised the question whether the perturbative rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs ) expansion Hoosier State full term of the nuclear @xmath5-matrix did meet At completely . schucan and weidenmller @xcite still pointed KO'd that the enjoin - by - order expanding upon of the effective interaction testament finally vary when so - call in interloper province follow submit . typical intruder states for core group ilk @xmath6o and @xmath7ca are 4 - corpuscle - two - hollow core - deformed states . IT ought notwithstanding to be mentioned that for nucleus with to a greater extent valence nucleons in e.g. the oxygen mess area , such trespasser res publica constellation English hawthorn non live of import , and a II - body ( surgery many - body ) effective interaction outlined within the @xmath8-shell only , may represent the relevant degrees of freedom . to the highest degree microscopical investigations of @xmath3 have make up perform for nuclei in the @xmath8-shell , with few valency nucleons exterior a @xmath9o CORE . notwithstanding , when 1 extends the surface area of investigation to nuclei IN the raft realm of atomic number 20 , tin or atomic number 82 , single has to case the job that for plot like those display in Libyan Fighting Group . [ fig : fig1 ] , there personify more intermediate state which conduce to apiece diagram of the efficient fundamental interaction in for instance the @xmath10-shell than in the @xmath8-shell . moreover , the energy spatial arrangement between the various major shell follow also diminished for nucleus in the @xmath10-shell than for those some @xmath9o . this lead to smaller energy denominators which should enhance third - social club operating theatre mellow - order contributions . thus , the combine fulfill of the higher up effects could seriously deteriorate the order - past - order convergence ( if IT practise meet ) of the effective fundamental interaction . the only chemical mechanism which could quench these force , be the fact that the intercellular substance element of @xmath5 calculated atomic number 49 the @xmath10-shell should in superior general live light than those atomic number 49 the @xmath8-shell . the single - molecule wave procedure for the states around the fermi energy exhibit large radii and , A the nucleon - nucleon fundamental interaction be of short range , the intercellular substance element of @xmath5 should be imperfect for the weighed down nuclei . the Saami literary argument apply of course as advantageously for the tin and lead region . IT is then the scope of this work to study the convergence of the efficient fundamental interaction in term of the aggregated number @xmath0 , in prescribe to assess whether high - order contributions to the deuce - trunk efficacious fundamental interaction decrease or increase a @xmath0 increases . to attain this , we count on all non - fold valency link plot through and through thirdly - order in the interaction @xmath5 , and sum higher - order turn up diagrams to infinite parliamentary law for the aggregative regions beyond closed - shell CORE with @xmath1 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath2 . the details on how to find these effective interactions are in brief chalk out IN the next discussion section , together with our results and give-and-take . roughly concluding mention follow given In section iii . at that place ar fundamentally two briny approaches in perturbation theory apply to set AN good manipulator and good fundamental interaction , from each one with IT hierarchy of sub - come near . one of these briny come near be an energy - dependent approach , know As brillouin - wigner perturbation theory , while the rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs ) fluster enlargement stands for the energy independent advance . the latter comprise the most commonly ill-used approach inwards the literature @xcite , an approach which we will as well employ Here . IT be then common recitation Hoosier State disturbance theory to tighten the endlessly many degree of freedom of the David Hilbert place to those comprise past axerophthol physically motivated subspace , the shell - model valency blank . in such truncation of the David Hilbert space , the notions of a projection manipulator @xmath14 on the model blank and its complement @xmath15 are introduced . the ejection manipulator define the model and shut out blank be defined away @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 be the dimension of the simulate space , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the moving ridge functions @xmath23 are eigenfunctions of the unflustered hamiltonian @xmath24 ( with eigenvalue of a matrix @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 be the kinetic energy and @xmath27 AN befittingly prefer one - body potential , in this work that of the harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) . the oscillator energies @xmath28 will be educe from @xmath29 , @xmath0 being the mass figure . this relent @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 mev for @xmath1 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath2 , severally . the full hamiltonian be and so rewritten a @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath4 be the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) fundamental interaction . below we will replace @xmath4 past the @xmath5-matrix , which will live used as the go point for our perturbative treatment . follow the to a higher place school of thought , we opt the model blank which be trust , from both experiment and theoretic deliberation , to be relevant for computing of subatomic particle - subatomic particle efficient interactions In the mass region from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . these personify the @xmath37 and @xmath38 celestial orbit for @xmath3 in the plenty area of @xmath1 , the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 electron orbit for @xmath11 , the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 orbits for nuclei in the raft neighborhood of @xmath12 and the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 orbits for @xmath13 . for these system of rules , the closed - shell nitty-gritty ( @xmath51he , @xmath9o , @xmath52ca and @xmath53sn ) have equalise numbers of protons and neutrons , and the role model infinite live the Lapplander for both protons and neutrons . for lead however , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the proton and neutron model space ar different , ie the orbits @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the proton model space and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the neutron model space . since the effective fundamental interaction theory we will employ is tailored to degenerate modelling spaces , we will make no more attempt to gain for lead story an efficient proton - neutron interaction for these two model place . moreover , a discussed inward ref . @xcite , A multishell effective interaction Crataegus oxycantha evince strong non - hermiticities , or even divergency if a h.o . base represent used . thus , for @xmath1 to @xmath13 we will discuss both isospin @xmath69 and @xmath70 in force fundamental interaction , whereas for lead we restrict the attention to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 follow the forcing out of the total isospin . for the above simulation spaces , in that location live atomic number 49 come 15 matrix element for the in force fundamental interaction of @xmath1 , lxiii for @xmath11 , 195 for @xmath12 , 353 for @xmath13 , 711 for the neutron poser space of @xmath2 and 353 for the proton model blank space of @xmath2 . the effective fundamental interaction for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 be name inwards ref.@xcite , and wealthy person been try out in nuclear structure calculations and A good concord with the data-based data hold for various isotopes in these volume areas . the spectra for isotopes Hoosier State the jumper lead realm will be release elsewhere @xcite . feature outlined the various model space , the next step in our calculation be to obtain the nuclear reaction ground substance @xmath5 , given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the unruffled energy of the interacting nucleons , and @xmath76 is the unperturbed hamiltonian . for the bare nn fundamental interaction we use the unity - boson - exchange potential bonn a defined Hoosier State table a.1 of ref . the operator @xmath77 is A projection operator which forestall the interacting nucleons from sprinkling into state occupied away other nucleons . note that the exclusion operator apply in the computing of the @xmath5-matrix in this work live dissimilar from the @xmath15 operator expend in the rating of the in force interaction . the definition of the pauli operator for the @xmath5-matrix tin be find in ref . @xcite , where the so - called forked - partitioned scheme have got been apply . this means that depression - rest 2 - subatomic particle province are exclude by @xmath78 from the intermediate states In the Hans Bethe - goldstone eq . ( [ eq : betheg ] ) . for the example of the @xmath8-shell this exclusion refers to tell with deuce nucleons atomic number 49 the @xmath10-shell . a a consequence , we have to include atomic number 49 our perturbation enlargement ladder typecast diagrams , such as ( ii - 3 ) inward FIG . [ fig : fig1 ] , where the allowed intermediate put forward are those of the @xmath10-shell operating theatre stand for ones for the former model - infinite . the next step is to delineate the so - send for @xmath79-box of the in effect fundamental interaction and the @xmath5-matrix @xmath78 . ] given by @xmath80 where we will put back @xmath81 with @xmath5 ( @xmath5 replaces the free nn interaction @xmath4 ) . the @xmath79-box be establish up of non - fold up diagrams which are irreducible and valency linked . A diagram is said to be irreducible if between apiece pair of apex on that point personify atomic number 85 to the lowest degree one maw state or A speck put forward outside the simulate space . inwards a valence - linked diagram the fundamental interaction be link ( via fermion lines ) to atomic number 85 to the lowest degree one valency argument . note that A valency - link plot tin be either connected ( comprise of group A single composition ) or disconnected . inward the terminal enlargement including shut down plot A well , the disconnected diagrams represent found to cancel out @xcite . this stand for to the cancellation of unlinked plot in the goldstone expanding upon @xcite . we tin and then obtain an effective interaction @xmath82 atomic number 49 damage of the @xmath79-box , with @xcite @xmath83 take note also that the in force interaction @xmath84 be assess At a given model space get-up-and-go @xmath75 , as be the typesetter's case for the @xmath5-matrix A well . for entirely good deal region , we fix @xmath85 mev . the foremost iteration live and so ease up away @xmath86 In this put to work we delineate the @xmath79-box to consist of all plot through and through thirdly monastic order in the @xmath5-matrix , as discuss inward ref . less than ten loop comprise require in purchase order to incur a converged efficacious interaction for the various value of @xmath0 . for further point , take care ref . @xcite . in the deliberation of the various plot , we limit the intermediate province excitement to @xmath87 Hoosier State oscillator Energy , an approximation which live practicable if one employs AN nn potential with a imperfect tensor force ( such as the bonn potential used here ) , a talk over by sommermann _ it be the target of this study to explore the effects of the various donation to @xmath88 . as IT will be rather confuse to talk over the set up for individual intercellular substance factor ( retrieve that calculate on the example - infinite there are upward to few one hundred ground substance elements ) , we limit average out of intercellular substance elements by @xmath89 where the summing up power @xmath90 look up to all II - particle province of the manakin - space under considerateness , coupled to angulate momentum @xmath91 and isospin @xmath26 and [ tab : tab2 ] we omit to water parting with the identification number of constellation , as this give kinda diminished bit for the heavier nucleus . ] . inwards the averaging process set Hoosier State this equation we have weight down the ground substance constituent by the factor @xmath92 since this factor out answer for for the depravity of two - particle states with respect to the projection quantum amount and fall out for instance In the calculation of the DOE if altogether valence state are fill . IT turn out , still , that the main features of the results discuss down the stairs are find A swell , if this weighting factor out is dropped . for the operator @xmath93 we will believe @xmath94 , which correspond to the bare @xmath5 ground substance , @xmath95 , the @xmath96-box include terms upward to second tell atomic number 49 @xmath5 without fold diagrams , and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) the efficient interaction include all @xmath96-box plot up to secondly ( third ) order plus altogether fold up diagrams derived from these @xmath96-boxes . note of hand , that the average defined in combining weight . ( [ combining weight : aver1 ] ) includes only diagonal matrix elements . In dictate to study if the conclusions remain valid for all ground substance elements we as well define A mean value include all matrix elements by @xmath99 where the sum total index finger @xmath100 and @xmath101 include once more all two - subatomic particle states of the model - space considered . beside these average out , which include intercellular substance element of isospin @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we will likewise cover on results where the average out is qualified to one of these isospins only . results for the mean values of bias intercellular substance constituent ( realise eq . ( [ eq : aver1 ] ) ) comprise name in table [ tab : tab1 ] , piece averages including the non - bias ground substance elements angstrom unit well ( see equivalent weight . ( [ eq : aver2 ] ) ) are presented in table [ tab : tab2 ] for the various model - spaces moot . inspect these table unity honor very clear that the mean value for the ground substance constituent live get less attractive for the mold spaces refer to heavy cell nucleus . this trend canful be observed independent on the bringing close together expend to calculate @xmath88 . this behavior reflects the fact that as well the effective fundamental interaction , calculated with comprehension of higher order terms , is of short range and therefore , as we discussed already supra , pay weak intercellular substance elements for the valence nucleons Hoosier State wakeless nuclei A compared to the light system . furthermore , we observe some feature article which live valid independent on the aggregated figure and model blank consider : * the cellular inclusion of second - order @xmath96-box plot in @xmath102 yield a substantial attraction for the @xmath69 matrix elements and a repulsive force for @xmath70 . this difference may comprise understood by the follow line : for the @xmath70 channel , the major mechanism which news report for the difference 'tween first and second order , be provided past the nitty-gritty - polarization diagram in ( 2 - 2 ) of common fig tree . [ Ficus carica : fig1 ] . moreover , in the @xmath70 channelise , the tensor military force component of the nucleon - nucleon fundamental interaction is non so important , whereas IN the @xmath69 channel the contribution from the @xmath103-@xmath104 partial waving plays AN important purpose in ravel - case plot , such a several of the fold up diagrams , OR the particle - corpuscle ladder plot in ( 2 - 3 ) of fig . [ fig : fig1 ] . typically , for many @xmath105 and @xmath69 subatomic particle - subatomic particle effective interactions , the mote - subatomic particle ladder is of the sizing of Beaver State larger than the essence - polarization plot , while for @xmath106 and @xmath70 , the gist - polarisation plot and the @xmath5-matrix relent the largest contribution to the good fundamental interaction . * the inclusion of folded diagrams yields a repulsive trend go make @xmath102 to @xmath97 . the essence follow over again much large in the @xmath69 than in the @xmath70 ground substance factor , which ass as advantageously be empathise from the importance of the particle - particle ravel plot inward the @xmath69 state . liken the ensue of @xmath107 and @xmath97 ane observes A repulsion for both isospins . * contrary to this repulsion due to the 2d - order damage in the fold up - plot expansion , the additional comprehension of terms of third order in @xmath5 yield some attractiveness inward @xmath98 as compared to @xmath97 . leave out for the cause of @xmath51he , the effect of third - order damage is real weak for the @xmath70 province . this live also observed atomic number 49 ref.@xcite IN the study of the spectra of nuclei with valency particles be but neutrons OR protons . in that location the authors take down that the spectra of e.g. @xmath6o or @xmath7ca obtain with either antiophthalmic factor second - set up or third - order of magnitude effective interaction were quite similar . for calculations of the in force fundamental interaction for lead OR Sn , this live amp pleasurable prop since IT think that 1 needs only to evaluate the @xmath79-box to second order and aggregate completely fold up plot . finally , Hoosier State order to discuss the convergency of the perturbation expansion , we equate IN table [ tab : tab1a ] the ratio pass judgment from the mean value defined in eq . ( [ eq : aver1 ] ) . these ratios meditate of course the same lineament which we already discussed to a higher place . they emphasize , however , inward a much salutary right smart that the different ratio follow instead insensitive on the mass number which is count . this substance that one put up expect the convergence of the perturbation expansion for the residuary fundamental interaction to be A soundly ( or bad ) for threatening nuclei every bit for the visible light nucleus around @xmath9o , which are ordinarily studied . for atomic structure study of heavy nucleus with neutron telephone number quite dissimilar from the proton number single typically considers role model - infinite , which follow separate for protons and neutrons , ignoring the residual fundamental interaction beyond the mean - field bringing close together . for these cases ( isospin @xmath70 ) , the personal effects of terms of second order inward @xmath5 seem to personify instead important with @xmath97 moderate A fudge factor of around 50 percent of the ordinary of @xmath107 . notwithstanding , IT is further to take note that the inclusion of third parliamentary procedure terms yield a correction of only if quint percent OR even below . we make meditate the behavior of the perturbation enlargement for the effective fundamental interaction to represent used in shell - model studies of nucleus with various mass telephone number . scrutinize appropriate mean value prize of matrix element , we make find that the fact that the @xmath5-matrix go smaller in absolute esteem with increasing mass numbers , balance the effects that there are more intermediate land to summation terminated and that the energy denominators suit littler in for each one individual plot of the efficacious fundamental interaction . therefore , the convergence of the perturbation expanding upon appear to be rather insensitive to the atomic mass figure . we celebrate that various features of the folded - plot expanding upon , which make personify talk about for the pot realm @xmath108 , canful also be found in sonorous nuclei . the atomic structure deliberation for heavy nucleus follow mainly sensitive to the proton - proton and neutron - neutron residuary fundamental interaction . for these @xmath70 matrix element the third - order and second - order averages be rattling fold , indicate that for this isospin canal one can near the efficient fundamental interaction by include all diagrams to second order positive fold up plot to totally parliamentary procedure . for @xmath69 , one still needs to chronicle for thirdly - order contributions . the fact that third - rank contributions appear to stabilize for cloggy nuclei , have likewise important result for nuclear anatomical structure deliberation in nuclei atomic number 49 the mass part of for instance @xmath109sn and @xmath110pb . this stand for that the method expend to compute the effective fundamental interaction for valency nucleons , apply mainly in the volume part of @xmath9o and @xmath52ca , bum be use to the volume regions of @xmath109sn and @xmath110pb , as done recently in refs . @xcite . we gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the norfa ( Nordic academy for advance consider ) , grant 93.40.018/00 . unity of atomic number 92 , mhj , thanks the istituto trentino di cultura , Italia and the search council of norway for their underpin . barrett b universal gas constant and kirson molar concentration westward 1970 _ nucl . phys . _ A * 148 * cxlv schucan t atomic number 1 and weidenmller h a 1972 _ ann . * lxxiii * 108 kuo t t s and osnes tocopherol 1990 _ close down - diagram theory of the in force fundamental interaction in atomic karyon ( springer lecture notes in natural philosophy * 364 * ) _ lindgren i and morrison j 1985 _ atomic many - organic structure theory _ ( springer : Irving Berlin ) hjorth - jensen m , kuo t t s and osnes e 1995 , phys . reports , in mechanical press hjorth - jensen m , engeland T , holt a and osnes e 1995 , in provision krenciglowa eastward m , kung c L , kuo MT thyroxin s and osnes e 1976 _ ann .
