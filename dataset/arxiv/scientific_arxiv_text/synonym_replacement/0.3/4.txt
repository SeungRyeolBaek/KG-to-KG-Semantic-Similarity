hit the books of laser ray propagate through with turbulent atmospheres are important for many practical application such as remote sensing , tracking , and long - outstrip optical communicating . howerver , fully tenacious laser beam are selfsame sensitive to fluctuation of the atmospherical refractive index finger . the initially tenacious laser beam acquires more or less properties of gaussian statistics in course of IT extension through the turbulence . as a final result , the racket / sign ratio approach unity for tenacious - space propagation . ( see , for example , refs.@xcite-@xcite ) . this unfavourable effect limits the functioning of communicating channel . to mitigate this blackball issue the expend of part ( spatially ) tenacious electron beam live purport . the coherent optical maser beam can buoy be transformed into group A partially coherent beam away means of a stage diffusor aim close the exit aperture . this diffuser premise AN additional phase ( randomly alter in space and time ) to the wave front of the forthcoming radiation therapy . statistical characteristics of the random stage learn the initial transverse coherency length of the beam . it follow shown In refs . @xcite,@xcite that angstrom unit considerable decrease in the noise / point ratio can occur under stick with conditions : ( i ) the ratio of the initial transverse coherence length , @xmath0 , to the shine radius , @xmath1 , should be essentially little than unity ; and ( ii ) the device characteristic time of stage sport , @xmath2 , should live often small than the integrating time , @xmath3 , of the detector . however , only confine incase @xmath4 and @xmath5 get be considered in the literature . ( picture , for example , refs . @xcite,@xcite and ref . @xcite , severally ) . IT is evident that the inequality @xmath6 canful make up easily satisfied by prefer a demodulator with very long desegregation time . At the same time , this kind of the sensing element can non key different signalize within the separation @xmath3 . this intend that the resolution of the receiving system might become too depression for the case of large @xmath3 . on the former hand , thither be a technical limitation on stage diffusers : upward to at present their device characteristic times , @xmath2 , ar non small than @xmath7 . besides that , in some specific guinea pig ( see , for example , ref . @xcite ) , the spectral broadening of laser radioactivity due to the phase diffusor ( @xmath8 ) may become intolerably high . the factor mentioned higher up impose sober restriction on the strong-arm characteristics of phase diffusor which could be potentially utile for suppressing the loudness wavering . AN equal choice of diffusor Crataegus laevigata be ease if we know inwards detail the effect of finite - time stage variation , acquaint by them , on the photon statistics . in this case , it is possible to mastery the execution of communication scheme . in what follow , we will obtain theoretically the dependence of scintillation index on @xmath9 without whatever restriction on the value of this ratio this follow the briny purpose of our paper . farther analysis be based on the formalism developed inwards ref . @xcite and modified here to understand the case of finite - time kinetics of the form diffusor . the detectors of the sop up type serve not sense the instant intensity of electromagnetic waves @xmath10 . they sense the intensity average out over close to finite musical interval @xmath3 ie @xmath11 commonly , the average out time @xmath3 ( the integration time of the sensor ) is practically minuscule than the characteristic clip of the turbulence variation , @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) . therefore , the average economic value of the intensity can represent obtain by further average out of eq . [ ane ] all over many measurements fit various realisation of the refractive - forefinger contour . the scintillation index determine the mean - square fluctuations of the intensity be delimit past @xmath14\bigg /\big < \bar{i}\big > ^2= \frac{\big < : \bar i(t ) ^2:\big>}{\big<\bar i \big>^2}-1,\ ] ] where the symbolization @xmath15 indicate the normal ordination of the creation and disintegration wheeler dealer which mold the strength , @xmath10 .

[ 1 ] , but also o'er the detector aperture . for simpleness , we will restrain ourselves to deliberation of the intensiveness correlations for coincide spatial points that correspond to `` small '' detector aperture . this simplification be rather reasonable for a long - distance multiplication route of the beam . atomic number 49 the case of quasimonochromatic light , we can select @xmath20 in the shape @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the cosmos and disintegration manipulator of photons with momentum @xmath24 . they are yield in the Werner Karl Heisenberg delegacy . @xmath25 be the volume of the system . it follow from eqs . [ two],[three ] that @xmath26 can be hold if unitary knows the average out @xmath27 IT is a complex problem to obtain this value for arbitrary turbulence strength and propagation aloofness . nevertheless , the following qualitative reasoning can assist to serve this in the case of strong turbulence . we have mentioned that the laser lightness acquire the belongings of gaussian statistics atomic number 49 the course of its propagation through and through the troubled atmosphere . A A result , In the limitation of infinitely tenacious extension itinerary , @xmath28 , exclusively diagonal " full term , ie terms with ( i ) @xmath29 OR ( ii ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 contribute to the correct parting of equivalent weight .
