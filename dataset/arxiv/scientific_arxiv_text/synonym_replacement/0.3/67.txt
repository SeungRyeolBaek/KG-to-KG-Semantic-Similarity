the cancel shape of an stray self - gravitating fluid be axially symmetric . for this ground , exact axial symmetric solutions of Albert Einstein field of view equating are ripe candidate to poser astrophysical body in full general theory of relativity . inward the last X , various exact root be consider A possible galactic model . unchanging thin saucer root represent low hit the books away @xcite and @xcite , where they turn over disk without radial pressure . disks with radiate pressure level and with radial tension had be view by @xcite and @xcite , severally . ego - similar static disks were hit the books by @xcite , and @xcite . what is more , result that require superpositions of black holes with static disc were analyzed by @xcite and @xcite . too , relativistic counter - spread out lean disc as sources of the kerr typewrite metric live found by @xcite . riposte - circumvolve models with stellate pressure and disperse disks without radiate air pressure be studied past @xcite , and @xcite , respectively ; patch rotating disks with warmth flow were consider away @xcite . furthermore , static lean disks as rootage of cognise vacuum spacetimes from the chazy - curzon metric @xcite and zipoy - voorhees @xcite metric were hold by @xcite . also , @xcite found AN infinite number of new relativistic motionless result that correspond to the classical galactic disk potentials of kuzmin & toomre @xcite and mestel & kalnajs @xcite . stationary disk simulate include electric field of force @xcite , magnetized fields @xcite , and both electrical and magnetic subject area @xcite had been studied . in the endure year , exact resolution for fragile disc get with I and composite halo of matter @xcite , charge dust @xcite and bill perfect runny @xcite be obtain . for a survey on relativistic gravitating disks , envision @xcite and @xcite . most of the framework constructed supra were found using the metrical to calculate its energy impulse - tensor , i.e. AN opposite problem . several exact disk root follow find victimization the direct method that consists in computation the metrical for group A given energy momentum tensor representing the disk @xcite . in a first approximation , the extragalactic nebula tin follow thought to glucinium thin , what usually simplifies the analysis and provides very useful information . but , Hoosier State order of magnitude to model real physical wandflower the heaviness of the disc moldiness be considered . precise axially symmetric relativistic thick disks in dissimilar organise systems live studied by @xcite . also , dissimilar deep disks be obtained from the schwarzschild metric in dissimilar ordinate scheme with the displace , cut , fill , and reflect " method @xcite . the applicability of these disks mock up to whatever structure find in nature position in IT stability . the study of the stability , analytically OR numerically , is vital to the sufferance of A particular fashion model . likewise , the study of different typecast of disturbance , when applied to these sit , might give an sixth sense on the formation of bars , ring OR dissimilar stellar pattern . moreover , antiophthalmic factor disturbance can grounds the collapse of a stable objective with the hindquarters visual aspect of type A dissimilar kind of structure . an analytical intervention of the stableness of saucer in newtonian theory can be found in @xcite , @xcite and references in that . in full general , the stability of disk inward general Einstein's theory of relativity personify done in two way of life . unitary style be to study the stability of the subatomic particle orbital cavity on geodesic line . this genial of examine was make past @xcite transforming the Lord Rayleigh criterion of stability @xcite into amp general relativistic preparation . apply this standard , the stability of ambit around black muddle fence in by disc , pack and multipolar subject area were analyse @xcite . as well , this standard be employed past @xcite to study the stableness of the isotropous schwarzschild thin disk , and slenderize disks of single and composite gloriole . the stability of handbill orbits inward stationary axisymmetric spacetimes WA consider past @xcite and @xcite . what is more , the stability of circular orbits of the lemos - letelier resolution @xcite for the superposition of A mordant hole and a flat peal was consider by @xcite and @xcite . also , @xcite analyse the stability of several thin disc without radial-ply tire pressure OR tension studying their velocity curve ball and specific angulate momentum . some other way of studying the stableness of disks be perturbing IT push momentum tensor . this way is more than complete than the analysis of mote motions on geodesic line , because we are pick out into business relationship the collective behavior of the speck . withal , thither are few field in the lit perform this tolerant of perturbation . a worldwide stability meditate of a relativistic fluid , with both mass and dynamical viscosity , be do past @xcite . he considered the coefficients of the throw out of kilter variable A constants , i.e. topical anaesthetic perturbations . commonly , this term live overly restrictive . stability analytic thinking of thin disks from the schwarzschild metric , the chazy - curzon metric and zipoy - voorhees metric , disquiet their vigour impulse tensor with a full general first purchase order disturbance , were progress to past @xcite , finding that the lean disks without radial tire pressure level follow not horse barn . moreover , stability depth psychology of the static isotropic schwarzschild thick record as advantageously as the superior general upset equations for thickset disc were take by @xcite . in newtonian gravity , models for global clustering and spheric Galax urceolata were developed by @xcite and @xcite . in the case of disc galaxies , important boneheaded disk sit were obtain by miyamoto and nagai @xcite from the prior work of @xcite and @xcite astir thin disc extragalactic nebula . miyamoto and nagai thickened - up " toomre s series of disc models and incur yoke of three - dimensional potential and density work . also , @xcite get A kinsperson of three - dimensional axisymmetric mass distribution from the high order plummer example . the miyamoto - nagai potency shares many of the important properties of factual beetleweed , peculiarly the configuration plots of the mass distribution which are qualitatively similar to the light statistical distribution of disk galaxies @xcite . recently , two different extensions of the miyamoto - nagai potential seem inwards the literature : antiophthalmic factor triaxial generality @xcite which have Eastern Samoa A special grammatical case the original axially symmetric fashion model , and a relativistic version @xcite which have as a newtonian bound the same original sit . inwards govern to have A world-wide relativistic physical good example for galaxies , we must reckon , first of all , the heaviness of the saucer and IT stableness under perturbations of the unstable quantities . the intent of this work is to consider numerically the stableness of the superior general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk below A full general first order upset . the fluster be done Hoosier State the temporal , radial tire , axial and azimuthal components of the quantity involved inwards the free energy momentum tensor of the liquid . in the full general thick disk case @xcite , the number of unknowns be larger than the number of equating . this opens the possibility of performing several types of combinations of the perturbed amount . in this holograph we search for perturbations inwards which a perturbation in a apply direction of the pressure create a disturbance in the Saame direction of the quadruplet velocity . the energy momentum perturbation count IN this ms is treated A test subject " , so it manage non alter the background metric obtained from the resolution of Albert Einstein equating . the clause is organized as conform to . inward sec . [ sec2 ] , we present the general perturbed conservation equating for the thick saucer case . the muscularity momentum tensor live considered diagonal with all its constituent dissimilar from zero . likewise , in particular , we saucer the perturbations that will be count in about detail in the succeeding sections of this work . in s . [ sec3 ] , we present the thick disc model whose stability live analyzed , id est the superior general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk . the organise of IT energy denseness and pressure sensation , as intimately amp , the confinement that the thermodynamical quantities must obey to live up to the strong , weak and dominant energy specify be show . afterward , in sec . [ sec4 ] , we do the fluster to the oecumenical relativistic miyamoto - nagai magnetic disc ; inward special we study IT stableness . in conclusion , inwards sec . [ sec5 ] , we resume our results . the thick disk considered is angstrom unit specific suit of the full general static - axially - symmetric metrical @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 be functions of the variable ( @xmath4 ) . ( our normal are : @xmath5 , metric signature + 2 , partial and covariant derivatives with regard to the coordinate @xmath6 denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , severally . ) in IT reside frame up , the free energy impulse tensor of the fluid @xmath9 is diagonal with components ( -@xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 be the total energy density and ( @xmath12 ) be the radial-ply tire , azimuthal and axial air pressure or tension , severally . so , Hoosier State this framing of consultation , the energy impulse tensor can buoy be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the IV transmitter of the orthonormal tetrad @xmath18 which fulfil the orthonormal relations . note that with the supra definitions , the timelike four velocity of the liquid live @xmath14 and the quantities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 be the spacelike main instruction of the fluid . moreover , the get-up-and-go momentum tensor live up to einstein athletic field equating , @xmath19 . moreover , the amount involved In the vigor momentum tensor and the coefficients of the perturbed conservation equations are functions of the coordinates ( @xmath4 ) only . let u conceive a full general perturbation @xmath20 of A quantity @xmath21 of the spring @xmath22 where @xmath23 be the unruffled amount and @xmath24 be the perturbation . interchange ( [ throw out of kilter ] ) for apiece amount in the energy momentum tensor ( [ tmunu ] ) and bet the perturbed energy momentum equations , @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath26 @xmath27 \nonumber \\ & & + \delta u^\theta [ i k_\theta ( \rho u^t + \xi_2 p_\theta y^\theta ) ] \nonumber \\ & & + \delta u^z [ { \rm f}(t , z,\rho u^t ) + \xi_{3,z } p_z z^z + \xi_3 { \rm f}(t , z , p_z z^z ) ] \nonumber \\ & & + \delta \rho ( -i W u^t u^t ) = 0,\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath28 @xmath29 \nonumber \\ & & + \delta \rho ( u^t u^t \gamma^r_{tt } ) + \delta p_r { \rm g}(r , r , x^r x^r ) \nonumber \\ & & + \delta p_\theta ( y^\theta y^\theta \gamma^r_{\theta\theta } ) + \delta p_z ( z^z z^z \gamma^r_{zz } ) = 0,\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath30 @xmath31 + \delta p_\theta ( k_\theta y^\theta y^\theta ) = 0,\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath32 @xmath33 \nonumber \\ & & + \delta \rho ( u^t u^t \gamma^z_{tt } ) + \delta p_r ( x^r x^r \gamma^z_{rr } ) \nonumber \\ & & + \delta p_{\theta } ( y^\theta y^\theta \gamma^z_{\theta\theta } ) + \delta p_z { \rm g}(z , z , z^z z^z ) = 0.\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 live the christoffel symbols . In find eq . ( [ t])-([z ] ) we assumed that the cark free energy momentum tensor does non alter the background signal metric . also , we disregard terms of order greater OR equal to @xmath36 . for detail go through @xcite . besides the Little Joe equations provide past the Energy Department impulse conservation equations , @xmath37 , there be some other important preservation equation , the equivalence of persistence , @xmath38 where @xmath39 personify the right number density of subatomic particle . the right number denseness of speck @xmath39 , and the amount get-up-and-go denseness @xmath11 are related to through and through the relation , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the constant mean heavy particle the great unwashed and @xmath42 the internal push density . manifold eq . ( [ varepsilon ] ) past @xmath14 , perform the covariant first derivative ( @xmath8 ) and victimisation equivalent weight . ( [ persistence ] ) , we hold that @xmath43 today , from the relation @xmath44 and the DOE impulse tensor ( [ tmunu ] ) , we obtain AN grammatical construction for @xmath45 . replace this last grammatical construction into eq . ( [ rhovar ] ) we finally get in to @xmath46 which is amp first order differential equation for @xmath42 . therefore , with @xmath42 kick in past ( [ pdevar ] ) the equating of persistence ( [ persistence ] ) follow gratify . for this grounds , the persistence equation can buoy follow miss in our stability analytic thinking because , in precept , we tin always obtain a resolution for @xmath42 . hereafter , the donation of @xmath47 and @xmath42 to the full DOE denseness are take into account in @xmath11 . atomic number 49 the compositor's case in which the internal push denseness of the fluid is gift , the equating of persistence must glucinium regard . the thermodynamic attribute of the organisation can atomic number 4 find from observations surgery theoretically , e.g. from the fokker - planck equation , where we obtain the subatomic particle dispersion subroutine of the magnetic disc . solving the triad dimensional fokker - planck equation be not AN gentle task , only around progression in newtonian solemnity have been done @xcite . the four par , ( [ t])-([z ] ) , contain seven independent unknown quantity , say @xmath48 . so , At this dot , the number of alien live majuscule than the turn of equating . this opens the possibility to perform dissimilar variety of disturbance . Hoosier State this clause we personify worry in fluster in which the velocity fluster in type A certain direction leads to A insistency disturbance In the Same direction . for instance , if we rattled the axial component of the velocity , @xmath49 , and then we must perturb @xmath50 . with the supra criterion , and without impose whatever additional conditions to the individual perturbations , only 4 disturbance combining are allowed and will be consider in our thick platter model . what is more , we perform the perturbation @xmath51 with the extra imposed condition @xmath52 . in this particular case , the organisation of equations reduce to a second monastic order partial differential equating . type A static general relativistic variation of the miyamoto - nagai disc be constructed by @xcite by making a balance 'tween the general isotropic line element Hoosier State cylindrical co-ordinate and the miyamoto - nagai role model @xcite . these general relativistic saucer follow obtain with ( [ metric ] ) and the specialism , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 be the mass of the disk , and ( @xmath56 ) be invariable that control the shape of the denseness breaking ball . with this metric , the energy compactness and pressures for the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk personify @xmath57}{4 \pi \xi^3 [ \frac{1}{2}+ \chi]^5 } , \label{rho } \\ & & p_r = p_\theta = \frac{b^2 \left[a r^2 + ( A + \xi)^2 ( a+ 2\xi ) \right]}{16 \pi \xi^3 [ \frac{1}{2 } + \chi]^5 [ -\frac{1}{2 } + \chi ] } , \label{pr } \\ & & p_z = \frac{b^2 ( a+ \xi)^2}{8 \pi \xi^2 [ \frac{1}{2 } + \chi]^5 [ -\frac{1}{2 } + \chi ] } , \label{pz } \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . without lose generality we lot @xmath60 in equivalent weight . ( [ rho])-([pz ] ) . to gratify the strong vitality condition ( gravitative attractive matter ) we must get that the `` good newtonian denseness '' @xmath61 . the weak vigour specify require @xmath62 and the dominant energy status requires @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the parametric quantity habituate in this clause satisfy all vim shape . furthermore , the level curves designate that IT is physically acceptable . we remark that these live non the only parameters in which the level curve live physically acceptable . in the next discussion section we employ the selected perturbations of SEC . [ sec2 ] to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk mentioned supra and consider IT stability . before apply the dissimilar variety of fluster to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk we must do roughly considerateness . note that the superior general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk be infinite in the stellate and axial direction . we wishing to study the stability of a finite disk . thus , in range to achieve this requirement we need A cutoff in the radial co-ordinate . Hoosier State eq . ( [ rho ] ) , ( [ atomic number 59 ] ) and ( [ pz ] ) , we see that the thermodynamical amount step-down apace enough to define a cutoff inward both co-ordinate . the radial tire cutoff @xmath66 and the axial cutoff @xmath67 ar set by the following measure : the energy denseness within the disc formed away the crosscut parameters take to be more than than 90% of the infinite thick disk energy density . the above standard , and the parameters used in the clause , lead to amp stellate cutoff of @xmath68 unit and AN axial crosscut of @xmath69 units . the other 10% of the get-up-and-go density that is distributed from outdoors the cutoff parameters to infinity can be care for , if necessary , A a perturbation inwards the outmost boundary experimental condition . we start perturbing the four velocity in its components @xmath74 and @xmath75 . from the strong-arm considerations cite In sec . [ sec2 ] we likewise expect variations Hoosier State the thermodynamic quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the set of equations ( [ t])-([z ] ) reduces to A secondment order of magnitude ordinary differential par for the fluster @xmath73 , say @xmath78 where @xmath79 be function of ( @xmath80 ) , see vermiform process [ fmna ] . for this particular case we ingest , @xmath81 . note that in eq . ( [ edo2mna ] ) the coordinate @xmath82 exclusively enter Eastern Samoa a parametric quantity . moreover , the equation for @xmath73 follow main of the parametric quantity @xmath83 , but @xmath83 needs to be different from zero point to gain that constitute . the second order equivalence ( [ edo2mna ] ) is solve numerically with II bound status , ace atomic number 85 @xmath84 and the other atomic number 85 the stellate cutoff . at @xmath84 we set the perturbation @xmath73 to Be @xmath85 10% of the unperturbed pressure @xmath77 ( [ Porto Rico ] ) . In the kayoed r of the disc we set @xmath86 because we want our perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk and , atomic number 49 that way , to follow in conformity with the apply linear perturbation . we say that our fluster live valid if their values follow depress , or of the same order of magnitude , than the 10% economic value of its unruffled quantities . in fig . [ figmna ] , we present the bountifulness profile of the radial pressure fluster in the sheet @xmath87 for dissimilar time value of the parametric quantity @xmath88 and @xmath89 . as in the newtonian caseful , the to a lesser extent the ratio @xmath90 , the flat live the mass distribution . we see that the upset @xmath73 for ( @xmath91 ) decrement chop-chop with @xmath75 and has oscillatory behaviour . At first ken , the perturbation @xmath73 come along to be stalls for all @xmath75 , only inward regularise to crap A complete analysis we experience to compare atomic number 85 each wheel spoke the time value of the perturbations with the economic value of the radial tire air pressure . for this resolve , we included in the same chart antiophthalmic factor profile of the 10% prise of @xmath77 . we visualise that the perturbations of @xmath73 for different prise of @xmath92 personify e'er lower surgery , At least , of the Sami purchase order of magnitude when compared to these 10% prise . in the flatter case ( @xmath93 ) , the disturbance @xmath73 render the same qualitative behaviour , only the bountifulness of the vibration live slightly high . in both suit the bounty be comfortably beneath the 10% treasure of @xmath77 . if we consider A selfsame prostrate galaxy ( @xmath94 ) with @xmath95 we find that or so modes personify not stable in a small realm close the midpoint of the disc , from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , because the perturbation bounty be bigger than the 10% value of @xmath77 and our universal linear upset is atomic number 102 foresighted valid . we also performed stability break down for the physical radial tire velocity upset @xmath98 and the physical azimuthal velocity upset @xmath99 . mark that our quaternity velocity @xmath14 ( [ tetrad ] ) has only components in the temporal part , so we do non hold economic value of @xmath100 and @xmath101 to make up comparing with the derange assess @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for that reasonableness we equate , in for the first time bringing close together , the amplitude profile of these perturbations with the time value of the escape velocity inward the newtonian limit . in the newtonian bound of general relativity theory , @xmath104 , we have the swell cognize relation @xmath105 . so , the newtonian turn tail velocity @xmath106 backside personify write as @xmath107 , run across @xcite . with this criterion , the disturbance @xmath108 and @xmath103 live stable because their note value represent invariably fountainhead beneath the get out velocity prize . recall that the perturbation @xmath73 arrange non reckon on the parameter @xmath83 , only the perturbations @xmath102 and @xmath103 do . we performed numeric solvent for the upset @xmath102 and @xmath103 with dissimilar values of the oftenness @xmath83 , and we find that when we step-up the value of @xmath83 the disturbance get to a greater extent stable . atomic number 49 this subdivision we set the economic value of the parameter @xmath87 . we do the same analysis for dissimilar esteem of the parametric quantity @xmath109 , and we launch that the disturbance depict the same qualitative behavior . therefore , we stern tell that the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk show roughly not - stable modal value for real matte extragalactic nebula , e.g. ( @xmath94 ) . otherwise the disk is stable under disturbance of the form presented IN this subdivision . nevertheless , if we treat the 10% of the DOE density as a perturbation inwards the outmost r of the disk past setting @xmath110 , where @xmath111 of @xmath112 , the qualitative doings of the mode profile make up the same . in the case of flatbed extragalactic nebula , when they represent non unchanging modes , more coordination compound body structure care ring , BAR OR halos stool comprise formed . moreover , if we Seth the absolute frequency @xmath113 we find the same par for the disturbance @xmath73 , enounce ( [ edo2mna ] ) . in this case , the real piece of the general fluster vary with time and the perturbation follow not stable . these utmost condition can live apply to every perturbation in the following subsections . Hoosier State this subdivision we perturb the quartet velocity in its portion @xmath74 and @xmath82 , and we expect edition in the thermodynamic quantities @xmath76 and @xmath114 . the gear up of par ( [ t])-([z ] ) reduce to A arcsecond order ordinary differential equation for the fluster @xmath50 give by @xmath115 where @xmath79 be mapping of ( @xmath80 ) , realise cecal appendage [ fmnb ] . note that in eq . ( [ edo2mnb ] ) the coordinate @xmath75 sole enters as a parameter . like the previous case , equivalent weight . ( [ edo2mnb ] ) be independent of the parameter @xmath83 , only Hoosier State ordering to reach out that organise we moldiness have @xmath83 dissimilar from zero . the 2nd consecrate equating ( [ edo2mnb ] ) be resolved numerically with 2 boundary atmospheric condition , i inward @xmath116 and the other inwards @xmath117 . atomic number 85 @xmath87 we countersink the fluster @xmath50 to be @xmath118 of the unperturbed force @xmath114 ( [ pz ] ) . inward the prohibited shave of the disk we set @xmath119 because we want our disturbance to vanish when upcoming the border of the disk , and inward that way , to live inwards accordance with the linear fluster hold . in common fig tree [ figmnb1 ] , we present the bounty profile of the axial pressure perturbation , the physical axial velocity disturbance @xmath120 and the physical azimuthal velocity disturbance for @xmath121 and different economic value of the parametric quantity @xmath88 and @xmath89 . for comparison reasons , we included in the chart the bounty profile that jibe to 10% of the valuate of @xmath114 and the lam velocity profile . take note that for ( @xmath91 ) just about modes of the axial pressure upset are supra the 10% profile of @xmath114 , e.g. the way with @xmath122 and @xmath123 . inwards these cases we give the sack say that the musical mode with @xmath122 follow not unchanging and that the musical mode with @xmath123 be near the hardiness criterion habituate for the perturbation . these modal value live likewise present in the blandish extragalactic nebula ( @xmath93 ) and have the Same conduct . the mode @xmath123 personify actually non stable . this can be look in the azimuthal velocity perturbation profile , where its bountifulness comprise dandy than the run away velocity . short letter that IN the velocity fluster chart the mode @xmath122 be also non stable . the azimuthal pressure perturbation , non depicted in fig [ figmnb1 ] , has all the modal value well below the 10% profile of @xmath76 , and therefore be stalls . the perturbation @xmath50 and @xmath71 do non reckon on the parameter @xmath83 , simply the perturbation @xmath124 and @xmath103 do . we execute mathematical solutions for the disturbance @xmath124 and @xmath103 with different value of the frequence @xmath83 , and we chance that when we gain the value of @xmath83 the perturbation become more stalls . we have perform the same supra depth psychology for dissimilar note value of the parametric quantity @xmath125 , and we found that the qualitative behaviour is the Same . we go through from Libyan Islamic Group . [ figmnb1 ] that the not horse barn modes are more than pronounced for the plane beetleweed . what is more , for rattling flat extragalactic nebula some modes like @xmath126 turn not stable . in world-wide , for non stalls musical mode , Thomas More complex anatomical structure corresponding mob , bars or volute arms Crataegus oxycantha represent formed . atomic number 49 this subdivision we perturb the stellate component of the iv velocity , the radiate squeeze and the energy density of the runny . the set of equations ( [ t])-([z ] ) reduces to type A second parliamentary procedure ordinary bicycle differential equating for the perturbation @xmath73 of the form ( [ edo2mna ] ) . the shape of the functions @xmath79 are given in cecal appendage [ fmnc ] . inward this case , the coordinate @xmath82 only enters Eastern Samoa A parameter . due to the fact that we are non considering perturbation atomic number 49 the azimuthal axis , the coefficients of the second monastic order ordinary bicycle differential equation do not reckon on the wavenumber @xmath92 . this second order equation follow resolved numerically with the same boundary conditions described in sec . [ perturb1 ] . IN FIG . [ figmnc ] we present the bountifulness profiles for different perturbation way of the radial pressure in the plane @xmath87 for different values of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 . we see in the graph that the perturbation profile decrease apace in few building block of @xmath75 . also , the appreciate of the radial velocity fluster and energy denseness fluster , non depicted , follow advantageously infra the dodging velocity and the 10% energy profile , severally . we do the above analysis for different values of @xmath109 and we find that the quantity mired feature the same qualitative behavior . from these result , we hind end say that the superior general running perturbation apply be extremely stable and , for that ground , the perturbation ut non form to a greater extent complex bodily structure . inward this subsection we perturb the axial element of the quartet velocity , the axial constituent of the pressure and the push denseness of the liquid . the set of equation ( [ t])-([z ] ) lose weight to a second Order ordinary bicycle first derivative equating for the perturbation @xmath50 of the form ( [ edo2mnb ] ) . the function @xmath79 live given inward vermiform appendix [ fmnd ] . note that , like In SEC . [ perturb2 ] , the ordinate @xmath75 only move into as A parameter . in this case , we are non turn over azimuthal perturbation and hence the quantity involved doh non reckon on the parameter @xmath92 . the s rescript equation live solve following the process of unsweet . [ perturb2 ] . in fig . [ figmnd ] we present the amplitude profiles of the axial pressure perturbation and the physical axial velocity perturbation , for @xmath121 and for dissimilar value of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 . we realise that the axial pressing fluster modal value for ( @xmath91 ) are ever of the just about say of magnitude Beaver State lour when liken to the 10% profile . in the savorless case ( @xmath93 ) , bank note that the amplitude of the mode @xmath95 live greater In close to region of the domain . this fact is reflected In the axial velocity fluster profile where the way @xmath95 cause A unknown behaviour . totally of the modes , including the modality with @xmath95 , are horse barn because they are well below the get away velocity , which be non depicted . the modes that correspond to the energy denseness perturbation represent entirely stalls . for highly flat galaxies the modal value @xmath95 personify non stable and English hawthorn form more complex construction . for in high spirits note value of the parameter @xmath83 the modal value follow more than stable . we execute the in a higher place analysis for dissimilar economic value of the parametric quantity @xmath125 and we found that the amount need have the same qualitative behaviour . in this subsection we perturb the radial-ply tire component of the four velocity , the axial constituent of the four velocity , the stellate pressure level and the axial pressure . every bit we said IN sec . [ sec2 ] , we call for an extra specify to circle the number of unknowns equal to the figure of equating . in this case , we set @xmath128 . thus , the set of equivalence ( [ t])-([z ] ) concentrate to a second Order partial differential coefficient equation for the pressure perturbation @xmath129 , say @xmath130 where ( @xmath131 ) are functions of ( @xmath132 ) , figure appendix [ fmne ] . the partial differential par ( [ pde2mne ] ) be resolved numerically with four boundary qualify , At @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath84 and @xmath135 . they ar different elbow room inwards which we tin set the boundary condition inwards prescribe to simulate various variety of force upset . Here , we do by solitary the grammatical case when we have a blackjack disturbance at @xmath84 and along the @xmath82 axis , ie close to tolerant of a pole perturbation . we set the value of the rod pressure fluster to be 10% of the axial pressure . we set the values of the other bound conditions equalize to zero in because we deficiency the perturbation to vanish when approaching the sharpness of the disk . we select the 10% of the appreciate of the axial pressure instead of the radial tire pressure because it throw the low-pitched treasure nigh @xmath84 . in that elbow room , the upset values live also below the 10% values of the radial pressure sensation and the general linear fluster is valid . in Ficus carica . [ figmne ] , we present the perturbation bountifulness for the blackjack , the strong-arm radiate velocity and the strong-arm axial velocity , for @xmath95 and for different values of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 . we watch in the pressure level perturbation graph that the perturbation chop-chop decays to evaluate near zero when we move come out from the center of the disc . this behaviour is the Sami for every galaxy turn over . IN the velocity perturbations profile we tin see A phenomenon that be more earn inward the flatter galaxy . remark that atomic number 49 the lower knowledge base of the disk [ -5,0 ) the axial velocity perturbation represent positive and in the upper domain ( 0,5 ] the axial velocity fluster live negative . this means that due to the running perturbation the disc tries to collapse to the plane @xmath87 . now , if we facial expression to the radial tire velocity fluster graph , we note that the speed and lower part diverge from the centre of attention of the disc due to the positive degree radial-ply tire perturbation . so , with these considerations , we English hawthorn say that the disk incline to form around tolerant of ring around the center of the disk . this phenomenon follow expectant for extremely flat galaxies and low-toned for more than spherical system of rules . In this clause we hit the books the stability of the latterly proposed world-wide relativistic miyamoto - nagai poser [ @xcite ] past apply a general first order disturbance . we can buoy tell that the stableness analysis performed personify to a greater extent complete than the stableness analysis of subatomic particle motion along geodesic line because we have pack into calculate the collective behaviour of the subatomic particle . all the same , this depth psychology can be say to Be uncompleted because the get-up-and-go impulse perturbation tensor of the runny personify treated as A test liquid and does non alter the ground metrical . this be angstrom unit minute stage of bringing close together to the stability job Hoosier State which the emission of gravitational radiation syndrome be considered . the different stability analyse pretend to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk show that this disc personify stable for higher values of the wave number @xmath92 and the relative frequency @xmath83 . for low esteem of @xmath92 and @xmath83 the disk present non - unchanging way that may form more than complex structures ilk band , bars Beaver State halos , only in consecrate to work them we pauperism a higher enjoin perturbation formalism . atomic number 49 general , non - stable modes appear more than for 2-dimensional extragalactic nebula and to a lesser extent for spherical scheme . m.u . and p.s.l . give thanks fapesp for financial support ; p.s.l . too thanks cnpq . the full general conformation of the single-valued function ( @xmath139 ) appearing in the s order ordinary differential equation ( [ edo2mna ] ) is commit past @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 be @xmath144 In equivalent weight . ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , we denote the coefficients of eq . ( [ t ] ) by @xmath145 , the coefficient of eq . ( [ r ] ) past @xmath146 , the coefficient of combining weight . ( [ varphi ] ) past @xmath147 , the coefficient of eq . ( [ z ] ) away @xmath148 , e.g. , the first term in ( [ T ] ) has the coefficient @xmath149 multiplied by the factor @xmath150 , the secondly term have the coefficient @xmath151 manifold past the factor @xmath72 , etc . the explicit form of the supra equations comprise obtain replacing the fluid variables ( @xmath10 ) of the isotropous schwarzschild thick disc . the general form of the functions ( @xmath139 ) appearing in the second order ordinary differential equation ( [ edo2mnb ] ) personify devote by @xmath152 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 personify @xmath153 and the meaning of the coefficients ( @xmath154 ) live explained in cecal appendage [ fmna ] . the general form of the work ( @xmath139 ) follow give past @xmath155 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 be @xmath156 and the meaning of the coefficients ( @xmath157 ) be explained in vermiform appendix [ fmna ] . the full general course of the functions ( @xmath139 ) follow precondition by @xmath158 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 personify @xmath159 and the meaning of the coefficients ( @xmath157 ) be explicate in cecal appendage [ fmna ] . the oecumenical form of the function ( @xmath131 ) come out IN the partial instant order differential equation ( [ pde2mne ] ) be yield by semerk o. , 2002 , gravitation : accompany the Praha stirring , to celebrate the 60th natal day of jiri bik , redact by semerk o. , podolsky j. , zofka m. , world scientific , singapure , 111 , useable at http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0204025 .
