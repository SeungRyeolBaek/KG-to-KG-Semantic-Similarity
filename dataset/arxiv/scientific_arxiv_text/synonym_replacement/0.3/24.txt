At first sign - to - stochasticity ratio , the separation of point - like galactic star from resolved galaxies using the ` sextractor ` class_star parameter be non full reliable . we use class_star @xmath143 in our pick of @xmath38-dropouts inwards discussion section [ section3 ] to reject artefact rest from the step-down work on , only this personify non a strict plenty criterion to turn down all lead from our taste . in this case , five of our candidate identified As @xmath38-dropouts have class_star @xmath144 , with solitary borg_1459 + 7146_785 having class_star @xmath145 ( a value look at away @xcite Eastern Samoa indicative of A astral nature ) . therefore we conclude that this source is most likely A star contaminant with unusual gloss . emission - furrow galaxies are another source of pollution for @xmath19 galaxy sampling . for representative , extragalactic nebula atomic number 85 @xmath146 with strong [ oii ] emanation Crataegus laevigata appear bright in @xmath46-band while the Galax urceolata continuum live overly deliquium to be discover in the other band @xcite . @xcite see that , at @xmath147 , the mean denseness of uttermost line emitters that come in the photometrical pick follow @xmath148 per arcmin@xmath149 , away create bemock catalog of extreme emanation line galaxies with vary @xmath38 magnitude and ghostly slope @xmath150 . extrapolating this result to @xmath39 , we wait to find @xmath151 possible contamination of this typewrite o'er our appraise surface area . this note value be in describe with late spectroscopical observance of @xmath147 borg prospect by @xcite apply the mosfire spectrograph on the keck scope , and past @xcite habituate xshooter on the very large scope . these consider found No expelling line atomic number 49 the spectrometry of @xmath147 prospect , and personify able to rule out expelling draw from a low-@xmath24 extremum emission line of descent contamination to @xmath152 , usurp that totally of the @xmath46 fluxion live due to axerophthol warm emission line . @xcite too find that , with type A 3hr exposure , only amp small part of the spectrum ( @xmath153 ) be so impact by atmospherical transmission and absorption by Buckeye State line that A strong emanation line of business would non make up notice to @xmath13 . the last , and belike most severe division of contamination , is that of peaceful and dust-covered extragalactic nebula that thus show a strong balmer split and angstrom unit selfsame faint ultraviolet illumination continuum . under these conditions , @xmath154 source Crataegus laevigata mimicker property of lbgs and thusly inscribe into our selection . observation with _ spitzer_/irac at @xmath155 and @xmath156 1000 can buoy efficiently differentiate 'tween high- and scurvy - redshift sources . in fact , dusty @xmath123 extragalactic nebula testament appear 1 - 2 magnitude bright inward [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] than In @xmath46 , patch @xmath19 lbgs will feature A comparatively flat spectrum . without spitzer data point , we bank on the size of the sources A placeholder for the @xmath157 $ ] colour , considering root with @xmath158 A potential contamination . @xcite get that , spell the intend size of it of nominee IN the @xmath39 taste from @xcite be @xmath72 , low - redshift , irac - blood-red interlopers receive a mean size of it of @xmath159 , simply can buoy be as small a @xmath160 , and there be no more high-@xmath24 candidates with sizes greater than @xmath161 ( fig quadruplet , @xcite ) . thence , we take @xmath162 antiophthalmic factor a threshold . the 2 burnished source inwards our sample live thusly extended to lessen into such categorisation . the source moot in @xcite comprise fainthearted than the @xmath39 prospect Hoosier State our sample , and so IT be imaginable that the larger sizes of borg_0240 - 1857_129 and borg_0240 - 1857_369 personify due to their high-pitched luminosities . habituate the size - luminosity relation infer inwards @xcite , we infer that the size of it of type A @xmath163 galaxy atomic number 85 @xmath164 ( the shining atomic number 49 our sampling ) would follow @xmath165 , below our threshold of @xmath162 . this size of it can non be use to completely refuse extremum emission - subscriber line extragalactic nebula , which be belike to be to a greater extent compact . for example , @xcite find that their try out of 52 uttermost emission line extragalactic nebula in clash get fwhm @xmath166 , similar to our @xmath167 touchstone for @xmath39 prospect . in increase to feel the redshift chance statistical distribution of our six prospect use bpz , we as well fit sed guide key in @xcite . from this , we find AN average chance @xmath168 of @xmath169 . we conclude that iii come out of the six prospect , borg_1459 + 7146_785 , borg_0240 - 1857_129 , and borg_0240 - 1857_369 , are potential to be contamination . for the remaining ternary , pollution is still A possibleness , and so we make a conservative supposition of @xmath170 taint ( two out of three source at @xmath171 ) , found on the approximate from the borg[z9 - 10 ] survey @xcite using the ordinary chance @xmath168 for the prospect inward their sampling . of the sestet possible candidates identified atomic number 49 the full borg[z8 ] study , three of them , including the two brightest , ar found atomic number 49 the Sami field ( borg_0240 - 1857 ) . the pic time for this level personify similar to the medial of the survey ( @xmath172 s atomic number 49 @xmath46 ) , and thus such A catch is extremely unlikely below the supposal of type A uniform statistical distribution of prospect atomic number 49 the lxii playing area analyzed Here . base on theoretic expectations , the mien of clustering stool Be used to verify the individuality of promising high-@xmath24 rootage @xcite , under the broad laying claim that ultraviolet light luminousness is correlate with dark -

[ figvolume],title="fig:",scaledwidth=46.0% ] from the discussion Hoosier State discussion section [ pollution ] , we consider the II brightest sources to be in all probability contamination because of their tumid half -
