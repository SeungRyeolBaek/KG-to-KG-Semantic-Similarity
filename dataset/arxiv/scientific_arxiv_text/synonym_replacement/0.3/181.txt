water vaporisation is AN important molecule for the chemical science of interstellar and circumstellar clouds . the 6@xmath8 - 5@xmath9 masing transition of h@xmath3o at 22 gigacycle per second , which arises from tier around 700k , has be used since IT detection by cheung et AL . ( 1969 ) to trace high innervation throttle around star organize region and evolved wizard . the size of the emitting part at that relative frequency is typically of the order of group A few milliarcseconds ( A few 10@xmath10 centimetre ) . so , no more info get be obtained from this line on the purpose of h@xmath3o at large spatial scales . other h@xmath3o business hold been detected from ground or airborne base scope similar the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition at 183 gigacycle ( water et aluminium . , 1980 ; cernicharo et al . 1990 , 1994 , 1996 ; gonzlez - alfonso et atomic number 13 . 1994 , 1998 ) , the 4@xmath13 - 3@xmath14 modulation at 380 ghz ( phillips , kwan and huggins 1980 ) , the 10@xmath15 - 9@xmath16 transition At 321 GHz ( menten , melnick and phillips 1990a ) and the 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 transition At 325 gigacycle per second ( menten et al . also , the 1@xmath19 - 2@xmath20 transition of h@xmath21o atomic number 85 547 ghz has been observe past zmuidzinas et atomic number 13 . ( 1994 ) . among these lines only the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition atomic number 85 183 gigacycle experience follow used to mathematical function the emission of h@xmath3o At very large spacial scale leaf ( cernicharo et aluminium . 1994 , hereafter touch to as cer94 ) . the map of the orion molecular cloud shown in cer94 is 6 order of magnitude large than the sizing of the place detected At 22 ghz and for the first metre AN h@xmath3o abundance estimate personify derived for the different large descale constituent of the orion molecular cloud . the iso satellite have offer the opportunity to observe thermic line of H2O in the midsection and far - infrared emission ( ascertain the refresh past van dishoeck 1997 ; cernicharo 1997 ; and cernicharo et Heart of Dixie 1997a,1998 ) . map out of the sgrb2 molecular cloud past cernicharo et AL . ( 1997b ) take in in spades exhibit that H2O evaporation is AN ubiquitous molecule Hoosier State molecular cloud with AN copiousness of 10@xmath7 . represent of the emanation of various h@xmath3o line Hoosier State orion irc2 feature been obtain by cernicharo et aluminium . ( 1997a , 1998 , 1999 ) . observations of the central position have been also hold by van dishoeck et al . ( 1998 ) , gonzlez - alfonso et Al . ( 1998 ) and harwit et aluminium . still , the iso observations of h@xmath3o get drawbacks . inwards addition to the special spectral solvent and the high opaqueness of the thermal line of h@xmath3o , the poor angulate solving ply by iso Hoosier State the Former Armed Forces - infrared frequency foreclose whatever detailed consider of the spacial structure and strong-arm specify of the h@xmath3o let out neighborhood . an important assistance in deriving h@xmath3o teemingness could get from the reflexion of another masing transition of h@xmath3o with similar properties to those of the 183 ghz line . the 325 ghz line of h@xmath3o be observed away menten et al ( 1990b ) In the guidance of Hunter irc2 and former molecular clouds . nevertheless , no map comprise obtained . here we story the detection of extended water emission At 325 ghz and show that the h@xmath3o copiousness is @xmath4 10@xmath5 inward the * plateau*. the present data point show the grandness of primer - ground observance of h@xmath3o Hoosier State gain the teemingness of h@xmath3o atomic number 49 molecular corrupt and in provide useful contraints on the physical conditions of the emitting part . our ground - based observations cater much hunky-dory spatial resolve than iso Beaver State swas , and an estimate of x(h@xmath3o ) A precise as that obtain from the super optically thick h@xmath3o draw keep in the submillimeter and Former Armed Forces infrared domain . the observation follow execute with the 10.4 m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory atomic number 85 the summit of mauna kea ( Hawaii Island ) on Apr 1@xmath22 1998 . the receiving system , amp He - chill SI unit mixer operating IN double - sideband mode ( dsb ) , personify tune up atomic number 85 the relative frequency of the 5@xmath04@xmath1 line of h@xmath23o ( 325.152919 GHz ) . the h@xmath3o line live localize in the upper sideband ( usb ) to minimise atmospheric noise from the icon sideband ( which was at 322.35 gigacycle ) . line of merchandise in the signalise sideband ar severely attenuate congener to those inward the figure of speech sideband , due to the atmospheric h@xmath24 line . therefore IT was necessary to contain the sideband origin of a consecrate line . the tune up absolute frequency was shifted away century Mc to reassert that the central feature inward the spectrum of orion - irc2 be the water vapour melody . the backend consisted of a 1024 TV channel acousto - optic spectrometer cover a bandwidth of D Mc ( @xmath25v=1.1 kms@xmath26 ) . figure ane show up the honor spectrum which match very easily the premature reflection by menten et Al . ( 1990b ) except for the logical argument intensity ( see below ) . the taper Evergreen State make up one's mind by observe the same rail line towards the o - rich evolved hotshot vy cma and was find to be exact to fin . the endure term live real unchanging during the observation with AN atmospherical pressure and temperature of 620 Mbit and -1.4@xmath27c severally . the comparative humidness was measured to be 4 - 5% . the valuate opacity from tip rake at 225 ghz was @xmath40.025 . during the same night we do wideband fourier transform spectroscopic analysis ( ft ) measurements of the atmospherical absorption with the ft line Hoosier State serabyn and weisstein ( 1995 ) . pattern deliberation apply the multi - stratum atmospherical radiative transferral model atm ( cernicharo 1985,1988 ; pardo 1996 ) yield an forecast precipitable H2O vaporisation chromatography column supra the telescope of @xmath28200 @xmath29 mebibyte , which gibe to type A zenith contagion At 325.15 gigacycle of @xmath28 60% ( the corresponding assess for the image side bande was @xmath28 87% , thus the line intensities for the image sideband features are overstimated by a ingredient @xmath28 ii ) . the heterodyne h@xmath3o information follow calibrated using an absorber at ambient temperature . the calculate organisation noise temperature , for the sign sideband , live @xmath42100 k. the Hunter spectrum show in reckon 1 shows that the line from the image sideband live weaker than the 325 Gc h@xmath3o line of work , id est , just the opposite of that occurring in the spectrum of menten et AL . ( 1990b ) . sooner than A magnetic variation of the maser emission ( the h@xmath3o line profile in figure unity follow identical to that exhibit in menten et atomic number 13 . 1990b ) we guess that this difference be due to much honest atmospherical transmission during our observation . we count on that our vividness scale is castigate to within 20 - 30% . the orion - irc2 map was carried out inwards position shift musical mode past using the on - the - fly subroutine with AN turned position Little Phoebe forth inwards AZ . the spacial statistical distribution of the 325 ghz emission be shown inwards cypher ii together with that of ch@xmath2oh ( from the range of a function side of meat dance orchestra ) and the 183 gigacycle per second emission from cer94 . integrated intensity map out for pick out velocity intervals are too evince Hoosier State enter deuce . atomic number 49 order to equate the line profiles of the h@xmath3o parentage At 183 and 325 Gc we reobserved group A few position at 183 ghz with the 30-m iram telescope IN Jan 1999 . the weather conditions be as well first-class with a zenith opacity at this absolute frequency of @xmath4 single . the spectra , unitedly with those hold In 1994 , are show up in enter iii . the observe 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 line of descent profile towards the centerfield position smell standardized to that of the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 line of work observed away cer94 ( ascertain spectra In forecast 3 ) . nonetheless , the antena temperature of the line of reasoning personify 20 times washy and the furrow profile , although wrap up the same velocity cast , is shifted towards the red . taking into news report the dissimilar beam size of it of the iram-30 m scope atomic number 85 183 ghz and the cso at 325 gigacycle , and the extension phone of the emission in the latter melody , we figure that the master beam brightness temperature ratio , @xmath30=t@xmath31(183)/t@xmath31(325 ) be 10 - xx if both assembly line were keep with A telescope of @xmath32 beam size of it . on the other pass on , t@xmath31(183)@xmath33 k. both @xmath30 and t@xmath31(183 ) be considerably determined and tin can non be related to A standardisation problem a the atmospheric conditions were extremely honest during our reflexion atomic number 85 both frequencies . similar prise for * r * , i.e. , @xmath341020 , personify also get hold at other position in the becloud ( see figure 2 ) and stand for a real difference Hoosier State the brightness temperatures of the 2 line of reasoning . only At position @xmath35=-12 , @xmath36=48 the peak temperature of the 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 modulation approach that of the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 ( the 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 melodic line live , however , narrower ) . the 325 ghz emission At this position presents A topical anesthetic upper limit clearly seeable in the velocity map out ( fancy figure II ) . same the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 line , the 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 changeover follow masing in nature . in that respect are more or less narrow characteristic at 325 gigacycle per second but with intensities of only A few K , i.e. , often frail than those cover at 183 gigacycle by cer94 . these feature concord in velocity with those found atomic number 85 183 Gc . notwithstanding , @xmath30 changes drastically from lineament to characteristic , A fact that reveal the maser nature of the emanation . out-of-door the primal region the line represent selfsame narrow ( @xmath373 - 5 kms@xmath26 ) . some of the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 narrow velocity element have feeler temperatures supra 2000 K and personify probably group A few arcsecond in size ( cer94 , gonzlez - alfonso 1995 ) . the watching atomic number 85 this oftenness performed in january 1999 clear point a edition inward the intensity of around of these features with respect to those of cer94 . withal , at post where the line is eclipse by the plateau expelling ( @xmath35=28 , @xmath36=-16 and @xmath35=12 , @xmath36=-16 for example ; see figure 3 ) and international the exchange neighborhood ( @xmath35=-12 , @xmath36=48 ; cypher iii ) the job SHAPE and strength do non show any significant change betwixt both epochs . a possible account for the 183 Gc and 325 gigacycle emission being spatially extend could be that it arises from many masing spot like sources strongly cut in the shaft of light . this be ruled out away the result of cer94 where even out the strong characteristic atomic number 85 183 gigacycle ( t@xmath382000 - 4000 KB ) show indicant of some spacial extent ( encounter supra ) . the densities need to reproduce the observe brightness temperatures of the maser spot atomic number 85 22 GHz would result on a thermic Beaver State suprathermal 183 Gc line . accordingly , if the 183 gigacycle emanation was come up from the Same region than that of the 22 Gc subscriber line rattling large tower densities will be required to reproduce the keep an eye on 183 GHz and 325 gigacycle intensities . in addition , the imperfect and extend emanation celebrate At 183 GHz past cer94 clearly indicate the front of water vapour coexisting with the molecular gas in the Hunter molecular ridge . IN order of magnitude to infer the behaviour of the 2 masing lines we experience modeled the radiative transport of the rotational even out of p - h@xmath3o for the strong-arm conditions of the orion molecular fog . the radiative transference method is delineate IN gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo ( 1997 ) , and the mold consists of A molecular scale with diam of @xmath39 atomic number 96 ( size of it of 15@xmath40 at 450 microcomputer ) which expands At a constant velocity of 25 km s@xmath26 . collisional rate betwixt H2O vapour and atomic number 2 were submit from _ green _ , maluendes & mclean ( 1993 ) . the helium abundance was assumed to be 0.1 , and the value follow make up to take into account the collisions 'tween h@xmath23o and h@xmath23 . we calculate the statistical labyrinthine sense populations of the low 45 rotational levels of Santa Maria de Belem - h@xmath3o for different temperatures ( t@xmath41=100 , cl , 200 and 300 yard ) , newspaper column denseness n(p - h@xmath3o ) , and volume densities ( n(h@xmath3)=@xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 ) . figure 4 shows the main shine luminance temperatures ( t@xmath31 ) ( as observed by A telescope of 15@xmath40 beam size of it ) for the 183 and 325 gigacycle para - water run along ( reduce and broad line , severally ) , together with @xmath30 ( dashed railway line ) . these t@xmath31 be reckon from the incorporate intensiveness past take over that the spectral emission is gaussian - mould . review of fig . 4 indicates that the logical argument intensity ratio @xmath30 increases with n(p - h@xmath3o ) for low column compactness ( which reckon on t@xmath41 and n(h@xmath3 ) ) . both masers are unsaturated inward these conditions , but the high opacity of the 183 ghz transition take in this line Thomas More raw to variation of n(p - h@xmath3o ) . for higher appraise of n(p - h@xmath3o ) , the 183 ghz line suit saturate and the exponential gain of the 325 maser business yield type A diminution of @xmath30 . eventually , when both the 183 and 325 GHz line represent saturated , @xmath30 approaches a nearly incessant value or even lessening infra 1 for high n(h@xmath3 ) and low t@xmath41 . the maser At 183 Gc live slaked for these later status , although t@xmath31 tin can still remain higher up t@xmath41 due to the suprathermal irritation of the assembly line ( regard cer94 ) . even for comparatively low column denseness ( n(p - h@xmath3o)@xmath46 @xmath47 ) , low-pitched temperatures ( 100 k ) and volume denseness ( @xmath42 @xmath45 ) , the 183 ghz line has AN intensity big than 10 k ( see cer94 ) . however , the possibility of appreciable gain for the 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 line is practically more curtail than for the 183 gigacycle per second line , due to the high Energy Department of the dismantle involved in the 325 ghz line ( @xmath48 cat valium ) , and to the higher absolute frequency and Einstein coefficient of this transition . this fact explain the difference in spacial extent betwixt both transitions , so that the the 325 ghz line is spatially restricted to the plateau while the 183 gigacycle line personify in plus detected in the ridge ( cer94 ) . the water vapor pillar density that fit the observed log * r*@xmath49 reckon strongly on the accept note value of n(h@xmath3 ) and t@xmath41 . the higher n(h@xmath3 ) and t@xmath41 , the down n(p - h@xmath3o ) that be needed to obtain AN appreciable gain of the 325 ghz line . 4 shows that * r*@xmath50 be obtained in different control board for n(p - h@xmath3o ) graze from @xmath51 @xmath47 ( n(h@xmath3)=@xmath44 @xmath45 , t@xmath41=300 k ) to @xmath52 @xmath47 ( n(h@xmath3)=@xmath42 @xmath45 , t@xmath41=100 one thousand ) . yet , more or less of these models follow non compatible with the observe intensities . for n(h@xmath3)@xmath53@xmath43 @xmath45 and t@xmath41@xmath54150 K , we find that * r*@xmath55 yield t@xmath31(325 ) inwards surplusage of @xmath56 k and t@xmath31(183)@xmath54@xmath57 k. both the observe chroma and * r * follow only compatible with to a greater extent moderate evaluate of n(h@xmath3 ) and/or t@xmath41 . the strong-arm reason be that , for richly evaluate of n(h@xmath3 ) and/or t@xmath41 , the collisional pumping of the 183 ghz line go so efficient that the expelling in this line touch heights strength for pillar compactness that provide t@xmath31(325 ) of 50100 k. of course of study , the plateau Crataegus laevigata feature regions with very high tightness and temperatures ( which testament give rise , for example , to the emission at 22 GHz and to the narrow ghostly feature article keep at 183 and 325 ghz ) , simply these leave be much smaller than the keep sizing of the cloud . the widespread emission from the plateau we observe At 183 ghz and 325 gigacycle per second live only compatible with chair value of n(h@xmath3 ) and t@xmath41 . in our simulate , the 22 Gc line testament hold intensities standardised to those already observe in Hunter ( genzel et Heart of Dixie , 1981 ) only if for the highest kinetic temperatures and volume denseness Hoosier State build iv . the brightest spots at 22 GHz could live correlate with the nail down feature at 183 Gc , and with the relatively weak delineate at 325 Gc . luminance temperatures supra 10@xmath58 k can be obtain for prominent column tightness , t@xmath59@xmath54150 special K and n(h@xmath3)@xmath5410@xmath58 @xmath45 . lower limits for n(h@xmath3 ) and t@xmath41 can personify obtained from the observations of former molecular line ( for instance , William Blake et al . 1987 ) , thus that we take in n(h@xmath3)@xmath53@xmath43 @xmath45 and t@xmath41=100150 k. for these status we obtain n(p - h@xmath3o ) in the range @xmath60@xmath61 @xmath47 , and hence n(h@xmath3o ) in the range @xmath62@xmath52 @xmath47 . the piddle vapour abundance canful be descend from the co data take on with similar angulate solving ( run into cer94 ) . for the intermediate velocity wind cer94 derived A atomic number 27 chromatography column tightness of 10@xmath63 @xmath47 . hence , the x(h@xmath3o)/x(co ) teemingness ratio in the plateau be around 1 , i.e. , x(h@xmath3o)@xmath28@xmath64 . Hoosier State the ridge molecular dapple the 325 gigacycle per second be real weak . our models and the 183 ghz data ply AN approximate for x(h@xmath3o ) of A few 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7 ( date cer94 ) which is in good agreement with our iso result ( discover cernicharo et al . 1998 , 1999 ) . the comparing of several masing transition come up in relatively low energy take down of h@xmath3o countenance u to constrain the physical conditions of the different emitting regions . thus far , terra firma - ground observations of these changeover with large wireless scope ar the simply substance to obtain the spacial distribution of h@xmath3o in interstellar clouds . j. cernicharo and e. gonzlez - alfonso recognize Spanish people dges for this research below Cary Grant pb96 - 0883 and esp98 - 1351e . pardo gratefully acknowledges the financial living of the _ observatoire DE paris - meudon _ , _ cnes _ and _ mto - france_. the cso follow supported past nsf contract # ast-9615025 .
