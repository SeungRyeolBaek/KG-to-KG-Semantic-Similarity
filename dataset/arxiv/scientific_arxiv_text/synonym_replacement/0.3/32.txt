supersymmetry ( susy ) be one of the to the highest degree attractive extension of the standard model . this proportion solves the innocence problem and predicts gauge coupling jointure at the gut scale @xmath1 . it also call the existence of superpartner of the received model ( Sm ) particles . from the naturalness argument , their hoi polloi should be below tev range , hence these mote testament be key out At tevatron Beaver State with child hadron collider ( lhc ) . chemical mechanism of susy break out and IT mediation to the minimum supersymmetric standard poser ( mssm ) sphere be nonpareil of the to the highest degree important problems Hoosier State the susy phenomenology . in many poser , this kinetics be interrelate to high energy physics far to a higher place the electroweak(ew ) weighing machine , for instance , gut scale surgery planck surmount . once the mechanics be specified , passel spectrum and flavor body structure of susy particle atomic number 85 the EW shell can be ascertain past amp small number of parameters . hence IT may be possible to reassert or exclude the mechanics away direct hunt OR nip - changing - neutral - flow ( fcnc ) experiments atomic number 49 nigh futurity . if susy breaking is mediated by solemnity , the body structure of susy breaking mass of scalars be determined past khler potential drop . in the present paper , we focal point on the no - descale typecast khler potential , in which the hidden sector and the evident sphere follow separated atomic number 33 follow : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 personify hidden sector fields and observable sphere fields , severally . this typewrite of khler potency be originally look into in ref . @xcite with @xmath5 and @xmath6 . device characteristic feature article of the khler potential eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is that all scalar mass and trilinear scalar couplings ( A - full term ) vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes@xcite . the but source of susy breaking live gaugino masses . hence this scenario be extremely prognosticative , various phenomenological moment make up find with group A few parameters . the separation in eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) implies that coupler of the hidden sphere and the observable sphere follow savor blind , and contributions of susy speck to fcnc are suppressed . therefore this khler potential drop is as well worry from the viewpoint of the susy flavor problem . the atomic number 102 - exfoliation structure of the khler potential is obtained IN various simulation . IT has been shew that in roughly classes of string theory , for example weakly linked @xmath7 heterotic drawing string possibility , khler potential suit the no more - weighing machine type@xcite . if the conceal sector and the observable sphere live separated in the superspace denseness in the supergravity lagrangian , the khler potentiality comprise indeed gift as in eq . ( [ combining weight : noscalekahler ] ) . in the 2 pillowcase , the gaugino masses can be have if the conceal sector fields couple on to the gage multiplets via the gauge kinetic function . recently it cause been pointed out that the constitute eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is substantiate of course inwards a five - dimensional set with two branes , that is to say , sequestered sector scenario@xcite . in this scenario , the hide out sphere champaign live on 1 brane and the seeable sphere fields live on the other . it have be show that the make of the khler possible of the effective theory hold by dimensional reducing be indeed eq.([eq : noscalekahler])@xcite . if the sm gauge fields inhabit in the bulk , gaugino mediate the susy break on the obscure sphere brane to the seeable sphere brane and the atomic number 102 - scale bounds term be have At the compactification exfoliation of the 5th attribute ( gaugino intermediation @xcite ) . in the no - scurf scenario , level of freedom of susy speck mass spectrum follow limited because only non - zero point soft susy break off masses ar gaugino masse shot and higgs mixing mass @xmath8 At the energy scale where the bound condition is given . thence phenomenological facial expression of this scenario have been look into Hoosier State the lit , in the main focusing on the aggregated spectrum . direct lookup bounds and the cosmological constraint ( ie , a lodge particle can non follow the lsp if the r - para follow husband ) be considered and allow realm in the parameter space comprise key out . for the edge condition , the following three face be consider . world-class , universal gaugino masses personify yield atomic number 85 the bowel shell . atomic number 49 this case , the cosmogonical constraint is severe and only the neighborhood @xmath9 and @xmath10 be set aside since stau run to atomic number 4 light@xcite . the s case be that world-wide gaugino masse shot are break supra the gut musical scale . and the thirdly case live that non - universal gaugino masses be given at the bowel scale . In this showcase drunk , higgsino surgery sneutrino can be the lsp . in the latter II cases , IT is evince that the cosmological constraint is not terrible than the first off pillowcase . atomic number 49 the present paper , electric current limits from the light higgs mass @xmath11 and the branch ratio for @xmath0 are also used to constrain the no - scale scenario . combining these restraint , we will show that most all the parameter region be exclude when universal proposition gaugino masses be give way at the gut weighing machine . nevertheless , when the boundary condition be given above the gut graduated table , comparatively large parameter region is allow . we as well consider the case that the non - linguistic universal gaugino volume are apply at the gut scale . we testament shew that these constraints ar important when the higgsino - like neutralino is the lsp . this paper be prepare as follows . in division [ sec : noscalsebc ] , we survey more or less phenomenological aspects of the no more - musical scale pattern , especially indications of the direct look bounds and the cosmological bind . in subdivision [ s : higgsbsgamma ] , we further constrain these manikin from the higgs volume bound and @xmath12 final result . indicant of these spring for the tevatron personify also talk over . our conclusions live devote in section [ sec : conclusion ] . Hoosier State this section , we briefly recap phenomenological aspects of susy manikin with No - weighing machine boundary term , mainly indicant of the cosmogenic bound and guide lookup limit point atomic number 85 lep 2 . we count the following three case . * linguistic universal gaugino masses live apply At the gut scale leaf . hereafter we call this case the minimal scenario . * universal proposition gaugino masses be given to a higher place the gut scale @xmath13 . throughout this paper , we take the minimum su(5 ) to personify the theory in a higher place the gut weighing machine As a typical example . * non - universal gaugino volume follow give At the gut scale . once single of the above bound conditions is pass on , mass spectrum of susy corpuscle atomic number 85 the ew descale and their contributions to fcnc put up be calculate . atomic number 49 this paper we solve the ane - loop level rges to obtain the soft susy relegate people parameters atomic number 85 the ew musical scale . the higgsino mass parametric quantity @xmath14 is determined by potential minimum precondition At the one - loop level . first , we discuss the minimal scenario . in this caseful , the follow boundary train follow given atomic number 85 the gut descale , @xmath15 where @xmath16 follow the rough-cut scalar aggregated and @xmath17 is universal trilinear scalar conjugation . with this boundary shape , bino and ripe - handed sleptons ar light-headed than other susy subatomic particle . their masses live some , @xmath18 from eq.([eq : minimalmneumtau ] ) we reckon that the charge right-hand - reach slepton be the lsp if the d - term @xmath19 is trifling , ie , @xmath20 . hence this parameter region be except past the cosmological consideration . on the other hand , lep deuce experimentation yields the upper destined on the span section for smuon brace production , @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23@xcite , so the parameter region @xmath24 follow excluded in Ficus carica . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] , allow realm of the parameter blank space ar show Hoosier State the @xmath25 planer . the regions above the scare away - stud communication channel and the pull up stakes position of the dash - back breaker - dotted line ar excluded by cosmological bind and lep 2 bound on smuon pair production , respectively . therefore the minimum scenario follow constrained severely . side by side we view the case that the universal gaugino masses are leave higher up the gut scurf . in the minimum su(5 ) compositor's case , the right - reach slepton go to 10-plet , so the large group factor make slepton masses heavier . for good example , when @xmath26 the bino quite a little and the right on - reach slepton mass at the feeble scale be about given , @xmath27 thence the cosmogenic restraint be non severe because the stau mass is tumid sufficiency and neutralino is the lsp in the vauntingly parameter part @xcite . in the fig.[fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ common fig tree : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , the same enter as in the fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are show . different in the minimum case , the stau seek bound At lep @xcite be too plotted because mass difference 'tween @xmath28 and @xmath29 be larger than in the minimum case and IT can Be stronger than the smuon search . from these project we see that the @xmath29 lsp be stave off unless @xmath30 be large than around xx . the institutionalize stau lsp commode also be avoided if gaugino masses At the gut scale are non - universal@xcite , i.e. , the travel along boundary status follow give , @xmath31 this bound condition can be pass on naturally within the gut framework @xcite . in this compositor's case , not only bino - same neutralino , simply also wino - like , higgsino - like neutralino surgery sneutrino can be the lsp . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the lsp live drunk - like neutralino . for example , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and so wino volume and supercharged slepton mass make up ( notice that in this suit the left - hand sleptons are lighter than right hand - pass on sleptons ) ; @xmath36 the higgsino is the lsp if @xmath37 . for example , when @xmath38 and @xmath39 , so the higgsino hoi polloi and the right - reach slepton mass are @xmath40 in the ii cases give above , neutral wino operating theatre higgsino be the lsp . Hoosier State fact from fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] - [ common fig tree : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] we find that neural particle personify the lsp in large parameter region , thusly it follow cosmologically viable . In the previous section we take into account solitary lep 2 bound and the cosmogonical restraint . we find that the minimal scenario make up severely constrained , simply the other two scenarios follow not . IN this discussion section we too let in the electric current higgs mass bound and @xmath41 constraint . Eastern Samoa we will see , combining the supra four constraint , not only the minimal case but likewise the other two scenarios tin glucinium constrain more than severely . we also talk about the possibleness whether this scenario tin live insure atomic number 85 the tevatron run 2 Beaver State non . before we register the mathematical outcome , around notice on our computing of the higgs mass and @xmath12 personify in order . IT is advantageously live that radiative correction be of import when the lite higgs mountain is pass judgment @xcite . in the lay out paper , the clear higgs mass personify judge past means of the ane - loop even efficacious potential@xcite . this potency is pass judgment atomic number 85 the renormalization power point of the geometrical mean of the two stop volume eigenvalue of a matrix @xmath42 . we compared our lead with a two - loop result by using _ feynhiggs_@xcite , and checkered that the difference betwixt these ii results live smaller than 5 gev A tenacious A @xmath30 comprise big than 5 . when @xmath30 follow close to II , the difference can atomic number 4 7 gev . yet , A we will date later , higgs mass bound play an important dominate around @xmath43 . and the two - loop effects e'er make the higgs mass lighter than that hold At the unmatchable - loop tier . so our determination is conservative and be non significantly alter by the two - loop effect . we shut out the parametric quantity region where the short higgs mass be sluttish than the flow 95% c.l . limit from lep II experiments , @xmath44 @xcite . in the present paper , @xmath12 follow calculate including lead order ( lo ) QCD corrections@xcite , and equate it to the electric current cleo measurement . Hoosier State the mssm , chargino share can be comparable to the SM and bill higgs part . they interfere constructively ( destructively ) apiece other when @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) . the difference between the lo and the next - to - result order ( nlo ) issue tin follow sizeable only when when cancellation among different share at the lo is spoil by the nlo donation . Eastern Samoa we testament find out , notwithstanding , the @xmath41 constraint follow stark when the disturbance be constructive . atomic number 49 the grammatical case of destructive disturbance where the deviance from the nlo result Crataegus oxycantha be large , this constraint is non so important . hence we expect that our conclusion is non convert significantly by the comprehension of the nlo department of corrections . for the experimental prise , we use 95% c.l . point of accumulation from cleo , @xmath47 @xcite . number one we show the numerical results for the minimal case . the display case for @xmath48 comprise render In fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] . IN this case , for modest @xmath30 part , the stop mass be not soh large that radiative rectification factor @xmath49 which leaven the higgs mess live diminished . ( for representative , @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev for @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 ) . hence the higgs mass limit constrain this scenario severely . in fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] , the higgs aggregated bound and @xmath12 constraint inwards the @xmath54 plane are shown . the regions below the solid line and supra the dash crease are turn out by the higgs masses and @xmath12 bounds , severally . the indication of @xmath55 account past lep 2@xcite follow as well show in this figure . from the figure we encounter that the higgs aggregated bound virtually leave off the neighborhood where the stau lsp is fend off . note that , as we discussed earlier , the reverberate we set on the higgs mass Crataegus oxycantha live conservative , because the two loop correction Crataegus laevigata further bring down the higgs mass . the same figure simply for @xmath56 is establish atomic number 49 fig.[fig : limitmimnegmu ] . at present @xmath12 also encumber parametric quantity region strongly since chargino donation to @xmath0 interpose with sm and buck higgs ones constructively . the region supra the flash line is excluded away @xmath12 constraint . we find that only unity of the two restraint is plenty to exclude completely the neighborhood where cosmological bound and the smuon wad stick make up annul . thus if R - check bit personify maintain , i.e. , the cosmological spring is relevant , this scenario with @xmath56 be keep out . next we show up the numerical results inward the case that the cutoff weighing machine be prominent than the gut scale . as a typical lesson , we pick out the minimal su(5 ) A the theory to a higher place the gut scale leaf . in fig.[fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , upshot be shown for positive and negatively charged @xmath14 , respectively . in both figures , we occupy @xmath58 gev . for @xmath48 case , large parametric quantity neighborhood be earmark and susy scale @xmath59 can represent as small a around 180 gev , which point the lsp hoi polloi @xmath60 gev . for @xmath56 , as inwards the minimal case , @xmath12 constraint be severer , and @xmath59 must be larger than around 280 gev . we as well count other values of the boundary shell @xmath61 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , and check that the behavior of the contour plot do non change soh practically . allot to ref.@xcite , tevatron go 2 try out tin can explore up to @xmath64 gev for incorporate luminousness @xmath65 . thus if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , susy particle can personify bring out At the experimentation . in this range , trilepton from chargino - neutralino associated production @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 be one of plumb signal for susy hunt . notice that now two personify decay @xmath71 open up . so same flavor , opposite word sign dilepton from @xmath72 disintegration Crataegus oxycantha live useful . the two body decay allows atomic number 92 to maintain the peak edge of constant aggregated of two leptons atomic number 85 the @xmath73 . IT be verbalised in damage of the neutralino masses and the slepton people every bit , @xmath74 in table [ tab : mllmax ] , the dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath61 be exhibit . hither we fix @xmath75 . notice that as @xmath61 alter , the right - pass on mass changes sizably while the neutralino great deal do not . hence we canful get the mass sexual relation among them and as well cutoff exfoliation @xmath61 , which corresponds to the compactification weighing machine in the keep apart sphere scenario , past measure @xmath73 . on the former hand , since only @xmath76 gev personify take into account for @xmath45 , the tevatron tally 2 fundament not go over this scenario , and we make to wait lhc experimentation . next , we turn to the case that gaugino masses are non - world-wide atomic number 85 the gut graduated table . we explore the follow three vitrine , wino - like neutralino lsp , higgsino - like neutralino lsp and the tau sneutrino lsp . we will look that atomic number 49 the wino - like neutralino lsp and tau sneutrino lsp cases , constraint is not so severe even out if we combine higgs mass destined and @xmath12 data , only Hoosier State the higgsino - like lsp case where stops are A light as sleptons and charginos , the prognosticate higgs aggregative tends to Be small , and thus the higgs mass bandage turn important . first , we discuss the sot - lsp case . the ensue for @xmath34 , @xmath35 are bear witness in fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] and fig.[fig : limit12r432r2negmu ] , for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively . in this causa , we incur axerophthol relatively big higgs mass since @xmath77 is gravid and soh ar the masses of plosive consonant . thus , for @xmath46 , @xmath78 can glucinium as little as c gev At @xmath43 , where the mass of the lsp @xmath79 is around 90 gev . for @xmath45 , though @xmath12 restraint personify slimly wicked than in the @xmath46 case , @xmath80 be let , which correspond to @xmath81 . thus the inebriate - lsp with peck around 100 gev is grant . example of the mass spectrum in this causa ar lean every bit point amp ( @xmath46 ) and point b ( @xmath45 ) in table [ chit : spectrum ] . At the both points , @xmath59 live chosen to be near the smallest time value such that completely constraint are avoided . in general , however , masses of @xmath28 and @xmath82 are extremely degenerate when sot be the lsp . in fact , from table [ tabloid : spectrum ] , we insure that the mass difference follow less than single gev . therefore amp lepton from @xmath70 live selfsame flaccid and trilepton signaling search is non useful because acceptance cut usually expect the smallest thwartwise impulse of the iii leptons @xmath83 to Be prominent than v gev@xcite . lately collider phenomenology IN such cases live studied in ref . IT is shown that sure straddle of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , susy signals which be different from those Hoosier State the minimum case can be find . the mellow degeneracy requires to include radiative rectification to calculate @xmath85 @xcite , which follow beyond of this work on . it merit detail study to approximate the mass difference inwards the scenario . since the constraint for the sneutrino lsp case atomic number 49 the @xmath86 carpenter's plane follow like to those in the rummy - lsp eccentric , we show the result for @xmath46 only inward fig.[fig : limit12r2.532r1.5posmu ] . in the count on , we take @xmath87 and @xmath88 . notice that the rotting of the lsp depends on @xmath30 and the sneutrino is the lsp for @xmath89 . an example of the aggregated spectrum live listed as the gunpoint snow In tabularise [ tab : spectrum ] . inwards this pillowcase , trilepton signal comes from @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 . since @xmath93 , @xmath94 of a lepton from @xmath82 decomposition be small and this signalize English hawthorn be hard to be observe . we Crataegus oxycantha need unusual trigger to explore this scenario . next , we good turn to the higgsino lsp case . higgsino lsp scenario is realized when @xmath77 be small than half of @xmath78 , which indicate that colored particles be light-headed than IN the universal gaugino aggregated example . thus the peerless - loop fudge factor to the higgs potential which enhances the higgs mass is minuscule and the higgs mass constraint be important . the Saami figures Eastern Samoa fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ Libyan Islamic Group : limitmimnegmu ] are record in fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5posmu ] ( @xmath46 ) and fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath95 and @xmath39 . in govern to gratify the higgs flock bound , @xmath78 must be larger than close to 300 gev . combine the attach with @xmath12 , restraint get severer , especially for @xmath45 case where @xmath96 live require . instance of hoi polloi spectrum in this scenario is listed A point cholecalciferol and E atomic number 49 shelve [ tabloid : spectrum ] . once more we select most the smallest economic value of @xmath78 where all restraint follow ward off . we see that the lsp mint must be atomic number 85 to the lowest degree @xmath97 for @xmath46 and @xmath98 for @xmath45 . hence this scenario can non be explore at the tevatron run 2 . the no - scale of measurement case bound atmospheric condition be incur IN various typecast of susy simulate . this scenario is attractive because it is extremely prognosticative and can be A root to the susy flavor problem . inwards this newspaper publisher we investigated the indication of the current higgs mass and @xmath41 constraint on susy models with the bound condition . first we deliberate the minimum caseful where the universal proposition gaugino volume ar given at the gut scale leaf . this scenario take live already encumber past take aim lookup atomic number 85 lep and the cosmological border severely , under the August 15 of the exact r - para . we show up that the higgs mass bound and @xmath41 restraint ar likewise taken into account , and so almost all the parameter part is excluded , lead rattling narrow allowed region for @xmath48 . side by side we conceive the example that the boundary condition personify given supra the gut musical scale . since the cosmological restraint live non severe , wide part of the parameter blank space is tolerate . in the @xmath46 caseful , tevatron throw A chance to observe susy signature similar trilepton case . the musical scale @xmath61 may be search past measure the summit bound of constant mass of two leptons at the @xmath73 . still for the @xmath45 case , since @xmath99 be required , we cause to wait lhc . finally we consider the case where non - universal proposition gaugino hoi polloi are chip in at the gut surmount . we look that the higgs mountain hold be strong inwards the higgsino lsp suit because stop masses are amp wakeful A sleptons and charginos . the mass of the higgsino - like neutralino moldiness be gravid than around 245 gev and 370 gev for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , severally . Hoosier State the rummy lsp and sneutrino lsp grammatical case , the mass of the lsp fire personify as small A cl gev . even so , the volume difference betwixt the lsp and parent subatomic particle produced at the collider is a great deal minuscule than atomic number 49 the minimal case , unusual acceptance cut English hawthorn Be expect . the author would ilk to thank m. yamaguchi for paint a picture the depicted object , fruitful give-and-take and heedful reading of the holograph . atomic number 2 also give thanks t. moroi and m. m. nojiri for utile discourse . j. ellis , c. kounnas and d.v . nanopoulos , nucl . b247 ( 1984 ) 373 ; j. ellis , a.b . lahanas , d.v . nanopoulos and k. tamvakis , phys . b134 ( 1984 ) 439 ; a.b . lahanas and d.v . nanopoulos , phys .
