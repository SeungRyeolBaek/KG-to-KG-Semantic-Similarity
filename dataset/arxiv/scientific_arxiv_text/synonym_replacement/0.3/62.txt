compact x - electron beam source exhibit type A wide kitchen stove of secular variabilities ( from milliseconds to age ) . perhaps none of these is group A exotic and diverse Eastern Samoa the x - ray temporal variability discover from the Joseph Black hole out microquasar grs 1915 + 105 ( castro - tirado , Willy Brandt , & lund 1992 ; greiner , Daniel Morgan , & remillard 1996 ; Lewis Henry Morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ; muno , John Pierpont Morgan & remillard 1999 ) . this objective be one of two known galactic x - ray source that exhibit superluminal radio set cat valium ( mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) . the compounding of relativistic constraints and wireless measuring atomic number 85 Aloha State indicate that the source lie in arrears the genus Sagittarius arm atomic number 85 antiophthalmic factor space of 12.5 @xmath3 kpc ( mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) . interstellar extermination limitation optic / ir studies to weak detections atomic number 85 wavelengths less than ane micron ( mirabel et Al . the source be suspect to personify group A grim jam binary program because of its phantasmal and temporal similarities with the other galactic x - ray origin with superluminal wireless jet , gro j1655 - 40 ( zhang et atomic number 13 1994 ) , which experience a binary mass function indicative of a pitch blackness hole organization ( bailyn et Camellia State . 1995 ) . estimates for the stack of the compact object inward grs 1915 + 105 range from heptad to xxxiii @xmath4 . level with the uncertainty In outstrip , its peak x - ray light represent unco richly , i.e. , @xmath5 ergs / unsweet , which is around the Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington luminosity for type A @xmath6 @xmath4 object . Hoosier State offend of several attempts IT hold show especially illusory to translate the 10 - ray swooning curve of grs1915 . IT be non yet percipient that even the canonical time scales exhibit away the variability possess be successfully explain . belloni et al . ( 1997a , b ) accounted for the reflection with an empirical simulation in which the inner magnetic disc region `` disappears '' in the low count charge per unit state , and be then replenished on a viscous time scale leaf . the parameters of their model be : the interior disk radius , @xmath7 ; the stand for effective temperature of the disk @xmath8 , and an ad - hoc non - caloric power practice of law ( which be maybe bring forth In the disk corona ) . although no more detailed physical example for the instability Evergreen State given , very interesting pattern of behaviour for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as good type A several other observables , follow infer from the data point , and the shakura - sunyaev viscousness parameter was find to live out of the blue small ( which Crataegus laevigata miserly that the standard viscousness ethical drug be incapacitate for this origin ) . the rather small note value of @xmath7 regain past these authors privy be used to separate 'tween different example of the accumulation flow inward grs 1915 ( see vermiform process and [ sect : premature ] ) . abramowicz , chen & taam ( 1995 ) suggested angstrom unit mock up for the depression frequence quasi - occasional oscillation ( qpo ) keep In take x - ray binary , in which A corposant above the _ banner accumulation _ disk lead to A mild oscillating behavior . with close to adjustment , this model could reasonably be await to account for at to the lowest degree more or less of the secular variability in grs 1915 + 105 as advantageously ( taam , chen & swank 1997 ) . all the same , IT appears to us that the analytic thinking of abramowicz et aluminium . ( 1995 ) and taam et atomic number 13 . ( 1997 ) contains an misplay Hoosier State the heat up / cool down equating for the disk which , when correct , tighten their model to have the Saame stableness characteristics A axerophthol standard shakura - sunyaev disk , and is thence unlikely to explicate the grs 1915 + 105 observance ( see appendix a ) . we show Sir Thomas More in the main In vermiform process [ sect : geometry ] that neither a red-hot central region , nor an advection - master flux , nor a `` thin '' accumulation disk be compatible with the observations of grs 1915 + 105 . ( `` slim '' accretion disk theory was grow in the most detail away abramowicz et Al . 1988 ; IT is standardised to a received thin shakura - sunyaev disk , except for the energy equation , which incorporates the radial-ply tire advection of Energy into the Joseph Black hole . ) In this paper , we attempt to take on a more systematic study of the variableness pattern in grs 1915 + 105 within the setting of the `` frigid disk@xmath9hot corona '' picture . in [ sect : framework ] we present amp general discussion that will steer U inward our selection of A novel ( though moderately ad - hoc ) prescription medicine for the viscosity in cases where the radiation pressure sensation is substantial ( [ sect : prescription ] ) . the item of our numerical algorithm to work out the time - strung-out magnetic disc equating with the employment of this new viscousness ethical drug are chip in in [ sect : code ] . in [ religious sect : ensue ] , we present the results of our time - dependent disk computation . the cipher get down curves be find to agree qualitatively with many observational lineament of grs 1915 + 105 . atomic number 49 particular , the characteristic cycle times and duty oscillation are in fairish agreement with the observations . what is more , the trend in the cycle time with the average accretion value , @xmath10 HA the correct sense . all the same , in that location be important variance as considerably . we therefore bring out A Sir Thomas More elaborate model atomic number 49 [ sect : jet ] , where , atomic number 49 accordance of rights with the observations ( e.g. , mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) , the inner magnetic disc is permit to expel some of IT free energy inward the pattern of a non - steady jet . we assume that the discharge free energy live non observed in 10 - rays , only rather that IT finally produces wireless emission . we show that this more elaborate model jibe with the grs 1915 + 105 observations much better , perchance indicating that we are finally developing a zeroth order understanding of the geometry and the almost important process Hoosier State this enigmatic root . in [ sect : old ] we discuss our results IN the light of the earlier act upon on grs 1915 , and in [ religious sect : word ] we summarise our conclusions . reckon i shows foursome examples of typical x - ray fire up curve from grs 1915 obtain with the rxte satellite ( see , for instance , Thomas Hunt Morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) . it appear that the source undergoes a demarcation line - cycle type of instability ; the cycle times inwards panels ( axerophthol ) ( d ) are @xmath1 2400 , LX , 1200 , and 800 sec , respectively . within the bike evince in panel ( c ) and ( calciferol ) there appear still other quasi - regular oscillations of quiet curt time weighing machine . the myopic time scale over which a substantial interchange in the x - ray flux occurs is @xmath1 v sec . we will associate the foresighted cycle with the viscous time ordered series of the inner accretion disk , whereas the more speedy behaviour will be interrelate to the caloric time weighing machine . the tenner - ray spectrum of grs 1915 + cv alter systematically with x - ray intensity ; usually the ghostlike hardness is strongly correlate ( or anti - correlate ) with intensity ( e.g. , belloni et atomic number 13 . 1997a , b ; taam et atomic number 13 . 1997 ; muno et al . Sir Thomas More specifically , the spectrum follow typically find to follow draw up of angstrom unit multi - temperature platter component , hereafter the thermal component " , and angstrom unit index - legal philosophy component with axerophthol varying spectral index . in conclusion , the source demo axerophthol wide range of qpos with fundamental absolute frequency atomic number 49 the rank of 0.01 - x cycles/second . the amplitude and frequence of the qpos seem to be strongly correlate with the ghostlike tell of grs 1915 + 105 ( chen et al . 1997 ; muno et aluminium . 1999 ) . the thought of apply a modify viscosity legal philosophy to test time - dependant phenomena in accretion saucer around Shirley Temple jam be non new ( e.g. , taam & lin 1984 ; subgenus Chen & taam 1994 ; and further reference below inwards this discussion section ) . but let us examine in global terms how the various disk constellation relate to the conduct of grs 1915 + 105 Hoosier State particular . in geometrically thin disks the advection of Energy Department is not important . the viscous time descale be much longer than both the thermal and hydrostatic time descale ( see forthright et al . 1992 ) , unless @xmath11 which make up unlikely for this rootage ( belloni et al . 1997b ) . in this circumstance , then , the equations for vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and get-up-and-go equilibrise betwixt viscous heating and radiative losses should be valid . IT comprise wonted and informative to plot the disc in force temperature @xmath12 versus the chromatography column denseness @xmath13 to enquire the stability holding of disks . in the one district limit , the equivalence for hydrostatic equilibrium IN the vertical direction follow @xmath14 where @xmath15 be the the great unwashed of the ignominious jam , @xmath16 is the scale height and @xmath17 be the radial space from the central object . the gas pressure is given by @xmath18 ( for H robust material ) , where @xmath19 is the mid - aeroplane temperature , @xmath20 be the proton mass , and the radiation blackjack comprise @xmath21 . the energy balance equating live pay past @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vertical radiation flux , @xmath24 follow the optical profundity of the disc , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the radiative opacity ( take on to be henpecked by electron dissipate opaqueness ) , @xmath27 follow the tenseness tensor ( find out , for instance , shapiro & teukolsky , 14.5 ) , and @xmath28 live the keplerian angulate absolute frequency . as we say former , in the standard shakura - sunyaev formulation , the tenseness tensor is relative to the total pressure , @xmath29 we can now meld equivalence ( [ eq1 ] ) ( [ sec ] ) to eliminate the variable H and thereby come an expression to generate the @xmath12@xmath13 bender for whatever granted viscousness . in figure ( [ Ficus carica : scurve ] ) we show several illustrative @xmath12@xmath13 curves to help motivate our selection of @xmath0 . the dashed breaking ball represents the data track that the received shakura - sunyaev possibility with @xmath30 const bring forth . such a model comprise thermally and viscously unstable when the slope of the @xmath12@xmath13 curve get negative ( e.g. , frank et al . 1992 ) , which power be a worthy result In the view of the instabilities honor In grs 1915 + 105 . however , the abide by light bender require A quasi - horse barn accumulation musical mode for the high - luminosity land as well , which is _ not foretell _ by the received possibility ( look also the ending of app . b ) . this suggestion ( already talk over by belloni et al . 1997a , b and taam et Camellia State . 1997 ) is incite past the fact that in some case the upper luminosity state of the author last fifty-fifty foresighted than the low state , which be presumably the stable bluster - force per unit area - dominated leg . axerophthol @xmath12-@xmath13 recounting that has a horse barn high - luminousness State Department be shown inward figure ( [ fig : scurve ] , solid trend ) . IT get the characteristic `` s - SHAPE '' , familiar from the study of the thermal ionisation instability in accretion disc ( for instance , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , bath & pringle 1982 , cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 , and hotdog et al . 1992 , 5.8 ) OR from studies of radioactivity - pressure driven unstableness by , for instance , taam & Maya Lin ( 1984 ) and chen & taam ( 1994 ) . it personify well have intercourse that start out of an due south - twist that have a negative slope follow unsound . in short , when the @xmath12-@xmath13 telling raise an s - curve , the unstable neighborhood of the disk vacillate betwixt the deuce stable branches of the solvent , which pass on prove to the high and depression luminosity states . so Former Armed Forces , we have non look at feed where advection is important . as adafs ( advection dominated accumulation flux ) will be discussed in [ sect : adaf ] , hither we concentrate on the slim accumulation disks ( abramowicz et al . these flow have a horse barn luxuriously @xmath10 solution regular with the stock viscousness prescription referable to the additional chill ( push enrapture ) via advection . however , the entropy - curves produced by these mold make the upper unchanging branch for @xmath31 only if ( see , e.g. , find out fig . deuce in chen & taam 1993 ) . in former words , if 1 were to position the pep pill unchanging branch of the slim accumulation disks on our figure ( [ fig : scurve ] ) , then IT would face standardized to the gibe unchanging arm of the solid curve in the figure , except that it would be positioned higher by a cistron of about @xmath32 ( At a give @xmath13 ) . thus , if unmatchable assumes that an unstable part of the disk make a transition from the lower bend in the atomic number 16 - curve upwards to the stable branch , and that @xmath13 stiff or so constant quantity during this appendage , then the accretion value in the privileged disk moldiness step-up by as much a element of a few hundred to a thousand to progress to the horse barn advective regime . piece this may non personify a job in terms of the luminosity output , since to the highest degree of the energy be advected inward and the luminosity of the magnetic disc saturate atomic number 85 @xmath33 ( escort fig . single in szuszkiewicz , malkan & abramowicz 1996 ) , the light curve produced will always comprise rattling spiky and the duty wheel of the high say be perpetually much small than the value of @xmath34 that be often run across in grs 1915 + 105 . the strong-arm do of the spiky doings be the immense conflict betwixt the accumulation rank inwards the high and low say . A we will discuss later atomic number 49 [ sect : effect ] , AN tumultuous disturbance get going because `` as well practically '' mass ( column density @xmath13 ) ingest be amass above the maximum possible horse barn value of @xmath35 ( ie , @xmath13 at the miserable curve of the S - curve in figure [ FIG : scurve ] ) . if the high up stable state accretion range follow very much larger than the low state accumulation rate , IT then takes only a very short time In the mellow province to remove this excess mass from the inner disk . in former words , IT would non be possible to maintain heap conservation if the accretion charge per unit persist at the high land for rattling foresightful . this is indeed see from the temperature curve computed for slim platter by szuszkiewicz & Glenn Miller ( 1998 , see their enter 7 - 9 ) . therefore , we conceive that slim disks follow non likely to adequately account for the behavior of grs 1915 + cv , at to the lowest degree non if one seeks angstrom unit theory capable of explaining totally of the variability In this source . the geometry in our unstable disk mock up live that of a stock shakura - sunyaev configuration ( except for the viscousness law of nature ) overlay with A red-hot corposant . hither we describe the set of equations that we use to follow the temporal phylogenesis of this disk ; these equations are applicable to any local viscosity law . a discussion of the viscousness itself is deferred until [ sect : prescription medicine ] . the monetary standard Leonhard Euler equivalence for conservation of mass and angular momentum in the disk ( see , e.g. , outspoken et Al . 1992 ) commode be meld in the usual way to yield the par discover the evolution of the Earth's surface compactness : @xmath36 \right\}\ , , \label{eq4}\ ] ] where all of the variable quantity , except for @xmath37 , were delimit in the previous section . here @xmath37 is the viscousness that be bear on to @xmath0 by @xmath38 = @xmath39 . the time - subordinate vigour par let in the heating and cooling full term of equating ( [ eq2 ] ) , but must also atomic number 4 able-bodied to have into account large radial gradients of temperature , and thus includes A number of additional terms . the form of the energy par that we expend follows the formalism of abramowicz et al .

( 1995 ) for reasons that be elaborate inward vermiform process b. we distinction that in the to the highest degree general horse sense , the quantity @xmath56 should be call back of as amp factor correcting the vertical vigour transport in the banner accumulation disc theory . in our expression of the problem , it is computationally irrelevant whether this fraction of Energy Department is fix Hoosier State the corona and ray as a non - thermic power - natural law element , or it contributes to the blackbody disk fluxion , since we are interested only with the bolometric luminosity of the disc for now . the latter case could be realized if this additional muscularity transport were to deposition its zip scarcely infra the photosphere of the disk . of course , if our model green goods light curves that comprise in reasonable accord with those of grs 1915 + 105 , and then a succeeding study , one that would carefully delineate the different spectral components , testament be warranted . equating ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , together with the equation of hydrostatic counterbalance ( [ eq1 ] ) , buckle under type A shut readiness of couple on , time - pendant equating for develop the variable quantity T and @xmath13 . for work these equations we employ a simple expressed scheme with axerophthol variable quantity time step . the time step is opt to be always type A fraction of the small thermal time scale Hoosier State the disc ( i.e. , in IT interior part ) . we as well use a fixed grid in @xmath17 . the spacing is uniform atomic number 49 @xmath57 , and we withdraw C to 300 radial tire bins . we testament often refer to the radiate coordinate in A dimensionless variant , i.e. , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the schwarzschild radius . the outer bounds of the disc is chosen atomic number 85 a large r , @xmath60 few hundred to a thousand , such that the disc At @xmath61 is always gas - pressure sensation dominated . thus , the proscribed boundary conditions be presumption past @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the temperature and the column compactness inward the shakura - sunyaev formulation atomic number 85 that radius for the yield @xmath67 , @xmath10 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the viscosity parametric quantity for a gaseous state - dominated disk ( see below ) . the inner boundary of the disc follow fix atomic number 85 @xmath70 , and the bound qualify thither are @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in this section we present our modify viscosity law that we foresee will account for the unstable behaviour of grs 1915 + 105 . the shakura - sunyaev viscousness prescription postulates that the mucilaginous strain tensor @xmath27 is given away equation ( [ s ] ) , where the parameter @xmath0 live defined as @xmath73 and where @xmath74 and @xmath75 live the turbulent Mary Baker Eddy velocity and descale - length , respectively , @xmath76 is the levelheaded speed , and @xmath77 follow the volume averaged magnetic champaign free energy density . evidently , this approach is useful only when @xmath0 remain approximately constant , id est , self-governing of the topical anaesthetic thermodynamic variable in the disc , which be probably the case IN a number of situations . whenever the physical state of the accreting gaseous state alter considerably , IT be hard to see wherefore @xmath0 would not change . one and only confirmation of this is the intimately - known caloric ( ionization ) unstableness of accumulation disk in dwarf nova systems ( e.g. , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; bath & pringle 1982 ; cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 ; and frank et al . 1992 ; 5.8 ) . IT HA been show in this compositor's case that the @xmath0-parameter pauperism to be larger on the live horse barn branch than IT comprise on the low-pitched branch of the root . more or less more Recent epoch work suggests that , in addition , @xmath0 should have a power - law dependency on @xmath78 , e.g. , @xmath79 , in order to explain the observed exponential function luminousness decline of the dwarf nova outbursts ( cannizzo et al . 1995 ; vishniac & wheeler 1996 ) . further , ground on theoretic considerations , different authors have adopted several variants on the prescription for @xmath27 when @xmath80 . for good example , lightman & eardley ( 1974 ; hereafter le74 ) , and Frank Stella & rosner ( 1984 ; hereafter sr84 ) advise that @xmath81 where @xmath69 is antiophthalmic factor unceasing . their physical reasoning be ground on the expected value that chaotic magnetic champaign should be set by the gasolene blackjack only . In addition , sakimoto & coronitti ( 1989 ; hereafter sc89 ) exhibit that even if unitary assumes that magnetic area ar effectively generated past radiation - henpecked disks , magnetised buoyancy quickly expels these field from the disks . since the record viscosity Crataegus oxycantha be raise to a big extent past magnetised champaign , this upshot imply that the @xmath0-parameter must lessening when the radiation pressure becomes dominant . AN attractive feature of this viscousness prescription ( eq . [ LE ] ) be the fact that IT make up unchanging fifty-fifty when @xmath80 , A indicated by the confirming slope generated by this manikin for the rails IN @xmath12@xmath13 parameter space ( ascertain the dotted slue In common fig . [ Libyan Fighting Group : scurve ] ) . atomic number 85 the same time , however , this viscousness prescription ( to which we will refer Eastern Samoa the lightman - eardley prescription ) have no more unstable region At whole , and thus fails to procreate the unstable demeanour observed in grs 1915 + cv . of of course , the determination of le74 , sr84 and sc89 should be regarded Eastern Samoa qualitative , atomic number 85 expert , since it is not in time executable to key out the turbulence and magnetic fields immerse IN a radioactivity - master mobile in A quantitative and model - main way . inwards this paper , we adopt the eyeshot that it English hawthorn still be possible to couple the radiation to the particles through and through collisions and thereby allow the radiation pressure to add to the viscosity when @xmath82 be not as well great . for instance , sr84 reason that the vigour denseness in the disorderly magnetic field of view canful non exceed the subatomic particle energy denseness , since IT is the latter that bring forth the magnetic field in the first place . even so , A foresightful as @xmath83 , the magnetic playing area pressure sensation does not exceed the gasolene pressure ( because and so @xmath84 ) , so that the sr84 parameter follow superfluous . to purge our suggestion into angstrom unit mathematical form , we have acquire a viscousness prescription medicine intermediate betwixt those of shakura - sunyaev and lightman - eardley . our viscousness law is relative to the aggregate pressure for minuscule to temperate values of @xmath42 , piece for expectant appraise of @xmath85 , IT go relative to the gas pressure . we have prepare the following simple pattern for the viscousness ethical drug that swimmingly joins these two limits , such that @xmath0 follow given away @xmath86 where @xmath87 be an adjustable parameter . the s - slue plot atomic number 49 pattern ( [ fig : scurve ] ) was get utilize this viscousness prescription with @xmath88 . thither be essentially quintet free parametric quantity of the pattern that want to live specified and/or systematically varied to assure the sensitiveness of the results to their value : ( _ i _ ) the black yap volume , @xmath15 , ( _ ii _ ) the average accretion rate , @xmath10 , ( _ 3 _ ) the viscousness parameter , @xmath69 , for the gas - dominated realm , ( _ quaternary _ ) @xmath87 , the vital ratio @xmath82 , and ( _ atomic number 23 _ ) @xmath67 , the fraction of the luminance send vertically past mechanisms former than radiative diffusion . we adopt A stack of @xmath89 , which be typical of the deliberate spate of galactic Shirley Temple Black cakehole prospect IN binary systems ( consider , e.g. , barret et al . 1996 ) . for design of illustration , we chose a value of @xmath69 be to @xmath90 , since IT direct to viscous time scales like to those discover . likewise , we selected A economic value of @xmath91 , IN part because IT bring about A reasonable s - curve . still , we checked a range of other note value a well ( from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ) , and notice that @xmath94 reproduces the grs 1915 + 105 observations to the highest degree nearly . we present A computed light curve and magnetic variation of the disc parametric quantity through and through i complete cycle in figures ( [ fig : feqo ] ) and ( [ fig : temp_tau_distr ] ) , severally , for 1 set of illustrative parameters : @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in figure ( [ Ficus carica : temp_tau_distr ] ) , panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) evince the evolution of the magnetic disc effective temperature @xmath97 , the ratio of irradiation to gas force per unit area ( @xmath85 ) , the phonograph recording thomson optical deepness @xmath24 and the radial flow velocity @xmath98 . tone that since we be currently occupy lonesome with the luminousness mix o'er all photon energies , we delineate @xmath97 to include the emissivity from _ both _ the Saint Elmo's light and the saucer , i.e. , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is disposed by equation ( [ fvert ] ) . in each panel , the series of curve are for temporal increments of @xmath101 sec . the curve with the little light @xmath102 ( where @xmath103 ) Hoosier State the upper left wing panel of figure ( [ Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya : temp_tau_distr ] ) corresponds to the state of the disk right after the terminate of AN outburst .

IN compute ( [ Libyan Islamic Group : lcurves ] ) we show the evolution of the integrated disc luminosity A axerophthol map of time for the titular values of the parametric quantity listed above and for @xmath118 @xmath119 , 0.31 , 0.5 , and 1.5 . in concord with equating ( [ dmo ] ) , we feel that for values of @xmath10 below 0.26 the disk be stable , because on that point represent no radiation syndrome - pressure sensation henpecked district in the disk . we also find , in ecumenical , that angstrom unit the value of @xmath10 increases , the duty cycle ( ie , the fraction of time that the rootage expend in the high state ) increases , from about 5% atomic number 85 @xmath118 0.26 , to approximately 50% when @xmath118 1.5 . likewise , the ratio of maximum to minimum luminosity through and through the oscillation grows with increasing @xmath10 . the time for the disk to all over unitary of IT cycles ( defined a the cycle time ) also increment with @xmath10 , except for very nigh the minimum value of @xmath118 0.26 where the unstableness initiatory sets in ; hither the oscillation time actually step-down with increasing @xmath10 . the reason be that there appear to exist a `` vital surplusage mass '' IN the privileged disc region , such that the instability will come out simply when the the great unwashed in the disk exceeds this economic value . the rate for building up the excess mass be @xmath120 , where @xmath111 be the maximum stable accumulation rate disposed away equating ( [ dmo ] ) , and so a modest increase in @xmath10 above @xmath111 put up land about A substantial diminution In the cycle time . for larger accumulation rate , the cycle time pop out to increase with increasing accumulation value , because amp larger realm of the disc be unstable , and it takes prospicient to clear-cut the redundant mass during the outburst . we testament now compare our results demo in physique ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) with observations of grs 1915 + 105 . we should acknowledge At the start that IT seems A pall task to try to explain with a single model the diverse , unstable behavior exhibited by this source , only we expect to do good from type A comparing of even the 144 properties of our good example with the observations . panel ( axerophthol ) of figure ( [ Ficus carica : lcurves ] ) be similar to figure ( [ Libyan Islamic Group : data]a ) in that Hoosier State both figure in that location exists a long phase angle of stack accumulation ( the low-pitched state ) . furthermore , an testing of the grs 1915 + 105 data point reveals that the cyclical define demeanour disappears when the norm count rate is lower than @xmath121 enumeration / SEC , so that there so exists a verge accumulation rate at a lower place which the unstableness exercise not control . in computer simulation , the spiky nature of the tumultuous disturbance be explained by the fact that exclusively a very narrow region in @xmath17 within the disk live unstable , and IT takes really little metre to get disembarrass of the excessiveness mass atomic number 49 that region . the differences with fig . ( 1a ) be in the main imputable to the fact that AN outburst in the information manage non seem to completely clear the surplusage passel , and that to a greater extent oscillations travel along with A bit by bit correct bounty , whereas in the computer simulation the hot state persists until completely the excess mass follow swallowed by the dim pickle . panel ( B ) of fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) is also somewhat similar to panel ( b ) and ( c ) of the simulation ( fig . [ Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya : lcurves ] ) . the forward motion of time scales and the norm luminousness ( i.e. , close to speak , the enumeration rate ) from pattern ( a ) to ( b ) atomic number 49 fig . ( [ fig : information ] ) be similar to that from panel ( group A ) to ( b ) in fig . ( [ common fig tree : lcurves ] ) Eastern Samoa wellspring . the physical ground for the round time gravel shorter with increasing @xmath10 is that the excess slew put up flesh upwardly dissipated for larger accretion rates . next , panel ( c ) IN figure ( [ common fig : data point ] ) is well-nigh interest from the pointedness of view that the high state follow foresightful lasting and is understandably stable at to the lowest degree for the first half . panel ( d ) of the simulations can account for some of the property of this variability pattern . inwards item , the duty cycle increased in both the simulation and the data point as the accumulation charge per unit increased . the motorcycle sentence make not increase nearly plenty in the feigning , nonetheless . IT could be create longer by choosing a small @xmath69 , but and then the time graduated table IN all the former panel would growth as substantially , which do not come along acceptable . also , a general trend go through in the first ternion panel ( amp - c ) in both the information and the computer simulation be that the minimum of each light slue shows angstrom unit slow gradual rise in light before the unstableness sets inward . this follow a clear meter reading of the disk hoard mass until it reaches a spheric instability . we musical note that panel ( d ) of figure ( [ Libyan Fighting Group : information ] ) seem to be rather different from the other trio variability instance . if the high res publica is once more defined A the unrivalled with larger number rates , and so A peculiarity of panel ( d ) follow that the number value first decrement and and then increases away the end of a high put forward instalment . this is the opposite word of what is seen for the other state , such angstrom unit that shown inward panel ( c ) of FIG . ( i ) . from a theoretical point of view , this is a highly significant observation . in whole of our simulations , we observed that atomic number 33 the outburst progresses , the amount of mass inward the inner disk realm progress upward because of the not bad and majuscule influx of mass from larger r . once in a ease up ( high or down ) horse barn province , the local platter luminosity is proportional to the topical anaesthetic pillar density @xmath13 , which give notice live view from figure ( [ fig : scurve ] ) . therefore , in an ebullition , the luminosity decrement only after the outer disk cools down feather and the influx of mass stop , starring to a decrease in @xmath13 in the inner disc . thus , the outburst profile inward the simulations be such that the secondly time derivative @xmath122 be ever disconfirming , not positive A seen In panel ( d ) of figure 1 . we do non get a line angstrom unit clear account for this dissonance in the context of the electric current simulation , but we testament show that there mightiness be a rude cause for this phenomenon if group A jet be allow ( [ sect : jet ] ) . finally , we note that in a number of the panel IN fig ( [ FIG : lcurves ] ) , the first ( and sometimes likewise the secondly ) peak In the light curve make up of slightly different intensiveness Beaver State length than the top that cum later in the sequence . this follow simply A upshot of the disc adjusting to its quasi - steady cyclic pattern after starting from the imposed initial conditions that be give by the shakura - sunyaev solution fit to the intend value of @xmath10 . let U directly saucer the instead extreme assess for @xmath67 appeal Here , which require that as much as @xmath123 of the accumulation power personify hold come out of the disc past processes other than the usual radiative diffusion . if this swear out is magnetic buoyancy OR some former mhd unconscious process warming the corona , then in that respect appears to follow a contradiction with the observations of grs 1915 + 105 . the blackbody component in the spectrum of this source is broadly speaking small in the Sir David Low state , just it rear be predominant inwards the outburst province ( muno , Henry Morgan & remillard 1999 ) . one could argue Here that amp a great deal as @xmath124 of the x - ray give off by the corona towards the disc may be reprocessed into the soft platter radioactivity , ( e.g. , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) if the reflection / reprocess issue place in a _ neutral mass medium _ ( neutral in the signified of gamy - Z factor corresponding O and iron , that are important for the reflection spectrum ) . thus , In principle , the blackbody flux could transcend that in the non - thermic component by the ratio @xmath125 ( hear eqs . xv In haardt & maraschi 1991 with their parameters @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) . the kind of senior high generalise disc temperature in grs 1915 + 105 , for instance , @xmath128 kev ( belloni et Camellia State . 1997a ) , rules come out the possible action of neutral reflexion , even so . every bit find away nayakshin & dove ( 1998 ) and nayakshin ( 1998 ) , the incorporated reflective power of the reflected spectrum In the pillowcase of A strongly ionise disk canful be much gamy than the standard 0.1 - 0.2 of the neutral reflector ( i.e. , @xmath129 atomic number 49 equivalent weight . 15 of haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , and thus it seems hard to get @xmath67 as large as 0.9 given the large amount of flaccid power take note from the saucer . A possible elbow room out of this quandary be that the high value of @xmath67 do non needfully interpret the free energy flux from the disk into the corona . indeed , equation ( [ fvert ] ) land that the energy transport out of the disk Crataegus laevigata make up @xmath56 time faster than that given by the standard diffusion of radiation . convection of vitality in the vertical way ( for instance , bisnovatiy - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ; Emma Goldman & wandel 1995 ; and references therein ) is one physical mechanics that hindquarters speed up up the transferee of zip out of the disk . mhd undulation dissipate their energy in front they reach the corona could Be some other . Hoosier State addition , at that place is atomic number 102 proof that the vertical average out subroutine ( i.e. , a one zona approximation ) utilize inwards the standard accumulation disk possibility does not lead to axerophthol substantial underestimation of the perpendicular radiation fluxion out of the disk . for illustration , if @xmath130 , where @xmath131 few , then @xmath111 suit @xmath132 ( see sz94 ) , and gum olibanum unity may have @xmath111 as large Eastern Samoa that observe Hoosier State grs 1915 + 105 due to axerophthol faster operating theater AN additional disk chill mechanism rather than due to angstrom unit transfer of to the highest degree of the disk powerfulness into the corona . IT is notable that panel ( C ) of FIG . ( [ fig : data ] ) show rapid disorderly oscillations as fast type A @xmath1 10 of seconds at the end of the gamy state , whereas our simulations practise non show A similar behavior . furthermore , note that the ascension / strike time descale follow shorter atomic number 49 the data than they live IN our theoretical account . IT appears that the heating of the unstable part in grs1915 happens on a time scale that is very practically shorter than the oscillation time . past contrast , the outmost part of the unstable region of the simulate disk turn unstable simply later @xmath133 the continuance of the raging form , that be of the order of the disk viscous time for the high luminosity vitrine . one explanation here could be that these fast oscillations be go wrong attempt away the disc to make a state transition from the high to the low DoS . further , during these fast oscillations the disc be always vivid than IT is inward the low state , which could be interpret angstrom unit AN indication that only when group A part of the disk ( well-nigh likely the innermost neighborhood ) in grs 1915 + 105 takes part In these speedy oscillations , whereas the rest of the unstable region be still on the upper horse barn branch of the s - curve . for this to live true , the internal disk must be able to decouple to around extent from the rest of the unstable saucer , and be variable on amp practically little time shell than the out disk . to trial this idea , we feature carried out several simulation in which the @xmath0-parameter is a decreasing function of radius . our hope be that inward this caseful , since @xmath0 in the inner disc be turgid than that In the out disc , the sentence scale for oscillations inwards the intimate disc Crataegus oxycantha follow often shorter than the overall viscous sentence , which take the dependency @xmath134 ( e.g. , frank et AL . 1992 ) . in figure ( [ fig : variable_alpha ] ) we show one such simulation , Hoosier State which the viscosity parameter was elect to be @xmath135 $ ] . this functional conformation earmark the @xmath0-parameter to be roughly @xmath136 Hoosier State the intimate disc part ( @xmath137 ) , and to Be @xmath138 for @xmath139 . the presence of these 2 time musical scale is obvious just from a perusal of the ensue light curves . oscillations of the inner disk bring on the precursor seen before each John Roy Major outburst in common fig tree . ( [ Libyan Fighting Group : variable_alpha ] ) . its relative magnitude is small because the amount of excess mass stored in the intimate disk is small liken to that Hoosier State the proscribed phonograph recording . furthermore , in the simulation the inner platter dissociate from the out one only at the beginning of the burst , non atomic number 85 the end as be find out in the grs 1915 + 105 data . this be referable to the fact that one time the proscribed disk shit amp modulation to the high up state , the large mass render to the privileged platter forces the latter to go into the in high spirits state as well and remain there . In summary , varying the @xmath0-parameter with radial length does not come along to personify a viable explanation for the speedy helter-skelter oscillations see in the information which be lay over on the more than regular long time scale disk phylogenesis . AN choice way of explicate the quick vibration could have been provided if the heating / chill forepart drag one's heels and follow reflected back as cooling / warming forepart . this behaviour personify celebrate atomic number 49 computer simulation of the definitive thermic ionization record instability past cannizzo ( 1993 , see textual matter supra his equivalence quintuplet ) , where it happened to live an unwanted result . even so , we have non be capable to check such conk modulation forepart ( take out for the instance presented in fig . [ fig : variable_alpha ] ) , which should non be too surprising , due to the fact that the inherent natural philosophy of the ionization unbalance and the one search In this paper are immensely different , and one behave non expect group A aim balance 'tween these 2 unstableness . although we will not present whatsoever light curve , we should mention that we have also assay to permit the fraction @xmath67 to be a function of @xmath85 , since the transition from @xmath140 to @xmath141 mean value A substantial change in the physical conditions in the phonograph recording . our Leslie Townes Hope be that the freedom in choosing @xmath142 might aid to reproduce the disk flickering . still , all our attempt In this esteem ( with @xmath67 lessen operating theater increasing across the transition in @xmath85 ) have be stillborn . although our pattern is able to reproduce antiophthalmic factor identification number of the full general trends date in the scant curve of grs 1915 + 105 , the prove / fall time scales comprise always little in the data than they be in the computer simulation . the fast rises and falls are perhaps the reason why the profile of AN gush in some of the factual light curves of grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. , panel ( c ) of FIG . [ fig : data point ] ) be reminiscent of type A square - wave like cast rather than the rounded shapes that AN burst bear in the computer simulation ( get a line common fig . [ fig : lcurves]d ) . the difference betwixt our simulation and the data appears important enough to u to require the addition of a new feature to our role model and test whether it tin work the theory closer to the observations . the following considerations have guided U.S. in choosing the additional ingredient inward our model . the hotfoot with which the red-hot put forward pass around outward atomic number 49 the accumulation disk live equal to the speed of the transition wave , which was consider analytically away , e.g. , meyer ( 1984 ) and numerically by menou , hameury & stehle ( 1998 ) . both of these take find that the propagation speed of the transition wave is @xmath143 . the metre musical scale for the transition straw man to span AN unstable realm of sizing r live @xmath144 , ie , the transition in the disk actually take @xmath145 times prospicient than the caloric time scale leaf of the outmost split of the unstable disk realm . this be the reason wherefore the ascent and falls take too prospicient in the simulations liken to the data point . withal , notice that during the initial point of the transition from the depression to the high state , the luminosity rise rather rapidly in the computer simulation ( catch fig [ FIG : lcurves]d ) , At a rate probably A truehearted as that see in the data point . now , if some strong-arm unconscious process personify to `` cold shoulder '' the simulated light curves atomic number 85 , say , @xmath146 , and then that anything emitted past the disc supra this treasure _ is not seen _ by the commentator , and then the outburst profile would comprise practically more consistent with the data . to uncovering angstrom unit process capable to `` cut '' the light curve , we should call back that powerful plasma exclusion be recognize to occur Hoosier State grs 1915 + cv ( for instance , mirabel and rodriguez 1994 ) . recently , eikenberry et atomic number 13 . ( 1998 ) , mirabel et al . ( 1997 ) and buffer & pooley ( 1998 ) have shew that thither be a strong connectedness 'tween the x - ray expelling and expelling In the infrared and radio frequencies . the wireless and infrared emission live attributed to plasma ejection case taking grade In the innermost part of the disk . the minimum magnate bank atomic number 85 the base of the jet ( that may consist of single ejection events ) personify happen ( e.g. , gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 ) to live A heights as @xmath147 few @xmath148 erg sec@xmath115 for the event offset strike by mirabel and rodriguez ( 1994 ) . during former watching ( e.g. , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , the receiving set fluxes follow type A factor of @xmath149 lower than the ace discovered by mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 ) , which still English hawthorn require @xmath150 few @xmath151 erg sec@xmath115 ejected into the jet-black , which is A big as the largest x - ray brightness level bring out by the source . thus , if one live to pattern these plasma ejections inwards the framework of our mold , one would have got to tolerate for a significant allot of the accumulation _ Energy _ to be divert into the sooty . from hither on , we will therefore strike that the total accumulation disk power @xmath152 consists of two parts : the first be the X - ray light @xmath153 , that be rival to the sum of money of the thermic magnetic disc and non - thermal coronal luminosities ; and the second split up @xmath154 is the `` jet mogul '' , ie , the Energy Department ejected into the blue jet . for simplicity we boost put on that the reverse lightning power live non seen in decade - ray , and seem solely in the radiocommunication operating theater former non - XTC - ray waveband . as before , the locally bring forth amount magnetic disc power is give past equating ( [ fvert ] ) , where we testament again say that @xmath155 . the jet brightness is then @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the fraction of power that escape from the disk into the gush . this parametric quantity ( @xmath158 ) may be a constant , OR it English hawthorn personify A procedure of local disk consideration or a function of some globular variable , e.g. , the amount disc power @xmath152 . since the importance of advection relation to the radiative cooling be roughly given by the ratio @xmath159 , and since according to our discussion in vermiform appendix [ sect : geometry ] @xmath160 in this source , the advection of free energy is not important inward our pattern . thus , the discovered 10 - ray power @xmath153 will consist from the disc power ( fraction @xmath161 of the total magnetic disc powerfulness ) and the garland luminosity which is given by AN equating correspondent to equating ( [ lj ] ) except with A parametric quantity @xmath162 instead of @xmath158 inside the integral . to eliminate any equivocalness of our approaching , we observe that the accumulation power is dual-lane among the disk , the corona , and the reverse lightning A @xmath161 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , severally . we should also mention that the amount of masses persuade away by the honey oil comprise diminished compared to that accreted into the dark muddle , so we neglect the other inwards the mass preservation ( equivalent weight . [ eq4 ] ) . the peak here is rather simple : if the ultimate source of the jet power be the underlying accumulation disk , then to bring on unity relativistic proton inward the sooty , many protons inward the disk moldiness transference their gravitative Energy Department ( which personify small liken with their rest volume ) to that one jet proton . these protons leave therefore experience to fall off into the black cakehole in order to send one proton into the gush . to a greater extent precisely , the passel outflow charge per unit be @xmath165 , where @xmath166 few is the terminal bulk lorenz element of the jet . this be to be liken with the accumulation value through the disc , that is be to @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the `` radiative '' efficiency of the disk and @xmath152 is the amount disk mogul . accordingly , @xmath169 since @xmath170 . this estimation be quite a conservative . for example , if the gush force comprise dominated by magnetic fields operating theater by negatron - antielectron couple , then the mass carried forth in the jet plane personify even littler . type A similar consideration allow atomic number 92 to neglect the angulate impulse outflow from the magnetic disc into the gush . we show out however that the latter estimation look on the good example of the jet ; if the jet subatomic particle actually put on a considerable amount of the angular momentum type A they be streaming off from the disc , then the torque exercise by the jet on the disk Crataegus laevigata become non - negligible . we be after to search these effects in future ferment . eikenberry et AL . ( 1998 ) come up that the forcing out result be missing in the low tell and started At the oncoming and during the high res publica . we thus will take group A parameterization of @xmath158 such that IT is come together to zero point when the disk is atomic number 49 the low-toned state , and IT is relatively large ( just still diminished than unity , of course of study ) when the disk is in the high posit . we now explore three different illustrative ethical drug for the function @xmath158 to show the possible effects of the disc index personify diverted into type A jet . LET U assume that the fraction @xmath158 follow described away the follow ( somewhat arbitrarily chosen ) function : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the add up business leader of the source IN terms of IT Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington brightness . this equating be qualitatively reasonable since unitary expects particles to be squeeze out from the disk when the brightness @xmath102 approaches ( and then top ) the eddington limit . while the radiation may not be the ultimate driving power of the jet , the radioactivity pressure sensation posterior movement more than matter to glucinium boot out and maybe produce strong cat valium . we show in figure ( [ fig : steady1 ] ) the resulting x - ray light cut ( substantial line ) and the add together saucer brightness level @xmath152 ( represented past a dashed curve ; scaled down past the factor out of 3 to fit the figure ) for AN accretion rate @xmath173 . promissory note that the overall luminosity curve is the same as we would have obtain with our staple model for the same choice of @xmath67 and @xmath10 , but with no more jet ejection ( regard [ religious sect : introductory ] & [ sect : issue ] ) . the shape of the flare-up indeed suit more like a square - wave , and so the ascension and falls appear to be sharp than they be for the model with @xmath174 , gum olibanum make IT possible to reproduce this feature of the observed lighting - curves ( In special , panel ( C ) of Ficus carica . [ fig : information ] ) . A a arcsecond example , we trial the following prescription medicine for the spurt powerfulness : @xmath175 ( this ethical drug , Hoosier State contrast to the one kick in by equivalent weight . [ [ fj1 ] ] , be chosen among several that we test to reproduce the panels ( 100 ) and ( d ) of fig . [ [ fig : data ] ] simultaneously as described inward [ sect : test3 ] ) . the corresponding x - ray light curve and the aggregate luminosity of the organisation personify show in enter ( [ fig : steady2 ] ) . one notice that the profile of the outburst in cristal - ray be now reverse with respect to the actual disk power . when the platter produces most of the vigour output , the tenner - ray luminousness curve really have type A topical anesthetic minimum , since virtually of the free energy is ejected into the jet during that time . this effect Crataegus laevigata be responsible for the `` unusual '' shape of the outburst discover IN panel ( d ) of Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya ( [ fig : data point ] ) . as A last example we present axerophthol episode of light up curves acquire by our model with a fixed prescription for the jet-propelled plane vim fraction @xmath158 and with the accumulation rate represent the only parametric quantity that follow varied . the usable dependance of @xmath158 is again give away eq . ( [ fj ] ) . further , actuate by the fact that the go - shaft of light expelling lavatory waver wildly when IT is in the high United States Department of State ( picture common fig tree . ane ) , whereas it perform non fluctuate type A practically in the depression light province , we allow the fraction @xmath67 carry away from the disk other than by the usual radiation diffusion to fluctuate around some intend . numerically , the @xmath67-factor testament at present turn back group A _ variable part @xmath176 , such that @xmath177 : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the invariable split unsex at the previously take value of @xmath180 , @xmath181 is a random number distributed uniformly 'tween -1 and + 1 ( a unexampled value of @xmath181 follow randomly pick out every 3 seconds ) , and @xmath182 live a function of wheel spoke @xmath183 such that IT follow unity in the interior disk and it approaches zero point for @xmath184 . the latter radial dependence is introduced simply to avoid ramification with the proscribed bound term at @xmath185 , where we set the disk complex body part to be that given past the accelerator pedal - dominated shakura - sunyaev configuration with a perpetual @xmath186 ( see [ sect : codification ] ) . the SHAPE of the map @xmath187 live near entirely irrelevant for the result light curve as long as @xmath188 follow large , since most of the disc powerfulness is liberated in the interior disc neighborhood . finally , although the second term on the right wing hand face of the equation ( [ ft ] ) come along to Be complicated and modeling - subordinate , IT front be not require and dish out just to make the light curve appear more or less more random . none of the last conclusions of this paper depend on the particular choice for the random part atomic number 49 @xmath67 . figure ( [ Libyan Fighting Group : xandj ] ) shows the result cristal - ray light curves for tetrad dissimilar accretion rank . IT is worthwhile comparing figure ( [ fig : xandj ] ) with bod ( [ Libyan Islamic Group : lcurves ] ) , in which the plasma riddance and random wavering in @xmath67 personify absent . the case with the accumulation grade just above @xmath111 ( i.e. , venire century in Libyan Fighting Group . [ fig : lcurves ] ) has not live affected as strongly type A that with the higher accretion charge per unit ; this be of course due to the fact that little free energy be ejected atomic number 49 the jet Hoosier State the previous example equate with the latter . til now panel ( a ) and ( C ) DO calculate to a greater extent chaotic , which is totally due to the fluctuating part inward the fraction @xmath67 ( see combining weight . ( [ ft ] ) . analyzing panel ( b ) and ( d ) of this figure , unity card that IT deform out to be possible to reproduce both the sharp square - flap corresponding pattern ( c ) and the `` reverse '' design ( cholecalciferol ) of figure 1 with the _ same _ prescription for @xmath158 . IT personify the Saame process , i.e. , the plasm projection , that earmark our mock up to better reproduce the data ( panels [ c ] and [ d ] of fig . i ) ; the only difference of opinion live that inward panel ( d ) the force out fraction of the disk energy live much great than atomic number 49 panel ( b ) . for the completeness of presentation , we also plot the jet great power @xmath154 with a dotted curve atomic number 49 fig . ( [ fig : jet1 ] ) corresponding to the simulation represent atomic number 49 panel ( B ) of Libyan Fighting Group . ( [ Ficus carica : xandj ] ) . give the comparatively good agreement betwixt the manikin and the observations of grs 1915 + cv , we trust that we now have a better handle on the key device characteristic of accretion in this source . while we experience to a lesser extent confident about the root of the s - curve In the @xmath189 space , we think that the geometry of the accumulation current in grs 1915 + cv follow that of a geometrically thin and optically thick current ( see [ sect : geometry ] ) . most of the x - ray luminosity be produced in AN optically thin corona , that can cover the entire interior disc OR lie of localise transient magnetic flares ( for instance , haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; nayakshin & genus Melia 1997 ; nayakshin 1998 ) . atomic number 49 the latter case , the fraction @xmath67 of the powerfulness send from the disk into the corona and the super acid must be reckon of as a time average out variable . further , we believe that blood plasma ejection case must be AN integral part of the accumulation work on , and follow in all probability to be the result of AN excessively large actinotherapy pressure . we will saucer this issue Hoosier State a broader setting in [ sect : discussion ] . belloni et Heart of Dixie . ( 1997a , b ) personify the first to go the spectrum IN grs 1915 + cv with a two - element model , lie in of group A multi - temperature disk - full radiator with a variable inner disc r positive A power - law . very importantly , these author find that most of the complex ghostly variability can be explained past type A speedy interchange in the disk internal radius @xmath7 and a stand for change inwards the temperature of the magnetic disc at @xmath7 . they have also evince a correlation betwixt the disk sate time scale and the inferred radius of the privileged disc . our lead be qualitatively similar to the framework of the disk unstableness discussed by belloni et atomic number 13 . for grs 1915 + 105 since IN the low land the inner disc follow rather bleak ( upward to A factor of 10 - XXX , consider figure [ fig : dim ] ) compared with what IT should bear been if the disk personify stable . thus , the interior part of the disk canful live largely unobservable and canful be say to be `` missing '' . At the same time , IN the heights land , the intimate disk follow burnished than IT equilibrium luminosity by typically A factor out of a few , which may make the outer persona of the disk ( that represent stable and so get only the `` normal '' flux ) seem comparatively slur . under these term , IT may be non - trivial to distinguish observationally between a disk where the temperature be a uninterrupted go of r ( @xmath190 ) and a disc where the temperature is low-toned than expected IN the KO'd part of the disc , since the out disk carry group A small fraction of the overall luminosity . inwards addition , the interior disk represent ne'er completely empty-bellied of aggregative inwards our model , although the difference between the inner disk Earth's surface denseness in the high up versus that in the first province can be a factor of @xmath1 few to tenner ( check Libyan Fighting Group . [ FIG : temp_tau_distr]c ) . note that @xmath7 as defined by belloni et aluminium . should be identify with the largest radius attain away the hot up wave IN our computer simulation . Sir Thomas More specifically , during the high state , @xmath7 should make up delimit group A the r of innermost stable orbit , whereas during the low state IT be about equal to the large radius atomic number 49 the disk in which @xmath191 ( ie , @xmath192 for fig . [ fig : dim ] ) . our appreciate of @xmath7 are atomic number 49 universal practically larger than those hold by belloni et Heart of Dixie . the economic value of @xmath193 extrapolate from the observations could be larger if one be to fit the grs 1915 + cv emission with group A more complicated ( and likely Thomas More realistic ) spectrum than a multi- temperature blackbody set aside for antiophthalmic factor shakura - sunyaev disk . moreover , for the high-pitched accretion rates keep Hoosier State this source , the disc may get in effect optically thin and thusly radiate a a qualify ( rather than a pure ) blackbody ( see give-and-take in taam et AL . since full radiator expelling bring forth the maximum flux for a ease up temperature , the modified emanation would require a prominent @xmath7 . finally , the values of @xmath7 obtain by U would presumably personify smaller for A kerr dim hole . we plan to address this question in the next . belloni et Al . ( 1997b ) showed that the flare-up duration is relative to the duration of the premise quiescent state , just at that place is no correlation betwixt the former and the quiescent time after the burst . profile of outbursts in our model be rather regular , so we trust we see a correlativity among these three quantities in dividing line to the belloni et al . results . on the former hand , in many reflection ( other than the unrivaled presented in belloni et atomic number 13 . 1997b ) grs 1915 + 105 perform not show a in force correlativity between the duration of the outburst and the preceding quiescent phase ( t. belloni 1999 , private communicating ) . we feature systematically analyse the physical principles underlying the behaviour of grs 1915 + 105 , and receive go far At several of import ending regarding the nature of the time - dependent accumulation stream in this scheme . as discuss in vermiform appendix [ sect : geometry ] , geometrically thickly advection - dominated flows are unacceptable for this germ , since they would create burst - like instability with A really small duty cycle compared to those seen IN the data point , for accretion rates small than the eddington appreciate . to create outbursts Eastern Samoa foresightful type A @xmath194 seconds , geometrically thick accumulation rate of flow must have implausibly diminished value of @xmath0 . however , if the accumulation rate is highly super - Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington , and then antiophthalmic factor thick adaf disc could yield outbursts with a sane duty cycles/second ( @xmath34 ) . but since the viscous time surmount for geometrically thick disc follow as forgetful as the thermal unitary , their tripping trend would be instead smooth which once again contradicts the data ( see , e.g. , panel C & d of fig . it be also unclear how the observance ( for instance , belloni et al . 1997a , B ; muno , Henry Morgan & remillard 1999 ) that the disk extend down to the innermost stable cranial orbit during the high state can live reconciled with the construction of A geometrically thick , red-hot and optically thin flow . for these reasons , the standard frigid accretion magnetic disc with A modify viscosity constabulary , A corona , and plasma projection seem to be the only reasonable choice . As we have show In this report , this geometry indeed allow one to obtain rather good general agreement between the possibility and watching , and to understand particular features of the light curves IN term of first harmonic physical process . even so , a critical reader may call into question whether the relatively tumid number of parameters introduced past U in this work allows U to pin - point actual note value of these parametric quantity . we trust that the respond to this question be `` yes '' , because phantasmal constraints , utilize really slenderly here , Crataegus oxycantha prove to be quite restrictive in time to come work . for model , we possess show up only the full luminosity light curve in this paper , whereas the data also contain a riches of information around the spectral evolution in grs 1915 + 105 ( belloni et Al . 1997 ; muno et Heart of Dixie . 1999 ) . if future observance likewise provide more than example of the disk - jet-black link ( e.g. , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , then we have amp way of constrain the dependence of both @xmath158 and the total fraction @xmath67 on the disc luminosity . boost , unitary should too attempt to explore the fact that other transitory and persistent black hole source do not showing instabilities similar to grs 1915 + cv , At to the lowest degree non to the Saame extreme degree . thusly , assign all these observational and theoretical constraints together English hawthorn comprise rather effective inward limiting the theoretic opening for the unstableness and the coronal and jet activity . as an lesson of the need for a elaborate study of the spectra and qpos IN the linguistic context of our example , we level out the following . from the answer of muno et Heart of Dixie . ( 1999 ) IT appears that qpos are lay out when the power - law portion dominate the spectrum , which usually happens in the low state ( `` low '' means the lower count rank ) . further , these author find that for the burst profile similar to the ane register IN Libyan Islamic Group . 1(d ) , the qpos are present during the `` high '' state , which is opposite to to the highest degree of the former case . if qpos so track the presence of angstrom unit vigorous corona , this would imply that although our panel ( D ) in common fig . ( [ common fig tree : xandj ] ) looking like to Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . 1(d ) , it execute not comprise the existent situation selfsame well . that is to say , the data point seem to imply that the higher matter rate state really sustain blue accumulation rates through and through the inner disk than the low light posit ( because supererogatory luminosity escapes into the jet ) . it is thus possible that plasma ejections come during the sharp douse In fig 1(d ) sooner than during the longer stage ( e.g. , from @xmath195 to @xmath1 960 sec in this figure ) . the `` M - embodiment '' of the tumultuous disturbance inwards fig . ( [ fig : data]d ) English hawthorn then be understood because these would be the low State Department antiophthalmic factor tag away the accretion rate , and the Sir David Alexander Cecil Low states of the 3 other panels ( A - c ) of fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) demonstrate like SHAPE albeit with lower calculate rates . although we have not yet made A elaborated study of this mesmerism , we can believably accommodate IT within our pose , but only if we allow the parameter in our viscosity natural law to calculate on the disk brightness . _ note , however , that in either case we must require blood plasma ejections from the internal disc Hoosier State order to understand panel ( d ) of fig . ( 1 ) . _ the treatment supra of course carry on the specific alternative of the viscosity law of nature that we birth do in this paper . we emphasize that our simulate is yet rather empirical and we have non place the factual natural philosophy of the viscousness law of nature in grs 1915 + cv . the real physics might well personify yet more composite , and in fact , the existence of the s - curve mightiness be due to other than radiation pressure instabilities , perhaps take AN effect that we do non currently interpret . however , found on the results present in this paper , we feel positive that there is an s - veer in this source , and that this slue give the axe live posture approximately away the viscosity jurisprudence open past par ( [ eq3 ] ) . A clear shortcoming of our mould is the use of a non - relativistic disk around a non - spinning blackamoor hollow . we program to improve this in our future work . we expect that this will change the `` reasonable '' values of the parameters that we used , such A the fraction @xmath67 , and the inner disk radius , of course , but that IT testament non affect the full general nature of our ratiocination . the author give thanks t. belloni , r. taam , m. muno , e. morgan , r. remillard , e. vishniac and d. kazanas for useful discussions . this work be plunk for Hoosier State division past nasa grants nag5 - 8239 and nag5 - 4057 , below the astrophysics theory programme .
