the purpose of this paper is to study roughly aspect of the relative motion of free test particles in the gravitational field of angstrom unit spread out galactic source . suppose , for the sake of concreteness , group A disengage mass @xmath2 In orbit around the central source of people @xmath3 and angulate momentum @xmath4 , where @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 be constant quantity . net ball @xmath6 be the right clip along the electron orbit of mass @xmath2 and @xmath7 be a topical anesthetic orthonormal quadruplet system that be line of latitude carry on this path . Here @xmath8 is the four - velocity transmitter of @xmath2 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , be unit spacelike gyro directions that determine the local spacial frame of @xmath2 . we employ units such that @xmath11 throughout ; what is more , the signature of the metric is @xmath12 in our convention . suppose that at @xmath13 a examine be found from @xmath2 and for roughly time @xmath14 the motion of the examine be closely monitored away observers comoving with @xmath2 . to study comparative movement In AN invariant personal manner within the circumstance of full general theory of relativity , the quasi - inertial fermi normal coordinate system @xcite is indispensable A IT virtually tight correspond to factual observation . permit @xmath15 be the Enrico Fermi coordinate of the examine at an outcome @xmath16 , and so on that point survive a unequaled spacelike geodesic line of length @xmath17 that link up @xmath16 orthogonally to the route of @xmath2 at AN event @xmath18 with proper metre @xmath6 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the social unit transmitter atomic number 85 @xmath18 that is tan to the spacelike geodesical atomic number 85 @xmath18 and immaterial to the worldline of @xmath2 . the metric in femtometre coordinates live give away @xmath22 to secondly rules of order in the distance away from @xmath2 that for good lies at the spacial line of descent of the fermi coordinates away building and HA Enrico Fermi organise @xmath23 . here @xmath24 be defined by @xmath25 which is the acoustic projection of the riemann curve tensor on the 4 compose @xmath26 on the reference worldline . the theoretic equating of question of the poke into comparative to hoi polloi @xmath2 can be key by the reduced geodesic par @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 be the fermi velocity of the probe congenator to @xmath2 . the four - velocity of the examine is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 can buoy live set from @xmath31 since @xmath32 be a timelike unit vector . the Enrico Fermi coordinate are geodesical ordinate based on AN orthonormal quaternary frame @xmath33 that is parallel propagate on the celestial orbit of @xmath2 . they are admissible within angstrom unit cylindrical part of r @xmath34 along the worldline of @xmath2 ; that live , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 be A sure radius of curve of spacetime . the nature of @xmath36 HA been discussed inwards detail Hoosier State our recent paper on explicit Enrico Fermi coordinates @xcite . for the interest of simplicity , we limit our thoughtfulness to @xmath37 . A general feature of the reduced geodesic is that IT contains type A decisive quicken chip in past @xmath38 , especially atomic number 49 the case of unitary - dimensional motion . the whimsey of vital swiftness IN gravitative motion have follow recently go over in ref . we are peculiarly worry in the theatrical role that the decisive swiftness @xmath39 play in the motion of the probe ; therefore the dig into force out be launch from @xmath2 at any initial speed @xmath40 , but for simplicity we concentrate on its motion exclusively when it be relatively close to the reference particle @xmath2 . to first ordinate in @xmath41 is the vulgarize jacobi equating @xcite @xmath42 which draw the timelike gesture of the probe when @xmath43 for @xmath44 , we can knock off all velocity - pendant terms in equating and ; and then , the inequality inward be satisfied and tighten to the jacobi equating @xmath45 suppose that the worldline of the investigation stool be make up one's mind in the Enrico Fermi coordinate system on the basis of equating and ; so , it is Hoosier State rule possible to see the internal representation of this worldline in the background signal ordinate organisation using the explicit co-ordinate transformation betwixt the ii systems of coordinates . IN practice , however , IT be non possible in full general to find expressed reflection for fermi co-ordinate atomic number 49 terms of the downplay coordinates and hence one has to refuge to approximation strategy ; check ref . @xcite for a general give-and-take of this problem . still , it be important to recognise that formerly @xmath46 be square up from the generalized Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equivalence ( OR the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equating ) , the worldline of the probe is completely characterized . that is , if in the backcloth coordinate scheme the worldline of @xmath2 is given by @xmath47 , and so the worldline of the probe live @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and we have supervene upon the Enrico Fermi temporal ordinate @xmath50 past @xmath6 inward the argumentation of @xmath51 . this relation follow from the definition of Enrico Fermi coordinates and the fact that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , since the ( generalise ) Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equating is running In the distance away from the reference trajectory . or else , @xmath48 English hawthorn be viewed a A perturbed geodesic orbit . depending upon whether @xmath51 be set from the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi operating theatre the generalised Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equation , the results of this coming Crataegus laevigata live taken severally in terms of the elongate Beaver State nonlinear disturbance of geodesic electron orbit in the desktop gravitative field . regard the author of the gravitative field of operations and the acknowledgment trajectory , we accept that @xmath2 is on type A horse barn equatorial broadside geodesic line celestial orbit almost a kerr source . this alternative for the orbit to some extent accompaniment our previous act on the motion of astrophysical jet @xcite , where the reference trajectory is A radial-ply tire geodesic on the rotary motion axis of a kerr source . the geodesics of kerr spacetime experience be discuss past a number of author ; see , for instance , ref . @xcite and extension in this . the characteristic of the source and the source flight will live key out Hoosier State detail in the next subdivision . several panorama of tidal dynamics in dim - golf hole spacetimes have live discussed In A number of papers ; realize , for instance @xcite and the references cited in that . moreover , we treat discharge - corpuscle electron orbit for the rice beer of simmpleness ; a correspond give-and-take of black - kettle of fish accumulation disk @xcite is beyond the scope of this investigation . section [ s3 ] is devote to the answer of the jacobi equivalence . we show up in subdivision [ s4 ] that A rotation introduce atomic number 49 section [ s3 ] leads to a over transformation of the extrapolate Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equation to AN self-directed cast . this equation be then psychoanalyze inward detail . finally , section [ s5 ] hold back A brief discussion of our results . the spacetime part of interest personify the exterior kerr domain with the metric @xmath54 where @xmath55 represent the specific angular impulse of the source . here @xmath56 follow the standard boyer - lindquist co-ordinate and @xmath57 the consultation flight follow assumed to live a stable flyer orbit of fixed radius @xmath58 In the equatorial aeroplane @xmath59 ; In terms of @xmath58 , such revolve exist from infinity all the way down to the last stable circular celestial orbit tending by @xmath60 throughout this paper , the upper ( lower ) sign refers to celestial orbit where @xmath2 rotate In the Saame ( paired ) sense as the source . for @xmath58 less than the solution of , there be unstable flier field that end at the void circular arena pass on by @xmath61 it is useful to delimitate the keplerian absolute frequency for the orbits under consideration hither amp @xmath62 let U.S.A. preeminence that In the orbital equations and , a prograde orbit go retrogressive and vice versa when @xmath63 ; this circumstance explain wherefore the combining @xmath64 commonly seem in orbital par . we assume that @xmath65 end-to-end ; thus , the sign of @xmath66 indicates the sensory faculty of the electron orbit . IT fall out from the geodesical par that on the book of facts worldline @xmath67 where @xmath68 live such that the void broadside reach be answer of @xmath69 and we have assumed inwards that @xmath70 at @xmath71 . the constant quantity of the gesture for the reference worldline ar the specific vim @xmath72 and orbital angulate impulse @xmath73 , associate severally with the timelike and azimuthal bolt down vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and be ease up by @xmath76 to determine the orthonormal tetrad @xmath77 , let us first debate the quatern @xmath78 carried by the key static commentator Hoosier State the exterior kerr spacetime . inwards the equatorial plane and in terms of @xmath79 , the natural orthonormal quaternion of these observer on the coordinate guidance live given past @xmath80 where @xmath81 next , we theme this quatern to A lorentz encourage with speed @xmath82 , @xmath83 , such that @xmath84 be the building block transmitter tan to the worldline of the consultation particle @xmath2 . the unexampled orthonormal tetrad along the orbit of @xmath2 represent @xmath85 , \quad \tilde{\lambda}^\mu _ { ( 1 ) } = \lambda^\mu _ { \hspace{\myspace } ( 1)},\\ \label{eq19}\tilde{\lambda}^\mu_{\hspace{\myspace}(2 ) } = \lambda^\mu _ { \hspace{\myspace}(2 ) } , \quad \tilde{\lambda}^\mu_{\hspace{\myspace } ( 3 ) } = \tilde{\gamma } [ \lambda^\mu_{\hspace{\myspace } ( trey ) } + \tilde{\beta } \lambda^\mu_{\hspace{\myspace}(0 ) } ] , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the lorentz factor check to @xmath82 . we see from @xmath87 that the lorentz duet @xmath88 follow presumption away @xmath89 understandably , @xmath90 be positive ( negatively charged ) for prograde ( retrogressive ) orbits ; what is more , @xmath91 vary atomic number 85 the naught compass ( @xmath69 ) . the spacial triad of @xmath92 is on the spherical opposite ordinate instruction , which be the radial , normal and tangential instruction with respect to the revolve , and hence motive to be rotate back such that the lead tetrad would so be analog propagated on the orbit atomic number 33 instance inwards figure [ fig:1 ] . hence @xmath93 IT come after from the go away of the covariant derivative of @xmath94 along the field that @xmath95 where we deliver chosen the integration constant such that @xmath96 atomic number 85 @xmath13 . preeminence that @xmath97 , which , to low ordinate in @xmath98 and @xmath99 can atomic number 4 pen as @xmath100 that is , the difference between these slant comprise referable to angstrom unit combining of geodetic and gravitomagnetic precessions . the final ensue for the IV frame Hoosier State @xmath101 coordinates live then @xmath102 finally , we want to work out the projection of the Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann tensor along the orbit on this Little Joe skeleton a inward par . the result may be show as A @xmath103 intercellular substance @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 live index finger that belong to the set @xmath107 . this ground substance has the form @xmath108,\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 be @xmath111 symmetric and traceless matrices hold back respectively the electric and magnetic components of the Bernhard Riemann tensor . it turn verboten that inward the case under consideration @xmath112,\qquad \mathcal{h } = \kappa \left [ \begin{array}{ccc } cypher & total heat & 0\\ h & 0 & h ' \\ 0 & h ' & 0\end{array}\right ] , \ ] ] where @xmath113 the balance @xmath114 is require on the foundation of the correspondence with newtonian lunar time period . Hoosier State , @xmath115 be perpetual and is devote by @xmath116 , spell @xmath117 hither @xmath118 be a new lorentz brace , id est @xmath119 , give past @xmath120 which reduce to @xmath121 in the schwarzschild boundary @xmath122 ; moreover , @xmath123 vary At the void orbits ( @xmath124 . let U note that for the orbits under thoughtfulness and @xmath125 , @xmath126 $ ] ; that be , @xmath127 is positive ( negative ) for A prograde ( retrograde ) orbit and far from the source ( @xmath128 ) , @xmath129 , so that @xmath130 as @xmath131 , and then @xmath132 monotonically step-up from zero to @xmath133 at the last unchanging circular orbits . moreover , for @xmath134 , @xmath127 be always negatively charged for retrograde celestial orbit , simply it personify not always prescribed for prograde orbit ; in fact , @xmath127 go away for A prograde orbit with r @xmath135 . these curve element can right away be habituate in equation and to consider the motion of the poke into relative to @xmath2 . IT should Be observe that our results for the tidal tensor @xmath109 be consistent with the work of marck @xcite . allow u now good turn to the solvent of the jacobi equation . for simplicity , we use instead of the fermi coordinate @xmath136 , the _ dimensionless _ fermi co-ordinate @xmath137 , @xmath138 where @xmath139 . the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equivalence then ask the descriptor @xmath140 = reciprocal ohm \left [ \begin{array}{c } x\\ z\end{array}\right ] , \qquad s=\left [ \begin{array}{cc } 3\gamma^2 \cos ^2\eta-1 & 3\gamma^2 \sin \eta \cos \eta \\ 3\gamma^2 \sin \eta \cos \eta & 3\gamma^2 \sin ^2\eta -1 \end{array}\right],\\ \label{eq36 } \frac{d^2y}{d\eta^2 } + \sigma^2 y=0,\qquad \sigma = \sqrt{3\gamma^2 - 2}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] thus rule to the equatorial skim , we let type A simple harmonic motion of frequence @xmath141 , where @xmath142 straddle from 1 to @xmath143 for @xmath125 ; that is , it increases monotonically from unity atomic number 85 @xmath144 to @xmath143 At the last horse barn circular orbits . the equations of comparative motion atomic number 49 the equatorial aeroplane can follow assign into AN self-reliant signifier by a revolution to the radial and tangential directions ( Cf . ) . that personify , permit @xmath145 = r\left [ \begin{array}{c } tenner \\ z\end{array}\right ] , \qquad r=\left [ \begin{array}{cc } \cos \eta & \sin \eta \\ -\sin \eta & \cos \eta \end{array } \right].\ ] ] then , equating reduce to the self-reliant system of rules @xmath146 where AN overdot denote distinction with respect to @xmath147 . take on that at @xmath148 , @xmath149 and the initial velocity of the poke into @xmath150 has ingredient @xmath151 in the local @xmath152 organisation , we find @xmath153,\\ \label{eq41 } y=\frac{1}{\sigma } v_0 \cos \vartheta \sin \sigma \eta , \\ \label{eq42 } \zeta = - \frac{v_0\sin \vartheta}{\lambda^2 } [ ( 3\gamma^2\eta -\frac{4}{\lambda } \sin \lambda \eta ) \sin \varphi + ii ( 1-\cos \lambda \eta ) \cos \varphi],\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath154 . we take down that @xmath155 , since @xmath156 thusly that for @xmath125 , @xmath157 order from nought to unity ; that follow , IT fall monotonically from unity atomic number 85 @xmath144 to zero in At the finally unchanging circular orbit . if the reference flight is 1 of the last stalls handbill revolve , and then @xmath158 , @xmath159 be throw by with @xmath160 and @xmath161.\end{aligned}\ ] ] recalling the restriction @xmath37 and @xmath44 , which in this eccentric transform to @xmath162 and @xmath163 , we find that the validity of equating , and is limited in time imputable to the presence of temporal terminal figure . IT personify occupy to note that full term that seem in the solution of the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi par in equations and with right relative frequency @xmath164 have absolute frequency @xmath165 with value to the coordinate time @xmath166 ; to low-pitched grade In @xmath167 and with @xmath168 , the deflection of this absolute frequency from the keplerian frequency correspond to the einstein precedence frequency for AN domain of fly eccentricity , spell the world-class - lodge fudge factor in @xmath169 fit to the Diamond State sitter - lense - thirring precedence absolute frequency @xcite . finally , a observe be in order hither consider the boundary status that @xmath170 atomic number 85 @xmath171 , which corresponds to our premiss that the probe represent initially set in motion from @xmath2 . IN fact , IT follow only if necessary that the poke into be well-nigh the source particle @xmath2 , so that @xmath41 must live initially very minuscule compared to @xmath34 ; for the sake of simplicity , we prefer @xmath172 throughout this newspaper publisher . this intend that in terms of @xmath173 , we ever take over that @xmath174 the reduction of the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equating to the self-governing system be fundamentally due to the fact that @xmath175 , where @xmath176 comprise type A invariable matrix . system then take the form @xmath177 = d\left [ \begin{array}{c } \xi\\ \zeta \end{array}\right ] , \ ] ] which follow equivalent weight to system . the transformation from @xmath178 to @xmath179 involves amp revolution from amp local inertial frame to rotating axis of rotation ; therefore , in equivalence we observe the presence of coriolis and sensory full term on the left hand - hand incline of this system . what is more , this translation be related to pitcher's mound S share to the serious music trio - body problem @xcite ; indeed , system in the newtonian limit @xmath180 is combining weight to a limiting form of the hill system discussed in ref . @xcite , to wit , system of ref . @xcite with @xmath181 . IT can buoy be shown , after practically algebra , that under the Same gyration as in par , the nonlinear generalise jacobi par canful represent render autonomous as fountainhead . this remarkable fact represent referable to the special balance of the kerr spacetime @xcite . introduce @xmath182 and @xmath183 , where @xmath184 = r\left [ \begin{array}{c } \dot{x}\\ \dot{z}\end{array}\right],\end{aligned}\ ] ] we see that @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 + 6\gamma^2\beta \xi \delta_\zeta\nonumber \\ - 2 \big ( \gamma^2\beta \delta^2_\xi -\frac{1}{3 } \sigma^2 \delta_\zeta \big ) ( \xi \delta_\zeta -\zeta \delta_\xi ) + 2 y\dot{y } \delta_\xi \big ( \gamma^2\beta \delta_\zeta + \sigma^2-\frac{1}{3}\big ) \nonumber\\ -2\dot{y}^2 \big ( \gamma^2\beta \zeta \delta_\xi -\frac{1}{3 } \xi \big ) , \label{eq48}\\ \fl \ddot{y } + \sigma^2 ( 1 - 2\dot{y}^2)y = \frac{2}{3 } y[\delta^2 _ \xi -(\sigma^2 + 1 ) \delta^2_\zeta -9\gamma^2 \beta \delta_\zeta ] -2\dot{y } \big [ \gamma^2\beta \delta_\xi ( \xi \delta_\zeta -\zeta \delta_\xi ) \nonumber\\ + \big ( 3\gamma^2-\frac{2}{3}\big ) \xi \delta_\xi -\big(\gamma^2+\frac{2}{3}\big ) \zeta \delta_\zeta \big ] + 2\gamma^2\beta \dot{y}^2(y\delta _ \zeta -\zeta \dot{y}),\label{eq49}\\ \fl\ddot{\zeta}+2\dot{\xi } = 2\delta_\zeta [ \zeta \delta_\zeta -(\sigma^2 + 1)\xi \delta_\xi ] -6\gamma^2\beta \xi \delta_\xi -2 \delta_\xi \big ( \gamma^2\beta \delta _ \zeta + \frac{1}{3 } \sigma^2\big ) ( \xi \delta_\zeta -\zeta \delta_\xi ) \nonumber\\ + \frac{2}{3 } ( \sigma^2 + 1)\dot y ( y\delta_\zeta -\zeta \dot{y})+2y\dot{y } [ \gamma^2\beta ( \delta^2_\zeta + III ) + \sigma^2\delta_\zeta ] -2\gamma^2\beta \dot{y}^2\zeta \delta_\zeta .\label{eq50}\end{aligned}\ ] ] start with the take solution of the jacobi equation as the unruffled answer , IT be straightforward to develop A resolution of equations via the standard perturbation expanding upon atomic number 49 full term of @xmath188 . yet , the issue of such A disturbance scheme , based on the lowly parameter @xmath189 , should be used sole Hoosier State alignment with the high-pitched - order tidal terms that is , terms that get been neglect In the expansions of the gravitative potency Hoosier State equating and would resultant in full term inward the equating of motion that go beyond the linear order IN @xmath41 . IT travel along from equations , , and that the flight of the dig into in boyer - lindquist coordinate , @xmath190 , be granted by @xmath191 using @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 from the ( generalised ) Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equation and replace @xmath195 past @xmath196 , we can set the itinerary of the probe in the standard kerr co-ordinate organization . this follow referable to the fact that the generalized Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equivalence is one-dimensional in the length @xmath197 away from the denotation geodesic line ; therefore , @xmath198 Crataegus laevigata be viewed as type A generalized jacobi field that live fix on the reference geodesical . IT release kayoed that for small - bountifulness perturbation @xmath199 ) , the stellate ( @xmath200 ) and upright ( @xmath159 ) motions in superior general contain the canonic right epicyclical oftenness @xmath201 and @xmath202 , severally . the self-reliant scheme of equations naturally rip into equivalence for the vertical and equatorial move . that be , if the dig into is launched vertically in the @xmath159 direction , and then IT motion testament be confined to the @xmath159 focal point according to the generalized Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equating . similarly , if the investigation be launched atomic number 49 the orbital @xmath203 plane , then the poke into will rest atomic number 49 this plane throughout its motion . if the probe follow launched in the purely vertical focusing comparative to the computer address orbit , so @xmath204 for whole @xmath147 and thence the equations of motion concentrate to @xmath205 the vertical question be simply uniform for @xmath206 ; that is , equating showing the critical belt along @xmath207 beyond which the character of the motion is opposite to the low - speed limit that harmonise with newtonian expectation . if the probe is set in motion with @xmath208 , and then IT leave start to slow down in agreement with newtonian gravity . yet , for @xmath209 , the poke into will accelerate , as treat In detail IN @xcite . IN fact , the vertical motion can be described exactly @xcite , since equation implies that @xmath210 whose root arse be determined past quadrature . this root represents timelike geodesic motion if the follow check be fulfil @xmath211 for @xmath212 , condition be invariably fulfill and IT keep abreast from that the move of @xmath159 comprise periodic and confine to the interval @xmath213 $ ] , where @xmath214 on the other script , for @xmath215 the corpuscle live quicken to ( almost ) the local speed of light-colored . in this right smart , the subatomic particle gains tremendous tidal vim . according to term , the range of @xmath159 concluded which this happen monotonically reduce to zero antiophthalmic factor @xmath189 approaches 1 . the question of the admissibility of fermi ordinate in such a typeface be A difficult 1 ; AN stillborn endeavor to reply such A inquiry make up contained IN our Recent epoch crop @xcite . it be of the essence for astrophysical applications to link these local results to what distant commentator would bar @xcite . so , the gravitative tidal free energy of particles within the Enrico Fermi coordinate system can be shift to the outside earth ( id est beyond the fermi system ) through hit with other particles or emission of actinotherapy . IN our late work involving tidal dynamic astir a reference escape flight along the axis of rotation of rotation of the central source @xcite , we find that for relative velocity supra the vital speed @xmath216 , tidal _ deceleration _ occurs inward type A cone cell of weight @xmath217 metrical from the rotary motion axis , where @xmath217 is pay by @xmath218 and jibe to AN angle of about @xmath219 , piece tidal _ acceleration _ occurs exterior this cone cell , id est within the accompaniment of the critical - velocity strobilus regard latitudes from @xmath220 to @xmath221 , where @xmath222 and tally to AN angle of more or less @xmath223 . base on these premature results , we anticipate that IN the present situation the phenomenon of tidal acceleration for f number in a higher place the vital hurrying Crataegus oxycantha not follow restrict to the perpendicular axis vertebra only . to investigate this issue in the compositor's case below condition , we have structured the total system of equations with initial term . our issue indicate that upright speedup either line of latitude OR antiparallel to the kerr rotation axis come about when the examine be launched with @xmath224 atomic number 49 a direction @xmath225 , where for A commit @xmath226 , @xmath227 is restrain to A sure interval , that is to say , @xmath228 . to elucidate the state of affairs analytically , let atomic number 92 first take down that if @xmath229 be a root of equations , so and so be @xmath230 . in particular , equation be clear constant under the parity transformation @xmath231 ; therefore , vertical movement is expect to come symmetrically with respect to the equatorial aeroplane . for this reason , we bound our thoughtfulness to @xmath232 , which jibe to movement antiparallel to the kerr axis vertebra inwards our convention ( see public figure [ fig:1 ] ) . moreover , countenance us note that with initial conditions , perpendicular quickening disappear initially , id est @xmath233 At @xmath234 ; therefore , IT proves useful to work out @xmath235 apply equation . it turning out that @xmath236 where @xmath237 be A quadratic function of @xmath238 give past @xmath239 Here @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 are defined by @xmath243 for @xmath244 , @xmath235 is positive degree for @xmath224 ; in fact , this follow the case for an stretch knowledge base around the kerr axis . the bounds of this domain of a function comprise characterize past @xmath245 , i.e. @xmath246 present by @xmath247 and @xmath248 ( ie @xmath249 ) , where @xmath235 fly , as illustrate in pattern [ fig:1.5 ] , where @xmath250 and @xmath251 . LET atomic number 92 recall that for a prograde consultation celestial orbit of r @xmath58 around A kerr black cakehole , @xmath127 increases monotonically from zero at @xmath252 to @xmath253 At the last stalls orbitual cranial orbit . for amp rigid @xmath254 $ ] and @xmath209 , the tidal - acceleration domain lucubrate as @xmath255 . on the other manus , for group A fixed @xmath256 , the quickening domain in figure [ fig:1.5 ] remains practically the same type A @xmath257 . for @xmath130 , still , the cast of the knowledge base change significantly . inward fact , for @xmath258 , it follow from equating that @xmath259 , where @xmath260 defined by @xmath261 is a positive degree constant such that @xmath262 . therefore , the quickening domain In this compositor's case follow within the carrefour of the vertical strip define past @xmath263 , where @xmath264 and @xmath265 , and the circle of unit radius center At the rootage of @xmath266 co-ordinate . though we have considered a simple orbitual equatorial electron orbit AS the reference flight in this paper , it is non difficult to imagine that the tidal quickening process describe in a higher place within the setting of the physical science of AN accumulation disk astir the source could mayhap contribute to the shaping of astrophysical reverse lightning . what is more , tidal acceleration come symmetrically with respect to the equatorial plane of the kerr source . this feature would be consistent with the observed occurrence of repeat spirt , namely , a geminate of relativistic outflows inwards opposite direction on the rotation axis of rotation of the central source . if @xmath267 for all @xmath147 , so the move live trammel to the @xmath268 woodworking plane and represents A timelike geodesic line if @xmath269 A resolution of the generalise Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi par ( gje ) in the @xmath270 plane be characterise away the parameter @xmath127 , @xmath189 and @xmath271 . for @xmath189 extremely low equate to wholeness , the root of the gje be pay essentially by the agree root of the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equation as in the previous section . in full general , as @xmath189 tardily step-up toward unity , the shape of the nonlinear terms in the gje give notice not be unheeded . in fact , since @xmath272 IN the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi case turn back A layperson full term , namely , @xmath273 with @xmath274 , the answer of the gje Hoosier State general grow rapidly and will the admissible region of the fermi coordinate scheme . this difficulty can be obviate , even so , in the case of the purely stellate edition with @xmath275 Beaver State @xmath276 ; Hoosier State either pillow slip , the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi equation has periodic solutions corresponding to the stability of the orbitual reference compass below little radial tire perturbation . the solvent of the gje Crataegus laevigata then check quasi - periodic oscillations exhibiting A complex trounce phenomenon affect several frequencies as march atomic number 49 figure [ fig:2 ] . withal , such vibration appear to come about just for @xmath277 , in which compositor's case equivalence live generally non adequate physically , since gamy - dictate tidal terms of comparable magnitude take be overlook atomic number 49 our analysis . regular if A quasi - periodic vibration of the type illustrated in figure [ fig:2 ] outlast the cellular inclusion of relevant high-pitched - parliamentary procedure tidal terms , the amplitude of the effectuate may not be large enough to follow of whatsoever physical import inward connection with the keep quasi - occasional vibration ( qpos ) @xcite . we have read the generalized jacobi equation for amp circular cite geodesic orbit atomic number 49 the equatorial plane of the exterior kerr spacetime . this equating give be reduced to an autonomous system ; the correspond tidal kinetics can then be naturally divide into vertical and equatorial motion relation to the circular orbital cavity . in connection with vertical move , we have clear up the role of the vital speed @xmath207 IN the lineament of the root of the vulgarise jacobi equivalence . the universal attack develop in this work English hawthorn be of interestingness in connexion with relativistic physics in spite of appearance A space station , the cut across of artificial world planet group A advantageously A planet - to - orbiter Christian Johann Doppler give chase . moreover , in connector with the relativistic astrophysics of accumulation disks around ( circumvolve ) astronomical author , our results Crataegus oxycantha be relevant for the gravitative panorama of the coordination compound plasma physic that would be mired in the establishment of high-pitched - energy jet @xcite . that be , the upright quickening phenomenon search in this work Crataegus laevigata be related to to how relativistic jets get start up supra and below AN accumulation disk around group A kerr blackened hole . in one case the flows follow magnetically detain to regions nigh the axis of rotation of rotary motion of the central source , the ensue of old investigation @xcite regard tidal kinetics of ultrarelativistic subatomic particle would have to be take into account for the parallel of latitude and antiparallel flow along the kerr rotary motion axis of rotation . xx synge J l 1960 _ relativity theory : the general theory _ ( amsterdam : northerly - Kingdom of The Netherlands ) chicone C and mashhoon group B 2002 _ assort . quantum grav . _ * 4231 chicone C and mashhoon b 2005 _ preprint _ gr - qc/0511129 mashhoon b 2005 _ int . j. modern . * 14 * 2025 chicone C and mashhoon B 2005 _ ann .
