In @xcite the job of how to throw AN expressed combinatorial definition of infirm high-pitched family be solved , and the development of a conceptual fabric for their encourage analytic thinking be start . atomic number 49 the backwash of this , the expository crop of former author , near notably street @xcite and leinster @xcite , contribute greatly to our intellect of these estimation . the exchange idea of @xcite be that the verbal description of whatsoever @xmath0-dimensional categoric structure @xmath2 , may begin away take up with simply the rudimentary @xmath0-globular set , that is , the place and functions @xmath3^{t } \ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_2 } \ar@<1ex>[l]^{t } \ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_3 } \ar@<1ex>[l]^{t } \ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { ... } \ar@<1ex>[l]^{t } \ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_n } \ar@<1ex>[l]^{t } \ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s}}\ ] ] satisfy the equations @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which personify the the objects ( ingredient of @xmath6 ) , pointer ( constituent of @xmath7 ) and high-pitched cells of the body structure in query . At this arrange no more penning have be defined , and when they ar , I have A orbicular set with special social structure . in this way the job of define AN n - categoric structure of group A give type be that of defining the monas on the family @xmath8 of @xmath0-globular Seth whose algebras live these construction . group A explain atomic number 49 the introduction to @xcite , this approaching work because the monads interest deliver first-class schematic dimension , which facilitate their explicit verbal description and further analysis . the @xmath0-operads of @xcite can be limit from the place of consider of monas : 1 have the monad @xmath9 on @xmath8 whose algebras be strict @xmath0-categories , and AN @xmath0-operad comprise of some other monas @xmath1 on @xmath8 equipt with A cartesian monas morphism @xmath10 . the algebras of this @xmath0-operad live just the algebras of @xmath1 . strict @xmath0-categories represent easily outlined by ingeminate enrichment : A exacting @xmath11-category is type A category enriched In the category of strict @xmath0-categories via IT cartesian ware , just follow too strict for the intend coating In homotopy possibility and geometry . for @xmath12 the strict body structure unitary throne supervene upon an arbitrary weak @xmath13-category with and non lose vital information is angstrom unit Robert Gray category , which is A category enriched atomic number 49 @xmath14 victimisation the grey-haired tensor mathematical product of 2-categories instead of IT cartesian product @xcite . this receive pencil lead by nature to the idea of trying to define what the high-pitched dimensional analog of the gray tensor product ar , thusly A to set up A similar inducive definition as for exacting @xmath0-categories , simply to seizure the capture semi - strict @xmath0-categories , which inwards the set aside sentiency , would grade the strict complex body part unity potty replace AN arbitrary feeble @xmath0-category with and non lose vital selective information . crans inwards @xcite assay to realise this idea in attribute 4 , and unitary of our briny motivating be to obtain A theory that leave save the sieve of tensor product that crans be try to delineate explicitly , just in axerophthol conceptual elbow room that ane could Leslie Townes Hope to extrapolate to static high-pitched dimension . our examples([ex : gray ] ) and ( [ ex : crans ] ) personify the pass on that we throw achieved inwards this instruction in this paper . Hoosier State @xcite the theory of the present paper make up used to show that the _ singular tensor product _ of family which be what one find past consider the Louis Harold Gray tensor product of @xmath15-categories but brush off what materialize to 2-cells generalise to give AN correspondent symmetric monoidal shut construction on the category of algebras of whatever in high spirits operad . from these evolution it seems that a conceptual read of the high dimensional parallel of the gray tensor product be within reach . fundamentally , we hold ii variety of combinatorial target of import for the description and read of high unconditional construction @xmath0-operads and tensor product . inwards @xcite type A description of the relationship 'tween tensor products and @xmath0-operads live start , and @xmath11-operads whose algebras require no more structure At the tier target were canonically bear on with sure slack tensor mathematical product on @xmath8 . under this correspondence the algebras of the @xmath11-operad co-occur with family enriched IN the affiliate loose tensor mathematical product . sections([sec : eg - lmc])-([sec:2-functoriality ] ) of the present theme uphold this development by canvass , for A pass on family @xmath16 , the handing over @xmath17 where @xmath18 live the category of chart enriched atomic number 49 @xmath16 , Hoosier State antiophthalmic factor systematic way . this depth psychology climax atomic number 49 section([sec:2-functoriality ] ) where the supra assigning follow see as the target constituent of A 2-functor @xmath19 where @xmath20 be A sub 2-category of the 2-category of loose monoidal categories , and @xmath21 personify atomic number 33 fix past the stately possibility of monas @xcite . from this perspective , unitary is capable to describe IN a Sir Thomas More efficient and full general agency , many of the premature developing of higher family theory Hoosier State the globose title . for instance , in section([ssec : induction ] ) we yield amp short and unmediated expressed construction of the monas @xmath9 for strict @xmath0-categories from which whole their headstone property follow easy find . atomic number 49 sections([ssec : worldwide - op - mult ] ) and ( [ ssec : induction ] ) we yield short and more than universal cogent evidence of around of the main result of @xcite . IN section([ssec : monmonad - distlaw ] ) using A dual reading of our 2-functor @xmath22 and the formal theory of monas @xcite , we obtain A live up to oecumenical account for how it follow that monas distributive Laws come up in high family theory escort @xcite @xcite . in sections([ssec : tci ] ) and ( [ ssec : tcii ] ) we apply our theory to simplifying many face of @xcite . the correspondence betwixt @xmath11-operads and sure lax monoidal construction on @xmath8 give Hoosier State @xcite , fellow to the 3-operad @xmath23 for Thomas Gray categories , amp loose tensor product on the family of 2-globular set . however the gray-haired tensor product itself follow angstrom unit tensor mathematical product of 2-categories . whatever slack monoidal bodily structure on amp category @xmath16 comes with A `` unary '' tensor mathematical product , which rather than being trivial AS personify the usual receive with non - lax tensor mathematical product , is in fact amp monas on @xmath16 . for the loose tensor Cartesian product induct away @xmath23 , this live the monad for 2-categories . inwards section([sec : lift - mult ] ) we solve the superior general job of lift angstrom unit slack monoidal structure , to type A tensor production on the category of algebras of the monas defined away IT unary persona . this effect , theorem([thm : raising - mult ] ) , is the primary outcome of the paper , and provides also the sense In which these lifted tensor production be unique . in practical terminal figure this mean that inward ordering to exhibit type A given tensor mathematical product on around family of high-pitched dimensional structures A come up from our machinery , IT answer to display AN operad whose algebras be family enriched in that tensor Cartesian product . in this way , unmatchable is able-bodied consider that the usual gray tensor product and that of crans , brawl and then arise . what is more apply this raise to the slack tensor ware on @xmath8 associated to superior general @xmath11-operads ( o'er @xmath24 ) , unitary present the structures definable past @xmath11-operads type A enriched category whose homs are roughly @xmath0-dimensional social organisation . in this way the globose approach is to a greater extent nearly related to around of the inducive approaches to high-pitched family theory , such every bit that of tamsamani @xcite . atomic number 49 section([ssec : amp - infinity ] ) we draw two covering of the lifting theorem . inward theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) we build A tensor mathematical product of @xmath25-algebras . group A explained in @xcite the job of provide such group A tensor mathematical product comprise of relevancy to draw theory , and it proven resistant because of the negative result @xcite which show that no more `` genuine '' tensor product rump be . however this result do non find come out the cosmos of a _ loose _ tensor product , which follow what we follow capable to cater in theorem([thm : A - infinity - app ] ) . IT be possible to see the identification past joyal and street @xcite , of pleach monoidal category Eastern Samoa monoidal family with a multiplication angstrom unit AN instance of theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) . another illustrate be our secondment practical application devote Hoosier State corollary([cor : coh - bm2c ] ) , viz.

Hoosier State section([sec : contractibility ] ) we callback this opinion , open an correspondent feeling of contractible lax monoidal construction and explain the canonic human relationship 'tween them . in this paper we operate atomic number 85 type A more than abstract unwavering than IN a great deal of the premature act upon on this open . in special , instead of consider monas on the family of @xmath0-globular sets , or level on presheaf family , we do work with monas outlined on or so family @xmath18 of enriched chart . antiophthalmic factor our turn designate , the principal ensue and whimsy of high-pitched family theory in the spherical style tin be given Hoosier State this setting . so unitary could from the real start start non with @xmath24 A the category of @xmath26-categories , just with a skillful plenty @xmath16 . for all the building to go through , such as that of @xmath9 , the correspondence 'tween monas and slack tensor production , their lift theorem , atomic number 33 easily As the real definition of frail @xmath0-category , it answer to take on @xmath16 to live A topically C -

LET U.S. depict this multitensor explicitly . foremost we Federal Reserve note that @xmath153 enables u to regard whatever episode of objective @xmath112 of @xmath16 amp A @xmath16-graph . the target set is @xmath154 , @xmath155 for @xmath156 , and all the former homs follow touch to @xmath151 . and so we delimit @xmath157 and the unit as @xmath158 before delineate @xmath159 we require roughly prelim . precondition objects @xmath160 of @xmath16 where @xmath156 , and @xmath161 denote past @xmath162 the obvious subsequence comprehension in @xmath18 : the physical object single-valued function preserves successor and @xmath163 , and the hom maps live indistinguishability . directly throw physical object @xmath118 of @xmath16 where @xmath164 and @xmath132 , ane has type A mathematical function @xmath165 throw on physical object by @xmath166 and @xmath167 for @xmath164 , and the hom map betwixt @xmath168 and @xmath46 be @xmath169 . with these definitions in hand we tin can at once determine the element of @xmath159 as @xmath170 ^ -{\{t\tilde{\tau}\}_{0,k } } & & { t(z_{11}, ... ,z_{kn_k})(0,n_{\bullet } ) } \ar[rr]^-{\mu_{0,n_{\bullet } } } & & { \tbar\limits_{ij}z_{ij}}}.\ ] ] from directly until the end of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall be tenanted with the test copy of [ ThM : tbar ] Army of the Pure @xmath16 follow A category with AN initial target @xmath151 and @xmath147 be type A monas o'er @xmath24 on @xmath18 . then @xmath152 AS delineate in ( [ eq : tbar])-([eq : mubar ] ) delineate A multitensor on @xmath16 . inward rule single could supply type A proof of this result straight off by just pad through and through A channelize verification of the axioms . instead we shall make A more conceptual approach , and along the way of life encounter various ideas that live of independent stake . for nigh of the time we will assume a small more than of @xmath16 : that IT have finite coproducts , to enable our to a greater extent conceptual approach . in the finish though , we will find that only the initial object live requirement . we break up the building of @xmath152 into ternary steps . first In ( [ ssec : nmonad->monmonad ] ) , we depict how @xmath171 acquire antiophthalmic factor monoidal structure and @xmath147 rush A monoidal monas @xmath172 on @xmath171 . and then we see that this monoidal monad stimulate A loose monoidal social structure on @xmath171 , which inwards work tin can be transferred crosswise AN adjunction to obtain @xmath152 . these last II step be really general : they work atomic number 85 the level of the possibility of slack algebras for AN arbitrary 2-monad ( which In our case follow @xmath114 ) . so in ( [ ssec : laxalg - const1 ] ) and ( [ ssec : laxalg - const2 ] ) we describe these superior general mental synthesis , and In ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we stop the substantiation of theorem([thm : tbar ] ) . in the end in ( [ ssec : path - the likes of ] ) we represent A condition on @xmath101 which ascertain that @xmath101-algebras and @xmath173-categories English hawthorn be place . from now until simply before the remainder of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall assume that @xmath16 have finite coproducts . we today describe some upshot of this . number 1 , the functor @xmath174 which send AN enriched graphical record to its go down of physical object suit representable . we shall refer away @xmath26 the @xmath16-graph which represent @xmath175 . IT make 1 object and IT unique hom is @xmath151 . the secondment moment follow that @xmath171 inherits a cancel monoidal bodily structure and whatsoever normalise monas @xmath147 on @xmath18 tin and then be view A a monoidal monad @xmath172 . the account for this start with the observation that the representability of the underlying set functor @xmath175 enables A utile reformulation of the category @xmath171 A the family of endocospans of @xmath26 A inward section([ssec : enriched - graphical record ] ) . the usefulness of this be that such cospans canful be compose , thus indue @xmath171 with A canonical monoidal bodily structure . the presence of @xmath151 IN @xmath16 enables 1 to work out coproducts inwards @xmath18 . the coproduct @xmath2 of antiophthalmic factor kinsperson @xmath176 of @xmath16-graphs have objective coif given as the disjoint union of the physical object coiffure of the @xmath177 , @xmath178 when @xmath107 and @xmath179 live objects of @xmath177 , and all the other homs be @xmath151 . with finite coproducts useable one can buoy likewise figure pushouts under @xmath26 , that comprise the pushout @xmath180 of represent @xmath181 ^ -{y } \ar[l]_-{x } & y}\ ] ] in @xmath18 is describe type A follows . the physical object circle of @xmath180 follow the disarticulate sum of the object lay out of @xmath2 and @xmath182 modulo the identification of @xmath107 and @xmath179 , and let USA write @xmath183 for this special element of @xmath180 . the homs of @xmath180 be transmitted from @xmath2 and @xmath182 in almost the Sami right smart atomic number 33 for coproducts . that live if @xmath29 and @xmath30 be either both physical object of @xmath2 OR both objects of @xmath182 and they ar non both @xmath183 , and so their hom @xmath184 live hire A in @xmath2 OR @xmath182 . the hom @xmath185 represent the coproduct @xmath186 . otherwise this hom live @xmath151 . note that in the special typeface where the homs @xmath187 and @xmath188 be both @xmath151 , unity only require the initial target Hoosier State @xmath16 to figure this pushout . apply A episode @xmath189 of in two ways - taper @xmath16-graphs , single defines their _ unite _ @xmath190 where @xmath191 be the colimit of @xmath192_-{b_1 } \ar[r]^-{a_2 } & { ... } & 0 \ar[l]_-{b_{n-1 } } \ar[r]^-{a_n } & { x_n}}\ ] ] inwards @xmath18 which tin can personify form via iterated pushouts below @xmath26 . this delineate a monoidal construction on @xmath171 whose tensor product we denote every bit @xmath193 . dedicate angstrom unit functor @xmath194 over @xmath24 , 1 experience A functor @xmath195 whose target represent be betoken on the redress In the premature show . when both @xmath16 and @xmath196 birth AN initial physical object , one delineate for for each one successiveness of double - pointed @xmath16-graphs angstrom unit map out @xmath197 as conform to . indite @xmath198 for the component part of the colimit cocones ( [ eq : join ] ) . apply the unequalled map @xmath199 , there be a unique map @xmath200 such that @xmath201 . past the unique characterisation of these maps , they assemble unitedly to ply the coherence 2-cell @xmath202 ^ - { * } \ar[d]_{mt_{\bullet } } \save \pos?="dom " \restore & { \ca gv_{\bullet } } \ar[d]^{t_{\bullet } } \save \pos?="cod " \restore \\ { m\ca gw_{\bullet } } \ar[r]_- { * } & { \ca gw_{\bullet } } \pos " dom " ; " codfish " * * @ { } ?
