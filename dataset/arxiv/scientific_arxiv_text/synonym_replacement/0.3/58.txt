although the macula number alter periodically with time with an average out period of xi yr , the individual rhythm period ( length ) and also the metier ( bounty ) vary In a random way . IT is keep that the strong cycles hold shorter stop and vice versa . this lead to AN important feature of solar round bed angstrom unit waldmeier effect . IT say that thither comprise an anti - correlativity betwixt the cost increase time and the peak macula turn . we phone call this A we1 . instantly instead of rear time if we consider the rise order and then we get really tight positively charged correlativity between the rise rate and the peak sunspot number . we call this A we2 . another important prospect of solar activity are the grand lower limit . these make up the periods of strongly tighten activity . angstrom unit honorable example of these be the during during 16451715 . IT be non AN artifact of few watching , just A real phenomenon ( hoyt & schatten 1996 ) . from the study of the cosmogonical isotope @xmath0c data atomic number 49 tree band , usoskin et al . ( 2007 ) reported that there represent @xmath1 high-minded minimum during last @xmath2 year . we want to model these unregularity of solar cycle using flux transferral dynamo simulate ( choudhuri et Al . 1995 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; chatterjee et Heart of Dixie . 2004 ) . in this poser , the turbulent diffusivity is AN of import ingredient which comprise non properly forced . therefore several groups use different time value of diffusivity and this lead to II sort of magnetic flux transport dynamo manakin heights diffusivity model and low diffusivity framework . inwards the earlier model , the prize of diffusivity usually habituate be @xmath3 @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( see also jiang et al . 2007 and yeates et al . 2008 for detail ) , whereas inwards the latter model , it is @xmath6 @xmath4 s@xmath5 . we refer that the mix length possibility gives the economic value of diffusivity as @xmath7 @xmath4 s@xmath5 . some other important flux rapture factor in this poser be the meridional circulation . only if since 1990 siemens we have some observational data point of meridional circulation skinny the surface and therefore we brawl non cognise whether the wide-ranging for the most part with solar cycle per second inward past tense or non . however if the flux transport dynamo be the right dynamo for the solar cycle , then ace ass consider the solar cycle period variant as the variation for the because the round period is strongly determined past the strength of the meridional circulation in this simulate . at present the periods of the solar pedal so had much variation inward past , so we can easily say that the had significant variation with the solar Hz . so the briny origin of randomness Hoosier State the flux transport dynamo model are the stochastic fluctuation inward process of generating poloidal theatre of operations and the stochastic wavering inwards the meridional circulation . atomic number 49 this paper we search the effect of fluctuations of the latter . we example last @xmath8 cycles away fit the periods with variable meridional circulation atomic number 49 type A high diffusivity pose base on chatterjee et al . ( 2004 ) mannikin . the solid argument in fig . [ fit23](a ) show up the magnetic variation of the bounty of @xmath9 used to modelling the periods of the bike . observe that we did not try to play off the periods of each cycle per second accurately which is bit difficult . we change @xmath9 between two cycle and non during A cycle . atomic number 49 increase , we do non commute @xmath9 if the geological period departure betwixt two successive cycles is to a lesser extent than @xmath10 of the average period . ( In m s@xmath5 ) with time ( in twelvemonth ) . the solid line be the variance of @xmath9 used to equalize the theoretic period of time with the abide by periods . ( b ) fluctuation of theoretical macula add up ( dashed seam ) and honor macula identification number ( solid phone line ) with time . ( c ) scatter diagram showing peak theoretic macula list and peak observed macula number . the running correlational statistics coefficients and the corresponding import point follow given on the plot.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] Hoosier State fig . [ fit23](b ) , we exhibit the theoretic macula serial publication ( eruption ) past scare away contrast on with the take note macula series past solid line . the theoretic macula series have comprise manifold past amp element to match the observe value . it personify selfsame interesting to see that near of the amplitudes of the theoretical macula cycle stimulate follow cope with with the observed macula oscillation . therefore , we have got encounter A important coefficient of correlation between these 2 ( get wind fig . [ fit23](c ) ) . this bailiwick suggests that a major take off of the wavering of the bountifulness of the solar cycle English hawthorn come from the wavering of the meridional circulation . this be a rattling important result of this analytic thinking . now we explain the physic of this result ground on yeates et AL . toroidal battleground Hoosier State the flux ship theoretical account , make up generated by the stretching of the poloidal study Hoosier State the tachocline . the production of this toroidal field be Thomas More if the poloidal field stay on in the tachocline for longsighted time and vice versa . however , the poloidal field of view diffuses during its shipping through and through the convection district . as angstrom unit ensue , if the diffusivity represent selfsame mellow , then practically of the poloidal field of view diffuses out and really less amount of it hit the tachocline to invest toroidal flying field . thus , when we decrement @xmath9 In in high spirits diffusivity poser to mate the geological period of a recollective cycle , the poloidal subject field get more than time to diffuse during IT rapture through the convection district . this in the end lead story to a lesser generation of toroidal force field and so the cycle becomes washy . on the former hand , when we increment the value of @xmath9 to correspond the period of A shortsighted pedal , the poloidal line of business do non get much clip to riddle Hoosier State the convection zone . hence it green groceries strong toroidal field and the cycle get stronger . consequently , we capture weaker bountifulness for longer periods and vice versa . yet , this is not the causa In low diffusivity role model because in this model the disseminative decay of the flying field be non much important . as a result , the slower meridional circulation means that the poloidal field of operation remains In the tachocline for long time and therefore IT produces Sir Thomas More toroidal athletic field , giving rear to amp strong oscillation . therefore , we do non get a right correlativity between the bountifulness of theoretical macula number and that of observed sunspot identification number when repeat the Saame analysis atomic number 49 low diffusivity modeling base on dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) good example . we subject field the using flux send dynamo simulation . we let seen that the stochastic fluctuation in the litigate and the stochastic fluctuations In the follow the ii principal sources of irregularity inwards this model . thence , to study we first infix suitable stochastic fluctuation IN the poloidal field source term of process . we realize that this hit the books john not reproduce we1 ( fig . [ pol](a ) ) . however it procreate we2 ( Libyan Islamic Group . [ pol](b ) ) . in conclusion we usher in stochastic fluctuations atomic number 49 both the poloidal bailiwick source terminal figure and the meridional circulation . we see that both we1 and we2 personify unmistakably multiply in this case ( see fig . [ both ] ) . we repetition the same study IN low diffusivity poser based on dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) model . however in this causa we are bomb to reproduce we1 , only we2 is reproduce . the inside information of this work can be found in karak & choudhuri ( 2011 ) . we take substantiate that the live of import in moulding many aspect of solar cycle . therefore we stay whether a great diminution of the leads to type A mussitate - like grand minimum . to answer this enquiry , we decrease @xmath9 to a real low-toned value IN both the hemispheres . we have do this IN the decaying phase of the utmost macula cycle before prattle minimum . we maintain @xmath9 atomic number 85 low value for about single yr and then we again increment IT to the usual value but atomic number 85 dissimilar rates in 2 cerebral hemisphere . IN northern cerebral hemisphere , @xmath9 live increased At more or less lour rate than southern cerebral hemisphere .

( C ) the dashed and flecked run along depict the macula numbers inward southern and northern cerebral hemisphere , whereas the strong line is the full macula identification number . ( d ) variation of get-up-and-go denseness of toroidal line of business at parallel of latitude 15@xmath11 At the bottom of the inning of the convection zone.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] in common fig tree . [ millimetre ] , we evidence the theoretical result covering the maunder lower limit episode . fig . [ mm](a ) , shows the upper limit amplitude of meridional circulation @xmath9 vary terminated this point in II hemispheres . IN fig . [ mm](b ) , we show the butterfly diagram of sunspot numbers , whereas in fig . [ mm](c ) , we show the variation of total macula identification number along with the single sunspot numbers in deuce hemispheres ( see the caption ) . In order to ease comparison with observational data , we have taken the starting time of the year to be 1635 . note that our theoretical ensue reproduce the sudden installation and the gradual retrieval , the north - Dixieland dissymmetry of sunspot keep down discovered in the last stage of mutter lower limit and the cyclical oscillation of solar rhythm found inwards cosmogenic isotope data . we also reference that if we boil down the poloidal field of view to a very downhearted value at the outset of the maunder minimum then also we can reproduce twaddle - like marvelous minimum ( choudhuri & karak 2009 ) . yet IN both the case , either we need to concentrate the surgery the poloidal field of operation atomic number 85 the beginning of the mussitate minimum . however if we deoxidise the poloidal athletic field little turn , so one can procreate prate - the like grand minimum at group A soften economic value of meridional circulation . the details of this canvass can be found in karak ( 2010 ) . we have show that with A suitable stochastic fluctuations in the meridional circulation , we be able to reproduce many important unorthodox feature film of solar cycle let in waldmeier force and mutter similar rattling minimum . however we be miscarry to multiply these results in low diffusivity simulation . therefore this study on with close to before written report ( chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri 2004 ; chatterjee & choudhuri 2006 ; goel & choudhuri 2009 ; jiang , chatterjee & choudhuri 2007 ; karak 2010 ; karak & choudhuri 2011 ; karak & choudhuri 2012 ) supports the high diffusivity pattern for solar cycle . chatterjee , p. , nandy , d. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2004 , a&a , 427 , 1019 choudhuri , a. r. , chatterjee , p. , & jiang , j. , 2007 , phys . , xcviii , 1103 choudhuri , a. r. , & karak , b. b. 2009 , raa 9 , 953 choudhuri , a. r. , schssler , m. , & dikpati , m. 1995 , a&a , 303 , l29 dikpati , m. , & charbonneau , p. 1999 , apj , 518 , 508 jiang , j. , chatterjee , p. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2007 , mnras , 381 , 1527 hoyt , d. v. , & schatten , k. h. , 1996 , soh . phys . , 165 , 181 karak , b. b. 2010 , apj , 724 , 1021 karak , b. b. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2011 , mnras , 410 , 1503 karak , b. b. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2012 , sol . , 278:137 usoskin , i. g. , solanki , s. k. , & kovaltsov , g. a. 2007 , a&a , 471 , 301 yeates , a. r. , nandy , d. , & mackay , d. h. 2008 , apj , 673 , 544
