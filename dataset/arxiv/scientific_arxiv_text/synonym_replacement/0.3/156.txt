it has long been thought that electro - magnetic examine _ i.e. _ real operating theater virtual photons would supply group A way to discover the formation of axerophthol quark - gluon plasm in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . the vigor distribution of the photons would reserve to bar the temperature of the plasma supply the range of production inwards the plasma outperform that of various downplay . IT is anticipate that this will come in axerophthol small window inward the gev range for the energy of the photon . atomic number 85 lower appreciate of the vigour the rate follow reign away various hadron radioactive decay processes patch at high values the usual severely processes ( those fall out in the really early stage of the collision before the plasma is formed ) , calculable away standard perturbative QCD methods , would dominate . in contrast to hadronic observables ( or heavy quarkonia ) which are sensitive to the late evolution of the blood plasma type A wellspring a to the re - hadronisation form , the photons in the gev orbit be produced presently later the plasma comprise organise and then they escape the blood plasma without further fundamental interaction . we assume the plasm in caloric equilibrium ( temperature t ) with vanishing chemical potential . the charge per unit of production , per building block time and volume , of a real photon of impulse @xmath0 is @xmath1 piece for a lepton twosome of people @xmath2 it be @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the retard photon polarisation tensor . the pre - factor @xmath5 offer the expected exponential function damping @xmath6 when @xmath7 . this written report is dedicate to the study of @xmath8 which hold the strong fundamental interaction dynamics of quarks and gluons Hoosier State the plasma . the theoretical fabric is that of the effective possibility with ray - summarise hard caloric loop ( htl ) @xcite . we briefly critique the status of @xmath9 calculated up to the II - loop approximation . some phenomenological consequences be mentioned . and then we turn to a treatment of higher loop corrections . follow the htl approach shot @xcite one distinguishes two descale : the hard " scale , typically of rules of order @xmath10 or expectant ( the energy of quarks and gluons in the plasm ) and the soft " scale of order @xmath11 where @xmath12 , the strong twin , be assumed to be small . collective effects in the blood plasma modify the physical science at exfoliation @xmath11 _ ie _ over long aloofness of @xmath13 . these effects lead to a modification of the disseminator and peak of the theory and one represent result to introduce in effect ( Re - sum ) propagators and peak . this live easily illustrate with the representative of the fermion disseminator , @xmath14 , which IN the bare " theory is simply @xmath15 ( we leave out spin tortuousness and make simply a dimensional analysis ) . the thermic donation to the one loop-the-loop correction @xmath16 is retrieve to be @xmath17 which follow of the same order angstrom unit the inverse propagator when @xmath18 live of order @xmath19 . the Re - summed disseminator @xmath20 is and so deep modified for impulse of @xmath21 whereas the thermic corrections appear essentially as high-pitched order set up for toilsome momenta . likewise , the gluon disseminator and vertices are modified past hard thermal loop-the-loop when the outside momenta follow soft @xcite . one can construct AN efficacious lagrangian @xcite in term of in effect propagators and vertices and calculate observables in perturbation theory . in the i - intertwine approximation , the photon production order is granted past the plot evince in fig . [ fig:1loop ] where the symbolic representation @xmath22 means that efficient disseminator and vertices ar expend . the result take been cognise for some clip and lavatory atomic number 4 expressed , in simplified notation , a @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is related to the caloric mass of the quark . unitary mention the presence of a large " logarithmic full term @xmath25 eclipse over A incessant term " @xmath26 . the two - intertwine diagrams are displayed inwards fig . [ fig:2loop ] . in rule , thither are more than plot inwards the effective possibility but only those leading to the dominant contribution live shown . all propagators and apex should be effective but since the largest donation arises from hard fermions it make up sufficiency , next the htl strategy , to dungeon bare fermion disseminator and -15pt peak a suggest . only the gluon line need to be effective since soft impulse @xmath27 through and through the gluon line dominates the integrals . to evaluate these plot IT follow convenient to signalise between the part arising from a time - similar gluon ( @xmath28 ) and A space like gluon ( @xmath29 ) . the first typewrite leads to a contribution similar to combining weight . ( [ eq:1loop ] ) and requires some care group A counter - term ( non record ) winnow out the part of the ii - loop diagrams already contained IN the one - loop plot @xcite . we concentrate on the second case which in terms of physical sue corresponds to bremsstrahlung production of a photon surgery yield in a quark - antiquark obliteration outgrowth where 1 of the quark is put off - shell by scattering in the plasma ( see fig . [ fig : unconscious process ] ) . the result for hard photons is @xcite @xmath30 the reason wherefore these 2 - loop contributions have the same order as the one - loop-the-loop unrivalled be due to the presence of strong collinear singularities . to calculate @xmath9 one get to skip the disseminator angstrom unit suggest past the dash - dust line in fig . [ fig:2loop ] . in the desegregation over the loop hard impulse @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 , @xmath33 on racing shell ) the denominators @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the UN - cut fermion propagators at the same time almost vanish when @xmath36 is duplicate to @xmath37 _ id est _ in the collinear form . this leads to AN sweetening factor of type @xmath38 where the reduce - off @xmath39 emerge from the deliberation . for the kinematic straddle of relate to U here , @xmath40 so that the two - grummet plot be enhanced by axerophthol factor @xmath41 which make up the @xmath42 factor link to the coupler of the gluon to the quark . AN interest solvent of the calculation live the importance of process ii of Ficus carica . [ fig : work on ] which grows with the energy of the photon and rule over the other contributions when @xmath43 every bit exhibit inward fig . [ fig : compar ] . phenomenological applications of these results take in been carried come out and the two - grommet physical process have been included in hydrodynamic evolution codes to predict the rate of real photon production at rhic surgery lhc @xcite . it is obtain that the two - loop processes ( especially the obliteration with scattering ) top to an increase by AN lodge of magnitude liken to the unitary - loop appendage . this may regular have aftermath for heavy ion hit At sps muscularity @xcite . several event may tighten these over - optimistic predictions : deficiency of chemical equipoise and more than importantly mellow regularize rectification as discussed next . since the ace - curl and deuce - loop termination are of the same order IT is sensible to worry about the convergence of the perturbative enlargement Hoosier State the effective theory ! the sweetening chemical mechanism PI At two - loop could as well be At puzzle out At the multi - loop layer especially inward ladder diagrams , AN example of which be show in fig . [ fig : run ] : so many little " fermion denominators appear inward such diagrams which john bring about a pile - up of collinear singularities . A Recent epoch study of the 3 - loop ravel plot demonstrate that @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the largest of the rationalise - polish off : + @xmath46 , which is the collinear cut - off encounter above : IT calculate on the caloric quark pot and momentum ( @xmath47 ) as substantially as on the external variables ; + @xmath48 , the debye mass if the add gluon follow longitudinal , surgery @xmath49 if it is transversal . + for the kinematic form of interest , Hoosier State the vitrine of AN redundant longitudinal gluon unmatched can check that @xmath50 and the debye volume acts A a cut - off with the result that the three - loop donation is suppressed away axerophthol factor @xmath12 liken to the two - intertwine . on the contrary , for a transverse gluon , both regulator are of lodge @xmath51 ( group A recollective A @xmath52 ) and the three - loop plot live of the same rules of order a the two - loop 1 . one be hence in a non - perturbative regime . the job is similar to the magnetic mass problem point out by linde in the perturbative deliberation of the free free energy @xcite , leave off that Here IT seem at leading order . some other effect which privy qualify the collinear enhancement mechanism is concern to the fermion damp rate . indeed , include the damping rate on the fermion transmission line , will shift the celestial pole of the propagators away from the real axis : this affects the sweetening mechanism based on the close - vanish of the denominators . push aside the requirement of standard of measurement invariance and boil down only on the mathematical effect of tilt the pole to the composite plane one can buoy do once more the deuce - loop calculation with fermion disseminator including the damp grade @xmath53 . the result is intuitively simple A a regulator of the mould @xcite @xmath54 comes come out , with @xmath55 delineate to a higher place . the force of @xmath56 on @xmath57 is shown on Libyan Islamic Group . [ fig : deaden ] for the case of a real photon ( @xmath58 ) . the realm @xmath59 is dominated by bremsstrahlung emission spell the part @xmath60 receives amp contribution primarily from the obliteration with sprinkling process ( see fig . [ fig : compar ] ) . the top slue be the result obtained with a vanishingly little width . one take down the change in the @xmath61 behaviour of @xmath62 A @xmath56 step-up : this is due to the different @xmath61 dependance of the real and notional division of @xmath63 . for practical photon production , one distinction that the amount @xmath64 increases with @xmath65 at desex @xmath61 so that the ratio @xmath66 , which controls the relative importance of the width , decrement . for @xmath65 with child plenty the effect of @xmath56 will turn trifling and the two - loop calculation should follow adequate . this is illustrated in fig . [ fig:2 ] . equivalence ( [ eq : mute ] ) impart itself to antiophthalmic factor mere interpreting . it tin represent pen As @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the signify free path of the quark inward the plasm and @xmath69 can follow shown to glucinium the formation length of the photon . and then , if @xmath70 the force of the damping rate canful be ignored and the correspond mellow order diagrams be crush . in the contrary case , Re - scattering in the plasm modifies the two - loop result . this is equivalent to tell that the Lev Davidovich Landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite have to follow admit into account IN the computing . ii interesting features emerge from the supra treatment : 1 ) the lpm force non only qualify the production of bremsstrahlung photon but likewise that of very firmly photons give out in the obliteration with scatter " operation as instance In common fig tree . [ fig : damping ] ; 2 ) if the virtuality @xmath71 of the hard lepton pair is large decent and then ace strike inward the domain @xmath72 and the perturbative computation at two - loop be sufficient . the problems discuss supra live AN representative of antiophthalmic factor Thomas More world-wide place concerning caloric putting green s function with outside momenta close to the light - cone @xcite . the production chemical mechanism of hard photons atomic number 49 the plasma is very coordination compound . new processes come along atomic number 85 2 - loop which substantially increase the rate of photon production calculated at one - loop . all the same , for real Beaver State little mass virtual photons the higher loop diagrams suit important and the range turning out to be non - perturbative . take into account higher order effects to incur A quantitative figure corpse to be manage . i give thanks f. gelis , r. kobes and h. zaraket for A fruitful coaction on the piece of work talk about above .
