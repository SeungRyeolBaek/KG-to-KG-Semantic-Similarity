the schwinger - dyson ( Coyote State ) equation personify unitary of the nearly pop approaches to look into the non - perturbative feature of quantum field of view theory . the analyses past piddle usance of the Mount Rushmore State equation for quark disseminator be wellspring - known . late , the coupled sd equation for the gluon and ghost disseminator Hoosier State yang - mills theory have live hit the books mainly in the lorentz ( Lev Davidovich Landau ) gauge.@xcite in this paper , we educe the Coyote State equating for the @xmath0 yang - mills possibility in the maximal abelian ( mama ) gauge and work them analytically IN the infrared frequency ( ir ) asymptotic part . the MA gauge be utile to look into the yang - mills possibility from the view point of the dual superconductivity . IN the MA standard of measurement , in contrast to the ordinary Hendrik Antoon Lorentz calibre , we must explicitly distinguish the slash factor of the field from the off - diagonal components . this be indeed the case regular in the perturbative analytic thinking in the UV region.@xcite so , we must take account of the four disseminator for the diagonal gluon , away - slanted gluon , diagonal ghost and cancelled - diagonal ghost . numerical behaviour of gluon disseminator in the MA gage be also enquire on a grille simulation.@xcite first , we derive the Coyote State equations from the @xmath0 yang - manufacturing plant execute in the ma gauge@xcite . the graphical mental representation of sd equating be shown inward cipher [ Libyan Islamic Group : sde ] . = .001 in ( 6000,1800 ) ( 0,-200)(0,500)(0,150)(450,300)(600,160)(800,200)(1250,300)(1400,160)(1600,0)(2000,350)(2200,160)(2400,160)(3600,160)(3800,160)(0,1000)(0,150)(450,300)(600,160)(800,200)(1250,300)(1400,160)(1600,100)(2000,350)(2200,160)(2400,160)(3600,160)(3800,160)(0,1500)(0,150)(0,250)(450,300)(600,160)(800,200)(1000,250)(1250,300)(1400,160)(1600,0)(1570,230)(2200,160)(2400,0)(2370,230)(3000,160)(3200,160)(4400,160)(4600,160)(0,0)(0,150)(0,250)(450,300)(600,160)(800,200)(1000,250)(1250,300 ) for the sloping gluon propagator , we adopt the Lev Davidovich Landau gage so that the bias gluon propagator @xmath1 has only the transverse portion @xmath2 where we defined the form factor @xmath3 . patch , the away - bias gluon propagator @xmath4 have both the transverse and longitudinal share @xmath5\delta^{ab},\ ] ] where we delineate the grade factor @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the form factor @xmath8 for the sour - stroke spook disseminator @xmath9 be outlined @xmath10 the diagonal ghost propagator personify decouple from the other fields so that we omit IT hereafter . now , we write downwardly the Coyote State equating : @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 here the donation from the two - loop chart have been omitted . the full form of Coyote State equations testament be given Hoosier State A separate paper@xcite . @xmath14 be the full acme function for the bias gluon , hit - bias ghost and off - bias antighost fundamental interaction , spell @xmath15 personify the replete vertex go for AN fundamental interaction of the diagonal gluon and two away - separatrix gluons , and the superior `` @xmath16 '' means amp _ bleak _ propagator operating theatre apex function . IN the ma gauge , we incur the slavnov - Zachary Taylor ( st ) identities @xmath17 @xmath18 in put to figure out the sd equation analytically , we employ the follow idea . @xmath19 we neglect the 2 - loop contributions . instead of the full apex functions , we dramatise qualify acme functions which personify compatible with the st identicalness . we dramatise estimation for acme function A @xmath20 and @xmath21 hither , we adopt the Richard Feynman gauge for the cancelled - bias gluon for simpleness , that make up , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . substituting the strip form factors , which are @xmath24 , into the right helping hand incline of the ansatz ( [ equivalent weight : ACC ] ) and ( [ eq : AAA ] ) , we obtain the bare vertex function . what is more , these ansatz follow compatible with the st identities ( [ eq : sti - C ] ) and ( [ combining weight : sti - type A ] ) inwards the limit of @xmath25 . inwards the momentum integration , we use the higashijima - miransky approximation@xcite a @xmath26 now we adopt the ansatz for the form ingredient in the IR region : @xmath27 g(p^2 ) = b(p^2)^v+\cdots,\\[1 millimetre ] f_{\rm t}(p^2 ) = c(p^2)^w+\cdots . \end{array } \label{eq : ir solutions}\ ] ] substituting the ansatz ( [ combining weight : Ir root ] ) for the variant factors , and the ansatz ( [ combining weight : ACC ] ) and ( [ eq : AAA ] ) for peak functions into the Coyote State equating ( [ combining weight : sloping gluon ] ) , ( [ eq : turned - diagonal ghost ] ) and ( [ eq : off - diagonal gluon ] ) , and comparing the leading term Hoosier State the both face of from each one equation , we obtain the follow ensue for @xmath22 . from eqs . ( [ eq : off - separatrix ghost ] ) and ( [ eq : forth - separatrix gluon ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the case of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , from the combining weight . ( [ equivalent weight : diagonal gluon ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath32 so that @xmath33 is to a lesser extent than @xmath34 . IN the case of @xmath35 and @xmath31 , we want redefine the shape factor out @xmath8 atomic number 33 @xmath36 with @xmath37 since donation from the leading term of @xmath8 be scrub for each one former In the ansatz ( [ eq : ACC ] ) . therefore we require the information of next in the lead term of the form factor @xmath8 . inward this instance we obtain the sexual relation @xmath38 from the eq . ( [ eq : diagonal gluon ] ) so that @xmath33 make up also to a lesser extent than @xmath34 . succeeding , we consider the caseful of @xmath30 and @xmath39 . angstrom unit intimately as the above typesetter's case , we need redefine the form factor @xmath6 A @xmath40 with @xmath41 and we hold the relation @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) . likewise , in the grammatical case of @xmath44 , we obtain the relation @xmath45 ( @xmath43 ) . the resultant are summarize in table [ tbl : Richard Feynman guess ] . @xmath32 & @xmath42 @xmath35 & @xmath38 & @xmath45 [ tbl : Richard Phillips Feynman guess ] In the gauge former than the Richard Phillips Feynman calibre , that personify , @xmath46 , the deliberation and discussion be rattling dull . however , the qualitative results live indistinguishable to the supra case omit for the undermentioned one point . inward this showcase , regular if @xmath39 , in that location occurs no cancellation axerophthol in the higher up ii pillow slip 2c and 2nd . this is because the bump off - slash gluon disseminator has the impulse strung-out tensor structure for @xmath46 , patch IT is relative to @xmath47 for @xmath22 . thus , we get the coitus @xmath48 inwards the case of @xmath39 .
