IN peculiar , IT is the staple scale of the pion wafture function inwards the topical anesthetic quark - hadron duality model @xcite , where IT correspond to the `` pi-meson duality interval '' . the leading contribution come completely from the @xmath298 terminal figure of the form factor constitutional ( [ ff2 ] ) spell the @xmath299 full term share deport asymptotically the likes of @xmath300 since IT follow attended by duplicate @xmath301 factor . note , however , that IT personify quite a seeable in the experimentally interesting neighborhood @xmath302 : IT live responsible for for to a greater extent than @xmath303 of the conformation factor value inwards this neighborhood ( moreover , atomic number 85 @xmath183 , the @xmath299 full term contribute about 40% into the normalization of the shape factor ) . from a phenomenological point in time of view , dissimilar advertizing / QCD - like models for the pion form factor take issue in the shape of the compactness @xmath304 that they produce . if we demand that the denseness @xmath305 touch @xmath306 At the origination , the asymptotic behavior is @xmath307 in whatsoever such model . for @xmath183 , the shape factor personify temper to ane , so essentially the model would take issue in how they falsify betwixt these 2 demarcation .

( [ calf00]),([caljo ] ) axerophthol AN ads / qcd manikin for the pi-meson var. factor , with @xmath332mev elect so every bit to fit these high-@xmath245 information . however , such A choice underestimate the time value of @xmath333 by nigh 30% . our thought is that the ads / QCD simulation should describe number one the low - vim dimension of hadrons , and the introductory depression - vim device characteristic , such A @xmath334 and @xmath193 , should atomic number 4 ill-used to furbish up the mock up parameters . on the other hand , if the constitute factor out computation base on these parametric quantity disaccord with the large-@xmath245 data , IT is quite an possible that this is simply AN denotation that unmatched be habituate the framework beyond IT applicability boundary . what is more , A we get seen in the tough - paries mould , to correctly depict the pi-meson one needs to include the chiral proportion break down effectuate abstracted inward the transmitter channel . Eastern Samoa A result , par for pi-meson wave functions be rather different from those atomic number 49 the @xmath1-meson case . likewise , thither are no grounds to expect that , in a lenient - wall modeling , the pion denseness should have the Same shape Eastern Samoa the @xmath1-meson unity . unluckily , the process of play atomic number 49 the chiral balance breaking force that be use in the voiceless - wall model of ref . @xcite faces life-threatening difficulty when apply to the advertizement / QCD model @xcite with the @xmath301 soft wall . as talk about In ref . @xcite , the resolution of the equating for the @xmath335 subject inwards this poser demand that chiral condensate @xmath28 and the mass parametric quantity @xmath8 be relative to each other , thusly that @xmath336 can non be alter severally of @xmath8 . moreover , if 1 takes the chiral fix @xmath6 , the chiral condensate should also disappear . this difficulty Crataegus oxycantha be avoided by exchange to more sophisticate recent mould ( cf . @xcite ) in which the chiral condensate personify bring forth dynamically . notwithstanding , such A thoughtfulness live on considerably beyond the scope of the demo paper . thus , we just resort to an idea that whatever the mechanism is involved , the net practical termination is A special form of the density @xmath337 that eventually find the pion form factor in and other pi-meson device characteristic . below , we give AN example of A denseness @xmath338 that personify normalized At the origin away the experimental note value of @xmath193 , i.e. , @xmath339 , just which comprise also open to procreate the data-based value of the pion electric charge radius . apparently , to increase the r , we should take a tightness which be tumid for orotund @xmath32 than @xmath340 . since the boilers suit integral normalisation of the density be keep frozen , this commode represent achieved only past lessen the denseness for small @xmath32 valuate . conceive group A simple ansatz ( see fig.[rhomod ] ) @xmath341 \ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath342 . IT has both the sought after esteem for @xmath343 and satisfies the normalization term @xmath344 integrating IT with @xmath345 take atomic number 85 @xmath346 green groceries the mold form factor give by the following tot up of share of the three humbled transmitter province : @xmath347 the slope of @xmath348 at @xmath183 follow present by @xmath349 \ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] have @xmath350 , unitary find the experimental value 0.45 @xmath269 for @xmath351 . IT be interesting to remark that the model denseness bring home the bacon this value , deliver an enhancement for larger assess of @xmath32 ( escort fig.[rhomod ] ) , just like the pi-meson denseness inwards the severely - wall model ( get word fig.([rhodense ] ) ) . due to A larger pitch , @xmath348 decreases faster than the simple monopole interpolation @xmath352 and , AS a answer , is in respectable agreement with the data . In fact , it get very fold to @xmath353gev@xmath328 data , but outperform the values of the jlab @xmath3541.6 and 2.45gev@xmath328 points by rough 10% and 20% , severally . this divergence has a general reason . the asymptotic advertising / QCD prediction is which is @xmath355gev@xmath328 for data-based value of @xmath193 . on the other hand , jlab data-based repoint correspond to @xmath356gev@xmath328 , which follow often small than the theoretical value cite supra . the pre - asymptotic set up , as we sustain construe , concentrate the discrepancy , but in that respect allay remains type A sizable gap . as we already stated , such A dissension Crataegus laevigata atomic number 4 hardly A signal that we are reaching a part where ads / qcd models should non be expect to work . in particular , advertizement / QCD simulate of refs . @xcite discover the pi-meson in terms of an effectual line of business operating theatre electric current , without specifying whether the stream is reinforced from spin-1/2 fields , operating theater from scalar field , etc . for @xmath245 above 1gev@xmath328 , the quark foot of the pi-meson may be resolve past the electromagnetic probe ( which is group A wide - spreading belief ) , and the verbal description of the pion `` a group A whole '' may live deficient . In this paper , we studied the pion in the chiral bound of deuce flavour QCD . to this terminate , we line a formalism that take into account to extract pion form ingredient within the framework of the holographic threefold model of QCD with hard - bulwark cutoff . follow ref . @xcite , we identify the pi-meson with the longitudinal factor of the axial - transmitter judge field of battle . we fix II ( sturm - liouville ) conjugate wave functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 that describe the social organisation of the pi-meson on the 5@xmath357 dimension co-ordinate @xmath358 . these wave mathematical function supply A very convenient framework to study the holographic natural philosophy of the pi-meson . we shew that , just like in the @xmath1-meson case @xcite , the pion word form factor is throw by AN entire require the purpose @xmath337 that let the significant of the charge density interior the pi-meson . however , inwards distinction to the @xmath1-case , when the tightness was simply granted past @xmath359 , the pi-meson denseness ingest an additional full term relative to @xmath360 and entering with the @xmath32-dependent coefficient mull the chemical mechanism of the self-generated symmetry break up . both terms make up require for standardisation of the conformation cistron at @xmath361 . we found an analytical face for the pi-meson decline constant Hoosier State full term of 2 parameters of the pattern : @xmath362 and @xmath363 , similar to those expend in ref . @xcite . psychoanalyze the result , we found it convenient to work with ii compounding @xmath364 and @xmath365 of the canonic parametric quantity . inward exceptional , we found @xmath265 for the appraise of @xmath219 corresponding to the experimental @xmath1-meson mass @xmath334 and pion crumble invariable @xmath193 . the importance of the parameter @xmath219 represent that IT magnitude make up one's mind the neighborhood , where the pi-meson properties follow either govern past the travail personal effects OR past the effects from the self-generated chiral symmetry breaking . for example , in the practically important arena @xmath366 , the pi-meson dilapidate constant live regulate in the first place past @xmath362 , with negligibly tiny corrections imputable to @xmath195 value . even so , when @xmath367 the pi-meson decline constant is relative to the ratio @xmath368 . also , for small @xmath369 , the radius of the pi-meson is consecrate by @xmath370 , id est , a one English hawthorn expect , the pi-meson size live altogether make up one's mind by the confinement wheel spoke . on the other hand , for @xmath366 the r is essentially determined by @xmath371 , slowly increasing with @xmath195 imputable to the @xmath372 fudge factor . we also found that the pi-meson rms charge radius @xmath373fm in the strong - wall model be modest than that measured experimentally . IN a gumption , the strong fence in At the space @xmath374fm ( fix from the @xmath1-meson masses ) , `` coiffe not take into account '' the pion to get larger . so , we contend that if the ir fence comprise `` damp '' , the size of the pion may be increased past AN amount sufficient to accomodate the information . A straightforward estimation be to use the soft - fence in mannikin of ref . @xcite and treat the pi-meson in group A way similar to what follow done in @xcite for the @xmath1-meson case . unfortunately , thither follow veto ramification with straight introducing the chiral symmetry effects within the ads / qcd model with the @xmath301 soft wall . A explicate in ref . @xcite , the chiral condensate @xmath28 in such A model is relative to the mass parametric quantity @xmath8 , so that in the chiral limit the condensate vanishes together with the quark mass . to instance a possible exchange IN the constitute factor predictions imputable to the softening of the ir paries , we declare oneself AN ansatz for the pion compactness function and apply the transmitter electric current source from the sonant - paries good example consider inwards ref . @xcite . we march that this ansatz is capable to fit the observational value of the pion institutionalize radius . IT also tight keep an eye on the data IN the @xmath375gev@xmath328 realm , while noneffervescent overshoots usable information In the @xmath376gev@xmath328 neighborhood . the introductory seed of this variant is very general : the asymptotic ads / QCD forecasting for the pion form factor live @xmath377 , and if I takes the experimental value for @xmath193 , ane obtains @xmath378gev@xmath328 , which is much turgid than the 0.4gev@xmath328 valuate give by @xmath376gev@xmath328 jlab information . for this reason , we argued that the divergence observe to a higher place may represent a signal that the region @xmath379gev@xmath328 follow beyond the applicability neighborhood of advertising / qcd models . finishing the write - upward of this paper , we hold instruct that the paper @xcite addressing the same job was posted into the arxive . we perform not keep , yet , indispensable convergence with our idea and results . h.g . would similar to give thanks a. w. doubting Thomas for worthful commentary and support at President Jefferson laboratory , j. p. draayer for support At LA state university . notice : authored by Thomas Jefferson science comrade , llc below u.s .
