developments be currently underway to promote the sensibility of ligo and to meliorate IT outlook for detective work gravitational waves let loose by compact physical object binary program @xcite . of particular proposition interestingness be the spotting of gravitative waves released during the inspiral and uniting of binary program melanize hollow ( bbh ) system of rules . sensing rat for bbh events be gestate to be within 0.41000 per year with advanced ligo @xcite . IT live important that rigorous detection algorithms be Hoosier State station in govern to maximize the number of detections of gravitational wave signals . the espial pipeline currently engage away ligo involves a match - filtering process whereby signals personify equate to A pre - constructed guide bank of gravitative waveforms . the guide personify chosen to wrap up close to interesting region of aggregated - spin parametric quantity space and are place end-to-end IT in such A right smart that guaranty close to minimum match between whatsoever arbitrary point in parameter space and IT close neighbour template . unluckily , the guide placement strategy in general requires many thousands of templates ( e.g. @xcite ) evaluated at arbitrary mass and spin around ; something that can non be reach utilize the stream set of numerical Einstein's theory of relativity ( nr ) wave shape . to hem in this issue , ligo exploit the use of analytical wave shape families like phenomenological model @xcite or effective - unitary - body pattern @xcite . we shall focal point here on the phenomenological B complex ( phenomb ) waveforms developed past @xcite . this waveform family describe bbh systems with varying masses and coordinate - spin magnitude ( ie non - precessing binaries ) . the family Evergreen State constructed by fit group A parameterized model to existing nr waveforms In order to generate a full inspiral - merger - ringdown ( imr ) verbal description AS antiophthalmic factor function of masses and spin . the obvious appealingness of the phenomb family be that it allows for the inexpensive building of gravitative waveforms at arbitrary point in parameter space and lav thus be expend to create at random dense template rely . to optimise computational efficiency of the detection unconscious process IT is desirable to reduce the identification number of templates under thoughtfulness . A variety of reduced base technique have be developed , either through singular - value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite , operating theater via a esurient algorithm @xcite . svd be AN algebraic manipulation that transforms templet waveform into AN orthonormal base with a ethical drug that at the same time filters out any redundance live within the original bank . A A final result , the number of guide needful for matched - dribble can represent significantly reduced . in addition , IT give been render Hoosier State @xcite that , upon throw templet waveforms onto the orthonormal basis bring forth by the svd , falsify the acoustic projection coefficients offer accurate approximations of other imr wave shape non include In the original templet banking concern . in this paper , we continue to search the usance of the interpolation of projection coefficients . we get hold of A novel approach that apply both the analytical phenomb wave shape family @xcite and nr crossbreed waveforms @xcite . we apply svd to a template bank constructed from an analytical waveform family to construct AN orthonormal basis spanning the waveform , and so jut out the nr waveform onto this groundwork and extrapolate the jut coefficients to permit arbitrary waveform to be retrace , thereby hold A new waveform approximant . we show up here that this approach amend upon the accuracy of the archetype analytical waveform family unit . the original waveform family shows mismatches with the nr waveform A high up A @xmath0 when no more extremization over physical parametric quantity be applied ( i.e. , a measure of the faithfulness " of the wave shape approximant ) , and mismatches of @xmath1 when maximized over total mass ( i.e. , a measure of the effectivity " of the wave shape approximant ) . with our svd truth booster , we personify able-bodied to construct A new waveform home ( given numerically ) with mismatches @xmath2 even without extremization over physical parametric quantity . this paper personify organise Eastern Samoa follow . we start in subdivision [ sec : mbias ] where we provide definitions to important terminology use in our paper . we then compare our nr loan-blend waveforms to the phenomb kinsperson and show that A mass - prejudice exists between the two . in section [ sec : method ] we submit our svd accuracy recall dose hold to the case study of equal - mass , zero point - spin binaries . In section [ sec:2d ] we investigate the feasibility of extending this attack to include unequal - mass binary program . we finish with close remarks in plane section [ sec : word ] . a gravitational waveform is described through amp complex mathematical function , @xmath3 , where real and imaginary parting store the sine and cos components of the wave . the specific form of @xmath4 depend on the parametric quantity of the system , Hoosier State our case the total lot @xmath5 and the mass - ratio @xmath6 . while @xmath4 live a continuous office of clip , we discretize by sampling @xmath7 , where the sampling time @xmath8 have uniform spacing @xmath9 . we shall as well white whatsoever gravitative waveform @xmath4 . this process be stockpile out inwards frequency blank via @xmath10 where @xmath11 live the ligo noise arc and @xmath12 is the fourier transform of @xmath4 . the whitened time - domain wave shape , @xmath13 , follow obtained past taking the reverse Francois Marie Charles Fourier transmute of . inwards the remainder of the paper , we shall e'er look up to whitened waveforms , drop off the subscript `` w '' . for our role IT answer to take on @xmath11 to be the initial ligo racket curve . using the advanced ligo noise curve would simply serve to needlessly refine our come near by making waveforms farsighted atomic number 49 the humiliated frequency domain . as a mensurate of the level off of agreement between ii wave shape , @xmath4 and @xmath14 , we will use their match , Beaver State overlap , @xmath15 @xcite . we delimitate @xmath16 where @xmath17 represent the received composite interior product and the norm @xmath18 . we always consider the overlap maximise over time- and phase angle - shifts between the two waveform . the time - maximation is indicate in , and the phase - maximization is an automatic aftermath of the modulus . tone that @xmath19 . for distinct taste At points @xmath20 we have that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the complex conjugate of @xmath14 . without lightening , would pauperization to be appraise atomic number 49 the frequency domain with a weighting factor @xmath23 . the primary reward of be IT compatibility with formal result for the svd , which will permit U to make more exact statement below . when maximise over time - shift @xmath24 , we ordinarily consider distinct time - change in whole number multiples of @xmath25 , as this avert interpolation . afterward the convergence feature been maximise , IT be useful to speak in terms of the mismatch , @xmath26 , defined simply as @xmath27 we expend this amount throughout the paper to measure the unwavering of disagreement 'tween waveform . we habituate mathematical waveforms compute with the spiritual einstein write in code spec @xcite . in the first place , we expend the 15-orbit be - mass ( mass - ratio @xmath28 ) , zero - spin ( effective gyrate @xmath29 ) waveform described in @xcite . IN section [ sec:2d ] , we also use unequal mickle waveform figure past @xcite . the waveforms be interbreed with A taylort3 place - newtonian ( pn ) waveform type A described atomic number 49 @xcite at fit absolute frequency @xmath30 and @xmath31 for hoi polloi - ratio @xmath32 and @xmath33 , severally . taylort4 at 3.5pn order is known to cope with nr simulation passing intimately for equal - mass , zero - gyrate bbh systems @xcite ( see as well fig . 9 of @xcite ) . for @xmath34 , a taylort3 hybrid is very standardized to a taylort4 loan-blend , cf.figure dozen of @xcite . the mismatch betwixt taylort3 and taylort4 hybrids be below @xmath35 at @xmath36 , send packing to to a lower place @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 . these mismatches make up significantly small than mismatches arising in the consider presented here , so we conclude that our ensue are non influenced by the accuracy of the utilized @xmath28 pn - nr hybrid waveform . for high mass - ratios , the pn - nr hybrids have a larger error due to the post - newtonian waveform @xcite . the fault - bound on the crossbreed increases with mass - ratio , yet , is mitigate inwards our study Here , because we purpose the @xmath41 cross only for total volume of @xmath42 , where to a lesser extent of the post - newtonian waveform is in band . because nr simulations are non useable for arbitrary mass ratios , we will in the first place rivet our investigation to the rival - mass and zero - twirl nr hybrid waveform describe above . the full imr waveform can be sire atomic number 85 whatsoever point along the @xmath43 line through with a simple-minded rescaling of bountifulness and phase with total mass @xmath44 of the system . despite such A simple rescaling , the @xmath43 line rest immaterial to lines of constant chirrup masses @xcite , therefore tracing A steep slope in term of waveform overlap , and encompassing A large degree of waveform social system . since our procedure for constructing AN orthonormal basis begins with phenomb waveform , let us forthwith investigate how well these waveforms model the nr waveforms to be extrapolate . for this purpose , we espouse the notation @xmath45 and @xmath46 to represent nr and phenomb waveforms of total good deal @xmath44 , severally . we measure the faithfulness of the phenomb family past computation the mismatch @xmath47 $ ] as A function of mass . the result of this calculation for @xmath48 is show up as the dashed cut in the top instrument panel of compute [ figure : bias ] . the mismatch start hit sort of high with @xmath49 atomic number 85 @xmath50 and and then slowly decreases as the mass is increased , until eventually drop to @xmath51 At high mass . the mismatch between nr and phenomb waveforms can follow tighten past optimise over a mass - bias . this follow accomplished by explore for the mass @xmath52 for which the mismatch @xmath53 $ ] personify a minimum . the resolution of this process is show by the solid line IN the top panel of figure [ figure : predetermine ] . allowing for antiophthalmic factor mass bias significantly thin the mismatch for @xmath54 . the mass @xmath55 that belittle mismatch be mostly diminished than the mass @xmath44 of our nr `` signal '' waveform , @xmath56 over almost all of the mass kitchen range count . apparently , phenomb wave shape be systematically underestimate the mass of the `` true '' nr waveform , At least along the component of parameter space take here . the solid phone line in the merchantman panel of physical body [ count on : preconception ] secret plan the relative the great unwashed - prejudice , @xmath57 . at @xmath50 this value live @xmath58 , and it lift to just supra @xmath59 for @xmath60 . and @xmath29 . a Thomas More comprehensive minimisation terminated mass , mass ratio , and efficacious spin might change this result . ] it is utile to deal how this mass bias liken to the potential parameter estimation accuracy in an early sensing . for a signaling with A matched - strain signaling - to - resound ratio ( snr ) of 8 characteristic of former detection scenarios templet / waveform mismatches will influence parameter estimate when the mismatch is @xmath61 @xcite . placing a horizontal disregard on the top impanel of figure [ figure : bias ] atomic number 85 @xmath62 , we see that for @xmath63 phenomb wave shape errors have atomic number 102 observational consequence ; for @xmath64 amp phenomb waveform with the unseasonable masses will live the comfortably match for the signal . for @xmath65 the missmatch 'tween equal - pot phenomb waveform and nr ( when optimise over aggregated ) grow to @xmath66 . optimization over muckle - ratio will reduce this mismatch , only we have not look into to what level . we aspire to construct an orthonormal base via the svd of a bank building of phenomb template waveforms , and then interpolate the coefficients of nr waveform projected onto this foundation to return a waveform category with ameliorate nr faithfulness . the for the first time footstep be to construct a guide rely of phenomb wave shape , with attention restricted to match - aggregated , zero point - spin binaries . AN advantage of focusing on the @xmath43 line is that guide bank construction can be simplified past consistently arranging templates in come up ordering by total mass . with this arrangement we define a template swear to consist of @xmath67 phenomb wave shape , labelled @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , with @xmath70 and with conterminous templates satisfying the relation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 be the desired intersection betwixt templates and @xmath73 live some accept tolerance in this value . the templet bank follow initiate away select A lower the great unwashed bound @xmath74 and assign @xmath75 . successive templet are encounter by sequentially moving toward higher flock inward order to find wave shape fulfil until some maximum volume @xmath76 be reached . end-to-end to each one trial , overlap 'tween waveforms make up maximized continuously all over form shifts and discretely o'er clip shimmy . for guide bank expression we choose to refine the optimisation o'er time by turn over shift in whole number multiples of @xmath77 . we henceforward relate to our fiducial template rely which employs the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . the lower mass bound was prefer inwards order to obtain a reasonably sized guide bank take @xmath82 waveforms ; pushing downwardly to @xmath50 result inwards more than than duplicate the number of templet . template wave shape to each one let a duration of @xmath83 and comprise uniformly taste at @xmath84 ( A try frequency of @xmath85 ) . @xmath86 of memory comprise require to hive away this template bank expend double - precision waveform . the next step is to transform the template waveform into an orthonormal basis . following the presentation atomic number 49 @xcite , this live achieved by arranging the templates into the row of axerophthol ground substance @xmath87 and factorisation through svd to hold @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are impertinent ground substance and @xmath91 follow antiophthalmic factor diagonal ground substance whose non - zero element on the main sloped be have-to doe with to group A unique treasure . the svd for @xmath87 represent uniquely outlined A long as the singular values be order in descending order on the main diagonal of @xmath91 . the end termination of be to exchange the @xmath67 composite - prise templates into @xmath92 real - valued orthonormal base wave shape . the @xmath93 basis wave shape , @xmath94 , be stored in the @xmath93 row of @xmath89 , and associated with this mode is the rum value , @xmath95 , taken from the @xmath93 element along the briny diagonal of @xmath91 . unitary of the appeals of svd is that the funny values place the base wave shape with respect to their ability to represent the original templates . this can be exploited inward order to construct a trim down cornerstone that spans the space of templet waveform to about tolerated mismatch . for instance , hypothecate we choose to reduce the basis by considering only when the first @xmath96 basis way patch discarding the rest . templet waveform fanny be represent in this reduced cornerstone past expanding them A the total @xmath97 where @xmath98 ar the complex - valued projection coefficients , @xmath99 the prime in represent used to punctuate that the concentrate basis be broadly speaking unable to fully represent the master copy template . we be vouch from to completely represent the template . ] IT was show up inward @xcite that the mismatch expected from reducing the basis in this way follow @xmath100 given @xmath91 , can live reverse to determine the number of basis wave shape , @xmath101 , need to represent the original templates for some expected mismatch @xmath102 . provides A useful estimate to the mismatch Hoosier State represeting guide from A reduced svd foundation . IN order to investigate IT accuracy , however , we should compute the mismatch explicitly for each guide wave shape . using the orthonormality condition @xmath103 , IT is easy to show up from that the mismatch between the templet and its jutting can live state in full term of the projection coefficients : @xmath104 this quantity be minimize continuously over phase and discretely over time teddy inwards whole number multiples of @xmath25 . prefer @xmath105 , omen that @xmath106 of the @xmath107 cornerstone wave shape from our fiducial template bank follow required to represent the templates to the want truth . in figure [ figure of speech : rec ] we liken the expected mismatch of @xmath108 to the actual mismatches reckon from for each phenomb waveform Hoosier State the template bank building . the clear squares in this plot show that the actual guide mismatch has a important amount of scatter about @xmath102 , simply average out over a whole remains comfortably border to the expected result . the phenomb templet wave shape can thus be represent to angstrom unit high degree from a reasonably reduced svd basis . we live of course to a greater extent interested in determining how well nr waveforms pot be interpret past the Sami cut back ground of phenomb waveforms . since nr and phenomb wave shape be not equivalent , put up non be used to estimate the mismatch obtain when projecting nr wave shape onto the tighten basis . we must therefore compute their delegacy mismatch explicitly . a superior general wave shape , @xmath109 , can be represented by the scale down basis In analogy to away expressing it angstrom unit the inwardness : @xmath110 where @xmath111 . A before , the stand for wave shape @xmath112 will in general be neither normalise nor tantamount to the master copy waveform @xmath109 . the mismatch between them is @xmath113 where we remind the reader that we always minimize over uninterrupted phase shifts and distinct time duty period of the two wave shape . inward figure [ figure : rec ] we use open circles to plot the agency mismatch of nr waveforms evaluated atomic number 85 the Saami set of masses @xmath114 from which the phenomb template bank was constructed . we see that nr waveform commode atomic number 4 represented In the reduced foundation with a mismatch to a lesser extent than @xmath35 o'er to the highest degree of the template cant bound . this is around a factor of five melioration inwards what tin be attain past using phenomb waveform optimise over mass . since nr waveforms be not originally include in the template cant , and because a mass - predetermine be betwixt the phenomb wave shape which were let in , we tin expect that the template location have no special signify to nr waveforms . this is evident from the reduce dashed describe which traces the nr representation mismatch for people evaluated 'tween the distinct guide . this line varies swimmingly crossways the considered mass range and exhibit no special features at the template locations . this be in contrast to the thin out solid run along which follow phenomb representation mismatch evaluated 'tween templates . Hoosier State this guinea pig , mismatch rise as we move out from unitary template and afterward settle back down as the next template is approached . the mental representation tolerance @xmath115 of the svd is A discharge parametric quantity , which so ALIR , we bear constrained to be @xmath116 . when this margin is varied , we observe the following curve : ( 1 ) phenomb representation mismatch generally follow @xmath117 ; ( 2 ) nr agency mismatch follows @xmath117 atomic number 85 first and then _ saturate _ to a minimum as the representation tolerance is continually reduced . these trends be notice IN public figure [ figure : trun ] where we plot nr and phenomb delegacy mismatch averaged ended the tidy sum bound of the guide banking concern evaluated both At and betwixt templates . the saturation in nr histrionics mismatch occurs when the reduce foundation gaining control all of the nr waveform structure contained within the phenomb base . boil down the basis farther hits A point of diminishing return as the increased computational be associated with a larger basis outweighs the do good of marginally improve nr match . we straightaway wish to see the possibility of using the reduced svd basis of phenomb templet waveforms to construct a new wave shape family with meliorate nr internal representation . the New waveform family would be given by a numerical interpolation of the projection coefficients of nr waveforms amplify onto the come down basis . hither we trial this using the fiducial template bank building and reduced basis distinguish above . the approach is to sample nr sound projection coefficients , @xmath118 , At about set of position , @xmath119 , and so perform AN interpolation to hold the continuous function @xmath120 that can be evaluated for arbitrary @xmath121 . the truth of the insertion scheme live maximized past find the space for which @xmath118 are smooth functions of @xmath121 . it be reasonable to suppose that the projection coefficients testament vary on a similar weighing machine over which the waveforms themselves alter . thence , a suited space to taste along is the space of invariable wave shape intersection . we define this to be the infinite @xmath122 $ ] for which the physical template pile be represent according to : @xmath123 move A outstrip @xmath124 in this infinite is thusly tantamount to proceed a space equalise to the intersection between adjacent templates . in this space , we feel the literal and complex quantity components , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , of the complex acoustic projection coefficients to be oscillatory functions that canful or so comprise described by a single frequency . this behaviour live planned for the basis way @xmath127 , L , and 123 inwards figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . some other trend observed inward this plot is that the projection coefficients become increasingly complex ( i.e. show less construction ) for higher - order mode . this be a direct result of the increasing complexity of high - tell basis waveforms themselves . we find that the low - order waveform are smoothest piece the high - order modes boast many of the unregularity associated with the multiple frequence factor and unification features of the guide . though they ar more composite , higher - order modal value have low singular prise and be therefore to a lesser extent important inwards represent waveform . this be observable from the becalm decline in amplitude of the acoustic projection coefficients when moving down the different panels of figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . we shall use of goods and services chebyshev polynomials to interpolate the jut coefficients . these be A set of orthogonal part where the @xmath128 chebyshev multinomial be delimit A @xmath129 . \label{eq : chebyn } \end{aligned}\ ] ] the orthogonal opposition of chebyshev polynomials can be used to perform AN @xmath130 order chebyshev insertion away sampling @xmath131 at the @xmath132 so - called collocation point given past the gauss - lobatto chebyshev nodes @xcite @xmath133 for @xmath134 . in universal , the interpolation will not be exact and around residual , @xmath135 , will personify introduced : @xmath136 here @xmath137 is the factual coefficient of @xmath45 envision onto the ground waveform @xmath94 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the coefficient hold afterwards insertion . the young wave shape fellowship be show numerically a antiophthalmic factor purpose of mass through and through the relation @xmath140{\bf u}_k,\ ] ] where the inferior intp " cue the reader that this follow figure from AN interpolation o'er @xmath98 . AN interpolated waveform of total mass @xmath44 can be liken to the master copy nr wave shape ( which we consider to be the true " betoken ) , where the latter follow expressed as @xmath141 with @xmath142 denote the component of @xmath45 that be orthogonal to the svd basis ( i.e. orthogonal to altogether phenomb waveforms in the guide banking concern ) . @xmath45 take issue from @xmath143 by AN add up @xmath144 to compute the encroachment of the various bringing close together mold , we look the overlap betwixt the extrapolate wave shape , and the precise waveform , @xmath145 $ ] . to begin this computation , IT personify useful to consider the square of the overlap , @xmath146 where we have drop the explicit aggregated - dependence and subscripts for convenience . victimisation @xmath147 and Deems Taylor - expanding the right on - hand - side of to minute regularise in @xmath148 , we find @xmath149 to endorse range in @xmath148 , the mismatch be thus @xmath150 we note that the right - hand - side of derriere be compose as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 personify the part of @xmath148 orthogonal to @xmath109 , @xmath153 however , for simplicity , we go by dropping the last-place full term in : @xmath154 expend , this gives @xmath155 \le \\ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n ' } \left|r_k(m)\right|^2 + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k = n'+1}^{2n}\left|\mu_k(m)\right|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|{\bf h}_\perp|^2 \end{gathered}\ ] ] we thus go through iii donation to the total mismatch : ( I ) the interpolation error , @xmath156 ; ( ii ) the truncation error from the discarded waveforms of the reduced foundation , @xmath157 ; ( 3 ) the failure of the svd basis to represent the nr waveform , @xmath158 . the sum of the cobbler's last two terms , which together create up the representation mistake , is line by the dashed line inward figure [ figure : rec ] . the end for our young waveform family is to feature an interpolation fault that is negligible equate to the representation computer error . to take the mass - dependence of insertion error in , we introduce the upper limit interpolation error of each musical mode , @xmath159 this allow the bound @xmath160 to order an upper limit on the error introduce by insertion . figure [ count on : rk ] plot @xmath161 as a function of modality - numerate @xmath162 A well angstrom unit the cumulative sum @xmath163 . the information touch to AN interpolation performed using @xmath164 chebyshev polynomials on the subjugate svd basis hold the frist @xmath106 of @xmath107 waveforms . in this case , we find the interpolation error to be mostly reign by the low-toned - dictate musical mode and also part by the highest - order musical mode . interpolated coefficients for various modal value live plotted in figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] and help to explicate the feature seen inward public figure [ figure : rk ] . in the first place , interpolation becomes progressively to a greater extent hard for higher - prescribe mode referable to their increasing complexness . this problem be palliate by the fact that gamy - rules of order modality be to a lesser extent important for representing wave shape , as evidenced by the diminishing amplitude of projection coefficients . although low - order modes ar much fluid and thus easier to extrapolate , their bounty are considerably big import that interpolation errors follow amplified with prize to high - rules of order mode . summarizes the three components adding to the last mismatch of our alter waveform family . their total contribution can live compute directly from the interpolated coefficients in A fashion similar to : @xmath165 = 1 - \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{n^\prime } \mu_k^\prime(m ) \mu_k^{\prime^*}(m)}. \label{eq : interpolationmismatch3}\ ] ] inwards the incase of hone interpolation for which @xmath166 , and concentrate to and respectively , and the total mismatch is simply the mental representation error of the reduce ground . in figure [ figure : interperror ] open up circles evince the total mismatch between our extrapolate wave shape family and the rightful nr wave shape for various masse shot . also plotted is the nr delegacy error without interpolation and the mismatch betwixt nr and phenomb waveforms minimized over people . we see that interpolation bring out only small additional mismatch to the interpolated waveform home , and remains substantially below the optimise nr - phenomb mismatch . this shew the efficaciousness of utilize svd mate to nr waveforms to generate a _ faithful _ wave shape kinfolk with improved truth terminated the _ phenomb family that be in the beginning used to make guide . this represents a superior general scheme for amend phenomenological fashion model and presents an interesting new chance to enhance the rival - dribble process apply past ligo . so far , we have focalise on the total mass axis of rotation of parametric quantity space . angstrom unit already discussed , this serve Eastern Samoa a convenient model - job , because the @xmath28 nr waveform can be rescaled to any total aggregated , and then that we ar able to liken against the `` correct '' resolve . the natural extension of this go is to expand into high dimension where nr wave shape be uncommitted only if at certain , distinct mass - ratios @xmath167 . IN this section we consider expanding our come near of extrapolate nr jutting coefficients from a 2 - dimensional template cant contain unequal - mass waveforms . we reckon A guide bank of phenomb waveforms cover mass - ratios @xmath167 from 1 to 6 and total masses @xmath168 . this aggregated range is chosen to facilitate comparison with previous work done by @xcite . for the 2 - dimensional case the construction of a templet bank is atomic number 102 farsighted amp straight A before due to the additional degree of freedom associated with variable @xmath167 . i method that has comprise advanced for this purpose is to site guide hexagonally on the wave shape manifold @xcite . using this procedure we find @xmath169 templet ar require to satisfy A minimal match of 0.97 . following the wave shape grooming of @xcite , templates are placed in the run-in of angstrom unit matrix @xmath87 with real and imaginary components filled in alternating forge where the whitened wave shape live fix up atomic number 49 such group A path that their peak bountifulness are aligned . the wave shape are sampled for a amount continuance of @xmath170 with uniform spatial arrangement @xmath9 so that @xmath171 of retention is required to store the contents of @xmath87 if double precision be in demand . diligence of metamorphose the 16 composite - valued waveforms into xxxii existent - appreciate orthonormal base waveforms . the direct be to sample the coefficients of nr waveforms project onto the svd base of phenomb waveforms using mass - ratios for which nr data survive , and and so interpolate amongst these to conception A numerical waveform category that can be value for arbitrary parameter . this provides axerophthol method for evaluating full imr waveforms for mass - ratios that have presently not been simulated . to summarize , we withdraw close to nr wave shape , @xmath172 , or full volume @xmath44 and tidy sum - ratio @xmath167 , and propose IT onto the basis wave shape @xmath94 in order to obtain @xmath173 next we apply some ii - dimensional insertion scheme on to construct continuous subprogram @xmath174 that crapper be assess for arbitrary economic value of @xmath44 and @xmath167 leap by the neighborhood of the template cant . the alter wave shape family be given numerically away the mold : @xmath175 a before , the insertion outgrowth act intimately if we can develop a scheme for which the projection coefficients are smoothly vary function of @xmath44 and @xmath167 . stick with the procedure draw inward @xcite , the composite stage of the first mode is subtracted from all mode : @xmath176}\mu_k(m , q ) . \label{eq : musmooth}\ ] ] to prompt wherefore might Be useful , net ball us debate qualify the phenomb wave shape family with a parameter - dependent complex form @xmath177 : @xmath178 when build amp templet bank , or when using amp guide camber , such a complex form @xmath177 is irrelevant , because the waveform are e'er optimized over a phase - shift . however , @xmath177 will seem IN the projection coefficients , , @xmath179 therefore , if 1 throw chosen a function @xmath177 with fine - musical scale body structure , this structure would be transmitted by the sound projection coefficients @xmath180 . for traditional uses of waveform category the boilersuit composite phase @xmath177 represent irrelevant , and thus , little aid may have be paid to how IT variegate with parametric quantity @xmath181 . the shift bump off the equivocalness inherent in @xmath177 by pick out IT such that @xmath182 . this choice link up the composite phase to the strong-arm mutation of the @xmath183 coefficient , and execute therefore eliminate all unphysical phase angle - sport on okay scales . in the leftmost venire of figure [ envision : coeff2d ] we plot the real part of the smoothed coefficients @xmath184 for phenomb wave shape projected onto the basis way @xmath185 and @xmath186 . the midriff panels show the Saame thing leave off using the nr wave shape assess at the set of mass - ratio @xmath167 = \{1 , II , trine , 4 , 6 } for which we take assume waveforms . obviously , the refinement on the @xmath167 axis be often finer for the phenomb waveform since they stool follow valuate for arbitrary volume - ratio , whereas we live limited to sampling at only 5 distinct pile - ratio for nr waveforms . for comparing resolve , the rightmost panel of cypher [ figure : coeff2d ] show the phenomb acoustic projection coefficients coarsened to the Saame set of plenty - ratios for which the nr waveforms live restricted to . we find the Same general behaviour as before that low - ordering modality display the smoothest construction , patch high - order mode exhibit increasing complexness . A plausible interposition scheme would live to sample @xmath187 for nr waveforms of varying plenty for constant mass ratio ( id est A we have done antecedently ) and then sew together these together crosswise the @xmath167 axis . since the projection coefficients in visualise [ figure : coeff2d ] demonstrate sinusoidal structure they must be sampled with at to the lowest degree the nyquist frequency along both axes . notwithstanding , seem at the midsection and rightmost panel IT appears amp though this live non yet possible given the face set of limited nr waveform . at best the 5 available aggregated - ratios be just able to sample at the nyquist absolute frequency along the @xmath167 axis for highschool - order modes . in order to achieve a fairish interpolation from these ejection coefficients the current nr information thus motive to be appended with more than mass - ratio . base on the left panel of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] a suitable choice would follow to double the current number of mass - ratio to let in @xmath167 = \{1.5 , 2.5 , 3.5 , 4.5 , V , 5.5}. hence , though IT is not yet practical to generate an interpolated waveform family unit using the svd advance scheme apply to nr waveforms , the possibleness stay open atomic number 33 more than nr waveforms personify generate . we have show that svd canful be apply to improve the histrionics of nr waveforms from a phenomb template bank . A sensibly concentrate svd basis follow capable to reduce mismatch by a factor of 5 equate to phenomb waveform optimized ended aggregative . on that point Evergreen State likewise no mass - bias affiliate with the svd base and therefore no optimisation over physical parameter require . this pass because svd unifies angstrom unit place of waveform social organisation o'er AN extend region of parameter blank and then that whatsoever biases turn blended into IT basis . svd so represents A generalized scheme through which phenomenological waveform families canful follow DE - predetermine and heighten for utilise as jibe - filter guide . we be able-bodied to graduate an svd basis of phenomb templates against nr waveforms in Order to construct a new waveform family with meliorate truth . this make up completed away extrapolate the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the phenomb base . lonesome marginal error live introduced past the insertion schema and the new wave shape category provided A to a greater extent fold representation of the `` true '' nr signalize compared to the original phenomb model . this was show explicitly for the case of equal - volume , 0 - spin double star . we go to investigate the possibility of draw out this approach to phenomb templet bank contain unequal - masses waveforms . at present , however , this method is not in time executable since the current number of volume - ratios covered by nr computer simulation live unable to sample the jutting coefficients with the nyquist relative frequency . this method will improve atomic number 33 more than nr waveforms live simulated and should be sufficient if the flow sampling rate of mass - ratio were to double . we give thanks ilana macdonald for preparing the intercrossed waveform expend in this examine . kilocycle per second , jde and hpp gratefully acknowledge the abide of the national science and engineering research council of canada , the canada research chair program , the canadian bring for gain research , and industry canada and the province of Ontario through and through the ministry of economic development and innovation . dk gratefully recognize the musical accompaniment of the grievous bodily harm planck society .
