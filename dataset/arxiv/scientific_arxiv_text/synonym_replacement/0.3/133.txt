connectivity and network project problems trifle an of import role in combinatorial optimisation and algorithmic rule both for their theoretical ingathering and their many literal - world applications programme . an interesting and gravid division of problems be of the following typewrite : given A graph @xmath5 with edge Beaver State node costs , find a lower limit - cost subgraph @xmath6 of @xmath2 that fulfil sure connectivity dimension . for example , given AN whole number @xmath7 , 1 tin inquire for the minimum - cost span subgraph that is @xmath8-edge operating theatre @xmath8-vertex tie . if @xmath9 and so this is the classical minimum spanning Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree ( mst ) job . for @xmath10 the problem be np - concentrated and also apx - concentrated to approximate . to a greater extent full general versions of connectivity job make up hold if ane essay group A subgraph Hoosier State which type A subset of the nodes @xmath11 refer to A _ terminal _ are @xmath8-connected . the well - get laid Rudolf Steiner tree problem be to find a minimum - cost subgraph that ( @xmath12-)connects group A given set @xmath13 . many of these problems are special case of the survivable web design problem ( sndp ) . in sndp , each mate of leaf node @xmath14 specifies a connectivity requirement @xmath15 and the goal be to incur a lower limit - cost subgraph that feature @xmath15 disarticulate paths for each couple @xmath16 . give the intractableness of these connectivity problem , in that location has follow a large amount of wreak on idea algorithms . A number of graceful and right techniques and final result have be develop over the years ( see @xcite ) . in special , the primal - dual method @xcite and iterated rounding @xcite have LED to close to remarkable results let in a @xmath1-approximation for border - connectivity sndp @xcite . an interest class of problem , related to some of the connectivity problems described above , is hold past expect that only @xmath0 of the tending terminals be connected . these problems follow part incite by diligence in which one seek to maximise earnings given A upper bound ( budget ) on the be . for good example , a useful problem in vehicle rout out diligence be to find a track that maximizes the figure of peak IN IT study to A budget @xmath17 on the length of the path . Hoosier State the exact optimisation countersink , the gain maximation job be equivalent weight to the problem of minimise the cost / length of A path dependent to the constraint that at to the lowest degree @xmath0 vertices be let in . of flow the two versions need not glucinium approximation equivalent , nonetheless , understanding peerless personify oft fruitful or necessary to understand the former . the most easily - studied of these job is the @xmath0-mst job ; the goal here is to find a minimum - cost subgraph of the yield chart @xmath2 that contains at least @xmath0 vertices ( Beaver State terminals ) . this job get attracted considerable attending in the approximation algorithmic rule literature and IT written report have led to various novel algorithmic ideas and practical application @xcite . we note that the steiner shoetree problem can follow relatively easily shorten in AN bringing close together preserve style to the @xmath0-mst problem . to a greater extent latterly , lau _ et atomic number 13 . _ @xcite count the natural generalisation of @xmath0-mst to gamy connectivity . in particular proposition they defined the @xmath18-subgraph problem to follow the following : breakthrough A lower limit - toll subgraph of the generate graphical record @xmath2 that hold atomic number 85 to the lowest degree @xmath0 vertices and live @xmath8-edge connected . we use the notation @xmath0-@xmath8ec to refer to this problem . Hoosier State @xcite an @xmath19 estimation was claimed for the @xmath0-@xmath1ec problem . notwithstanding , the algorithm and test copy in @xcite personify incorrect . more late , and in independent work from ours , the author of @xcite obtain A different algorithmic rule for @xmath0-@xmath1ec that grant an @xmath20 approximation . we render late A more detailed comparing 'tween their feeler and ours . it be also shown in @xcite that group A good estimation for @xmath0-@xmath8ec when @xmath8 represent tumid would yield AN improved algorithmic rule for the @xmath0-densest subgraph job @xcite ; atomic number 49 this job one and only seek A @xmath0-vertex subgraph of A pay graphical record @xmath2 that has the maximum number of border . the @xmath0-densest subgraph job admits AN @xmath21 estimation for close to fixed unremitting @xmath22 @xcite , but has resist attempts atomic number 85 AN improve bringing close together for angstrom unit number of year now . in this paper we consider the acme - connectivity generalization of the @xmath0-mst job . we define the @xmath0-@xmath8vc problem as follow : give AN whole number @xmath0 and a graph @xmath2 with sharpness be , uncovering the minimum - cost @xmath8-vertex - connected subgraph of @xmath2 that contains at to the lowest degree @xmath0 acme . we also believe the _ final _ edition of the job where the subgraph get to bear @xmath0 terminal from angstrom unit given last set @xmath3 . IT can be easy render that the @xmath0-@xmath8ec job concentrate to the @xmath0-@xmath8vc problem for whatever @xmath23 . we likewise observe that the @xmath0-@xmath8ec problem with terminals canful be easily rock-bottom , A follow , to the uniform job where every vertex is amp terminal : for apiece final @xmath24 , create @xmath25 dummy acme @xmath26 and attach @xmath27 to @xmath28 with @xmath8 collimate inch of zero be . at present set @xmath29 IN the unexampled graph . unitary tin can avoid using parallel butt past creating a ingroup on @xmath26 use cipher - toll edges and connecting @xmath8 of these acme to @xmath28 . remark , even so , that this simplification just piece of work for adjoin - connectivity . we ar non aware of A reduction that boil down the @xmath0-@xmath8vc job with a given set of terminal to the @xmath0-@xmath8vc job , even when @xmath30 . In this paper we consider the @xmath0-@xmath1vc problem ; our main result be the following . [ ThM : kV ] there be AN @xmath31 bringing close together for the @xmath0-@xmath1vc problem where @xmath32 is the telephone number of pole . [ cor : ke ] there follow an @xmath31 estimation for the @xmath0-@xmath1ec problem where @xmath32 be the number of pole . one of the expert ingredients that we develop represent the theorem below which may atomic number 4 of independent interest . pay a chart @xmath2 with edge costs and weight on terminal @xmath3 , we define @xmath33 for type A subgraph @xmath6 to follow the ratio of the cost of inch inward @xmath6 to the total weight of terminal in @xmath6 . [ thm : cycle ] allow @xmath2 follow an @xmath1-vertex - connected chart with inch be and have @xmath34 follow a set of terminus . and then , there live a wide-eyed cps @xmath35 hold back at least @xmath1 terminus ( A non - trivial oscillation ) such that the denseness of @xmath35 personify At to the highest degree the density of @xmath2 . moreover , such A oscillation canful be regain IN polynomial time . expend the supra theorem and AN L-P go up we obtain the follow . [ cor : cycle ] given amp chart @xmath5 with border cost and @xmath32 terminals @xmath36 , there is an @xmath37 bringing close together for the problem of find out a lower limit - denseness non - piffling cycle . note of hand that theorem [ thm : cps ] and corollary [ cor : oscillation ] are of interest because we seek a cycles/second with at to the lowest degree _ two _ terminals . axerophthol minimum - denseness cycle containing just one terminus can comprise found by apply the advantageously - known Min dialect - mean cycle algorithm in directed graphical record @xcite . we point out , even so , that although we suspect that the job of find A lower limit - compactness non - lilliputian cycle is nurse clinician - strong , we currently do not have axerophthol proof . theorem [ thm : round ] bear witness that the job live tantamount to the dens-@xmath1vc problem , define inward the next section . * observe : * the reader may marvel whether @xmath0-@xmath1ec or @xmath0-@xmath1vc admit a constant factor idea , since the @xmath0-mst problem allow one . we note of hand that the main technological tool which underlies @xmath38 approximation for @xmath0-mst job @xcite is A special holding that holds for A L-P relaxation method of the prize - collection Rudolf Steiner shoetree problem @xcite which is a lagrangian liberalisation of the Rudolf Steiner tree problem . such axerophthol property live not known to adjudge for generalisation of @xmath0-mst include @xmath0-@xmath1ec and @xmath0-@xmath1vc and the @xmath0-steiner forest problem @xcite . so , one be strained to bank on alternative and problem - specific technique . we reckon the rooted version of @xmath0-@xmath1vc : the goal be to find a min - cost subgraph that @xmath1-connects At least @xmath0 terminal to a define rootle peak @xmath39 . IT be relatively straightforward to tighten @xmath0-@xmath1vc to its rooted version ( date section [ sec : k2vc ] for item . ) we thread brainchild from algorithmic ideas that lead to poly - logarithmic bringing close together for the @xmath0-mst job . to describe our approach to the steady down @xmath0-@xmath1vc problem , we delineate a closely colligate problem . for a subgraph @xmath6 that take @xmath39 , let @xmath40 be the number of terminal that be @xmath1-connected to @xmath39 In @xmath6 . and so the _ denseness _ of @xmath6 personify simply the ratio of the cost of @xmath6 to @xmath40 . the dens-@xmath1vc problem be to find group A 2-connected subgraph of minimum tightness . AN @xmath37 approximation for the dens-@xmath1vc problem ( where @xmath32 be the number of terminals ) privy be infer inward a around what stock way of life by habituate a bucketing and scaling play tricks on amp linear programming repose for the problem . we exploit the cognize stick of @xmath1 on the integrality gap of A natural lp for the sndp problem with peak connectivity requirements in @xmath41 @xcite . the bucketing and surmount conjuring trick has image several use inwards the past and take of late comprise spotlight in various practical application @xcite . our algorithm for @xmath0-@xmath1vc uses a greedy approach At the high level . we jump with AN empty subgraph @xmath42 and apply the approximation algorithmic rule for dens-@xmath1vc in an reiterative fashion to covetously supply terminals to @xmath42 until atomic number 85 to the lowest degree @xmath43 terminal are in @xmath42 . this approach would give an @xmath44 approximation if @xmath45 . nevertheless , the live loop of the dens-@xmath1vc algorithm may add many more terminal than desire with the termination that @xmath46 . in this pillow slip we nates non bound the tone of the solution obtained away the algorithm . to overcome this job , one canful render to _ prune _ the subgraph @xmath6 append in the last loop to only deliver the desired list of terminals . for the @xmath0-mst problem , @xmath6 be a tree and prune follow quite easy . we remark that this fruit amp rather straightforward @xmath20 estimation for @xmath0-mst and could cause been key out a good deal before a more clever analytic thinking given Hoosier State @xcite . one of our technical donation be to generate A lop step for the @xmath0-@xmath1vc problem . to accomplish this , we use ii algorithmic ideas . the first live encapsulated atomic number 49 the cycle encounter algorithm of theorem [ ThM : cycle ] . second , we use this cycle find algorithm to repeatedly fuse subgraphs until we get the desire enumerate of terminus in unitary subgraph . this latter step involve care . the cycle merging scheme is inspired past A similar approach shot from the work of lau _ et AL . _ @xcite on the @xmath0-@xmath1ec problem and in @xcite on the directed orienteering problem . these ideas yield AN @xmath47 approximation . we kick in a slightly modified cycle - merging algorithm with amp to a greater extent sophisticated and non - trivial analysis to obtain AN improve @xmath31 approximation . around remarks are in order to compare our work to that of @xcite on the @xmath0-@xmath1ec problem . the combinatory algorithmic rule in @xcite follow base on feel A low-pitched - density cycle operating theatre angstrom unit have-to doe with construction call off group A bi - oscillation . the algorithmic program in @xcite to find such angstrom unit structure is incorrect . further , the cycles are contracted on the agency which limitation the approach to the @xmath0-@xmath1ec problem ( contracting A pedal in @xmath1-node - connected graphical record may clear the ensue graph non @xmath1-node - link up ) . in our algorithmic program we do non contract cps and instead innovate dummy terminals with weights to capture the number of terminals in an already form component . this involve U to now speak the minimum - density non - trivial simple rhythm problem which we do via theorem [ thm : cycle ] and corollary [ cor : cycle ] . in free-lance work , lau _ et al . _ @xcite incur antiophthalmic factor unexampled and objurgate @xmath48-approximation for @xmath0-@xmath1ec . they as well follow the same come near that we do inwards using the L-P for find slow subgraphs follow by the clip ill-use . notwithstanding , in the dress step they use a entirely different approach ;
