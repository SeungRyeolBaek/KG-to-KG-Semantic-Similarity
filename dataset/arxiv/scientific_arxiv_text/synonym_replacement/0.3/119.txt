information encoded In qubits bathroom be habituate for dependable quantum communicating or efficient quantum computing @xcite . this information be encoded In a quantum state @xmath4 which in the case of A qubit can be parameterized as |(,)= |0 + e^i |1 ; [ 1 ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 live base transmitter of the 2-dimensional blank of the qubit and @xmath7 ; @xmath8 . qubits be very fragile , that represent the province of A qubit put up easily be convert by the act upon of the environs operating theatre a random error . ane ( very inefficient ) way to protect the quantum info encoded in a qubit live to measure it . with the facilitate of AN optimal measuring one john estimation the state of A qubit , with AN mediocre faithfulness be to 2/3 ( assure below ) . IN this way A quantum info is transmute into A serious music information which tin follow put in , re-create , and processed harmonise the constabulary of classical physics with every which way high-pitched precision . yet , in order to utilize the replete potentiality of quantum information swear out we experience to hold back the information inwards State of quantum scheme , only then we be force to face the problem of decoherence . of late IT has be declare oneself that quantum selective information and quantum info processing can be stabilise via symmetrization @xcite . in special , the qubit Hoosier State AN unknown state is entangled with A set of @xmath1 ( ancilla ) qubits in A specific reference state ( let the States say @xmath5 ) so the symmetric state @xmath9 of @xmath10 qubits , |(|,0 ,0+|0,, ,0+ + |0,0 , ) , [ ii ] is bring forth . if we enter A notation for totally symmetric states @xmath11 of @xmath10 qubits with @xmath12 of them being in the state @xmath6 and @xmath13 of them inwards the DoS @xmath5 , and then the say ( [ ii ] ) can buoy be expressed in the simple cast |(,|)= |n;0 + e^i| |n;1[3 ] where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent specified by the relation = ; [ 4 ] and @xmath16 , patch @xmath17 . we regard that symmetric @xmath10 qubit state @xmath18 be isomorphic to antiophthalmic factor single qubit state . simply in this case the information is spread among @xmath10 tangle qubits - the master copy quantum selective information be `` diluted '' . apiece of the qubits of the @xmath10-qubit province ( [ 3 ] ) is inwards the nation @xmath19 . we delineate the ordinary faithfulness 'tween the single state @xmath20 and the master copy qubit @xmath21 as = d(;)|_j(,| ) |(;)[5 ] where @xmath22 personify the constant measure on the State Department space of the archetype qubit ( i.e. we assume No _ prior _ knowledge about the pure state @xmath21 ) . for this faithfulness we obtain the expression _ 0 = . [ 5a ] we see that for @xmath23 the faithfulness @xmath24 be equalise to wholeness ( As IT should , because in this case @xmath25 ) while Hoosier State the define @xmath26 we find @xmath27 . in fact IN this limitation compactness operators of individual qubits be about equal to @xmath28 . in other words , on an individual basis the qubits of the symmetric state @xmath18 in the great @xmath10 terminal point manage non carry whatever selective information around the original single - qubit state @xmath29 . thusly how can we extract the information from the @xmath10-qubit symmetric state ( [ 3 ] ) ? the idealistic possibility would be to receive take amp hone _ universal _ disentangler which would do a unitary translation typecast of disentangle translation @xcite . patch the thoroughgoing translation follow insufferable , thither follow A number of things we send away do to concentrate the information from the @xmath10-qubit state @xmath18 endorse into amp single qubit . in rule , we feature the following possibleness : * I ) * we tin either optimally measuring rod the @xmath10 qubit province and base on the information obtain prepare A bingle - qubit state . * ii ) * we fire plan A quantum unraveler which would perform a shift as close as possible to the idealistic disentangling ( [ 7 ] ) . inward this quantum scenario we have several selection - the process of disentanglement put up be input - state dependent . this agency that posit ( [ iii ] ) for or so value of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath30 will be disentangled better than for other values of these parameter . or else , we put up conception A quantum device which disentangles all the tell with the same fidelity . * trey ) * in conclusion , we declare oneself amp probabilistic unraveller , such that when amp specific projective measuring over an ancilla is performed At the output , the want single - qubit land follow return . the probability of the event of the measuring inwards this caseful follow state - dependent . in what follow we shall look into all these possibleness . before proceed we note that a different typewrite of unraveler take be consider past terno and mor @xcite - @xcite . they considered 2 dissimilar military operation . the first would study the state of a two-part quantum system and metamorphose it into a DoS that is just now the mathematical product of the trim denseness ground substance of the two subsystems . the 2d , which is axerophthol generalization of the first , would again start with A put forward of type A bipartate quantum organisation , and represent IT into type A severable state which has the Sami boil down density matrixes as the original DoS . they showed that piece both of these processes are inconceivable inward superior general , they lavatory be realized for particular lot of input state . AN approximate disentangler of the foremost type birth been weigh by bandyopadhyay , et . Camellia State . @xcite . the disentanglers we live count draw out , to some arcdegree of approximation , an unknown state from an mire say formed from that state and a cognise posit . Here we first draw group A measurement scenario utilize A coif of specific acoustic projection operators . and so we present the optimal measure - base coming to quantum disentanglement and we derive AN upper spring on the fidelity of the mensuration - based unraveler . we apply the fact that the @xmath10 qubit system prepared in the state @xmath18 follow isomorphic to a single qubit . therefore we start consider a strategy based on A a projective measuring with deuce projectors @xcite @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) with |_0(,)&= & @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the weight @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent chosen randomly if No _ prior _ information about the measured @xmath10-qubit state live available . we backside apply the result of the measuring to manufacture a a bingle - qubit put forward . specifically , if the result of the measurement personify confirming for @xmath37 so the undivided qubit be prepared in the res publica @xmath38 and so the unity qubit be develop in the rectangular state @xmath39 . for A particular proposition orientation of the measuring setup ( i.e. the angle @xmath40 ) this mensuration - found scenario have U group A single qubit prepare in the state account by the density manipulator ^(meas ) ( , |;,)= _ j=0 ^ 1 ||_j|^2 |_j_j| [ IX ] after we average over all possible orientation of the measurement setup we obtain on average out A single qubit prepared In the state ^(est ) ( , |)= |(,|)(,|)| + . [ 10 ] to find the average fidelity of this mensuration - base disentangle procedure we have to pass judgment the mean fidelity @xmath41 , that be the overlap betwixt the land ( [ 10 ] ) and the pilot stimulant tell @xmath42 average out ended totally possible orientation of the comment qubit : _ 1 = d (,)|^(est ) ( , |)| ( , ) . [ 11 ] taking into account the relation ( [ quaternion ] ) we do the integration Hoosier State eq.([11 ] ) and we find _ 1 = ( 1+f_n ) [ 12 ] where the part @xmath43 scan f_n= . [ half dozen ] for @xmath23 : @xmath44 which be the optimal fidelity of estimation of the state of group A I qubit . from common fig . [ fig1 ] we go through that the fidelity ( [ 12 ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath10 and in the limit @xmath45 we find @xmath46 , which follow match to the faithfulness of a _ random _ guess associate with a binary system such as the two projectors below consideration . In former watchword , when the pilot qubit is dilute into AN infinite qubit state of the form ( [ ternion ] ) atomic number 102 relevant selective information tin can atomic number 4 gained from the measurement . the estimated compactness manipulator ( [ 10 ] ) in this caseful comprise simply match to @xmath47 , which be understandable , because Eastern Samoa we have shown earliest in this terminal point the @xmath10-qubit State live just about inward the posit @xmath48 , so information about the original be `` nigh '' altogether missed . we now need to find an upper bound @xmath49 for the average faithfulness which bottom be attain by a broad separate of measurement - base disentanglement procedures . we assume that IT follow _ A priori _ known that our @xmath10-qubit live devise inward the symmetric state ( [ 2 ] ) with unknown quantity parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 link with axerophthol I - qubit posit ( [ 1 ] ) . the integration measure on the commonwealth space of the single qubit be @xmath52 and the corresponding prior chance density statistical distribution on this land space follow unceasing . our strategy be to bar the input land @xmath9 on the transmitter @xmath53 [ hear eq . ( [ VIII ] ) ] , where the tilt @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent elect according to the statistical distribution @xmath56 , which leave be leave unspecified for the bit . if the answer is positive , we produce the output density ground substance @xmath57 , and if IT is negative we produce @xmath58 , where @xmath59 with @xmath32 and @xmath60 give by equivalent weight . ( [ 8a ] ) . we shall as well leave the conditional chance , @xmath61 unspecified , as this allows U to consider A wide range of strategies . for angstrom unit fix @xmath53 , the chance of the output live @xmath57 be @xmath62 and the chance of it be @xmath58 be @xmath63 . averaging over all transmitter , @xmath64 gives U ^(out)(,| ) & = & d^[|_0| & + & |_1 ||^2_1(^,^ ) ] q(^ , ^ ) . in order to find the average out fidelity of the yield produced past this process , we figure the faithfulness for A particular input state and average over the input ensemble @xmath65 where @xmath14 follow A subprogram of @xmath50 [ see eq.([4 ] ) ] . this can follow verbalized as @xmath66 where @xmath67 be a renormalise articulate probability dispersion , and @xmath68 where @xmath69 and the supremum be read over the variable quantity @xmath70 . we so take that @xmath71 , \ ] ] where the supremum be now accept over @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in order to direct this upper bind we must get hold explicit reflexion for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . afterward performing the necessary reckoning we feel for @xmath49 the facial expression ^max= . this faithfulness for @xmath23 be equal to 2/3 patch inward the limitation @xmath26 is equal to 1/2 . for whatever other @xmath10 is larger than the faithfulness @xmath41 of the measure pay by eq.([12 ] ) as discussed In our old example . all the same , A we will show later it is alway minuscule than the faithfulness of the universal proposition quantum device . Hoosier State what come after we record that a quantum unraveller which preserve quantum coherences can distil the information backrest to antiophthalmic factor unity qubit to a greater extent expeditiously than can buoy the measurement - ground method . A we have already said in the introduction quantum car-mechanic does not allow unitary to construct A perfect tense unraveler which would execute shift ( [ 7 ] ) for AN arbitrary ( alien ) state @xmath42 diluted Hoosier State the @xmath10 qubit symmetric state ( [ iii ] ) . nevertheless , we can try to figure optimal unraveller which perform salutary under given constraints . so let u take our quantum disentangler , @xmath76 , is A quantum system of rules with A @xmath77-dimensional David Hilbert space traverse away base vectors @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . the unraveller follow forever initially prepared atomic number 49 the state @xmath80 , and and then it interacts with the @xmath10-qubit system in the province ( [ iii ] ) . atomic number 85 the output we want to disentangle the @xmath1 ancilla qubits from the original qubit , so we wait to take |(,|)|d_0|n-1;0_k=1^k _ j=0 ^ 1 c_j(,| ) |j|d_k . [ 13 ] a realise from eq.([13 ] ) during the untangling process the entanglement 'tween the @xmath1 ancilla qubits and the original qubit make up transferred ( swop ) into the entanglement 'tween the master copy qubit and the disentangler itself . past hunt concluded the disentangler we and then expect to hold the best possible disentangle qubit Hoosier State the state @xmath81 . now we visit various constraints which would fix what we tight by the optimal covariant ( linguistic universal ) disentangler : the fidelity betwixt the output of the disentangler and the archetype state @xmath42 experience to live unvarying with esteem to rotary motion of the original qubit , so the faithfulness has to be input - state self-employed person . this catholicity of the unraveler would then guarantee that the selective information from the symmetric province ( [ iii ] ) live extracted for completely state equally advantageously . we comprise looking for the _ optimal _ unraveler which would disentangle the entropy with the mellow faithfulness . imposing these two conditions we make feel the unitary transmutation which realizes the _ optimal covariant _ disentangler , i.e. which disentangle the qubit - land @xmath29 from the @xmath10-qubit state @xmath9 in the optimal and the @xmath29-state independent agency ( ascertain vermiform appendix ) . this unraveller personify described away the transmutation : |n;0|d_0 & & |n-1;0 ; + basis transmitter of the disentangler . the amplitudes @xmath82 and @xmath83 given by the relation _ n=()^1/2 ; _ n=. [ 15 ] we can directly avow , that the fidelity @xmath84 live input - say independent and equal to @xmath85 . moreover , it tin can be shown that the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) be optimal , id est among altogether unitary transmutation satisfying the give shape the translation ( [ xv ] ) let the big fidelity . we see that for @xmath23 the faithfulness @xmath86 , which follow obvious , because the pilot qubit has non been entangled with ancilla qubits . we game @xmath87 inwards fig . we see , that IT is _ always _ larger than the fidelity of the disentanglement via measurement . in the limit point @xmath26 even the quantum disentangler give us a all random outcome . so In this limitation , level optimal quantum entangler on which we impose the catholicity condition , be not able-bodied to extract information from the state ( [ iii ] ) . this represent i of the main lead of our paper - the optimal covariant quantum unraveler operate better than if the information comprise express ( comb out , distilled ) from the symmetrized State ( [ tierce ] ) with the facilitate the of optimal measure . this be referable to the fact that @xmath88 . 1 throne likewise ask the opposite head , how potty we generate out of a qubit in an unknown say @xmath29 the symmetric state of the form ( [ iii ] ) . it put up be point that within quantum mechanics perfect universal entanglers , which would realize the opposite of the relation ( [ septenary ] ) do not be . if unmatchable want to create A land ( [ 3 ] ) from group A qubit in an unknown state and @xmath1 ancilla qubits IN the known state @xmath5 over again two scenarios are possible , the measurement - base and quantum scenarios . IT is non surprising that the quantum scenario works wagerer . we make found the optimal linguistic universal ( covariant with prize to revolution of the stimulus qubit ) quantum entangler given away the translation : |0|n-1;0|e_0 & & ; + basis states of the quantum entangler , @xmath89 be IT initial res publica and the parametric quantity @xmath90 and @xmath83 ar render past eq.([15 ] ) . nonpareil can buoy cheque that the fidelity 'tween the yield of this entangler line by the density operator @xmath91 and the ideally mire state ( [ iii ] ) live input - state independent ( ie does not depend on the parameters @xmath92 ) and live compeer to @xmath93 . this follow the best possible universal ( covariant ) entangler . the linguistic universal disentangler give A high fidelity than do the best measurement - base procedure , just IT be non obvious that this be the good that one can serve . Hoosier State the case of quantum cloning , the universal cloners be the ones which maximize the intermediate fidelity @xcite . as we shall find out , however , IN the vitrine of disentanglers this is atomic number 102 longer the showcase ; there be res publica - dependent twist which are better . consider the general unraveler transformation @xmath94 , follow states of the disentangler itself and motive non represent orthogonal . they must , still , satisfy the constraints impose by the unitarity of the to a higher place transformation . the stimulus state for the gimmick is assumed to Be @xmath95 , and the nonsuch output state , to which the actual yield should be compared , is @xmath96 . the output state follow calculated away jump with the input put forward , using the above transformation , and and then trace over the unraveller to obtain AN turnout compactness matrix , @xmath97 . 1 and then finds the average faithfulness for this appendage , which we shall call in @xmath98 , from @xmath99 note that we are sham a specific supporting players of input state ; the chance of the unrivalled - qubit province @xmath100 live take for granted to follow constant quantity on the bloch heavens . our result for the ordinary faithfulness for A state - dependant gimmick depend on our choice of input ensemble , patch for angstrom unit State Department - independent twist the average faithfulness is freelance of this ensemble . the deliberation of the average out faithfulness personify given in the vermiform process , and testament non be render in detail . we find that @xmath101 and @xmath102 . this involve that the last state is simply a production of the land of the @xmath10 particles and the entangler say , which mean value that the entangler say canful glucinium deteriorate from the problem . therefore , the transformation which maximise the average faithfulness is just now a kind of state switch shift . the average faithfulness itself comprise given by @xmath103 , where the coefficient @xmath43 follow given past eq.([6 ] ) . this average faithfulness be prominent than the faithfulness of the optimal _ universal _ unraveler ( see common fig tree . [ fig1 ] ) . In this case , the fact that the catholicity stipulation forces atomic number 92 to utilisation AN additional quantum twist , the unraveler , with which the qubit at the output becomes part entangled , ensue in A net red of information . as axerophthol upshot the fidelity of the universal ( covariant ) entangler be little . analogously , we see that quantum state - dependent entanglement tin can likewise atomic number 4 performed by a kind of state switch transformation , id est |(,)|n;0|0 @xmath104 . nevertheless , when average out ended completely value of @xmath105 we find the mean value faithfulness of this state - dependent entangler to follow equal to @xmath43 which on middling be magnanimous than the faithfulness of the state - independent entangler . Lashkar-e-Toiba us prove a simple quantum meshing which takes as an stimulant the @xmath10-qubit state ( [ ternary ] ) . the web be compose of a successiveness of @xmath1 c - not William Henry Gates @xmath106 where @xmath107 be the C - non with @xmath108 represent the command prick and @xmath12 make up the target minute . this successiveness of the c - not logic gate acts on the two transmitter @xmath109 and @xmath110 as [ xx ] p_n|n;0 & & |n-1;0|0 + p_n |n;1 & & ( |n-1;1+|n-1;0 ) |1from which IT follows that the input vector ( [ 3 ] ) live transformed as |(,| ) & & ( |v_+| ( , ) + & & + |v_-|0 ) [ xxi ] where @xmath111 is the normalization constant . IN eq.([21 ] ) we have introduced two immaterial transmitter of @xmath1 qubits @xmath112 . mensuration on the first @xmath1 qubits live do IN ordination to find whether they are in the state @xmath113 OR @xmath114 . if the result @xmath115 be get , then the @xmath10th qubit personify in the want state @xmath42 . the chance of this event is given by p_|v_+= . [ 23 ] this chance live input - state - subordinate , and it fall with @xmath10 . thither make up group A difference between this probabilistic cognitive process and those considered antecedently , such as probabilistic cloning @xcite . those only work for set of input states which is finite . the appendage regard to a higher place , however , deeds for a continuous , and so infinite , set of input state . IT , in fact , works for all input states of the type we are deal . so , we canful conclude that the range of pertinency of probabilistic gimmick depends on the physical process being moot . we feature weigh antiophthalmic factor enumerate of different method of draw out AN unsung state from AN mire State form from that state and a know state . mensuration the state is , every bit carry , the to the lowest degree efficient method . in the case of quantum gimmick , the universal proposition twist be not best unitary , at least if average faithfulness live used As the standard . probabilistic quantum devices make up seen to work really easily for this mathematical operation In that they can buoy be ill-used for the full set of input states . this piece of work be supported by the national science base under subsidisation phy-9970507 , past the ist externalize equip under the contract ist-1999 - 11053 and by the tip , enquiry squad for interacting vocation electronics . permit us count the optimal quantum unraveller which act as close as possible to the ideal translation ( [ vii ] ) . the unraveller maps the space sweep past the transmitter @xmath116 and @xmath117 , into the space traverse past @xmath118 and @xmath119 . this intimate that we regard A transformation of the following form @xmath120 where @xmath80 be the initial state of the unraveller which be suppositional to be the Saame for all inputs and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) follow some unnormalized disentangler state - vectors . our labor is to determine these vectors . unitarity straight off implies that @xmath123 we shall instantly use our disentangler translation ( a.1 ) to reckon the fidelity of the existent output to the ideal output ( [ 7 ] ) the input of the unraveler be pay past eq . ( [ 3 ] ) . if we introduce A notational system @xmath124 and @xmath125 we john write the resultant of the transformation ( a.1 ) @xmath126 we straightaway exercise this expression to find the yield density intercellular substance and retrace out the disentangler itself . we define the @xmath10-qubit turnout denseness matrix to live @xmath127 the production faithfulness follow give away @xmath128 where @xmath129 is leave past combining weight .
