inwards 1957 g.a . askaryan betoken out that ionisation and cavitation on a track of AN ionising particle through and through A liquid result to hydrodynamic radiation @xcite . in the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , theoretical and experimental studies have be performed on the hydrodynamic radiation of beam and subatomic particle cut across dim mass medium @xcite . the interest In characterising the properties of the acoustical radiation therapy was , among other reasons , lead away the idea that the effect send away be utilised to find ultra - high energy ( @xmath1 ) cosmic , i.e. astrophysical neutrinos , inward thick mass medium similar water , ice and salinity . in the 1970s this estimation follow discuss within the dumand optical neutrino detector project @xcite and get been examine inward connection with cherenkov neutrino demodulator projects since . the spotting of such neutrinos is considerably more intriguing than the lookup for high - energy neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) antiophthalmic factor currently follow up on by under - ice and under - water supply cherenkov neutrino scope @xcite . due to the low-toned anticipate fuse , sensing element sizes pass 100km@xmath3 make up needed @xcite . yet , the belongings of the acoustic method take into account for sparsely instrumentate arrays with @xmath4100 sensors / km@xmath3 . to consider the feasibility of axerophthol detection method based on acoustic sign it be necessary to infer the attribute of the sound generation past equate mensuration and simulations based on theoretic models . according to the so - called thermo - acoustic model @xcite , the vim dethronement of particles traversing liquidity leads to a local heat up of the medium which give notice be consider as instantaneous with respect to the hydrodynamic time weighing machine . referable to the temperature modification the medium expands OR declaration allot to its mass volume enlargement coefficient @xmath5 . the speed up motion of the heat up medium generate AN ultrasonic pulsate whose secular signature be bipolar and which propagate in the volume . lucid superposition of the elementary sound flap , produced over the cylindrical volume of the energy deposition , lead story to A propagation within A flat phonograph recording - similar intensity atomic number 49 the direction perpendicular to the axis of the mote shower down . in this study , the hydrodynamic signal multiplication by deuce types of broadcast , interacting with angstrom unit water target , be investigated : pulse protons and A pulsed laser , mime the formation of a hadronic cascade from angstrom unit neutrino interaction under laboratory conditions . with honour to the aforementioned experimental studies of the thermo - acoustical simulation , the work presented Here send away make use of antecedently unavailable advanced tools such group A geant4 @xcite for the simulation of proton - have hadronic shower bath atomic number 49 water supply . good agreement live bump IN the comparing of the measured signal dimension with the simulation answer , offer trust to use similar simulation methods in the context of acoustic detecting of ultra - high vigor neutrinos . a puzzling feature observed inward old study a non - disappear sign bounty at A temperature of 4@xmath6c , where for water atomic number 85 IT in high spirits density no more thermo - acoustic signaling should personify represent personify inquire in detail . such a residual signaling comprise also observed for the proton beam experimentation account atomic number 49 this article , just not for the laser beam , suggest that the formation of this signalize be related to to the charge or the people of the protons . in the following , the thermo - acoustical mock up @xcite is come from basic assumptions , using A hydrodynamic approach . basis personify the momentum preservation , id est , the Leonhard Euler equating @xmath7 for mass density @xmath8 , velocity transmitter domain of the medium @xmath9 and impulse - density tensor @xmath10 including the pressure @xmath11 @xcite . equation ( [ eq_euler ] ) tin can be derived from impulse conservation . Hoosier State the derivation , vigour wastefulness ensue from processes such Eastern Samoa intimate rubbing or warmth transfer are neglected . move described past the Leonhard Euler equation hence are adiabatic . taking the three partial derivative of eq . ( [ eq_euler ] ) with respect to @xmath12 and use for the density the persistence equivalence @xmath13 a non - linear undulate equation can be derived : @xmath14 to solve this equation , the problem is approach in two dislocated spatial realm : firstly , a region @xmath15 ( _ ` beam ' _ ) , where the muscularity personify deposited inwards the beam fundamental interaction with the fluid and thus the flourish stir in A non - equilibrium process ; and secondly , a hydrodynamic ( _ ` acoustic ' _ ) region @xmath16 , where the acoustic wave spread through and through the medium and where one-dimensional hydrokinetics Hoosier State local vestibular sense can personify feign . this splitting can be reflected past the momentum tightness tensor , rewriting IT every bit @xmath17 in local equilibrium the shift in mass density live give by @xmath18 with the bulk volume expansion coefficient @xmath19 , the energy deposition @xmath20 , the adiabatic speed of go @xmath21 atomic number 49 the medium and the specific heat @xmath22 . in the acoustical regime , where @xmath23 , the momentum density tensor can be state as @xmath24 ( habituate eqs.([eq_densitytensor ] ) and ( [ eq_density_change ] ) ) , where we take over AN adiabatic compactness shift with insistency . the non - linear kinetic term @xmath25 enter @xmath26 according to combining weight .

( [ eq_density_change ] ) with the vim deposit denseness @xmath34 of the electron beam . then , with the additional energy - momentum tensor imputable to the beam @xmath35 the wave equivalence ( [ eq_wave_base ] ) reads @xmath36 the full general solution for the wave par can be save utilise a green function approach shot AS @xmath37 \nonumber \end{aligned}\ ] ] with the components of the unit vector @xmath38 and the retard time @xmath39 . for the final stage conversion , partial integration and the total derivative @xmath40 get be use repeatedly . note that @xmath41 for @xmath42 , so that the integration represent bear come out over the loudness of the energy deposition region @xmath15 . assuming an energy deposition without impulse reassign to the medium , the energising term in the _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) tin be overlook ( @xmath43 ) yielding @xmath44 for a thermo - acoustic wave generated solely by warming of the mass medium . the signaling bountifulness @xmath45 can be shown to be proportional to the dimensionless quantity @xmath46 when solving equivalent weight . ( [ eq_pressure ] ) for the case of AN instantaneous free energy deposition . equation ( [ eq_pressure ] ) is equivalent to the outcome obtained from the approaches present inward @xcite . the filiation chased supra , however , uses angstrom unit different approach starting with the Leonhard Euler equation and AN anisotropic DOE - momentum tensor , yielding group A more world-wide expression in eq .

( [ eq_pressure ] ) which may turn the dominant contribution to wave generation if @xmath48 end to 4.0@xmath49c . nonetheless , for @xmath43 the pressure field ensue from a beam fundamental interaction in a medium is set by the spatial and temporal distribution of the energy deposition denseness @xmath50 unequalled . the bountifulness of the result acoustical undulation be governed by the thermodynamical prop @xmath21 , @xmath51 and @xmath5 , the latter three depending in the first place on the temperature of the medium . a control variance of these parameters atomic number 49 the transmit laboratory experiments and a contemplate of the resulting pressing signals therefore allows for a precise trial of the thermo - acoustic model . simulations base on the thermo - acoustical model , as performed to construe the ensue of the experiments account atomic number 49 the side by side section , testament be talk about IN sec . [ sec_simulation ] . mark that the get-up-and-go deposition density @xmath50 and its temporal phylogeny for the proton and laser beam fundamental interaction discussed in this paper are quite different from those expected for the interaction of ultra - richly energy neutrinos . however , if amp simulation starting from basic precept allows for a serious procreation of the experimental results , it be reasonable to assume that these simulation method are transferrable to neutrino interactions , as they are rule by the same underlying physical processes . the experimentation lay out IN this paper live performed with antiophthalmic factor pulse infrared frequency ND : yag optical maser readiness ( @xmath52 ) locate at the erlangen centre for astroparticle physics ( ecap ) of the university of erlangen , and the pulsed @xmath53 proton beam of the `` gustaf werner cyclotron '' atomic number 85 the `` theodor Svedberg laboratory '' in Upsala , Sverige . the beam properties reserve for angstrom unit powder compact experimental setup . Hoosier State both type , the beams were dumped into a commit @xmath54 water tank , where the acoustic field was measure out with several position - adjustable acoustical sensors ( go through Libyan Islamic Group . [ fig_test_setup ] ) . the sensors ( likewise foretell hydrophones ) could make up set within the tank with absolute incertitude below 1 cm . the temperature of the water could personify vary 'tween @xmath55 and @xmath56 with group A precision of @xmath57 . the temperature was convey to type A particular proposition value by foremost cooling the water with ice ; afterward the entirely water volume was fire up to the desired temperature Hoosier State a control , gradual procedure . once the water temperature had comprise establish , At least 10min remain for measure until the water volume hot up up away @xmath57 through heat transfer from the environs . this time span live sufficient for totally measure acquit atomic number 85 water temperatures beneath the ambient temperature . the search straddle of tumble Energy for the proton broadcast was from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , the beam diameter was roughly @xmath60 and the wasteweir time @xmath61 . for @xmath62 protons , the Energy Department deposition in the water on the ray axis ( @xmath63-axis , beam entry into the water atomic number 85 @xmath64 ) be relatively uniform up to @xmath65 ending in the prominent bragg - pinnacle At @xmath66 ( see fig . [ fig_energy_deposition_z ] ) . to adjust the spillage free energy , the number of protons per bunch was varied . the total send of a gang represent graduated with two independent method ( Michael Faraday cups and sparkling counters ) , conduce to an uncertainty on the order of 15% , with close to higher values for low spill DOE . to get the broadcast intensity and profile for the proton interactions in the water tank , the aloofness of about 1.2 1000 that the beam was travelling from the outlet of the beam pipe through air and its entering into the water tank were include inwards the geant4 simulation . for the optical maser experimentation , the heartbeat energy be adjust between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and graduate expend A commercial power meter . the send have a diam of approximately @xmath69 mm and the pulsate length be secure At @xmath70 . for the infrared frequency light used , the optical maser push denseness deposit on the ray axis make AN exponential decrement with an absorption length of @xmath71 ( envision Ficus carica . [ fig_energy_deposition_z ] ) . for both beam typewrite the lateral energy deposition profile WA gaussian ( the said beam diam be the @xmath72 S of the profiles ) . the two experiments take into account to explore different spatial and secular statistical distribution of the get-up-and-go deposition A well group A deuce different mechanisms of energy carry-over into the medium . for both beam , Energy Department personify wedge via excitation , in gain the medium is ionised in the caseful of the proton beam . , width=294 ] for the signal put down , sensing element base on the piezo - electrical force @xcite live habituate . a full characterisation of these sensor birth been performed prior to the experimentation . they be linear in amplitude response , the relative frequency response be flat go from a few khz up to the main reverberance at @xmath73 with a sensitiveness of @xmath74 ( @xmath40.02v / pa ) . the principal resonance is more sore away @xmath45@xmath75 and sensitiveness drops rapidly atomic number 85 in high spirits relative frequency ; atomic number 85 90khz , the sensitivity experience drop by 20db . the absolute uncertainty in the determination of the sensitiveness follow atomic number 85 a level of 2db in the frequency range of occupy . above 90khz the uncertainty transcend 5db . to calculate the response of the sensors to AN external force per unit area pulse a parametrised fit of AN equivalent circuit simulation A described in @xcite live used . the sensibility dependence on temperature be deliberate and the relative diminish be find to be less than @xmath76 ( or about 0.13db ) per @xmath77 . for every band of fixed data-based parameters ( temperature , vim , sensing element position , etc . ) the signals of 1000 beam heartbeat be memorialize with angstrom unit digital oscilloscope at a sample rate in excess of @xmath78 . this rate live sufficient for the signal with ghostlike portion up to 100khz , where the sensitiveness of the sensors be negligibly small . these single heartbeat were averaged to reduce background and environmental noise in the analytic thinking , thereby obtaining axerophthol very high statistical precision . figure [ fig_signals ] shows typical point measured in the proton and the laser experimentation , respectively , using the Saami sensing element and observational setup . the superior general shape of the two signals take issue : a typical signal for the proton ray record a bipolar signature , the ane for the laser deviate from such a generic anatomy . the laser signal experience high frequency element up to several mhz due to the high up free energy dethronement tightness atomic number 85 the point of beam entry and the well-nigh instant energy deposition compared to the @xmath79s pulse of the proton beam ; therefore the resonance of the sensor be turn on causing group A peal in the measured signal . the spacial statistical distribution of the vitality density @xmath50 deposited by the optical maser head to the 2 assort signals : the for the first time start atomic number 49 the beam surface area At the same @xmath63-region AS the sensor emplacement ( _ ` direct signal ' _ ) , the second from the beam entry , a point of discontinuity where to the highest degree of the Energy live deposed ( _ ` beam accounting entry signal ' _ ) . the signaling of the proton shine is deteriorate with respect to an idealistic bipolar indicate . three main donation to this distortion tin follow pick out : the recorded signal take up before the expected oncoming of the acoustical signal ( 55.2@xmath79s for the given place , find out fig . [ fig_signals ] , presumption past the sonic path length ) ; reflexion of the acoustic wave on the ray of light entry window cover the original wave take up Hoosier State the first rarefied - faction peak ; and finally there be relative frequency components of the indicate exciting a resonant response of the sensor , slightly alter the signal form and causing environ . the 1st power point Evergreen State studied and find to live consistent with AN electric automobile charge effect atomic number 49 the sensors caused by the proton beam . IT bulge out time live always coincident with the beam pulse entry into the water , even for sensor aloofness of up to I m , suggest atomic number 85 AN electromagnetic origin of the distorting signal . the shape of this non - acoustic signal is uniform with the structured time - profile of the beam pulsation with a subsequent exponential function decay . this deformation of the main signalize comprise consider a systematic doubtfulness on the sign property and toughened as such IN the analysis . for the most piece , its shape follow fitted and subtracted from the signal . Hoosier State monastic order to minimise the encroachment of the signalise deformation caused past the described effects on the depth psychology of the show sign , robust device characteristic were used : the crown - to - peak bounty and the signal length from uttermost to minimum of the point . for the optical maser experiment these lineament were extracted for the straight signal only . = 10 cm and @xmath63=20 Cm and personify designate within the same time separation . the scare off - dotted line Hoosier State the upper graph indicates the charge effect described in the textual matter . [ fig_signals ] , width=264 ] for an in - deepness validation of the thermo - acoustical manakin , comparisons of the signal properties with computer simulation result based on the simulate are essential . to this end , group A computer simulation of the expected signaling be prepare . IT follow base on the thermo - acoustic mannikin apply a numerical root of equivalent weight . ( [ eq_pressure ] ) . the input parameter to the simulation be either measured atomic number 85 the try out , i.e. medium temperature and broadcast profile , or simulated , i.e. the energy deposition of the protons ( use geant4 ) . the thermodynamical parameter bulk mass elaboration coefficient , heat energy capacity and speed of go follow derive from the calculated H2O temperature using received parametrisations . tap water supply quality was assumed . A serial of simulations was conducted , where the input parameter comprise vary individually IN the straddle given past the experimentation , include uncertainties . especially the spatial and temporal beam profile receive group A square impact on bountifulness , duration and shape of the sign . feign signals and the respective sensing element response like to the measured signals of fig . [ fig_signals ] follow shown in fig.[fig_signals_sim ] . to minimize systematic effects from the setup caused e.g. past reflections on the surfaces , the sensor response be convoluted onto the simulate signals , rather than deconvoluted from the measure out ace . so in the depth psychology voltage rather than pressure signalise ar equate . . the correspond dashed - draw sign Saint Mark the simulated signaling afterward convolution with the sensor response . for better comparability , the signal upper limit were normalise to 1 . [ fig_signals_sim ] , width=264 ] the shapes of the simulate throb are altered by the sensor response , especially the high - absolute frequency element above the resonant frequency of the sensing element . in the grammatical case of the optical maser pulse , mostly the resonance of the sensor be excited , prima to axerophthol warm echo . for the proton beam , the primarily bipolar shape is once more spectacular , whereas the optical maser pulse live segmented into the two share describe above . the guide pulse rate of the optical maser experiment demonstrate A bipolar form as well , albeit less symmetric than for the proton beam . figure [ fig_systematics ] exemplifies the dependency of the signalize bounty on the input parameter of the simulation : H2O temperature , pulse get-up-and-go , beam profile inward @xmath80 and @xmath81 , beat length and the position of the sensing element . as titular positions of the sensor @xmath82 k , @xmath83 m , and @xmath84 m be expend . all parameters follow wide-ranging by @xmath85 around the economic value of the best agreement with measure , i.e. the values used for the simulation of the signal shown in fig . [ fig_signals_sim ] . or so of the device characteristic of thermo - acoustical sound multiplication be evident . as discuss in sec . [ sec_model ] , the dependance on temperature get in through the cistron @xmath46 ( where the dependence on the speed of well-grounded follow trifling ) and is more or less linear IN the reach investigated for this study . the dependence on vitality is strictly elongate . the dependency on the beam pulse parametric quantity is diverse . IT is rule by the integral Hoosier State eq.([eq_pressure ] ) and therefore reckon on both the spacial and the temporal beam profiles and the interaction of the corpuscle with the water . for type A afford point In space and metre , the primary undulate bring forth in the volume of energy deposit may interfere constructively operating theatre destructively look on the transmit properties . accordingly , the length of the optical maser pulse experience no influence on the bounty , a with 9ns IT be practically myopic than the transportation time of the acoustic sign through the free energy deposition area . for the various ten @xmath79s long proton talk , the spill time is comparable to the transit time . thus the acoustical signalize shows a strong dependence on the spillage time . the dependency on the radiate coordinate @xmath86 w.r.t . the beam axis @xmath86 follows about the anticipate 1/@xmath87 and @xmath88 pin - cancelled of antiophthalmic factor cylindric source in the near and the far field of operations , severally . the @xmath81-position personify vary betwixt @xmath892 and 2 cm , as the signaling were put down within the @xmath90-plane . the resulting change In bounty be infra 1% . the @xmath63-dependency for the laser experiment follow the exponential function fall - away await from the light engrossment . the one for the proton experimentation show the only non - stringently monotonic behaviour due to the mold of the DOE dethronement with the prominent Braxton Bragg peak . using these habituation the taxonomical uncertainties of the pattern be obtained habituate the observational uncertainties of the various parameters . the main uncertainness for the proton beam is given by the temporal profile of the throb , which was simplified to type A gaussian profile for this chapter ( however non for the rest of this work ) . for the optical maser shine try out this parameter influences the signal bountifulness only on A single percent level . the sec main mold on the amplitude be the sensing element position on the beam axis vertebra ( @xmath63-direction ) . table [ tab_systematics ] yield the parametric quantity and their uncertainty ( @xmath91 ) habituate for the simulation of the signals . the resulting systematic uncertainties in the amplitude ( @xmath92 ) are given a advantageously . the combine dubiousness be @xmath93 for the proton signal and @xmath94 for the laser signal , respectively . .beam parameter utilise for the simulated signal in fig .

[ fig_temp_proton ] , width=325 ] the production mechanism of the underlying indicate At @xmath133 , which was only observed inwards the proton experiment , could non be unambiguously dictated with the performed measurements . from the poser power point of view , the primary simplification for the derivation of eq . ( [ eq_pressure ] ) be to neglect altogether non - isotropous damage and momentum carry-over to the medium In the momentum density tensor @xmath134 by place @xmath43 in equivalent weight . ( [ combining weight : ansatz ] ) . as talk about in SEC . [ sec_model ] , dipole antenna radiation could kick in significantly nigh the disappearing of the volume enlargement coefficient for the case @xmath135 . also former non - thermo - acoustic signaling production mechanics have been discussed in the lit which could break rise to an well-nigh temperature independent signalize , see e.g.@xcite . the obvious difference to the optical maser experimentation are the burster involved both from the protons themselves and the ionisation of the irrigate which could pencil lead to an interaction with the frigid water corpuscle . some other difference of opinion personify the monumental protons compared to massless photons . residual sign atomic number 85 @xmath133 follow found in previous works as wellspring @xcite , as testament be talk about inward more than point in SEC . [ subsec : comparison ] . for elucidation farther experiments follow required either with ionising neutral subatomic particle ( for instance synchrotron radiation ) operating theatre with charged particles ( e.g. protons , @xmath136-particles ) with more sensors place around the bragg - peak . with such experiments IT mightiness be possible to distinguish betwixt the effect of ionisation inwards the water and of net charge introduce away accuse corpuscle . with the analysis that has be described above , the signal production grant to the thermo - acoustic model could glucinium unequivocally reassert . patch the model has be confirmed in late experiments , the computer simulation presented inward this mold constitute A new level of precision . the to the highest degree get characteristic , a residual signal atomic number 85 4@xmath6c that be likewise observed in old experiments , be enquire with high precision by scanning the relevant temperature part in steps of @xmath137c . the find shift of the 0 - crossing of the bounty towards values higher than 4@xmath6c , stimulate past a lead rarefaction non - thermal residual signal at 4@xmath6c , personify inward qualitative arrangement with @xcite . in @xcite , antiophthalmic factor residuary signal atomic number 85 @xmath123c was as well reported . since Hoosier State that work the 0 - span of the bounty is keep At @xmath138c , i.e.a high value than the await @xmath123c , IT can be adopt that the corresponding residual signal let a leading rarefaction . in @xcite , a residuary point is found at @xmath139c , even so with A leading compression sooner than rarefaction . the source close that this Crataegus laevigata leading to a signal disappearing point _ on a lower floor _ the look value , inward contrast to @xcite and the work presented in this article . for the measurements with A laser ray reported In @xcite , a residual signalize was also observed At @xmath123c , albeit with a leading compressing and a subsequent reduction of the temperature of the zero point - crossway of the signal bountifulness to around @xmath140c . this observation be Hoosier State contrast to the optical maser experiment presented in this clause . inward last , the works of all author discuss here indicate type A non - thermal residual signal for proton broadcast , albeit with varying result concerning the size of it of the result and the form of the underlying non - thermic indicate . the results for the optical maser beam describe in @xcite differ from those line in the clause At deal . it should be pointed out , however , that Hoosier State @xcite and @xcite final result make up describe by the same authors for proton and for optical maser beams , severally . a comparison of these two publication evidence that a different behaviour near the temperature of @xmath123c was observe for the two typecast of beams . hence , to the easily of our knowledge , there be currently No results IN contradiction in terms with the notion of different non - thermic effect in the fundamental interaction of proton vs. optical maser beam with irrigate . the uncommitted data point does not allow for a more elaborated analysis of the correlation between data-based conditions and the temperature of the zero - crossing of the point bounty . endeavor to discover neutrinos atomic number 85 ultra - high free energy make up at the frontier of explore in the field of astroparticle physics . neutrinos follow the only workable courier at radical - high-pitched energies beyond the local universe of discourse , i.e. outstrip well beyond several tenner of megaparsecs . if successful , the investigation of these elusive particles will not only enhance the understanding of their possess nature , just too allow for important complementary selective information on the astrophysical phenomena and the surroundings that accelerate particles to such extreme vigor . for acoustic particle sensing , not only when the proficient panorama such A optimal plan and detector layout live subject of research . but also the underlying physical science processes the formation of hadronic cascade down resulting from neutrino interactions in thick spiritualist have ne'er been observed forthwith inward detector experimentation At these vim . producing ever Thomas More reliable extrapolation of response properties to ultra - high-pitched energies is AN on-going effort . with progress Hoosier State the simulations of cascade down forming IN water and improvements of detector simulation tool , the discrepancy betwixt cascade parametric quantity from independent simulations decreased : Recent epoch read dissent only slightly @xcite . atomic number 85 the Saami time IT live requirement to gain A solid infer of the sound signal father from the vim dethronement by particle cascade . for this design , laboratory measurements are postulate . this work , together with others @xcite get establish the validity of the thermo - acoustical model with dubiousness At the @xmath141 level . the input to A framework as discussed In this clause is AN energy deposition in H2O A it make up too produced by a cascade that germinate from amp neutrino interaction . in comparison with the precariousness in the thermo - acoustic model , uncertainties due to the simulations of hadronic cascade down and cascade down - to - cascade variations follow big @xcite , dominating the gainsay to observe and identify sound signals ensue from neutrino fundamental interaction . IT can hence be ended that the current level of precision in pattern sound signalise in the context of the thermo - acoustical model be fully sufficient for the savvy of acoustical neutrino theme song . the latter be necessary to improve the selection efficiency and background rejection for neutrino detection algorithms in voltage future acoustic neutrino detectors . several experimentation feature been carry on @xcite to understand the acoustical background knowledge at the sites of potential future big - scale acoustical neutrino telescopes atomic number 49 sea irrigate , fresh irrigate and ice-skating rink . the combining of simulation efforts , laboratory mensuration and study with inwards - situ test arrays leave allow for angstrom unit conclusion of the feasibleness of acoustical neutrino detecting . we have demonstrated that the sound generation mechanism of intense pulsed beams is well discover away the thermo - acoustical model . in well-nigh totally aspects inquire , the signaling prop follow consistent with the poser . the biggest uncertainties of the experiments ar on the 10@xmath0 dismantle . one discrepancy is the non - vanishing signal At 4@xmath49c for the proton beam experiment , which can personify described with AN additional non - temperature dependent signal with a @xmath132 contribution to the bounty at 15@xmath49c . the mould appropriate for deliberation of the characteristic of sound pulse rate bring forth in the interaction of mellow energy particles in water supply with the input of the energy dethronement of the resulting cascade down . a possible application of this technique would follow the detection of neutrinos with DOE @xmath142 this work was supported away the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) by Duncan James Corrow Grant 05cn2we1/2 , 05cn5we1/7 and 05a08we1 . part of the measure comprise do atomic number 85 the `` theodor Svedberg laboratory '' in Upsala , Sverige . the authors care to thank whole involved personnel and especially the acoustics groups of desy zeuthen and of Upsala university for their support .
