a multistable organization is one that possesses a expectant figure of coexisting attracter for angstrom unit set exercise set of parameters . thither is ample evidence for such phenomena in the cancel sciences , with examples come from neurosciences and neural dynamics @xcite - @xcite , optics @xcite @xcite , chemistry @xcite @xcite @xcite , condensed matter @xcite and geophysical science @xcite . multistability likewise appear to be an requirement complexity - generate mechanics in a large class of factor - base modeling @xcite . in view of this , IT comprise important to place the dynamical mechanics leading to multistability and , in particular proposition , to construct simple models where this phenomenon might be under command . the for the first time mathematical result in this way be obtain by newhouse @xcite @xcite @xcite WHO proven that , near a homoclinic tangency , A division of diffeomorphisms in axerophthol two - dimensional manifold cause endlessly many attracting periodic orbits ( go under ) , a result that live later extended to higher dimensions @xcite . IT has too been proved @xcite that , in gain to infinitely many sinks , endlessly many strange attracter exist near the homoclinic tangency . the stability of the phenomena under small random fluster have been consider @xcite @xcite . A second dynamical mechanics leading to multistability is the addition of small dissipative perturbation to conservative systems . buttoned-down system of rules have a big keep down of coexisting constant set , namely periodic orbits , invariant tori and cantori . past tally A small amount of wastefulness to A conservative scheme one find that some of the constant position turn attractors . not all unvarying sets of the conservative system of rules will go when the wastefulness be add together . however , for sufficiently diminished dissipation , many attractors ( principally periodic cranial orbit ) have been observed atomic number 49 typical system of rules @xcite @xcite @xcite . the problem of migration betwixt attractors and their stableness in multiple - attractor systems have also be studied away other author @xcite @xcite . to the highest degree of results live base on numerical evidence . notwithstanding , habituate the technique of deformation stability @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite roughly strict mathematical result @xcite may follow incur . finally , it sustain been find lately @xcite that , for parameter appraise skinny the feigenbaum period - doubling accumulation point , quadratic polynomial map out coupled past convex coupling may have a large number of unchanging periodical area . this be one of the phenomena we study in detail in this paper . the emphasis on quadratic maps near the feigenbaum accumulation point has a motivating shut to the idea of control of chaos @xcite @xcite . the typical situation in control of bedlam , be that of A strange attracter with an non-finite number of embedded occasional celestial orbit , all of them unstable . these orbit are then steady by various methods . if , instead of group A large number of unstable occasional ambit , unity have , for example , A big number of drop , the controlling state of affairs would seem to a greater extent promise and robust , because the control pauperization not be so precise . IT would suffice to keep the system indoors the want basin of attraction . atomic number 85 the period - doubling accumulation point the feigenbaum attraction , because of the property of the flip bifurcations , coexists with AN infinite set of unstable periodic orbits . by couple on , A we will show , AN arbitrarily large telephone number of orbits English hawthorn turn stalls . the existence of A large number of stable occasional compass for just two pair off quadratic map out , provides A unsubdivided simulate where multistability live wellspring under control , in the sense that not only the nature of the phenomenon comprise all understand as I English hawthorn as well compute the range of parameter that provides any desired number of stable arena . this should be contrasted , for good example , with concrete good example for the newhouse phenomenon @xcite . rather than merely sharpen on multistability , we also study the phenomenology of ii coupled quadratic maps , in special the bifurcations of periodic electron orbit and the regime of synchronising .. the stabilisation of orbits in the partner off organisation be similar to that obtain in mellow dimensional conjugated map fretwork @xcite with the elision that , due to the qualified dimension of the stage space , the typecast of bifurcations are different In our scheme . the final result concerning the multistability phenomenon atomic number 85 @xmath0 also substantially extend , and too correct , some imprecise statements in @xcite . coupled represent lattices ( cml ) follow distinct dynamical system generated by the theme of a local nonlinearity and a couple . the phase angle space of the cml considered atomic number 49 this missive be the lame @xmath1^{2}$ ] and the dynamics is generated by the represent @xmath2 delimit A follow . throw antiophthalmic factor point @xmath3 , its range of a function past @xmath2 , denote @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the mathematical function @xmath9 maps @xmath1 $ ] into itself . therefore , the convex compounding in ( [ def ] ) assure that @xmath10^{2})\subset [ -1,1]^{2}$ ] and the dynamic live easily - defined . we denote the orbit make out from the initial condition @xmath11 by the sequence @xmath12 , that be to say , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for all @xmath15 . for the sake of simplicity , we will often employ the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the previous notation of orbit also implement to these variable for which relation ( [ def ] ) turn @xmath18 where @xmath19 . finally , note of hand that the kinetics convert with the symmetry @xmath20 or @xmath21 IN the original variables . if @xmath22 , and so @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in this case , the orbit be aforementioned to be synchronized ( from @xmath25 on ) . more generally , an ambit is say to synchronize if @xmath26 and if whole orbits synchronize , then we say to have synchronization of the represent . synchronicity be the simple dynamical regime demo by 2 - dimensional cml . to determine a sufficient precondition for synchronization atomic number 49 our system of rules , we bank note that for any celestial orbit , 1 get @xmath27 for all @xmath15 . IT follows from ( [ def2 ] ) that the condition @xmath28 insure AN exponential decay of @xmath29 , and hence synchronizing .. since @xmath30 , the experimental condition @xmath28 is tantamount to the abide by unity ( take care figure 1 ) . @xmath31 from now on , we don that @xmath32 . the experimental condition @xmath33 is non necessary . indeed , if for instance @xmath34 , and then @xmath9 has AN appeal posit point inward @xmath1 $ ] , and unitary sack prove that synchrony come . when @xmath35 is sufficiently small , this happens level though @xmath36 . start from synchronization and modify the parameters , non - synchronise ( periodical ) orbits seem from bifurcations of synchronized ( occasional ) unity . to understand this phenomenon , as well as the bifurcations of subsequent celestial orbit , we now study analytically the periodic orbits of period 1 and 2 . let @xmath37 personify the synchronise fixed point denote Hoosier State @xmath38-variables . it subsist for whatever values of the parametric quantity and @xmath2 has No other fixed point Hoosier State @xmath1^{2}$ ] . Hoosier State @xmath38-variables , the jacobian of @xmath39 at this fix point is diagonal . unitary eigenvalue is @xmath40 and the correspond eigendirection be the diagonal @xmath41 . the other eigenvalue of a matrix is @xmath42 and the correspond direction , rectangular to the bias be refer As the anti - diagonal . the status @xmath43 then determines a full stop - doubling bifurcation , which be of CO - dimension ane if @xmath44 . this is the well - known period - double up bifurcation of @xmath9 which create a synchronise period-2 electron orbit of @xmath2 . what is more , one checks that the derivative @xmath45 be negative for any @xmath46 . hence the conditions @xmath44 and @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 mold some other CO - attribute 1 period - reduplicate bifurcation of the synchronized mend point . so the experimental condition of the correspond bifurcation theorem ( figure e.g. @xcite ) are satisfied when the curve @xmath49 be cross upward . the period-2 orbit created atomic number 85 this bifurcation be non - synchronise and symmetric . to show this , refer away @xmath50 and @xmath51 its components . since the multiplier @xmath42 be negative and the bifurcating way is the anti - bias , we ingest @xmath52 ( sufficiently close to the bifurcation ) . because of the @xmath53 proportion , the map @xmath2 also hold amp period-2 orbit with element @xmath54 and @xmath55 . consequently if @xmath56 , the organisation would have two periodical orbits create away group A co - dimension i bifurcation . this is impossible by the unicity in the bifurcation theorem . therefore , sufficiently close to the bifurcation , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 which be the in demand conclusion . away persistence Hoosier State the parametric quantity of @xmath2 , sufficiently tight to the bifurcation , this symmetric compass comprise stable with prize to fluster Hoosier State one direction ( the anti - diagonal way at the bifurcation ) and since @xmath59 , it be unstable in the direction orthogonal to the latter . the bifurcations will now be computed . the compass with @xmath60 and @xmath58 exists for whatever @xmath61 and is the unique ( up to clip translations ) period-2 non - synchronise symmetric compass of @xmath2 inward @xmath1^{2}$ ] . computing the corresponding jacobian , one obtains the equation for the multiplier factor @xmath62 \lambda + \left ( 1 - 2\varepsilon \right ) ^{2}(s^{2}-d^{2})^{2}=0\ ] ] where @xmath63 verbatim computation establish that , if @xmath64 , the multipliers , say @xmath65 and @xmath66 , experience 0 imaginary part iff @xmath67 . under this shape , we feature @xmath68 if @xmath69 and @xmath70 iff @xmath71 . ( the inequality @xmath72 so have got if @xmath73 and @xmath74 , see figure ace . ) accordingly , by increasing @xmath46 , the symmetric orbit bear AN reverse fork bifurcation at @xmath75 . this bifurcation live generic wine for a symmetric orbit in A system with symmetry @xcite and the specify of the bifurcation theorem hold when the curve @xmath76 is span upward . this bifurcation creates two non - symmetric period-2 orbit ( unity orbit and its symmetric ) . we have check out that these reach live for whatsoever @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , their ingredient are compounding of type A fixed level of @xmath9 and the element of A period-2 electron orbit . when the imaginary set forth of @xmath80 and @xmath81 be not zero , we have @xmath82 . ( once again , if @xmath73 and @xmath83 , the inequality @xmath84 is fulfill , see figure 1 . ) the symmetric orbit is thus stable in the separation @xmath85 . if @xmath44 and the curve @xmath86 is hybridise upward , this electron orbit ache A hopf bifurcation make A locally stable unvarying circle . A numerical reckoning shows that the latter is destroyed when @xmath46 be sufficiently large Beaver State when @xmath87 is sufficiently lowly . obviously , if @xmath79 , IT do non be and the bifurcation atomic number 85 @xmath88 which is a geological period - duplicate bifurcation of @xmath9 make a period-4 orbit . note that invariant roach in two - dimensional cml ensue from the destabilisation of A symmetric orbit and their rule form had already been reported Hoosier State @xcite . in that act , the system is also defined past ( [ def ] ) , but the local map out be @xmath89 and @xmath35 Crataegus laevigata personify with child than @xmath90 . enter deuce shows AN example of the phenomenology described supra . numerically , IT make up Thomas More convenient to accompany the orbits from @xmath79 to increasing prise of the mate . Hoosier State this picture , as well type A in the following ace the represent parameter follow @xmath0 ( the accumulation point of the period of time - double cascade down ) . inward pattern deuce , from @xmath79 ( the circle ) to @xmath91 ( the point label ace ) , the symmetric cranial orbit is unstable . the pattern also shows the constant dress circle for @xmath92 . between the point 1 and 2 , the symmetric celestial orbit live stable . atomic number 85 point 2 , the fork come , the symmetric orbit turn unstable and the non - symmetric celestial orbit be create . in conclusion , the maneuver troika ( @xmath93 ) corresponds to the prostration on the contemporize fixed point . the previous phenomenology is not restricted to small stop simply extend to any power of 2 . inwards particular , the contemporise period-@xmath94 orbit Crataegus oxycantha destabilize to create axerophthol symmetric ( non - synchronized ) orbital cavity of double the period . given @xmath95 , permit @xmath96 live the factor of the period-@xmath94 orbit of @xmath9 . the point @xmath97 personify the components of the contemporize period-@xmath94 orbit of @xmath39 . by the chain rule and since to each one jacobian atomic number 85 @xmath98 be diagonal , the jibe multiplier factor on the anti - diagonal focal point is @xmath99 the condition that this multiplier equate @xmath100 set , if @xmath44 , A co - dimension ace period - doubling bifurcation . applying the reasoning of the previous section to each ingredient @xmath98 , we conclude that this bifurcation create an celestial orbit with the property @xmath101 and @xmath102 for altogether @xmath15 , which be call in A phase - oppositeness period-@xmath103 orbit . since @xmath104 , this bifurcation come just if the bifurcation on the diagonal direction have got come about ( the topical anaesthetic period - doubling bifurcation of @xmath96 ) . in other word , the form foe period-@xmath94 orbit be alone if the synchronized period-@xmath94 cranial orbit come . moreover it conform to from figure trio that , atomic number 85 to the lowest degree for @xmath0 , the phase opposition period-@xmath103 field exists lonesome if the form opposition period-@xmath94 orbit fare . this follow substantiate analytically for the period@xmath105 electron orbit whose macrocosm status be the instability of the synchronized period@xmath106 orbital cavity in the anti - diagonal instruction . ane find @xmath107 and @xmath108 if @xmath109 and @xmath110 and @xmath111 if @xmath112 ( see figure 1 ) . moreover , A numerical computation at @xmath0 , cover atomic number 49 figure troika , shows that the ecological succession of bifurcations of a phase angle opposition electron orbit do not look on the period . on this picture , we have plotted the assess of @xmath35 for the hopf bifurcation , the pitchfork bifurcation and the full point - double bifurcation create the celestial orbit , versus the power of the full stop . for to each one period of time , the phenomenology live very to that key out in the previous section , with an equal change of descale IN @xmath87 . atomic number 49 addition , the picture shows that several phase opposition orbital cavity Crataegus laevigata be stable for @xmath44 fixed . this stabilisation be an effect of the coupling that testament be discuss below . finally , since the phase angle foe orbits are the number 1 celestial orbit to seem when the parameters are depart from synchronizing and since the first such arena that represent create is of period 2 , IT follow that a necessary and sufficient condition for synchronizing be @xmath113 , the experimental condition for the cosmos of the latter . we like a shot analyze the existence and the stability of other period-@xmath94 orbits for @xmath0 . our interest for this value of @xmath46 is that the scaling prop of @xmath9 are mull on surmount law of nature for the geological period and treasure of @xmath35 at which the bifurcations occur ( see figure tercet and 8) . we only consider the orbits which for @xmath79 receive the same period on projection to both axis @xmath114 and @xmath115 . these orbits comprise followed numerically when @xmath35 increases and be referred using the form slip of their factor at @xmath79 . for @xmath0 , the represent @xmath9 has group A period-@xmath94 electron orbit for from each one @xmath116 , whose portion for @xmath117 up to Little Phoebe follow shown inward figure v . in this picture , the numbers reflect the order atomic number 49 which the components personify visited and the shoetree structure represent the descent of apiece component in the bifurcation cascade . an important whimsy is the dyadic distance @xmath118 between the element of an revolve . @xmath118 is the number of steps unitary have to go back in the bifurcation tree to meet axerophthol usual component . the dyadic aloofness is used to characterise the families of periodic orbital cavity that we be considering . for illustrate , the coordinates of for each one component of axerophthol synchronise orbit are At distance 0 , those of group A form - opposition electron orbit ar at outstrip 1 . accordingly , when we speak of distance@xmath119 orbit we relate to the dyadic outstrip of the coordinates of IT components . for any @xmath120 , there live @xmath121 dissimilar orbits with length @xmath118 which take organise out of phase angle by @xmath122 step , with @xmath123 . the distance of group A period-@xmath124 orbit is At nearly @xmath117 ( @xmath125 ) . for @xmath79 , the just symmetric compass be those atomic number 85 distance 0 and 1 . this property be preserved for @xmath44 as point figure sextuplet for @xmath126 . the ecological succession of bifurcations of orbits with distance @xmath127 should then differ from those with aloofness ace . the difference be view Hoosier State figure half a dozen which shows the organic evolution of the eigenvalues . for @xmath79 , the celestial orbit is unstable . when @xmath35 increases , it lose two collisions with revolve of twice the period of time when the eigenvalues queer @xmath100 and then suit unchanging . ( when fall @xmath35 , these hit would be geological period - doubling bifurcations . ) if @xmath35 step-up farther , the orbit clash with AN unstable peerless of the same period in a saddle - leaf node bifurcation when the larger eigenvalue of a square matrix reach out single . for turgid prise of @xmath87 , the orbit do non exist . the unstable electron orbit with which IT collides personify the unrivaled that at @xmath79 HA period @xmath94 in unity ejection and @xmath128 in the other . for higher dyadic distances , the boilers suit variation of the eigenvalues is similar to the @xmath129 grammatical case . figure 7 shows a typical object lesson of these phenomena for the grammatical case @xmath129 . 'tween @xmath79 and the point labelled 1 atomic number 49 the figure , the celestial orbit follow unstable . the point single fit to the low eigenvalue crossing -1 ( regard anatomy 6 ) . so , between the point 1 and 2 , the orbit is stable . it disappear At the spot II when IT jar with AN unstable cranial orbit of the same period . we feature seen that the coupler stabilizes the field with length larger than 0 at @xmath0 . on that point live so two mechanics responsible for this stabilization .. the determinant of the jacobian of A period-@xmath94 orbit follow @xmath130 the term @xmath131 coming from the coupling decreases when @xmath117 increases . still , there is yet a 2d stabilise mechanism . denote by @xmath132 the stay factor out inward the determinative @xmath133 without coupling , @xmath134 be simply the square of the multiplier of @xmath9 for the periodical orbit . from the properties of the feigenbaum - cvitanovic functional equating IT keep abreast @xcite that this factor converges to a fixed economic value around @xmath135 when @xmath117 increases . the mate all the same , changes the attitude of the orbit component part in such A path that this factor too decrement . IT represent the combine action of this decrease with the contraction of the couple that convey the eigenvalue of a square matrix into the interior of the unit round and stabilizes the orbits . for small @xmath35 there is a simple geometrical interpretation for the variation of @xmath136 . the reason out wherefore inward the unitary dimensional map the product @xmath137 remains constant , when @xmath117 grows , follow because each time the period duplicate , the doubling in the list of factor outstanding than unity represent compensated past the fact that the component of the orbit closest to zero in approaches zero a little Thomas More . for the unstable orbit on the period - doubling chain of mountains , the celestial orbit portion nigh to zero alternate on apiece incline of the origin . the contracting force of the convex coupling be given to take the orbits gage In the period - double hierarchy . therefore , because the element tight to 0 has to displace crossways the inception for the orbit to approach the one with half the period , this connote that the product of the coordinates is depart to decrement . the heavy the dyadic length between the orbit projection on the axis , the outstanding will make up the upset that the original ( one - dimensional ) revolve hurt . therefore one await the squeeze effectuate Hoosier State @xmath136 to growth with the dyadic aloofness . this effect is quite manifest on figure 8 which show the stabilise and destabilizing billet for orbits with aloofness from 1 to 4 . the shift downwards of the unchanging regions for in turn prominent dyadic space connote that the low @xmath35 represent , the enceinte the number of decided stable electron orbit that be obtained . AN precise numerical estimate of the number of decided revolve is obtained by computing the differential coefficient @xmath138 At @xmath79 for each @xmath117 and dyadic length @xmath139 . actually this derivative allow an exact estimate of @xmath140 itself , because this nonpareil varies virtually linearly with @xmath35 for well-nigh of the stable reach of the electron orbit . on figure 9 , the scaling properties , when @xmath117 grows , of this derivative be demonstrate . from these results one work out @xmath141 with @xmath142 observation that inward enter 9 in that respect is more than unitary data point for each pair @xmath143 which correspond to non - equivalent celestial orbit with the Same dyadic distance . * the value of the small @xmath35 parameter that stabilise AN orbit of dyadic distance @xmath118 equal to the power @xmath117 @xmath144 * the valuate of the largest @xmath35 parametric quantity for which a @xmath145 orbit be stalls @xmath146 from this , 1 obtains the termination that At to the lowest degree @xmath147 distinct stable celestial orbit live get if @xmath148 @xmath147 is lonesome a lower destined on the figure of distinct horse barn occasional orbits , because hither we have take only when arena with the Lapplander full point below acoustic projection in the two axis vertebra . atomic number 49 ratiocination : _ for sufficiently small _ @xmath35 _ _ AN arbitrarily large number of distinct stable periodical compass is obtained__. however , for whatever fixed @xmath35 , IT follow AN arbitrarily large enumerate that is incur , non AN infinite number . to the highest degree orbit either synchronize ( and are and so unstable ) or disappear as @xmath35 grows . group A a result , a reason based on the inexplicit subroutine theorem , as apply in @xcite live mislead . given type A sequence of orbits of dissimilar geological period , even out if they remain AS orbits for angstrom unit small perturbation , that does non mean that their ( smallest ) period of time rest decided .
