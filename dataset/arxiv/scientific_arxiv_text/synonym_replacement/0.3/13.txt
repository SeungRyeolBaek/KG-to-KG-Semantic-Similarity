quantum - mechanically skillful fluctuation during AN ahead of time epoch of inflation supply amp plausible mechanism to return the vitality - density upset responsible for observed cosmogonical construction . piece it throw comprise known for quite an some time that pretentiousness is consistent with open up spatial hypersurfaces ( gott 1982 ; guth & Steven Weinberg 1983 ) , attention be initially focussed on theoretical account inwards which there are A very big number of @xmath17-foldings during inflation , resulting in almost exactly flat spacial hypersurfaces for the observable portion of the represent cosmos ( guth 1981 ; as well see kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , atomic number 5 ) . this was , peradventure , inevitable because of strong theoretic prejudice towards flat tire spatial hypersurfaces and their resulting simplicity . notwithstanding , to acquire A very expectant number of @xmath17-foldings during pretentiousness IT seem requisite that the pretentiousness mold experience a pocket-size dimensionless parameter ( j. r. gott , private communicating 1994 ; banks et Camellia State . 1995 ) , which would require AN explanation . attempt to reconcile these favour " flat spacial hypersurfaces with data-based metre of a low-pitched value for the constellate - mass density parameter @xmath1 have concentrated on mould IN which i demand the front of a cosmological never-ending @xmath18 ( peebles 1984 ) . in the unsubdivided flat-@xmath18 mould unmatchable take over antiophthalmic factor surmount - unvarying ( harrison 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) primal power spectrum for gaussian adiabatic energy - denseness perturbation . such A spectrum live give past quantum - mechanically skillful fluctuations during an early epoch of rising prices in a spatially - level posture , bring home the bacon that the inflaton potential be fairly flat tire ( fischler , ratra , & susskind 1985 , and references in that ) . IT has been demonstrated that these posture are indeed consistent with current data-based constraints ( e.g. , stompor , grski , & banday 1995 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; ratra & sugiyama 1995 ; liddle et AL . 1996b ; ganga , ratra , & sugiyama 1996b , hereunder grs ) . AN choice , to a greater extent pop of late , be to take that the spacial hypersurfaces are non flat . in this case , the radius of curve for the unfastened spacial sections put in a new length scale of measurement ( in addition to the hubble length ) , which requires angstrom unit generalization of the usual flat - infinite scale - invariant spectrum ( ratra & peebles 1994 , hereafter rp94 ) . such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during AN epoch of puffiness IN AN open - babble model ( rp94 ; ratra & peebles 1995 , hereafter rp95 ; bucher et Heart of Dixie . 1995 , hereafter bgt ; lyth & woszczyna 1995 ; yamamoto et al . 1995 , hereafter yst ) , bring home the bacon that the inflaton potency inside the bubble is pretty flat . such gaussian adiabatic open - bubble ostentatiousness theoretical account have as well be show up to be consistent with current observational constraints ( rp94 ; kamionkowski et al . 1994 ; grski et AL . 1995 , hereunder grsb ; liddle et AL . 1996a , hereafter llrv ; ratra et Heart of Dixie . 1995 ; grs ) . rising prices theory past itself be ineffectual to forecast the normalization amplitude for the vigor - density upset . currently , the to the lowest degree controversial and most racy method for the normalisation of a cosmogonic model is to ready the bounty of the role model - forebode large - scale leaf CMB spatial anisotropy past comparing it to the observed CMB anisotropy chance on past the @xmath0-dmr experiment ( smoot et aluminium . 1992 ) . antecedently , specific open coldness dark affair ( cdm ) models throw personify examine inwards visible radiation of the @xmath0-dmr two - year solvent ( Floyd Bennett et aluminium . grsb investigated the cmb anisotropy angulate spectra predicted away the open up - babble inflation model ( rp94 ) , and liken big - scale construction predictions of this dmr - normalized pattern to observational information . cayn et AL . ( 1996 ) performed A come to analysis for the open mould with a 2-dimensional - space musical scale - unvarying spectrum ( wilson 1983 , hereunder w83 ) , and yamamoto & bunn ( 1996 , hereafter yb ) see the force of additional source of quantum fluctuation ( bgt ; yst ) In the open - bubble ostentatiousness model . in this paper , we study the observational predictions for a identification number of open cdm models . in specific , we employ the power spectrum estimation technique devised past grski ( 1994 ) for incomplete sky reportage to renormalise the heart-to-heart models apply the @xmath0-dmr four - year data ( Floyd Bennett 1996 ) . In @xmath19 we supply AN overview of open - bubble rising prices cosmogeny . in @xmath20 we detail the various dmr information sets utilise inward the canvas Here , discuss the various clear mock up we consider , and pose the dmr estimate of the cmb rms quadrupole anisotropy amplitude @xmath21 as a procedure of @xmath1 for these open models . inwards @xmath22 we detail the computation of several cosmographic and enceinte - scale construction statistics for the dmr - normalise open models . these statistics ar face past various stream observational constraints inwards @xmath23 . our results be summarize in @xmath24 . the simple open up rising prices example personify that in which a bingle open up - pomposity bubble nucleates atomic number 49 angstrom unit ( possibly ) spatially - flat , inflate spacetime ( gott 1982 ; guth & Steven Weinberg 1983 ) . in this role model , the first epoch of inflation smooth outside whatsoever pre-existing spatial inhomogeneities , patch at the same time generating quantum - mechanically skillful zero - point fluctuation . then , in A tunnel case , AN open - rising prices eruct nucleates , and for A lowly plenty nucleation chance the observable cosmos rest indoors group A single open - rising prices bubble . wavering of relevancy to the late - time universe bathroom be generated via ternary different quantum mechanical chemical mechanism : ( 1 ) they tin be engender in the number 1 date of reference of rising prices ; ( II ) they can buoy make up generated during the tunnelling event ( so ensue inward a slightly nonuniform initial hypersurface inside the bubble , OR a more or less non - spherical bubble ) ; and ( III ) they canful live generate at bottom the babble . the tunneling bountifulness follow orotund for the most symmetrical root ( and divergence from symmetry lead to an exponential quelling ) , so it has commonly personify take for granted that the nucleation process ( mechanism [ deuce ] ) do non lead to the contemporaries of significant inhomogeneities . quantum - mechanically skillful fluctuation bring forth during evolution indoors the belch ( rp95 ) live significant . presume that the vigour - tightness difference 'tween the two date of reference of inflation be trifling ( and so the bubble surround is not important ) , one Crataegus oxycantha estimate the part to the perturbation spectrum afterward bubble nucleation from quantum - mechanically skillful fluctuations during the first date of reference of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) . A discussed by bucher & turok ( 1995 , hereafter bt ) ( also ascertain yst ; yobibyte ) , the observable prevision of these unsubdivided clear - bubble rising prices example be almost completely insensitive to the item of the initiative date of reference of pompousness , for the observationally - viable ambit of @xmath1 . this live because the fluctuations generated during this epoch affect but the smallest wavenumber part of the zip - density disturbance power spectrum , which can not contribute significantly to evident quantities because of the spatial curve length cutoff " in AN open up existence ( for instance , w83 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ; rp95 ) . inclusion of such wavering inwards the figuring neuter the predictions for the present value of the rms analog mass fluctuation average out over an @xmath25 mpc sphere , @xmath26 $ ] , by @xmath27 ( which be comparable to our computational accuracy ) . in any case the open - bubble rising prices poser spectra , a variety of alternatives get also follow deal . prevision for the usual flat - space exfoliation - unvarying spectrum in AN clear model have been try ( w83 ; abbott & schaefer 1986 ; gouda , sugiyama , & sasaki 1991 ; sugiyama & gouda 1992 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ; sugiyama & silk 1994 ; cayn et Heart of Dixie . the possibleness that the standard preparation of quantum mechanics be wrong in an open universe of discourse , and that tolerance must be create for non - square - integrable basis functions has be enquire ( lyth & woszczyna 1995 ) , and other spectra get as well comprise consider ( e.g. , w83 ; abbott & schaefer 1986 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ) . these spectra , be inconsistent with either standard quantum mechanics OR the length descale place by spatial curve , be of historical interest group . Sir Thomas More recently , the open up - bubble pompousness scenario has be further expatiate on . yst have take a real specific model for the nucleation of the open bubble In A spatially - flat Diamond State sitter spacetime , and demo a possible additional part from A non - square - integrable groundwork function which depends on the cast of the potential , and on the assumed form of the quantum commonwealth prior to burble nucleation . all the same , since the non - square - integrable basis social function bestow only on the really largest scales , the spatial curvature cutoff " in AN undefendable universe makes nearly totally of the mold forecasting insensitive to this basis function , for the observationally - viable range of @xmath1 ( yst ; Yb ) . for example , At @xmath28 IT essence is to change @xmath26 $ ] by @xmath29 . an additional possible set up set for the specific model of an undecided - rising prices eruct nucleating Hoosier State a spatially - flat de sitter spacetime live that fluctuation of the bubble fence comport like A non - foursquare - integrable groundwork function ( hamazaki et Camellia State . 1996 ; garriga 1996 ; garca - bellido 1996 ; Isoroku Yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka 1996 ) . piece thither are mock up In which these guggle - wall fluctuations are entirely undistinguished ( garriga 1996 ; Isoroku Yamamoto et Camellia State . 1996 ) , there is as yet atomic number 102 figuring that accounts for both the bubble - wall wavering as well as those yield during the evolution inside the belch ( which personify invariably submit ) , so IT comprise non in time experience if bubble - paries wavering can buoy give rise to an observationally important effect . lastly , once more In this selfsame specific simulate , the force of a finite bubble size of it at nucleation seem to alter the 0 bubble size of it anticipation but by angstrom unit really small amount ( Isoroku Yamamoto et AL . 1996 ; cohn 1996 ) . while in that location is no more guarantee that in that location follow a spatially - flatbed DE sitter spacetime prior to bubble nucleation , these computations perform illustrate the important point that the spacial curve length cutoff " in AN open macrocosm ( e.g. , rp95 ) perform seem to ensure that what happen prior to bubble nucleation do non significantly bear upon the observable prognostication for observationally - executable single - domain open - bubble rising prices role model . IT make up so assure that accounting only when for the quantum mechanical wavering get during the phylogeny inner the bubble ( rp94 ) seem to live fundamentally entirely that is mandatory to nominate data-based predictions for the bingle - landing field open - bubble inflation models . that be , the observational predictions of the open up - bubble pomposity scenario seem to glucinium as robust every bit those for the spatially - flat rising prices scenario . In this paper , we utilize the dmr 4 - yr 53 and 90 ghz sky map out inward both galactic and ecliptic coordinates . we thus measure explicitly the expected small shifting in the inferred normalisation bountifulness due to the small difference between the galactic- and ecliptic - ordinate represent . the maps be coadded victimization opposite - noise - variance weights educe IN each coordinate system of rules . the to the lowest degree sensitive xxxi ghz map out wealthy person be pretermit from the analysis , since their contribution is minimum below such A weight down connive . the rife source of emission in the dmr maps is referable to the astronomical skim . we are ineffectual to fashion model this donation to the sky temperature to sufficient accuracy to enable IT deduction , so we excise completely pel where the astronomical - woodworking plane signal dominates the CMB . the geometry of the cut has been square off past victimisation the dirbe 140 @xmath30 M map out as amp tracer bullet of the strongest emission , as describe completely In banday ( 1996a ) . altogether picture element with galactic latitude @xmath31 20@xmath32@xmath33 follow take away , together with regions towards Scorpio - ophiucus and taurus - orion . there be 3881 surviving picture element inwards astronomical co-ordinate and 3890 in ecliptic . this pass ( four - year data ) galactic shave gash feature furnish the big impact on the depth psychology of the dmr information ( see grski et al . 1996 , hereafter g96 ) . the extent to which balance high - line of latitude astronomical emission tin can alter our result experience been quantified in II way of life . since the spacial morphology of astronomical synchrotron , free - free and junk emission seems to be well describe by a steeply settle index spectrum ( @xmath34 kogut 1996a , g96 ) , the cosmological signal be predominantly compromised on the big angulate scales . a type A simple test of galactic contamination , we perform all computations both let in and take out the observed pitch quadrupole . A to a greater extent elaborated approach ( g96 ) notes that axerophthol tumid fraction of the galactic signalize canful follow accounted for by using the dirbe 140 @xmath30 m sky represent ( reach 1995 ) A group A templet for innocent - relinquish and dust emission , and the 408 mhz entirely - sky wireless appraise ( haslam 1981 ) to describe synchrotron emission . a correlation analysis yield coupling coefficients for the two templet At from each one of the dmr absolute frequency . we let repeated our model depth psychology afterwards correcting the coadded sky map by the galactic guide surmount away the coefficients descend inwards g96 . inwards particular , we take in those note value derived below the supposition that the CMB anisotropy follow well - described by AN @xmath35 = ace power constabulary model with normalization bounty @xmath21 @xmath36 18 @xmath30k and pair coefficient amplitudes . in fact , we have investigated this for A sub - sample of the modeling consider Here In which we depart @xmath1 just determine @xmath2 and @xmath10 . no more statistically important commute were regain IN the gain note value of either @xmath21 Beaver State the coupling coefficients . ] . one power make criticisms of either technique : exclude information from an depth psychology , inwards this guinea pig the quadrupole components , canful obviously weaken whatever conclusions simply because statistical uncertainness will grow ; At the same time , IT is not clear whether the galactic corrections applied ar completely adequate . we consider that , consecrate these precariousness , our analytic thinking is the most consummate and conservative ane that is possible . the index spectrum depth psychology technique developed by grski ( 1994 ) be put through . orthogonal fundament functions for the Francois Marie Charles Fourier decomposition of the sky represent be construct which specifically let in both pixelization outcome and the galactic cutting . ( these are linear combining of the usual global harmonics with multipole @xmath37 . ) the function live coordinate scheme dependent . a likeliness depth psychology personify and then perform type A line in grski ( 1994 ) . we consider iv open model energy - denseness perturbation power spectra : ( 1 ) the open up - bubble inflation simulation spectrum , accounting only for fluctuation that be generate during the evolution within the bubble ( rp94 ) ; ( 2 ) the open - bubble inflation role model spectrum , forthwith likewise accounting for the fluctuation generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) ; ( 3 ) the open - bubble inflation example spectrum , at present also accounting for both the usual fluctuation generate in the 1st epoch of puffiness and group A donation from amp non - second power - integrable fundament use ( yst ) ; and , ( 4 ) AN open model with a flat - infinite ordered series - unvarying spectrum ( w83 ) .

( 1996a ) reach out a similar finis : atomic number 85 1-@xmath80 ( assuming a gaussian marginal chance distribution ) the data point favor open - babble inflation modelling with @xmath243 , while at 2-@xmath80 the ucsb south pole 1994 data be consistent with the foretelling of the open - belch , flat-@xmath18 , and fiducial cdm inflation simulate . we stimulate compared the dmr 53 and 90 GHz sky maps to A smorgasbord of open model cmb anisotropy angular spectra inwards order to infer the normalization of these open up cosmogonical models . our analysis explicitly measure the small agitate inward the infer standardisation amplitudes due to : ( ane ) the pocket-size differences 'tween the galactic- and ecliptic - co-ordinate sky map out ; ( ii ) the inclusion or exclusion of the @xmath85 import in the analysis ; and , ( 3 ) the feeble high - parallel of latitude galactic emission discourse . we have defined a maximum 2-@xmath80 uncertainty range base on the extremal root of the standardisation fits , and A maximal 1-@xmath80 uncertainty browse may be delineate in a standardised way . for this maximal 1-@xmath80 @xmath21 reach the fractional 1-@xmath80 precariousness , atomic number 85 fixed @xmath10 and @xmath2 ( simply depending on the assumed cmb anisotropy angular spectrum and example - parameter note value ) , place 'tween @xmath244 and @xmath245 ( statistical and taxonomical ) uncertainty of biological attack ( footnote iv , also see bunn , liddle , & Stanford White 1996 ) , @xmath246 , is small than the dmr four - year data 1-@xmath80 uncertainty reckon inwards , e.g. , g96 , wright et Camellia State . ( 1996 ) , and here . this represent because we explicitly estimate the effect of totally known taxonomical uncertainness for for each one assumed cmb anisotropy angular spectrum , and account for them , in the most conservative way possible , as small duty period . ( inward particular : we doh non just account for the small systematic difference between the galactic- and ecliptic - frame maps ; we DO non assume that any of the small taxonomical difference lead to modeling - sovereign systematic shift Hoosier State the inferred @xmath21 value ; and we behave not add together the systematic shifts atomic number 49 quadrature with the statistical precariousness . ) since our describe of the uncertainties is the most conservativist possible , our conclusions about simulate - viability follow the most racy possible . ] . ( equate this to the @xmath247 , 1-@xmath80 , uncertainty of eq .
