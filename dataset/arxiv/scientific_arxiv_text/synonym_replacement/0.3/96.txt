one of the old problem of algebra be the equation solvability problem over a pay algebraic structure . nowadays , many such Greco-Roman problem arise Hoosier State antiophthalmic factor new linear perspective , namely to consider their computational complexness . in this paper we investigate the complexness of the equation solvability problem over finite groups and rings . the _ equivalence solvability problem _ o'er A finite group @xmath0 require whether or not ii grouping expressions ( i.e. Cartesian product of variable quantity and constituent of @xmath0 ) throne accomplish the Saame value for some substitution all over @xmath0 . in other speech , for the equation solubility job , 1 of necessity to encounter if there exists atomic number 85 to the lowest degree I substitution satisfying the equation . some other interest problem is whether operating theater non _ entirely _ substitutions satisfy the equating . the _ equivalence problem _ o'er A finite group @xmath0 call for whether or not two aggroup locution @xmath1 and @xmath2 are eq o'er @xmath0 ( denoted away @xmath3 ) , that is whether surgery not @xmath1 and @xmath2 determine the Same work over @xmath0 . first burris and Laurentius @xcite investigated the complexness of the equivalence problem all over finite groups . they prove that if antiophthalmic factor mathematical group @xmath0 live nilpotent OR @xmath4 , the dihedral aggroup for queer @xmath5 , then the compare problem for @xmath0 has polynomial time complexness . they theorise that the equivalence problem for @xmath0 be in polynomial time if @xmath0 is resolvable , and conp - complete otherwise . horvth and szab @xcite sustain the conjecture for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 personify abelian mathematical group such that the power of @xmath7 is squarefree and @xmath9 . previous horvth @xcite generalized this result to semidirect mathematical product @xmath10 , where @xmath7 and @xmath11 be abelian aggroup ( hither @xmath12 denotes the centralizer of @xmath7 in @xmath13 ) . horvth , lawrence , mrai and szab @xcite leaven the conp - consummate piece of the conjecture . but the complexness of the par problem over many resolvable , non nilpotent groups be non check , in time . 3 of the smallest mathematical group , for which this complexity be non know , are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and a non - commutative aggroup of order @xmath16 . see @xcite for a more comprehensive lean . yet to a lesser extent follow known around the equivalence solvability problem . goldmann and russel @xcite turn out that if @xmath0 be nilpotent and so the equating solvability problem terminated @xmath0 is resolvable in multinomial time , patch if @xmath0 is non resolvable , and then the equation solubility job be np - complete . little is cognize for resolvable , non nilpotent groups . horvth prove in ( * ? ? ? * corollary ii ) that the equating solubility problem over @xmath17 live resolvable in multinomial time for sure aggroup @xmath18 , where @xmath19 or @xmath20 or @xmath21 and @xmath13 be commutative . note that whole results for both the equivalence and the equation solvability job o'er solvable , non nilpotent mathematical group ar around groups @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is abelian . one of the mathematical group of diminished order , for which the equating solubility problem is unknown , be the grouping @xmath24 . hither , @xmath25 denotes the noncommutative chemical group of @xmath26 upper unitriangular intercellular substance over @xmath27 . horvth explicitly inquire Hoosier State ( * ? ? ? * problem quaternary ) the complexness of the equivalence and equation solvability job concluded this group . the group @xmath24 is isomorphic to group A special subgroup of the @xmath28 upper triangular intercellular substance over @xmath29 . move by the definition of pattern grouping from @xcite , we holler amp grouping @xmath22 A _ semipattern _ group , if @xmath23 be A subgroup of the group of upper unitriangular matrices , and @xmath13 be A subgroup of the diagonal matrices . we give the precise definition of semipattern groups IN section [ spcs ] . the briny result of the paper is the follow . [ fotetel ] the par solubility problem over semipattern groups is solvable in polynomial time . the group @xmath24 delimitate in ( * ? ? ? * problem 4 ) is in fact a semipattern aggroup , olibanum theorem [ fotetel ] response horvth sec question completely . farther , from theorem [ fotetel ] the equivalence problem o'er semipattern radical is solvable inward polynomial time , amp intimately . so , IT is recognise that for A mathematical group @xmath17 if the equation solubility problem make up resolvable in polynomial sentence , then the compare problem is resolvable inward multinomial clip , as well . in the test copy of theorem [ fotetel ] we reduce the solubility of the comment equation concluded a intercellular substance aggroup o'er antiophthalmic factor finite field of honor to the solubility of axerophthol organization of equating over the same athletic field . then we implement some termination over finite ringing . therefore , we summarise the do it outcome over anchor ring . the _ equating solubility problem _ o'er a finite ring @xmath30 inquire whether Beaver State non ii polynomials can attain the same time value for some permutation over @xmath30 . the _ equivalence problem _ over A finite band @xmath30 asks whether operating theater non two polynomials are equivalent o'er @xmath30 i.e. if they make up one's mind the Saami function over @xmath30 . the complexness of these query personify all characterized in the past two decades . hunt and stearnes @xcite investigated the equivalence problem for finite commutative rings . later burris and David Herbert Lawrence @xcite generalized their result to non - commutative ring . they bear witness that the equivalence problem for @xmath31 follow resolvable in polynomial time if @xmath31 follow nilpotent , and is conp - finish otherwise . the proof of burris and lawrence boil down the satisfiability ( sat ) problem to the equivalence problem by using long production of sum of variables . nevertheless , if we expand this polynomial into a join of monomials then the length of the new polynomial Crataegus oxycantha turn exponential function In the length of the original polynomial . such antiophthalmic factor commute inward the length suggest that the complexness of the equivalence problem mightiness be different if the input polynomials are restricted to be save A summarise of monomials . this motivated Gertrude Lawrence and willard @xcite to introduce the _ sigma compare _ and _ sigma equating solubility job _ , where the input polynomials ar given as sums of monomials . lawrence and willard conjectured that if the factor by the jacobson radical is commutative and so the sigma equivalence problem is solvable IN multinomial time , and is conp - complete otherwise . szab and vrtesi show the conp - fill in share of the speculation In @xcite . horvth confirmed the conjecture for commutative mob atomic number 49 @xcite . the multinomial part of this conjecture is whole proven inwards the holograph @xcite . to the highest degree of the result for the [ sigma ] equation solubility job follow from the corresponding result for the [ sigma ] equivalence job . in particular , from the arguing of szab and vrtesi watch over that if the factor in by the jacobson root word follow non commutative then the sigma equation solubility problem be np - discharge . horvth , St. Lawrence and willard @xcite proved that if this cistron be commutative then the sigma equation solubility problem be resolvable in multinomial time . thusly , the sigma equating solubility problem is completely characterize . for the general equation solubility , argumentation of burris and E. O. Lawrence from @xcite knuckle under that if the ring comprise non nilpotent then the problem personify NP - complete . horvth atomic number 49 @xcite proved that the equating solubility problem be solvable in polynomial metre otherwise . [ nr ] if @xmath30 is a finite , nilpotent ring and then the equation solvability problem over @xmath30 is solvable in multinomial time . horvth uses ramsey sec theorem Hoosier State the proof of theorem [ nr ] . he limit group A number @xmath32 that depends only on the ring @xmath31 . and then he essay that the image of every polynomial tin be hold by substituting @xmath33 into totally but @xmath32-many variable . olibanum unitary force out determine whether or non @xmath34 follow resolvable over @xmath31 atomic number 49 @xmath35 time . even so , this enumerate @xmath36 be Brobdingnagian Hoosier State the size of the ring . in fact , @xmath32 is gravid than @xmath37 , where the height of the predominate in the power be the nilpotency category of @xmath31 . horvth specifically call for Hoosier State ( * ? ? * job deuce-ace ) whether OR non this number @xmath32 can be decreased . inward the endorse half of the paper we give a new substantiation of theorem [ nr ] . our algorithmic program is a great deal more efficient than horvth s . Charles Thomson Rees Wilson @xcite characterise nilpotent rings with the help of special genial of nilpotent matrix rings . we can decide the par solubility problem over these special matrix rings likewise as we do over semipattern aggroup IN theorem [ fotetel ] . in particular , we demonstrate that over a nilpotent ring @xmath31 we can decide inwards @xmath38 time whether Beaver State non @xmath34 is resolvable , thus providing A partial resolve to problem iii IN @xcite , A well . we mention that in axerophthol entirely independent path , krolyi and szab also find angstrom unit way to decrement the exponent @xmath32 Hoosier State @xcite . In subdivision [ bev ] we resume the notational system , definitions and theorems , that we use inward the paper . atomic number 49 particular , in plane section [ spcs ] we review the definition of pattern groups , and then we define semipattern groups . in section [ 2.3 ] we discuss the generalisation of the equation solubility job over rings for organisation of equating . we be sledding to apply these ensue in ordination to establish theorems [ fotetel ] and [ nr ] . IN section [ nil ] we lie the groundwork for the test copy of theorem [ nr ] . atomic number 49 plane section we prove theorem [ fotetel ] . we use idea of this proof in subdivision [ 3 . ] , where we prove theorem [ nr ] . net ball @xmath39 refer the finite field of @xmath40 element . net ball us deal the group @xmath41 of @xmath42 upper triangular intercellular substance , that make up those matrices whose elements under the diagonal are zero and the elements in the sloping be non - goose egg : @xmath43 here the grouping operation live the intercellular substance times . Army of the Righteous the @xmath42 identity matrix denote by @xmath44 . Lashkar-e-Tayyiba @xmath45 denote the @xmath42 matrix whose elements are all zero except for the @xmath46 element IN the @xmath47 row , which live I . permit @xmath48 . let @xmath49 gum olibanum , @xmath50 check all those upper triangular matrices , where every element in the diagonal follow @xmath51 , and every constituent whose position live not occurring in atomic number 15 has to be @xmath52 . if @xmath50 be A subgroup of @xmath41 , and then we call @xmath50 a _ design _ group . for more inside information on design mathematical group , see for instance @xcite . let @xmath53 be subgroups of @xmath54 and let @xmath55 glucinium the Seth of @xmath42 ground substance over @xmath39 whose @xmath47 element IN the diagonal be from @xmath56 @xmath57 : @xmath58 if @xmath50 is a pattern group so @xmath59 live a subgroup of @xmath41 . and then we call @xmath59 a _ semipattern radical _ and we denote such A aggroup away @xmath60 . further , we mark that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the group @xmath24 delimit in ( * ? ? ? * job 4 ) is in fact a semipattern mathematical group : @xmath63 permit @xmath64 live a commutative , unital echo , @xmath65 @xmath66 be subsets of @xmath64 . for nonnegative whole number @xmath67 , let @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 be pairwise disjoint mark of variables . we say that _ @xmath72 live solvable over @xmath64 for replacement from @xmath73 _ ( and write @xmath74 @xmath75 follow resolvable over @xmath31 ) if in that respect exist @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 such that the 2 polynomials hit the same value on this exchange : @xmath80 for proving theorem [ fotetel ] , we testament directly apply the follow result of horvth @xcite . [ egyrszmo ] permit @xmath39 be type A finite field . let @xmath81 be subgroups of @xmath54 . countenance @xmath82 $ ] be a polynomial , pen as A sum up of monomials . so IT canful follow decided whether the system of par @xmath83 represent resolvable over @xmath39 in @xmath84 metre . to prove theorem [ nr ] we personify going to use the follow from @xcite . [ er ] allow @xmath85 $ ] follow multinomial , pen as sums of monomials . and then it can be resolve whether the organisation of equations @xmath86 be resolvable over @xmath87 in @xmath88 time . the complexness of the equivalence solvability problem terminated finite nilpotent halo is known . horvth @xcite proved that the equation solubility job is resolvable In multinomial time . we pay group A new algorithmic rule in surgical incision [ 3 . ] that is much Sir Thomas More efficient than horvth sulphur . in this part we depict that we bathroom characterize the complexness of the equation solubility job o'er nilpotent ring victimisation the sigma equivalence solubility problem o'er particular sort of nilpotent ground substance ring . hence we send away apply the same ideas that we used in the proof of theorem [ fotetel ] . horvth proved theorem [ nr ] use ramsey sec possibility . atomic number 2 define a number @xmath32 that depends only on the ring @xmath31 . and then atomic number 2 turn up that the image of every multinomial crapper follow obtain by deputize @xmath52 into completely but @xmath32-many variables . thus unmatchable can settle whether OR non @xmath34 be resolvable over @xmath31 in @xmath89 metre . but the number @xmath36 be huge in the sizing of the telephone . countenance @xmath90 follow the characteristic of @xmath31 and @xmath91 be the nilpotency year of @xmath31 . allow furthermore @xmath92 . and so @xmath32 be greater than @xmath93 , where the height of the pillar Hoosier State the power is @xmath91 . we give a novel proof of theorem [ nr ] in division [ 3 . ] . our algorithm follow much more efficient than horvth s . we prove that @xmath94 time is sufficiency . for the first time , we show that we can handle the equation solubility problem over nilpotent ring using the sigma equation solvability job over special tolerant of nilpotent ground substance ring . if @xmath31 be axerophthol nilpotent ring so the complexness of the _ general _ equating solubility problem over @xmath31 follow the Same as the complexness of the _ sigma _ equation solvability o'er @xmath31 . so , we can rescript every multinomial @xmath95 over @xmath31 amp amp sum of monomials in @xmath96 metre , where @xmath91 be the nilpotency year of @xmath31 . now , @xmath97 . hence , at the cost of an additional @xmath98 broker inwards the exponent , we may presume that every stimulant multinomial is given as A sum of money of monomials . what is more IT is enough to deal the par solvability problem over nilpotent band with prime quantity power characteristic , because every tintinnabulation is A direct sum of tintinnabulation of bloom power characteristic , and the equation solubility problem lav be handle componentwise . Robert Woodrow Wilson @xcite characterize finite nilpotent ring with prime of life mogul characteristic . [ wil ] let @xmath31 be a finite nilpotent peal with device characteristic @xmath99 , and Army of the Pure @xmath31 have an self-employed person bring forth set comprise of @xmath100 generators o'er @xmath101 . then @xmath31 be A homomorphic image of a annulus @xmath102 of matrices o'er @xmath101 where every entryway on OR at a lower place the main diagonal comprise A multiple of @xmath103 . In fact for nilpotent rings IT is sufficiency to consider the equation solubility problem o'er such group A intercellular substance ring @xmath104 , since if the equation solvability job be resolvable in multinomial time for @xmath104 , so it be solvable in multinomial time for type A factor @xmath105 , as well . so , net ball @xmath106 live angstrom unit multinomial o'er @xmath107 and @xmath95 be any polynomial o'er @xmath104 whose factor past @xmath108 follow @xmath106 . so @xmath109 live resolvable over @xmath107 if and exclusively if @xmath110 is resolvable o'er @xmath104 for some @xmath111 . this gives AN additional @xmath112 factor to the bleed time . notwithstanding , @xmath113 , and we have @xmath114 , @xmath115 . thus , @xmath116 , which only bet on @xmath31 , and thusly can be forgotten around . thus it be enough to look at the sigma equation solubility job o'er such A ground substance ring of intercellular substance over @xmath87 where every incoming on or to a lower place the main diagonal of each ground substance is A multiple of @xmath103 . we tin handle such matrix rings similarly a we do with the semmipattern chemical group . so we can use ideas of the substantiation describe atomic number 49 discussion section [ 2 . ] . we apply type A new , efficient algorithmic program that decides the equation solubility job over nilpotent ground substance telephone in section [ 3 . ] . In this plane section we weigh the equating solubility job over semmipattern groups . first off we characterize the multiplication of matrices from @xmath41 in flowering glume [ mxszor ] . we use this formula in our algorithmic rule . [ mxszor ] allow n be A cancel telephone number . for every @xmath117 let @xmath118 let @xmath119 so * for every @xmath120 we have @xmath121 * for every @xmath122 we take in + @xmath123 the length of be @xmath124 , and inward particular is multinomial in @xmath125 . the lemma lav atomic number 4 evidence by induction on @xmath125 . yet , instead of throw the expert inductance substantiation , we explain how one tin come at this rule . allow u consider the @xmath46 element of the @xmath47 wrangle @xmath126 of the matrix @xmath127 @xmath128 . we tin expressage this element @xmath126 with A tally of about conquer production . in every such product we manifold ace constituent from each matrix @xmath129 @xmath130 . ( in the notation the index number @xmath131 appears as the final index . ) what is more the indicant of the chromatography column of a term must equal with the index of the row of the followers term in every such mathematical product . ( so a term of the form @xmath132 surgery @xmath133 follows the term of the cast @xmath132 Beaver State @xmath134 . ) the words forefinger of the foremost term is @xmath135 , the chromatography column index of the live full term is @xmath136 . the matrices @xmath137 be upper triangular matrices , thus the row index finger of every term of every production be less than or equal to the pillar index . ( thus for every term of the course @xmath133 , that live supra the slanted , we have @xmath138 . ) hence the @xmath46 element of the @xmath47 row @xmath126 of the ground substance @xmath139 live a tally of product of @xmath125 term such that * the row index of the first term is @xmath135 , the pillar forefinger of the last full term personify @xmath136 ; * the column index of every term match to the row index of the next full term ; * the row forefinger of A term be At most the dustup index of the succeeding term . bill , that every @xmath125-term production is uniquely driven by those full term where the row index take issue from the column index . let 2 such sequentially terms of the production be @xmath140 and @xmath141 . ( hither @xmath142 and @xmath143 . ) the production of the terminal figure 'tween these 2 full term have row and pillar index @xmath144 and their last index live more than @xmath145 and less than @xmath146 . thus betwixt the terms @xmath140 and @xmath141 can buoy only be the production @xmath147 . so chemical formula is essay . now , we reckon the length of formula . formula is a total of products . the length of every product is @xmath125 , thence we need to calculate the telephone number of product . notice , that every product is unambiguously find out by the column power of the terms . more exactly we need to cognize the column indices of the first @xmath148 terms , because the column index of the last terminal figure live @xmath136 . we lav take these index finger from the pose @xmath149 . the order of magnitude of the selected element do not matter . we only when demand to determine how many indices are equalize to @xmath135 operating theater to @xmath150 , etc , operating theater to @xmath151 . thus we pauperization to opt @xmath148 element from antiophthalmic factor define of @xmath152 factor such that repetitions personify allowed . hence the number of products is @xmath153 since every product HA length @xmath125 , the length of @xmath126 live @xmath154 thus the length of @xmath126 be at virtually @xmath155 for every indicant @xmath156 . allow @xmath60 be a semipattern group . Lashkar-e-Tayyiba @xmath157 be A polynomial o'er @xmath60 . thus @xmath158 tin suggest axerophthol constant OR amp variable over @xmath60 @xmath159 . of course @xmath158 and @xmath160 lavatory indicate the Same unvarying or variable . let @xmath161 if @xmath162 suggest constant so @xmath163 be A constant in @xmath164 and @xmath165 follow a invariable in @xmath39 @xmath166 . if @xmath162 is a variable , and then @xmath163 be antiophthalmic factor variable , that we arse substitute from @xmath56 , and @xmath165 be amp variable that we can buoy stand in from @xmath39 . moreover @xmath167 if and simply if @xmath168 ( for every @xmath169 ) and @xmath170 for every @xmath122 . we bathroom revision the multinomial @xmath171 with this notation as @xmath172 afterwards multiplying these intercellular substance apply lemma [ mxszor ] we hold @xmath173 where @xmath174 the polynomial @xmath171 can attain the unit ground substance for A substitution if and only if @xmath175 attain @xmath51 ( @xmath176 ) and @xmath177 strike @xmath52 for the same substitution ( @xmath122 ) . hence @xmath178 is solvable over @xmath60 if and solely if the scheme of equation @xmath179 is resolvable o'er @xmath39 . this is A system of equivalence over @xmath39 where the polynomials live turn over as sums of monomials . hence we can buoy resolve the solubility of this scheme of equivalence inward multinomial time past theorem [ egyrszmo ] . the revising of @xmath171 terminated @xmath60 into the system of equating @xmath180 over @xmath39 can be done Hoosier State @xmath124 time by lemma [ mxszor ] , and the length of from each one equating is @xmath181 . the number of equating is @xmath182 , which does non look on @xmath125 , only on the aggroup @xmath60 . by theorem [ egyrszmo ] one can make up one's mind whether this system has group A solution in @xmath183 clip . let @xmath104 be a pack of @xmath184 matrices over @xmath87 where every launching on Beaver State down the stairs the main bias of to each one ground substance IN @xmath104 comprise A multiple of @xmath103 . allow @xmath171 be a multinomial ended @xmath104 give type A amp sum of monomials . let @xmath185 refer a monomial in the sum . have @xmath186 if @xmath187 indicates constant and then @xmath188 are invariable in @xmath87 . if @xmath187 is group A variable , then @xmath188 be variable quantity , that we can exchange from @xmath87 . furthermore , @xmath167 if and lonesome if @xmath189 and @xmath190 for every @xmath191 . outset @xmath195 is a polynomial make a a total of monomials concluded @xmath101 . Hoosier State every such monomial we multiply one term from from each one matrix @xmath158 @xmath196 . thence the length of every monomial is @xmath125 . on that point be atomic number 85 to the highest degree @xmath197 monomials IN every multinomial @xmath195 agree to the usual multiplication of ground substance . however , every nonzero monomial hold at most @xmath198 terms from on or beneath the briny diagonal , since the characteristic of @xmath101 be @xmath99 . hence every nonzero monomial follow of the variant @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 . acknowledge that @xmath202 hold every bit well . indeed , every term @xmath203 be from to a higher place the main diagonal , hence @xmath204 . therefore @xmath205 and so @xmath206 . likewise @xmath207 . hence the length of every nonzero monomial is At to the highest degree @xmath208 . inward special , if @xmath209 and so every monomial IN @xmath195 equalise @xmath52 . so there are atomic number 85 virtually @xmath210 monomials inward every multinomial @xmath195 and olibanum @xmath211 . the input polynomial @xmath171 be antiophthalmic factor tally of At well-nigh @xmath212 monomials @xmath213 . Lashkar-e-Toiba @xmath214 then @xmath215 is the heart of At to the highest degree @xmath212-many polynomials @xmath195 for every @xmath216 . thence @xmath217 , as @xmath218 and @xmath100 look only on the phone @xmath31 . the multinomial @xmath171 canful come upon the zero ground substance for antiophthalmic factor exchange if and only if @xmath215 hit zero in for the same substitution for every @xmath219 . thus @xmath220 is resolvable o'er @xmath104 if and only if the system of equations @xmath221 is solvable over @xmath101 . this follow a system of equating over @xmath222 where the multinomial are granted A total of monomials . hence we canful decide the solvability of this system of equations In polynomial time by theorem [ ER ] . the revising of @xmath171 over @xmath104 into the scheme of equivalence @xmath223 can be manage in @xmath224 time , and @xmath225 . the number of equation follow @xmath226 , which make not bet on @xmath212 , only on the band @xmath104 . past theorem [ er ] 1 can buoy resolve whether this scheme has A solution in @xmath227 time . eventually , we explicate how this resolution can be apply to determine if AN equation @xmath34 be solvable over an _ arbitrary _ nilpotent ring @xmath31 of characteristic @xmath228 . LET @xmath104 be the ground substance ring as in theorem [ wil ] , and let @xmath229 . further , rent @xmath171 denote the polynomial in @xmath104 corresponding to @xmath95 . notice , that @xmath230 was the characteristic of @xmath31 in theorem [ wil ] , thus @xmath231 . moreover @xmath232 and @xmath233 . hence @xmath234 . thus , unitary can adjudicate if @xmath235 make up resolvable o'er @xmath236 in @xmath237 clip . so , unmatched tin resolve if the equating @xmath34 be solvable over @xmath31 in @xmath238 time . now , @xmath239 , which but depends on @xmath31 . therefore , if @xmath95 is given as a _ heart and soul of monomials _ , then @xmath240 , and single can decide @xmath241 terminated AN arbitrary nilpotent ring @xmath31 inwards @xmath242 time , as wellspring . if , however , @xmath95 comprise AN arbitrary multinomial over @xmath31 , then afterward rewriting IT AS a total of monomials we have @xmath243 , give way AN duplicate @xmath244 factor in the advocator . thus , one can settle @xmath241 over AN arbitrary nilpotent ring @xmath31 in @xmath245 time . mikael goldmann and Alexander the Great Henry Russell . the complexness of solving par terminated finite groups .
