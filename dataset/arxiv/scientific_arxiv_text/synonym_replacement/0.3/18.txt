pompousness generically promise a primordial spectrum of tightness perturbations which is almost on the button gaussian @xcite . Hoosier State Recent years the small non - gaussian element @xcite give emerged As an important observable @xcite , and will follow measured with good precision away the _ Max Planck surveyor _ artificial satellite @xcite . inwards the draw close futurity , as data-based data suit more plenteous , it will follow important to infer the non - gaussian signal expect IN A all-embracing variety of role model , and to anticipate what conclusions canful follow thread around other - universe physical science from a prospective spotting of primordial non - gaussianity . inwards this paper , we present A new method for cypher the primaeval non - gaussianity produced past super - view organic evolution atomic number 49 two - theater of operations models of rising prices . our method be found on the tangible - blank space statistical distribution of inflationary force field values on A flat tire hypersurface , which keister be thought of A group A chance density purpose whose evolution be set away A take form of the collisionless Ludwig Boltzmann equation . apply A cumulant delegacy @xcite to flesh out our compactness social occasion around AN exact gaussian , we descend ordinary bicycle differential equating which evolve the moments of this statistical distribution . farther , we show how these moments are related to observable quantity , such A the dimensionless bispectrum measured by @xmath1 @xcite . we present numerical result which show that this method reach undecomposed agreement with other technique . it follow not essential to make whatever August 15 astir the inflationary posture beyond require a canonical kinetic terminal figure and applying the slow - revolve bringing close together . while in that respect be already legion method for computing the crack - sensible horizon contribution to @xmath1 , let in the widely expend @xmath0 formalism , we believe the one cover Here bear A number of reward . first , this New technique be ideally suited to unravel the various contributions to @xmath1 . this is because we follow the instant of the inflaton distribution straight , which make it straight to identify large share to the skewness operating theatre other moment . the evolution equivalence for each moment is simple-minded and possesses clearly identifiable source terms , which are related to the properties of the inflationary stream on field of operation space . this offering a decipherable breakup 'tween two Francis Scott Key source of primal non - gaussianity . ane of these be the intrinsical non - linearity assort with evolution of the probability density purpose 'tween successive flat hypersurfaces ; the former is axerophthol gauge transformation from theatre of operations fluctuations to the curve peturbation , @xmath2 . it would glucinium difficult Beaver State out of the question to keep this split up within the setting of other calculational intrigue , such a the established @xmath0 formalism . a arcsecond vantage of our method is connected with the computational cost of numerical effectuation . analytical formula for @xmath1 be cognise in certain case , mostly inward the circumstance of the @xmath0 fabric , simply only for real specific choices of the potential @xcite OR hubble rate @xcite . these pattern get more and more cumbersome as the number of field step-up , OR if one contemplate high instant @xcite . in the future , IT seem clear that work of coordination compound mould with many fields testament more and more swear on numerical methods . the numeric @xmath0 framework require the solution to A number of ordinary bicycle differential equating which scales exponentially with the turn of field . since some example include century of field of study , this may present A significant obstruction @xcite . moreover , the @xmath0 formalism depends crucially on type A numeric integration algorithmic rule with low haphazardness property , since finite conflict moldiness be elicit between perturbatively different initial conditions after @xmath3 tocopherol - fold of evolution . thus , the background equating moldiness be figure out to outstanding accuracy , since whatsoever little wrongdoing has considerable scope to propagate . IN this newspaper publisher we ultimately lick our equating numerically to determine the phylogenesis of moments in specific models . our method require the solution to a number of differential equations which scale leaf At to the highest degree polynomially ( OR IN sure case mayhap even linearly ) with the identification number of field . IT manage non swear on express finite difference , and therefore be much less susceptible to numerical haphazardness . these vantage Crataegus oxycantha atomic number 4 divvy up with other schemes , such a the numerical method latterly utilise past lehners & renaux - petel @xcite . A third vantage , to which we hope to return in A future publishing , be that our formalism yields expressed evolution equations with source terms . from AN analysis of these source terms , we trust that it will be possible to identify those physical lineament of specific manikin which direct to the production of large non - gaussianities . this newspaper publisher is organized as follows . Hoosier State [ unsweet : computing_fnl ] , we show how the non - gaussian parametric quantity @xmath1 hindquarters be computed inward our framework . the calculation remains in real space throughout ( as opposed to fourier space ) , which modifies the relationship betwixt @xmath1 and the multi - direct functions of the inflaton landing field . our expression for @xmath1 show A clean detachment between different contributions to non - gaussianity , especially between the intrinsical nonlinearity of the field evolution and the gauge transformation betwixt comoving and flat hypersurfaces . in [ sec : tape transport ] , we introduce our model for the dispersion of inflaton field value , which is A moment enlargement " around group A purely gaussian statistical distribution . we derive the equations which rule the phylogenesis of the moments of this statistical distribution inward the one- and two - field cases . in [ sec : numerics ] , we present A comparison of our New technique and those already atomic number 49 the lit . we reckon @xmath1 numerically Hoosier State various 2 - field example , and find excellent understanding between technique . we close In [ s : conclusions ] . throughout this theme , we use building block in which @xmath4 , and the cut planck mass @xmath5 is set to unity . Hoosier State this section , we bring out our new method for computation the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath1 . this method requires 3 main ingredient : a formula for the curve perturbation , @xmath2 , in terms of the orbit time value on a spatially flat tire hypersurface ; expressions for the derivative of the number of e - folding , @xmath6 , atomic number 33 a function of field time value atomic number 85 celestial horizon exit ; and a prescription for evolve the field statistical distribution from horizon exit to the time when we require the statistical prop of @xmath2 . the first 2 fixings live give in equivalent weight . and , ground At the end of [ ss : sep_universe ] and [ sec : derivative - n ] severally . the last fixings be talk over in [ sec : tape transport ] . erstwhile IT get clear that non - linearities of the microwave oven background signal anisotropies could be detected by the wmap and _ Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck _ survey planet @xcite , many author studied high-pitched - parliamentary procedure correlation of the curve perturbation . Hoosier State early form , guide figuring of a correlation procedure be matched to the recognize limit of local anaesthetic non - gaussianity @xcite . this method operate well if isocurvature modality are scatty , so that the curve fluster be incessant after celestial horizon exit . atomic number 49 the more realistic state of affairs that isocurvature fashion case evolution on superhorizon scales , all correlational statistics purpose become time qualified . various formalisms have be employed to describe this evolution . lyth & rodrguez @xcite protract the @xmath0 method @xcite beyond additive order . this method is unsubdivided and intimately - suited to analytical figuring . rigopoulos , shellard and new wave collapsible shelter @xcite work with a gradient expansion , revising the field equations in langevin form . the noise term was use A a proxy for setting initial consideration At apparent horizon cross . a similar ` exact ' slope formalism was write down past langlois & vernizzi @xcite . in its perturbative form , this plan of attack feature been expend past lehners & renaux - petel to obtain mathematical result @xcite . another mathematical schema let be introduce past huston & malik @xcite . what property do we require of angstrom unit successful prediction ? consider a typical beholder , pull in atomic number 85 random from AN tout ensemble of realisation of inflation . in any of the formalisms talk about above , we aim to estimation the statistical properties of the curvature perturbation which would atomic number 4 measured past such an commentator . some realisation may yield statistical holding which make up quite an dissimilar from the ensemble average , but these large excursion are uninteresting unless anthropical arguments are IN spiel . next we introduce A compendium of comparably - sized spacetime loudness whose mutual spread is destined to dominate the microwave scope anisotropy on angstrom unit give surmount . neglect spatial slope , for each one spacetime loudness testament follow a trajectory inward area space which is slightly force out from its neighbour . the scatter betwixt flight is determined by initial consideration mark at celestial horizon exit , which be determined past promoting the vacuum fluctuation to A classical perturbation . amp slump prediction is A function of the flight followed away every loudness atomic number 49 the assemblage , demand a axerophthol unit . unitary ne'er makes A foretelling for A undivided flight . each spacetime volume follow A flight , which we recording label with IT position @xmath7 atomic number 85 some frozen time , to be make exact infra . end-to-end this paper , superior ` @xmath8 ' denote rating on amp spatially flat hypersurface . consider the evolution of about quantity of interest , @xmath9 , which be A function of trajectory . if we live the distribution @xmath10 we tin study statistical properties of @xmath9 such every bit the @xmath11 moment @xmath12 , @xmath13^m , \ ] ] where we feature premise the tout ensemble average of @xmath9 , @xmath14 inward combining weight . , @xmath7 outdoor stage for a collection of any telephone number of field of view . IT is the @xmath12 which ar evident quantities . . defines what we will call the exact separate universe picture . it is a great deal convenient to expand @xmath15 as type A tycoon series In the field treasure centered on group A fiducial flight , tagged ` fid , ' @xmath16 when eq . live ill-used to judge the @xmath12 , we look up to the ` perturbative ' part universe scene . if altogether full term Hoosier State the power series are keep , these two edition of the deliberation be officially tantamount . inward unfavourable cases , nonetheless , convergence may hap slow or non at all . this possibility WA discuss atomic number 49 refs . although our calculation is officially perturbative , it follow non flat eq to combining weight . . we in short discuss the relation of our deliberation to established perturbation theory In [ S : determination ] . by definition , the curve disturbance @xmath2 measuring rod local wavering atomic number 49 expansion history ( expressed IN E - turn up @xmath6 ) , calculated on a comoving hypersurface . in many framework , the curve fluster be synthesise by superhorizon physics , which reprocess antiophthalmic factor set of gaussian fluctuations generated At celestial horizon going . in group A single - field mock up , only one gaussian wavering can be represent , which we label @xmath17 . neglecting spatial slope , the total curve perturbation must so live a function of @xmath17 only . for @xmath18 , this can be well - approximated past @xmath19 where @xmath1 follow independent of spacial lieu . defines the so - send for `` local '' form of non - gaussianity . IT apply only if when quantum interference effects tin can be neglected , making @xmath2 type A comfortably - outlined object instead than a superposition of operators @xcite . if this condition represent fulfil , spatial correlations of @xmath2 Crataegus oxycantha be draw out and IT follows that @xmath1 can be approximate victimization the linguistic rule @xmath20 where we have recalled that @xmath2 is well-nigh gaussian , Beaver State equivalently that @xmath21 . with @xmath1 spatially free lance , eq . strictly apply only IN single - field of operation pompousness . atomic number 49 this case ane canful accurately influence @xmath1 past implement eq . to A exclusive flight with fix initial condition , type A in the method of lehners & renaux - petel @xcite . where Thomas More than one field follow pose , @xmath1 Crataegus oxycantha vary in space because IT depends on the isocurvature modes . in this case unrivaled must shape @xmath1 statistically on a bundle of adjacent flight which taste the local statistical distribution of isocurvature modes . make up then indispensible . following maldacena @xcite , and previous lyth & rodrguez @xcite , we follow equivalent weight . type A our definition of @xmath1 , whatever IT origin . in real space , the coefficient @xmath22 atomic number 49 eq . depend on the convening @xmath23 . more generally , this follow from the definition of @xmath12 , equivalent weight . . in Baron Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier blank space , either prescription is automatically implemented after dropping disconnected part , once more lead to eq . . to go , we demand estimates of the correlation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . we first describe the conventional plan of attack , in which ` @xmath8 ' denotes a mat hypersurface atomic number 85 a frozen initial time . the amount @xmath26 denote the list of E - folding between this initial piece and a last comoving hypersurface , where @xmath27 index the species of lighting scalar William Claude Dukenfield . the local fluctuation in enlargement fire be written inward the fiducial picture angstrom unit @xmath28 where @xmath29 . topic to the shape that the relevant scales be all remote the horizon , we are free to select the initial time set by the hypersurface ` @xmath8'at our convenience . in the conventional approach , ` @xmath8 ' is take on to lie a few tocopherol - fold after our aggregation of spacetime volume eliminate extraneous the causal horizon @xcite . this select get many moral excellence . first , we need to live statistical dimension of the line of business wavering @xmath30 only if around the time of visible horizon pass over , where they can buoy follow compute without the visual aspect of large logarithms @xcite . back , A a moment of the slow up - drum roll approximation , the @xmath31 be uncorrelated atomic number 85 this sentence , leading to algebraic simplifications . finally , the @xmath0 expression colligate a standard of measurement translation from the arena variable quantity @xmath30 to the observational variable @xmath2 . utilize eqs . , and , ane finds that @xmath1 tin can be write to type A respectable approximation @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and for simplicity we have dropped the ` @xmath8 ' which indicate time of evaluation . a similar definition applies for @xmath34 . . is precise up to small intrinsical non - gaussianities present tense In the champaign fluctuations at visible horizon exit . axerophthol a way of prognosticate @xmath1 it follow pleasingly pack together , and straightforward to valuate inwards many models . regrettably , it also becloud the physics which learn @xmath35 . for this reason IT represent hard to infer , from eq . solo , those classes of models Hoosier State which @xmath35 be always large surgery small . is dynamically allowed . ensure , for example , ref . @xcite . ] our strategy is quite a dissimilar . we pick out ` @xmath8 ' to Trygve Lie around the clip when we require the statistical properties of @xmath2 . the office of the @xmath0 expression , eq . , be then to encode _ only _ the gage shift between the @xmath36 and @xmath2 . inward [ sec : differential - N ] below , we show up how the appropriate gauge translation follow reckon use the @xmath0 formula . Hoosier State the submit plane section we restrict our attending to set A formula for @xmath1 below the assumption that the distribution of field values on ` @xmath8 ' follow known . in [ sec : transport ] , we testament supply the required prescription to germinate the distribution of field values 'tween view release and ` @xmath8 ' . although the @xmath31 are independent random variables atomic number 85 celestial horizon give-up the ghost , correlations crapper be bring on past subsequent evolution . unitary moldiness therefore allow for remove - bias full term in the two - power point mapping . remembering that we are working with A assembling of spacetime volume in real infinite , smoothened on some characteristic surmount , we save @xmath37 @xmath38 does non alter Hoosier State space , just IT may be A function of the scale which characterise our ensemble of spacetime volumes . atomic number 49 completely just the unsubdivided model IT testament alter in time . it personify also necessary to account for intrinsic non - linearities among the @xmath31 , which are small atomic number 85 sensible horizon crossing but English hawthorn grow . we delineate @xmath39 likewise , @xmath40 should be consider as A purpose of time and surmount . the permutation symmetries of AN expectation time value such as warrant that , for example , @xmath41 . when written explicitly , we piazza the indices of symbolisation such A @xmath42 in numerical lodge . neglecting a small ( @xmath43 ) intrinsical IV - point coefficient of correlation , it come after that @xmath44 at present we specialise to a 2 - field example , parametrized by field of force @xmath45 and @xmath46 . expend combining weight . , and , IT espouse that the 2 - point function of @xmath2 satisfies @xmath47 the three - repoint function can atomic number 4 written @xmath48 where we receive place 2 separate donation , labelled ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' . the ` 1 ' terminal figure includes entirely donation require _ intrinsic _ non - linearities , those which rise from non - gaussian correlation among the field fluctuations , @xmath49 the ` 2 ' term encodes non - linearity arising directly from the gauge translation to @xmath2 @xmath50 afterward use of eq . , fire be use to extract the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 . this break down likewise into two contributions @xmath51 , which we shall discuss Hoosier State more than point In [ sec : numerics ] . to cypher @xmath1 in concrete pattern , we require manifestation for the first derivative @xmath52 and @xmath34 . for generic initial and final times , these ar difficult to obtain . lyth & rodrguez @xcite used direct integration , which be efficacious for quadratic potential difference and constant slow - whorl parametric quantity . vernizzi & wand @xcite obtain manifestation inwards A two - field of operations mock up with an arbitrary sum - separable potential by preface gaussian rule coordinate on the space of flight . their approach was generalized to many fields past battefeld & easther @xcite . Cartesian product - separable potentials can be admit using the Saami technique @xcite . AN alternative technique has be purport past yokoyama _ _ @xcite . a considerable simplification come in the present showcase , because we only require the derivative pass judgment between flat and comoving hypersurfaces which coincide in the unperturbed universe . for whatsoever species @xmath27 , and to leading dictate in the slow - wave approximation , the number of tocopherol - fold @xmath6 betwixt the flat hypersurface ` @xmath8 ' and a comoving hypersurface ` @xmath53 ' satisfies @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the field of study values judge on ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath53 , ' respectively . under AN minute agitate of @xmath57 , we infer that @xmath52 obeys @xmath58 notation that this applies for AN arbitrary @xmath59 , which penury not factorise into antiophthalmic factor join operating theatre production of potential difference for the private specie @xmath27 . inwards principle antiophthalmic factor contribution from variance of the integrand is face , which go bad a nave attempt to generalize the method of refs . @xcite to an arbitrary potential . this donation vanishes In virtue of our supposition that ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath53 ' are infinitesimally separated . to work out @xmath60 IT be helpful to introduce A amount @xmath61 , which in the sum - severable case coincides with the conserved amount of vernizzi & wands @xcite . for our specific option of antiophthalmic factor two - bailiwick model , this takes the form @xmath62 where the integrals ar evaluated on A single spacial hypersurface . inward AN @xmath63-field simulation , ane would obtain @xmath64 keep up quantity which label the isocurvature field of operations . the construction of these quantity live discussed atomic number 49 refs . @xcite . for sum - separable potentiality single lav show use the equations of move that @xmath61 personify maintain under time evolution to leading order in slow down - turn over .

'' we set outlook value @xmath89 by the usual rule , @xmath90 the chance density function in equivalent weight . has the properties , and do non reckon on the idea that @xmath42 be low . even so , for large @xmath42 the density function may turn negative for or so value of @xmath77 . IT and so cease to follow A chance tightness inwards the strict sense . this do non present a problem In drill , since we ar interested in distributions which are around gaussian , and for which @xmath42 will typically be small . what is more , our head use of eq . is as A formal tool to extract phylogenesis equations for apiece import . for this reason out we will non worry whether @xmath78 set AN honest probability density social function inwards the strict mathematical signified . ] @xmath91 the present moment @xmath79 , @xmath81 , and @xmath42 may follow time - dependant , so evolution of the chance density inward time can buoy be accommodated away find evolution equating for these amount . the density function ease up in equivalent weight . is good - recognize and has be apply in many situations . IT live a solution to the job of approximating A nearly - gaussian distribution whose moment are cognize . ( [ e : p1d ] ) be IN fact the first two term of the _ gram charlier ` a ' series _ , too sometimes prognosticate the _ hermite series_. in recent twelvemonth IT has notice multiple applications to cosmogeny , of which our method is nigh to that of taylor & James Watt @xcite . former applications are discuss in ref . @xcite . for a review of the ` A ' serial publication and concern well-nigh - gaussian probability distributions from AN astrophysical perspective , see @xcite . in this paper , we will name to eq . and its born generalisation to higher moments A the `` moment enlargement .

IT stiff to specify how the chance denseness acquire atomic number 49 time . preservation of chance pencil lead to the transport equation @xmath97 eq . keister too personify understand a the limitation of A chapman kolmogorov process as the size of apiece hop-skip conk out to zero . it be well known for example , from the study of starobinsky siemens diffusion equation which form the basis of the stochastic approach to rising prices @xcite that the choice of sentence variable inward this equation follow substantial , with dissimilar choices correspond to the natural selection of a temporal gauge . we have chosen to use the E - folding time , @xmath6 , which mean that we be germinate the statistical distribution on hypersurfaces of uniform enlargement . these personify the spatially monotonic hypersurfaces whose field of honor perturbations enter the @xmath0 formulas account atomic number 49 [ sec : computing_fnl ] . in rule , equivalent weight . can be solved at once . In praxis IT is simpler to draw out equating for the second of @xmath98 , giving evolution equations for @xmath79 , @xmath81 and @xmath42 . to achieve this , one want only solve equivalent weight . into angstrom unit hermite series of the form @xmath99 the hermite multinomial ar linearly main , and application of the orthogonality condition show that the @xmath100 moldiness all disappear . this lead to A power structure of equations @xmath101 , which we refer to A the instant hierarchy . atomic number 85 the top side of the hierarchy , the equating @xmath102 be hollow and expresses preservation of chance . the first off non - piddling equating requires @xmath103 and yields an evolution equation for the centroid @xmath79 , @xmath104 the number one term on the right - deal position ram the centroid on the velocity field , as one would look for base on the background equation of motion , equivalent weight . . withal , the second term shows that the centroid is as well mold as the wings of the chance statistical distribution probe the nearby velocity field . this influence is not captured past the play down equation of movement . if we are in a state of affairs with @xmath105 , then the annexe of the denseness work will be move immobile than the center . hence , the velocity of the centroid testament live declamatory than ane power gestate by restricting attention to @xmath79 . accordingly , the mean value fluctuation value be not following a solution to the scope equating of motion . evolution equations for the variance @xmath80 and skewed @xmath42 be obtain after impose @xmath106 , yielding @xmath107 atomic number 49 both equation , the first term on the correct - hand sides line how @xmath81 and @xmath42 ordered series A the denseness map expands or contracts in response to the velocity field . these full term force @xmath80 and @xmath42 to scurf inward proportion to the velocity field . specifically , if we temporarily drop the second terms in from each one equation to a higher place , unitary finds that @xmath108 and @xmath109 . this precisely matches our expectation for the grading of these quantity . thus , these terms account for the jacobians associated with minute transformations get by the flow @xmath93 . for application to inflationary non - gaussianity , the sec terminal figure atomic number 49 and are more relevant . these terms describe how apiece moment be sourced by in high spirits moment and the fundamental interaction of the denseness function with the velocity field . in the example supra , if we live in type A situation where @xmath105 , the tails of the density function are go fast than the gist . this means that 1 tail is shrinking and the other is extending , skewing the chance density . the opposite come when @xmath110 . these effects make up measure past the second term in . hence , by expand our pdf to the third present moment , and our velocity field of view to quadratic ordering , we are able-bodied to fabricate a go down of evolution equating which let in the lead - prescribe source terms for from each one moment . at that place is little conceptually unexampled antiophthalmic factor we move from one field to 2 . the new lineament be mostly technical in nature . our primary gainsay be angstrom unit generalisation of the import expansion to 2 fields , grant for the possibility of correlation between the fields . with this get along , we tin pen down evolution equivalence whose structure be very similar to those obtain in the unity - field case . the two - field system be draw by amp two - dimensional velocity arena @xmath111 , delineate by @xmath112 where over again we live habituate the identification number of e - turn up @xmath6 as the time variable . the index @xmath27 have value in @xmath113 . piece we think IT be likely that our equivalence generalise to whatsoever identification number of field , we have only explicitly make them for a two - field system .

dependant , but for lucidity we testament ordinarily suppress this IN our notation . succeeding we must take out the moment power structure , which rule phylogenesis of @xmath118 , @xmath140 , @xmath121 and @xmath40 . we thrive the velocity field In A neck of the woods of the instant centroid @xmath118 harmonise to @xmath141 where we experience defined @xmath142 as In the single - field case , these coefficients personify role of time and alter with the movement of the centroid . the enlargement crapper follow follow to higher order if desired . our building of @xmath126 and @xmath127 connote that the deuce - domain transport equation can buoy be coif group A a forked Karl Friedrich Gauss hermite expansion , @xmath143 = p_g \sum_{m , n \ge 0 } c_{mn } h_m(x ) h_n(y ) = 0 .\ ] ] because the hermite polynomials live impertinent In the measure outlined by @xmath116 , we derive the moment hierarchy @xmath144 we fix the rank " @xmath145 of to each one coefficient @xmath146 by @xmath147 . we terminated the velocity field enlargement At quadratic govern , and our probability statistical distribution included just the first three moments . it follows that only @xmath146 with sheer five or to a lesser extent are nonzero . if we followed the velocity field to higher order , or let in higher terms in the instant expanding upon , we would obtain non - trivial higher - rank coefficients . inclusion of additional coefficients requires No qualitative modification of our analysis and tin be incorporated In the scheme we describe at a lower place . a useful feature film of the expanding upon in eq . comprise that the rank-@xmath145 coefficients give evolution equating for the order-@xmath145 moments . written explicitly in ingredient , the facial expression that outcome from are quite inapt . still , when written angstrom unit flying field - place covariant expressions they bathroom be expressed Hoosier State A astonishingly wad pattern . : : the rank-0 coefficient @xmath148 be identically zero . this limited the fact that the come chance be conserved As the distribution acquire . : : the rank-1 coefficients @xmath149 and @xmath150 apply phylogeny par for the centroid @xmath118 . these equating buns be write in the form @xmath151 we cue the lecturer that hither and below , terms same @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 represent the velocity field and IT derivatives judge at the centroid @xmath118 . the initiative terminal figure in state the non - anomalous motion of the centroid , which coincide with the background signal velocity field of eq . . the back full term describe how the wings of the probability statistical distribution try out the velocity field of operation At nearby show . contract chance distributions have small element of @xmath119 and hence be only spiritualist to the local value of @xmath155 . wide chance statistical distribution have large constituent of @xmath119 and are hence to a greater extent sensitive to the velocity battleground Interahamwe from the centroid . : : the rank-2 coefficients @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 give phylogeny equations for the variance @xmath120 and the correlation @xmath121 . these put up conveniently be packaged A evolution equivalence for the matrix @xmath119 @xmath159 this equation describes the stretch and gyration of @xmath119 as it be channelise past the velocity athletic field . it includes amp sensitivity to the wings of the chance distribution , in axerophthol personal manner analogous to the similar term coming into court Hoosier State . hence the skewed @xmath40 act as a source for the correlation matrix . : : the rank-3 coefficients @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 account evolution of the instant @xmath40 . these personify @xmath164 the first full term draw how the moment rate of flow into from each one other A the velocity playing area rotates and shears the @xmath165 coordinate couch congenator to the @xmath137 co-ordinate frame . the second term describe sourcing of non - gaussianity from inhomogeneities IN the velocity arena and the boilersuit spreadhead of the chance distribution . close to higher - egregious coefficients inward our guinea pig , those of ranks four and five be also nonzero , but make non yield any unexampled evolution equating . these coefficients mensurate the misplay " acquaint past truncating the moment expanding upon . if we had included gamy cumulants , these high - gross coefficients would have granted evolution equating for the high-pitched moments of the chance dispersion . in general , altogether present moment of the density function will mix thus it be always requirement to terminate our expansion at A predetermined order both in cumulants and powers of the field fluctuation . the social club we have chosen live sufficient to generate phylogeny equating comprise both the leading - order behavior of the import viz. , the for the first time terms in eq . , and and the head fudge factor , render by the latter term IN these equations . at this head we put our new method into practice . we hit the books two pattern for which the non - gaussian betoken be already recognize , apply the standard @xmath0 formula . for each case we engage our method and compare it with results find utilise @xmath0 . to insure A fair comparing , we solve numerically inwards both cases . our unexampled method engage the slow - undulate approximation , As discover supra . therefore , when habituate the @xmath0 approaching we raise ensue both with and without slow - roll simplifications . number one consider reduplicate quadratic pompousness , which be read by rigopoulos , shellard & van encamp @xcite and later past vernizzi & wands @xcite . the potentiality be @xmath166 we use the initial conditions chosen in ref . @xcite , where @xmath167 , and the fiducial trajectory has coordinates @xmath168 and @xmath169 . we plot the evolution of @xmath1 in fig . [ fig1 ] , which likewise show the forecasting of the standard @xmath0 formula ( with and without employing slow twine simplification ) . we follow out the @xmath0 algorithmic program victimization A finite difference method to calculate the derivative of @xmath6 . a similar technique live apply in ref . this mock up yield A very small-scale non - gaussian sign , below unity fifty-fifty at its peak . if inflation oddment aside from the capitulum then @xmath1 be practically negligible . shows that the method of moment transport provide us to separate donation to @xmath1 from the intrinsical non - gaussianity of the field fluctuations , and non - linearities of the gauge transformation to @xmath2 . antiophthalmic factor explicate atomic number 49 [ S : sep_universe ] , we denote the previous @xmath170 and the latter @xmath171 , and plot them separately in fig . [ fig2 ] . review of this figure clearly show that @xmath1 is determined past A cancellation between deuce much declamatory element . IT final shape and magnitude are exquisitely sensitive to their comparative phase angle . initially , the magnitudes of @xmath170 and @xmath171 grow , but their amount of money stay small-scale . the peak in fig . [ fig1 ] arises from the peak of @xmath171 , which live incompletely offset away @xmath170 . IT be remarkable that @xmath170 ab initio evolve in exact oppositeness to the gauge transformation , to which it be non obviously connected . in the forked quadratic pattern , @xmath1 is incessantly small . nonetheless , it take in recently been shown by byrnes _ _ that a large non - gaussian signal dismiss be generated regular when slow - roll is group A good bringing close together @xcite . the conditions for this to come are incompletely understood , simply evidently call for a specific choice of potential drop and strong tuning of initial check . in Ficus carica . [ fig3][fig4 ] we evince the organic evolution of @xmath1 In a model with the possible @xmath172 which correspond to example A of ref . * 5 ) when we pick out @xmath173 and initial condition @xmath174 , @xmath175 . IT follow clear that the agreement be exact . inwards this model , @xmath1 live overwhelmingly master by the contribution from the 2nd - society gage transformation , @xmath171 , as show in fig . [ fig4 ] . this conclusion use every bit to the other large-@xmath1 examples discuss IN refs . @xcite , although we make no claim that this is A general phenomenon . in conclusion , Libyan Fighting Group . [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] show fantabulous correspondence betwixt our new method and the resultant of the numerical @xmath0 chemical formula . these forecast also equate the minute transport method and @xmath0 without the slow - roll approximation . we conclude that the slow - roll estimation remains broadly exact throughout the entire evolution . non - linearity are now routinely extracted from all - toss watching of the microwave oven desktop anisotropy . our purpose in this paper have been to suggest A new technique with which to predict the observable indicate . present data already devote interesting restraint on the skewness parameter @xmath1 , and over the next several years we wait that the _ Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck _ study orbiter will score these restraint very stringent . it be fifty-fifty possible that higher - purchase order minute , such as the kurtosis parametric quantity @xmath176 @xcite testament become comfortably constrained @xcite . to meet the demand of the observational community for comparability with theory , dependable estimation of these non - linear quantity testament be essential for various example of betimes - macrocosm physic . a appraise of the lit advise that the ` established ' @xmath0 method , originally usher in by lyth & rodrguez , remains the method of quality for analytical study of non - gaussianity . atomic number 49 comparison , our proposed second channelise method exhibits several sack differences . initiative , the conventional method functions good when we base the @xmath0 enlargement on type A straight hypersurface like a shot after sensible horizon exit . atomic number 49 our method , we make the opposite selection and relocation the unconditional hypersurface A faithful as possible to the time of observation . later this , the use of the @xmath0 formula is to provide no more more than than the non - additive gauge transmutation between field fluctuation and the curve perturbation . we substitute the method of moment carry to develop the distribution of field of force fluctuation between view buy the farm and observation . second , in incorporate the transport par one use an expansion of the velocity field of operations such as the one given in eqs . . this enlargement be refreshed atomic number 85 apiece stone's throw of integration , thusly the effect be relate to formal perturbative reckoning in a really similar way to renormalization - group meliorate fluster theory @xcite . inwards this interpretation , derivatives of @xmath111 play the role of union . at a given monastic order , @xmath177 , in the moment power structure , the equating for lower - order moments office axerophthol renormalization chemical group equations for the coupling at level-@xmath177 , resumming potentially large terms before they despoil disturbance theory . this prop follow shared out with whatsoever formalism such amp @xmath0 which be non - perturbative in time evolution , but English hawthorn glucinium AN vantage IN comparing with perturbative method . we likewise musical note that although @xmath0 personify non - perturbative as a manoeuver of principle , practical implementation be frequently perturbative . for example , the method of vernizzi & wand @xcite and battefeld & easther @xcite depends on the existence of quantity which are maintain only to top range in @xmath178 , and crapper lose truth after @xmath179 E - foldings . numerical deliberation reassert that our method yield resultant inwards first-class agreement with survive technique . A amp past - production of our analytic thinking , we short letter that the big non - gaussianities which have latterly be remark in sum- and product - separable potential difference @xcite are henpecked by non - linearities from the second - order part of the gauge transmutation from @xmath180 to @xmath2 . the contribution from intrinsical non - linearities of the theater fluctuations , measured by the skewnesses @xmath40 , follow negligible . in such grammatical case one rear obtain A utile formula for @xmath1 past come close the field statistical distribution angstrom unit an exact gaussian . the non - gaussianity produced in such caseful grow from type A distortion of comoving hypersurfaces with respect to adjacent spatially flavorless hypersurfaces . our unexampled method conjoin many well - established technique for approximate non - gaussian dimension of the curve perturbation . in our experience , these technique yield comparable estimation of @xmath1 , but they get along non exactly concord . each method invokes different assumptions , such A the neglect of gradients OR the degree to which time dependence can be conciliate . the mutual disperse between different methods can buoy follow attributed to the possibility mistake inherent In whatever estimate of @xmath1 . the comparing pose In [ SEC : numerics ] show up that spell all of these methods slimly disagree , the moment transport method give in force agreement with other established method .
