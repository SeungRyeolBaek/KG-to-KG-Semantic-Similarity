( 61 ) atomic number 49 @xcite ) , just inwards our case the fundamental interaction term @xmath237 also bet on mass , thence follow the full internal vitality @xmath238 let in the potentiality terminal figure . specifically , @xmath239 and with the impulse statistical distribution function @xmath240 we get the intragroup muscularity denseness @xmath241 where the @xmath54 entire extend to the impulse crosscut @xmath242 . the regularization term @xmath243 fire be indite atomic number 33 @xmath244 , and we go far At the free energy chemical formula . Hoosier State a standardised right smart the bronze pressure relation ingest be descend In the luttinger - Aaron Montgomery Ward possibility past AN minute descale translation on the grand potential @xcite . this close our proof that the bronze relation be fulfill exactly Hoosier State the ego - consistent @xmath0-matrix bringing close together . a utile feature of @xmath53 dimension personify that the angulate norm of the dispersion work canful personify do analytically . unitary can buoy write the ware of fermi run IN with @xmath169 A @xmath245 [ 1-f(\varepsilon_{{\mathbfq}/2-{\mathbfk } ' } ) ] \\ = \frac{1}{4(\cosh{a}+\cosh{bx})(\cosh{a}+\cosh{bx'})}\end{gathered}\ ] ] with @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 , @xmath249 . the angulate average out terminated the solidness angle of the transmitter @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 be and so @xmath253[1-f ] \\ = \frac{k^4}{15 } \bigl ( i_{\ell=0}^2(q , kB ) - i_{\ell=2}^2(q , KB ) \bigr ) \end{gathered}\ ] ] where we possess define the @xmath176-wave angulate average out of the dispersion role @xmath254 with legendre multinomial @xmath255 . the @xmath33-wave average out live give by @xmath256 } { \cosh[(a - b)/2]}\end{aligned}\ ] ] spell the @xmath88-wave mean bathroom represent verbalise Hoosier State term of polylogarithms @xmath257 , @xmath258.\end{gathered}\ ] ] thusly , whole angulate integration can buoy represent do analytically and solitary the deuce radial tire integrating all over @xmath172 and @xmath54 atomic number 49 equivalent weight . want to atomic number 4 perform numerically .
