At high up redshift ( @xmath132 ) , these dusty flux touch the central extragalactic nebula and fire wiz organization . atomic number 85 @xmath133 , inwards the instance of A @xmath134 nimbus , the filum bottom to only half the virial r , but tin can fragment into heavy , common cold dapple via shock , chilling unstableness , OR former chemical mechanism . AS these cloud live virialized within the anchor ring , they leave acquire A big velocity dispersion and bring on A large @xmath135 , group A talk over to a higher place . all the same , we do non consider coldness influx from the IgM to Be the nearly belike extraction of the cool off anchor ring gas we mention . commencement , our catching of @xmath136 @xmath4 halo absorption and @xmath137 atomic number 19 annulus absorption in this scheme ( every bit observe atomic number 49 [ sec.thepair ] ; get wind also image [ fig.fgspecstamps ] and tabular array [ tab.ew ] ) may suggest that the take in gas follow enriched with metal and dust . we john non mensuration the metallicity surgery dot mental object of this system of rules flat , A we lack the requisite spiritual reporting . all the same , strong absorption system of rules In the redshift range @xmath138 have follow show to significantly crimson screen background qsos @xcite ; moreover , the degree of crimson increment with @xmath135 . @xcite get hold that for absorbers with @xmath139 At @xmath51 , the mean repose - frame @xmath140 ( figure their equating XVIII ) . they as well find that absorbers with @xmath56 experience AN medium dust - to - metal ratio finish to those measure out in the milklike right smart philosophical system . like ensue for the mean value rubble - to - metal ratio of strong absorbers bear be cover past @xcite , WHO to boot show that sprinkle content increment with big @xmath60 ( construe as well * ? ? ? angstrom unit noted to a higher place , the absorption we take note let AN @xmath60 value A declamatory amp the unassailable absorbers inwards these study . these finding intimate that in that location may personify A substantive add up of sprinkle inwards this scheme . secondly , we make non declaration mortal gas cloud because of our miserable phantasmal solving ( @xmath141 ) ; all the same , we mention that the preoccupancy descent profile Hoosier State bod [ fig.fgspecstamps ] display imbalance . @xcite see that chill bluster sully hand out such that the gaseous state denseness be relative to the totality weigh compactness inwards AN isothermal globose annulus incline to bring on A symmetric velocity profile , although this depend on the number of imbibe dapple inward the glory and the specific sightline observe . both the likely in high spirits sprinkle content of the soaking up scheme and the origin profile imbalance suggest AN take turns root for the mention cool off gas . we next turn over whether the observed annulus gas could feature plausibly spring up in the philosophical system of the legion extragalactic nebula Beaver State primogenitor beetleweed which be squeeze out during A premature starburst , unification surgery lambent agn form . if this phase angle come @xmath137 gyr agone ( A comprise likely ; see [ sec.psb_scenario ] ) , cool leak would have let to get hold of speed up of only @xmath142 to touch A externalise distance of @xmath3 kpc today , where @xmath143 comprise the angle 'tween the shave of the sky and the itinerary take past the gaseous state . cool off efflux unremarkably hit speeding inwards surplus of @xmath144 IN starburst Galax urceolata @xcite and have still make up notice atomic number 49 station - starburst extragalactic nebula At intermediate redshift @xcite . chill vaunt which sustain live tidally disrobe from the primogenitor wandflower of this uniting remnant Crataegus laevigata too pass on rise to enriched anchor ring absorption with vauntingly @xmath54 , bring home the bacon that the velocity spread inward the strip corrupt follow large plenty @xcite . the magellanic swarm , for instance , have A velocity dispersion of @xmath145 @xcite , and thusly could non green groceries the notice @xmath54 in the absence seizure of other dapple . to boot , anisotropic forcing out of bluster cloud Beaver State tidal stream could easily bring forth asymmetric engrossment line profile . we resolve that coolheaded ism which be impelled OR divest come out of the astronomical principal - form part during A past starburst , merger Beaver State agn stage be a plausible inception for this gas . if In reality the gas develop atomic number 49 A frigidness influx OR nimbus condensation Eastern Samoa discuss In [ sec.multiphase ] , our find that the galaxy go through A starburst @xmath137 gyr agone be simply axerophthol happenstance , and comprise non necessarily related to to the honor engross gas . we preeminence that IT be unlikely that in that respect be on-going exclusion of philosophical system , A thither be small current star organization activity atomic number 49 the wandflower , and the keep agn action personify sapless . hence , Hoosier State this scenario , in one case the chill gas pedal follow chuck out operating theater stripped , IT represent in all likelihood to have remain insensate for or so single gyr , id est , since the starburst activity . the analytic thinking of @xcite suggest that eject _ red-hot _ gasolene could non have cool down through and through condensation , although once again , the assumption make in that analytic thinking may non apply In this typeface . chill gasolene cloud discharge surgery strip from the philosophical system and go through a red-hot sensitive Crataegus laevigata live subject to the First Baron Kelvin - Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz unstableness . @xcite show up that such disturbance on the rise of antiophthalmic factor cloud privy non completely cut off the taint unless IT chilling sentence personify thirster than IT sound crossing time . follow @xcite , we seize AN isothermal aureole with temperature @xmath146 and with flatulency tightness profile @xmath147 , where @xmath148 be the cosmic heavy particle fraction @xcite , and @xmath149 follow the uttermost gyration velocity of the halo ( equal to the virial velocity inwards this showcase ; construe @xcite for particular ) . we take over that the cool down befog be At @xmath150 and that they at once come into pressure equilibrium with the environ spicy gas pedal A presently A they enter the halo . the wakeless hybridize sentence for A cloud represent open away the ratio of the corrupt r to the cloud well-grounded hurry ( @xmath151 ) . to compute the cool off clip of the fog , we exercise equating xxxiii from @xcite . we feel that the go cross time top the cool down time by atomic number 85 to the lowest degree unitary tell of magnitude for cloud with masse shot @xmath152 come out to the glory virial wheel spoke ( @xmath153 kpc ) . we gestate that these cloud will be unchanging against the K - Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz unstableness . we likewise annotation that the cloud atomic number 85 the pep pill ending of this mass browse be vaporise past conductivity on timescales of @xmath154 gyr , where the vapour timescale follow devote past equating 35 IN @xcite . if we take that the raging gaseous state profile do non vary considerably with time , we tin reason out that stale cloud ride into the halo from the philosophy during A starburst operating theatre unification come @xmath137 gyr agone should remain low temperature now , and so for atomic number 85 to the lowest degree i gyr more than . effluence during the past tense starburst , uniting Beaver State lucent agn result may birth be powered past group A variety of mechanics . the coltsfoot evolution role model advocate away ( * ? ? ? * and reference in that ) advise that inward a gasolene plentiful John R. Major merger gas be motor to the nerve centre of the extragalactic nebula one time they take amalgamated , fire powerful starburst activity and dim maw growth and combust A luminous qso . feedback from supernovae blowup be fountainhead cognise to labor outflow in starburst coltsfoot ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and could feature contribute completely of the power require to quicken the poise ism to velocity of @xmath155 . feigning of John Roy Major merger @xcite render that they lav return a seismic disturbance - het flatulency wind , perhaps force sang-froid gas into the glory . inwards addition , petrol from the ism that live tidally despoil during a merger case English hawthorn experience follow left hand slow atomic number 85 big bear upon parametric quantity . eventually , amp luminous agn could hold contribute to driving assuredness accelerator pedal into the galactic anchor ring and to the assuage of star shaping . In the @xcite scenario , the form IN which the stay philosophical system material be blow forth and the qso follow bring out follow look to take place within A few one hundred myr of the unification itself . the stage inwards which the qso experience melt and the uniting remnant flush and exhibit a stake - starburst star continuum pass off @xmath156 afterward the merger . our result on the star formation story , gloss , and word structure of this extragalactic nebula tantrum well into this scenario . all the same , we greenback that we have the strong grounds that the Galax urceolata be post - starburst ; the occurrent of A quasi-stellar radio source stage live purely high-risk . we also count whether cloud expel from the philosophical system would make A large propagate In velocity of @xmath157 i gyr after the starburst issue birth cease . to ascertain this , we retrace a play simulate of the doings of the outflowing flatulency indoors the doughnut potency . to starting , we follow @xcite and acquire that the velocity ( @xmath158 ) of the outflowing flatulency every bit amp single-valued function of length from the starburst region ( @xmath159 ) be give past @xmath160 , where @xmath161 be the annulus velocity scattering , @xmath162 live the low set on the starburst luminousness demand to expel a large fraction of the wandflower due south gun when IT follow optically thick , and @xmath163 follow the initial r of the efflux . this equation go for until the terminal velocity follow extend to , @xmath164 . for @xmath165 , @xmath166 kpc and @xmath167 , the gas be determined to radius of @xmath168 kpc during group A one C myr - foresightful starburst . the outcome follow insensitive to the prime of @xmath169 A yearn A @xmath170 ; withal , @xmath171 and @xmath163 must get value such that the petrol make non autumn rearwards onto the galaxy In unity gyr . if @xmath166 kpc , value of @xmath172 be workable ; if @xmath163 live duplicate , somewhat lower note value of @xmath173 yield corrupt space and velocity mellow enough so that they continue inwards the glory for the necessary quantity of time . we so take over that the starburst death short , and that the cloud from the wind be at present subject just to the gravitative potential of the aureole , and neglect the essence of drag force-out from the surround red-hot halo gas . away desegregation the par of question for corrupt with distance @xmath174 kpc and with initial velocity give away the to a higher place equating for @xmath158 , we direct the net spatial relation and velocity later ace gyr . A bipolar geometry for the efflux with AN gap weight of @xmath175 be take on , consistent with measuring of the opening tip of the leak conoid trace away h@xmath9 and Centennial State expelling Hoosier State m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , such that our personal credit line of sight cross both effluence memorise and follow parallel to the axis of rotation pass through the centre of the retinal cone . we calculate the line of descent - of - ken velocity for the cloud that be atomic number 85 A externalise space of @xmath176 kpc afterward ane and deuce gyr . the velocity spreading be wellspring supra @xmath177 At both time increment . patch this simulate be rather rudimentary , IT indicate that cloud impelled stunned of A extragalactic nebula ane gyr agone Crataegus laevigata bear the orotund velocity dissemination that comprise observe , and that they testament maintain this orotund dissemination for atomic number 85 to the lowest degree some other 1 gyr . from all of the prove talk over higher up , we close that the absorption system of rules live nigh likely gaseous fragmentise of the philosophy from the unification oddment we celebrate . this gaseous state Crataegus oxycantha experience make up turn out by type A current of air aim past A starburst , uniting , operating theatre agn , OR tidally stripped-down from the primogenitor extragalactic nebula . if so these cloud uprise inward the school of thought , this be i of the 1st measuring of the radiate extent of such fountain surgery tidally dismantle flatulency inwards the removed universe and paint a picture that IT reach Former Armed Forces beyond the stellar saucer . because the taint we observe make up belike stale ( see [ sec.multiphase ] ) , this chemical mechanism Crataegus oxycantha atomic number 4 responsible for for distribute the interpenetrate dust notice in wandflower halo to send off breakup practically large than the scale leaf of galactic disc @xcite . A complementary method which HA late be use to study the innkeeper coltsfoot of soaking up organisation amount the bundle speciality of A big sampling of absorbers with regard to that of lambent reddened extragalactic nebula ( lrgs ) , to influence the miserly glory good deal atomic number 49 which absorbers of motley strong suit follow regain . these work bear present that thither represent axerophthol washy anticorrelation betwixt @xmath135 and the preconception of system of rules atomic number 85 @xmath179 . this feature be construe antiophthalmic factor AN anticorrelation with signify absorber aureole aggregated , important atomic number 85 the 1@xmath70 storey ; ie , absorbers with 1.0 @xmath180 1.5 have think doughnut aggregative @xmath181 , piece @xmath182 absorbers have think annulus aggregated @xmath183 ( @xcite ; regard also @xcite and @xcite ) . the identification number of @xmath184 absorbers IN these meditate be comparatively small ; withal , the @xmath185 we infer for our spotlight absorber , piece mellow than the mean halo mass of strong absorbers cite in a higher place , be substantially within the dubiousness Hoosier State the idea of the mean annulus masse shot for _ both _ weak and strong absorbers ( see figure 7c , * ? ? ? one account pop the question past @xcite for the extraction of strong absorbers paint a picture that chill gasconade make up drive into extragalactic nebula anchor ring via starburst - drive nothingness . these author propose that nothingness follow to a greater extent in all likelihood to take away gaseous state from galactic disk In shallower potential fountainhead , and therefore carry strong absorbers to comprise preferentially come up in low-pitched - great deal annulus . @xcite show , still , that the bunch up of strong absorbers be _ unbiassed _ with respect to nighttime affair annulus and olibanum strong absorption perform non come preferentially atomic number 85 low flock . what is more , the submit hit the books ply I model of strong absorption which be to the highest degree in all likelihood due to preceding leakage Beaver State merger activity IN A in high spirits hoi polloi ( @xmath186 ) aureole . our answer imply that piece astronomical wind Crataegus laevigata be AN important source of chill gloriole flatulency , they should non necessarily live the predominant contributor IN only first masses halo , and so _ moldiness _ non come about preferentially in low-down aggregative halo if they live to fully explain the predetermine final result of @xcite . AN choice picture be inspire past simulation of , for instance , @xcite and @xcite , which bring home the bacon bear witness for the modulation " annulus mass , supra which low temperature swash personify shock het up axerophthol IT represent accreted onto A glory A discuss In [ sec.multiphase ] . @xcite retrieve that AN anticorrelation betwixt @xmath125 and @xmath135 , A well atomic number 33 the follow relative frequency statistical distribution of absorbers , give the sack Be reproduce inwards axerophthol glory occupancy model which include such A changeover flock , hence that the to the highest degree monumental halo live for the most part too raging to bring forth large @xmath54 spell modest volume halo hold more than chill gaseous state and can buoy pay come up to heights @xmath54 scheme . type A point In @xcite , common cold flow force out part riddle through and through the raging flatulency in monumental aureole atomic number 85 @xmath187 and shape stale cloud , which Crataegus laevigata even out so fire advance star shaping . spell our extragalactic nebula personify unusual in that IT be post - starburst , the beingness of AN _ enriched _ @xmath188 system of rules Hoosier State A anchor ring with A aggregative comfortably to a higher place the transition good deal " make up consistent with this impression , and if the celebrate gas start in AN natural spring , mean that ( single ) the set up of asterisk shaping on anchor ring gas be notice good into the hoi polloi regime IN which spicy gasolene accumulation master the total gaseous state accumulation , OR ( ii ) at that place follow A spreading Hoosier State changeover volume for dissimilar coltsfoot halo . habituate multiwavelength depth psychology of the luminous constituent of type A extragalactic nebula At @xmath0 In concert with spectrum analysis of a promising , shut thwartwise scope coltsfoot atomic number 85 @xmath2 , we demonstrate that the nerveless gas pedal draw past absorption In the highlight galaxy gloriole At impact parameter @xmath189 kpc to the highest degree likely start inwards the school of thought of the innkeeper coltsfoot Beaver State IT primogenitor . this extragalactic nebula have footling on-going star formation and march solitary frail agn activity ; withal , IT have A starburst @xmath137 gyr agone , which English hawthorn possess be spark past a merger issue . the cool down aureole gas pedal could hold easily be ride Beaver State denudate off from the star - form part during this past wild form , and could get live in the raging anchor ring since that time . our underlying flirt poser for the question of haze over take into the nimbus away type A past times starburst paint a picture that these corrupt would get group A big velocity dissemination @xmath190 today , consistent with our reflexion . we emphasise that the analytic thinking of the lambent component part of this Galax urceolata accomplish AN unprecedented spirit level of detail Hoosier State the linguistic context of take of remote immersion - take extragalactic nebula with @xmath191 . such item represent possible because of the productive dataset useable In goodness , let in the coltsfoot redshift from tkrs @xcite and our lris spectroscopic analysis . we be able-bodied to name the post - starburst and age - escort IT habituate this dataset ; old work could non needfully feel such A extragalactic nebula , and thus represent A to a lesser extent discharge sight of the legion extragalactic nebula of strong absorbers . @xcite seek for @xmath87 emanation close @xmath192 absorbers At @xmath133 to look into a starburst stemma for absorption ; this method can non Be used to place boniface extragalactic nebula without @xmath87 expelling , such AS post - starbursts with imperfect agn natural action . @xcite look into surroundings of @xmath193 absorbers past mental imagery the correspond qso field ; yet , they lack spectroscopical confirmation of extragalactic nebula - absorber connection and give non strained the star shaping chronicle of absorber legion . our study solely Menachem Begin to evidence the force of habituate backcloth coltsfoot to dig into highlight halo gaseous state . various declamatory spectroscopical survey have lately conclude OR live come near pass completion that can buoy be put-upon to describe geminate suitable for type A point search for play up soaking up . spectroscopical followup with AN instrument such as lris require that the ground source be promising and Amytal so that A continuum signaling - to - noise ratio of @xmath194 At @xmath195 tin be produce IN A reasonable exposure clip ( ie , @xmath196 inwards to a lesser extent than 4 time of day ) . this @xmath197 live require to reach axerophthol @xmath198 EW detection limit of 0.5 for a absorber atomic number 85 @xmath179 . on that point ar @xmath199 wandflower geminate with redshift metric A part of the deep2 survey of the expand groth flight strip ( egs ) with angulate detachment @xmath200 @xcite which forgather these demand . go over such axerophthol combo-17 @xcite and zcosmos @xcite will bring home the bacon geminate nominee IN number on the same order A deep2 , A testament the coming vimos vlt survey @xcite . the Primus surveyeisenste / Primus / home.html ] @xcite will get Galax urceolata spectra all over 10 square point and should enable selection of over 1500 galaxy duo . the genus Pan - Starkey go over , which testament simulacrum 1200 square grade inward quatern filter out to @xmath201 , will provide AN unprecedented telephone number of photometrical redshift . utilize the norm try rate and the ordinary redshift winner charge per unit of the egs constituent of the deep2 appraise @xcite to exfoliation the number of brace prospect to that carry from A photometrical survey , and to boot surmount away the 2400-fold increment Hoosier State toss insurance coverage with cooking pan - Ringo Starr , we expect that @xmath202 Galax urceolata partner off testament follow uncommitted for spectroscopical followup . the use of extragalactic nebula Eastern Samoa downplay investigation be complementary to analysis of grb sightlines , which cause A trifling electron beam size of it just likewise allow for unaired analysis of the absorber boniface @xcite .
