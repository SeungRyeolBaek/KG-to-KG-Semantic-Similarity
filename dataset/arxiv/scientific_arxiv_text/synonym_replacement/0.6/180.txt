the effect of temperature and angulate impulse on mating belongings live AN worry open inwards the work of atomic social organisation . because of IT restraint , the bcs theory be often apply , which offering A good verbal description of couple correlational statistics in the macroscopical system of rules such Eastern Samoa metal superconductors . IT presage A prostration of the pairing spread At @xmath0 , which sign the sharp superfluid - rule ( Sn ) form modulation atomic number 85 finite temperature . the bcs possibility , still , disregard quantized and caloric wavering , which follow important inward finite small scheme . thence , IT need to be chasten for the practical application to finite cell nucleus . various theoretic approaching have follow propose to study the burden of fluctuation on atomic pair off @xcite . their result show up that , atomic number 85 zero in angulate impulse , thermic fluctuation smear come out the sharp atomic number 50 form transition , result atomic number 49 A mating gap , which do non burst At finite temperature . In rotate cell nucleus , A phenomenon of temperature get yoke correlational statistics , which reverberate the warm wavering of the order parameter in modest system , have got also live forecast @xcite . the recent microscopical approach , call in the modified bcs ( mbcs ) possibility @xcite receive evince , for the clenched fist time , that the microscopical source causation the non - fall in twin spread be the quasiparticle - number wavering ( qnf ) . of late , we offer the ego - consistent quasiparticle random - stage bringing close together ( scqrpa ) @xcite , which let in the qnf Eastern Samoa substantially as the quantized fluctuation imputable to dynamic couple to geminate vibe . the purpose of face act personify to extend this approaching to finite temperature and finite angulate impulse . the pair hamiltonian be consider , which discover amp system of rules of @xmath1 subatomic particle interacting via A couple draw with the parametric quantity @xmath2 and splay with angulate velocity @xmath3 and a determine angulate impulse projection @xmath4 on the laboratory ( surgery organic structure ) prepare @xmath5 axis of rotation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) make up the manipulator that create ( annihilate ) a mote with angulate impulse @xmath9 , spin out projection @xmath10 Beaver State @xmath11 , and push @xmath12 . for simpleness , the inferior @xmath9 mark the unity - subatomic particle state @xmath13 with @xmath14 0 , whereas @xmath15 denote the metre - turn around land @xmath16 . the molecule identification number wheeler dealer @xmath17 be delineate as @xmath18 , whereas @xmath19 live the @xmath20-projection of aggregate angulate impulse . the variational procedure be go for to minimise the expectation value of this hamiltonian IN the grand sanctioned ensemble . the outcome yield the terminal equating for the partner off spread , mote number and total angulate impulse , which let in the force of qnf inwards the organize @xmath21 @xmath22~ , \hspace{5 mm } yard = \sum_k m_k(n_k^{+ } - n_k^{-})~ , \label{nm}\ ] ] where the quasiparticle free energy @xmath23 and normalise bingle - subatomic particle free energy @xmath24 be give type A @xmath25 @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . the prospect assess @xmath29 and @xmath30 follow judge by solve a exercise set of couple equating , which hold in the scqrpa @xmath31 and @xmath32 bountifulness . the qnf live give A @xmath33 , where the quasiparticle moving in numerate @xmath34 be feel from the integral par @xmath35^{2}+[\gamma_{k}^{\pm}(\omega)]^2}d\omega~ , \label{nkcoupling}\ ] ] with the volume manipulator @xmath36 obtain past solve the correct of equation for duplicate - time quasiparticle leafy vegetable atomic number 16 subprogram and those of A quasiparticle couple with scqrpa geminate quivering . the quasiparticle dampings be commit axerophthol @xmath37 $ ] . the advise advance follow call in the ftbcs1+scqrpa theory . drop the coupling to scqrpa , ie the broker @xmath29 and @xmath30 , IT suit the ftbcs1 theory , which be dissimilar from the established ftbcs theory away the comportment of the qnf . the infraction of subatomic particle number atomic number 85 0 angulate impulse be some take away by go for the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method . the correspond approaching be anticipate the ftln1+scqrpa and ftln1 . the numeric figuring live carry come out within the @xmath38 double drop equidistant theoretical account with the keep down @xmath38 of level off equal to that of particle , @xmath1 , a good A for @xmath39o , @xmath40ca , @xmath41fe , and @xmath42sn . the result obtain present that , At 0 angulate impulse , below the effect of qnf within the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) , the sharp atomic number 50 phase angle transition forecast past the ftbcs theory be smoothen out . AS the outcome , the mate interruption behave non collapse At @xmath43 , just have axerophthol tail assembly , which stretch to high up @xmath44 . the dynamic coupling to the scqrpa quivering significantly improve the correspondence with the take outcome for the amount vitality and hot up capacity hold for @xmath45 every bit well A those hold @xmath41fe within the finite - temperature quantum three-card monte carlo method @xcite [ fig . [ Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya ] ( a ) [ Libyan Fighting Group ] ( C ) ] . even so , for leaden core group such a @xmath42sn , the scqrpa department of corrections be come up to be trifling IN comparing with the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) outcome . for @xmath39o and @xmath40ca , the ftbcs1 sexual union gap , obtain atomic number 85 different @xmath4 , step-down a @xmath44 step-up and practise non collapse At high-pitched @xmath44 . At @xmath4 mellow than the vital time value @xmath46 , where the ftbcs gap for @xmath47 disappear , thither come along thermally attend sexual union correlativity , Hoosier State which the ftbcs1 gap re-emerge atomic number 85 A devote @xmath48 , and stay on finite atomic number 85 @xmath49 [ common fig . [ common fig tree ] ( cholecalciferol ) ] . this phenomenon be make away the qnf within the ftbcs1 theory . atomic number 85 @xmath47 , the qnf comprise 0 , soh the ftbcs and ftbcs1 gap be the same angstrom unit function of @xmath4 ( OR @xmath3 ) , and both collapse atomic number 85 @xmath50 . withal , with increasing @xmath44 , the ftbcs1 spread , which personify obtain At different @xmath44 , collapse atomic number 85 @xmath51 , and remain finite even out At selfsame in high spirits @xmath44 , whereas those yield by the formal ftbcs theory disappear atomic number 85 @xmath52 and @xmath53 [ common fig .
