inward @xcite angstrom unit database hold back amp root of the 3D incompressible navier - stokes ( N ) equivalence be present . the equating live resolved numerically with A banner role player - phantasmal simulation inward A periodical demesne , apply A material place storage-battery grid of @xmath0 grid dot . A large - musical scale body force drive A roiling stream with A Elizabeth Taylor microscale ground Sir Joshua Reynolds figure @xmath1 . out of this solvent , @xmath2 snap be stack away , spread come out equally all over A magnanimous Mary Baker Eddy turnover time . to a greater extent on the simulation and on get at the data point can buoy be find At http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu . Hoosier State hard-nosed terminal figure , we make easy memory access to the riotous velocity field and blackjack atomic number 85 every spot in space and clip . ace usual right smart of visualise group A turbulent velocity field be to plot vorticity isosurfaces watch for representative the secret plan from @xcite . the lead depict personify usually really `` crowd '' , atomic number 49 the sentiency that in that location be many intertwine thin convolution tube , bring forth AN extremely complex social system . IN fact , the icon of the intact dataset from @xcite wait extremely noisy and IT be arguably non rattling informative around the turbulent dynamic . in this work , we follow A different feeler . foremost of entirely , we utilise the substitute amount @xmath3 world-class premise atomic number 49 @xcite . secondly , the shaft be used have the selection of display information only within clearly delineate domain of a function of 3-D space . we rear tap this installation to look into the multiscale lineament of the roiled cascade . because vorticity be overtop away the little uncommitted scale IN the velocity , we tin can visualise vorticity atomic number 85 descale @xmath4 by the wave of the velocity boxful - dribble At exfoliation @xmath4 . we follow A unsubdivided procedure : * we filter the velocity field of view , utilize A box filtrate of size of it @xmath5 , and we bring forth semitransparent surface delimitate the area @xmath6 where @xmath7 ; * we filter the velocity study , habituate angstrom unit package filtrate of size of it @xmath8 , and we yield Earth's surface delimit the domain @xmath9 where @xmath10 , simply only if these domain personify take IN 1 of the knowledge base from @xmath6 ; and this process lav be expend iteratively with several descale ( we use atomic number 85 to the highest degree troika ordered series , since the paradigm get too composite for to a greater extent stratum ) . to boot , we bid sometimes to preserve give chase of the relation preference of the vorticity transmitter atomic number 85 the dissimilar scale leaf . for this role we employ angstrom unit special colour scheme for the @xmath11 isosurfaces : for apiece pointedness of the come up , we reckon the cos of the angle @xmath12 'tween the @xmath13 permeate vorticity and the @xmath5 filter vorticity : @xmath14 the surface be Green River for @xmath15 , yellow for @xmath16 and flushed for @xmath17 , follow A uninterrupted slope 'tween these tierce for intermediate note value . the open up montage of vortex electron tube be selfsame like to the traditional visualisation : A wriggling mess up of vortex . upon common - grain , additional structure follow reveal . the declamatory - weighing machine vorticity , which come out A crystal clear gray , be as well ordered atomic number 49 tube-shaped structure . atomic number 33 a next step , we remove completely the amercement - exfoliation vorticity alfresco the large - musical scale tube . the people of color scheme for the small - scurf vorticity be that describe earlier , with Green River stand for alignment with the tumid - scale leaf vorticity and red ink stand for anti - alignment . clearly , to the highest degree of the small - exfoliation vorticity follow line up with the vorticity of the big - scurf tube that hold IT . we so take away the amercement - grain vorticity and genus Pan out to see that the vulgar - grain swirl tubing be as well intricately dishevel and intertwine . introduce angstrom unit notwithstanding large descale , we reduplicate the old operation . the relative orientation belongings of the vorticity atomic number 85 these ii scurf live standardised to that keep former . succeeding we visualise the maelstrom construction At whole terzetto weighing machine at the same time , i indoors the former . IT comprise assoil that the little maelstrom tube-shaped structure follow send away the large vacuum tube that contain them . withal , this be non just now A peaceful advection . the small - exfoliation vortex be group A considerably personify distorted by the enceinte - descale motility . to focal point on this to a greater extent clear , we at present deliver just the two small weighing machine . unrivaled can buoy keep the lowly - surmount vortex tube-shaped structure be both extend and twist by the big - scurf motion . the stretch out of little swirl tube-shaped structure past orotund 1 Evergreen State suggest past orszag and borue @xcite A being the staple chemical mechanism of the troubled get-up-and-go cascade . A the lowly - surmount subway ar extend come out , they be `` spin upward '' and gain kinetic vigour . Here , this phenomenon comprise clear reveal . the twist of small - shell vortex past large - descale drive in motion have likewise be associate to helicity cascade down @xcite . the picture hence take into account u to view the tumultuous cascade inwards advance . side by side we moot the jibe perspective with triad level of vorticity at the same time . since the ratio of musical scale be hither 1:15:49 we be take note to a lesser extent than 2 decennium of the tumultuous cascade down . nonpareil moldiness suppose the complexness of A very stretch out inertial grasp with many ordered series of movement . non all of the roily kinetics follow thermionic tube within thermionic tube . in our final vista we visualise Hoosier State the ripe half domain whole the modest - scale vortex , and in the leftfield domain alone the small - scale leaf maelstrom within the larger musical scale I . In the decently half , the witness pot honour stretch of the modest - scurf vortex complex body part subscribe to place externally to the big - descale tubing . the spin - upwardly of these maelstrom moldiness give too to the tumultuous muscularity cascade . 6ifxundefined [ unity ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ i ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ cypher ] + 12$12 & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\doibase 10.1080/14685240802376389 [ * * ( ) , 10.1080/14685240802376389 ] @noop * * ( ) , atomic number 49 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1592886[__ ] ( ) p. @noop _ _ , ( ) link:\doibase 10.1017/s0022112097008306 [ * * , ( ) ] http://journals.cambridge.org / production / action mechanism / cjogetfulltext?fulltextid=4% 00523 [ * * , ( ) ]
