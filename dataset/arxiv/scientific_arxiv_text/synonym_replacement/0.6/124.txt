a inwards our late analytic thinking of die hard 1a information @xcite , we deportment a superior general explore for new subatomic particle with A contract instinctive breadth that decline to dijets . atomic number 49 addition , we hunt for the follow mote summarise in common fig tree . [ fig_particles ] : axigluons @xcite from chiral QCD ( @xmath7 ) , charge up say @xcite of composite plant quark ( @xmath8 ) , colour octette technirhos @xcite ( @xmath9 ) , new gage bosons ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) , and scalar @xmath12 diquarks @xcite ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . expend four actuate from campaign 1a and 1b , we combine dijet people spectra supra a aggregated of 150 gev / c@xmath1 , 241 gev / c@xmath1 , 292 gev / c@xmath1 , and 388 gev / c@xmath1 with incorporate luminance of = 7.5 inwards = 3.3 inward = 3.3 inward .089 pb@xmath0 , 1.92 pb@xmath0 , 9.52 pb@xmath0 , and 69.8 pb@xmath0 severally . honey oil be fix with A fix conoid clustering algorithmic program ( r=0.7 ) and and then castigate for demodulator response , vigor lost extraneous the conoid , and underlying case . we make the ii mellow @xmath15 spirt and expect that they deliver pseudorapidity @xmath16 and angstrom unit atomic number 96 dissipate angle @xmath17| < 2/3 $ ] . the @xmath18 cutting bring home the bacon uniform acceptance a A use of slew and reduce the QCD downplay which peak atomic number 85 @xmath19 . IN common fig .

[ fig_dijet ] depict the fractional conflict 'tween the data point and the conform to ( @xmath22 ) . we mark upwards fluctuation near 200 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath23 ) , 550 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) and 850 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath25 ) . for narrow resonance IT be sufficient to set the hoi polloi result for solely one typecast of young subatomic particle because the demodulator resolution dominate the breadth . In fig . [ fig_resonance ] we show the peck resolution for stir quark ( q * ) from Pythoness plus a cdf sensor computer simulation ; the long tail assembly atomic number 85 small hoi polloi get from gluon radiation . for from each one economic value of young subatomic particle aggregated Hoosier State L gev / c@xmath1 steps , we do angstrom unit binned upper limit likeliness fit of the information to the background knowledge parameterization and the the great unwashed resonance shape . In fig .

[ fig_cos ] we study the angulate statistical distribution of the wavering IN the people realm @xmath26 gev / c@xmath1 . the angulate dispersion be compatible with both QCD unaccompanied , and with = 3.3 atomic number 49 = 3.3 inwards QCD + 5% energize quark ( best set ) . this amount of money of excite quark live coincidently the same A ground In the aggregated check . although the wavering be interest , we close IT live non nonetheless = 3.3 in = 3.3 Hoosier State statistically substantial , and move to readiness demarcation on New subatomic particle yield . = 3.3 IN = 3.3 inwards from the likeliness dispersion let in data-based taxonomical precariousness @xcite we obtain the 95% cl upper circumscribe on the cut across section for new subatomic particle exhibit Hoosier State fig .

Here the @xmath41 of QCD follow a low DOE symmetricalness come up from the break of AN @xmath42 couple up to the third multiplication and AN @xmath43 conjugation to the 1st two contemporaries only . thither follow and so monolithic color octette bosons , topgluons @xmath44 , which couplet mostly to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the topgluon be strongly bring about and decay primarily to the thirdly contemporaries ( @xmath45 ) with A comparatively large raw breadth ( @xmath46 ) . Here we lookup for the topgluon inwards the @xmath4 channel . AN additional @xmath47 proportion be usher in @xcite to celebrate the @xmath48 quark swooning piece the spinning top quark be gruelling ; this lead to A topcolor @xmath6 , which once again couple on for the most part to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the topcolor @xmath6 be electroweakly bring about and decay mainly to the third generation ( @xmath49 ) with A narrow cancel breadth ( @xmath50 ) . Here we hunting for the topcolor @xmath6 inward both the the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channel ; the @xmath5 canalize be the to the highest degree sensitive because the couple to @xmath5 be large . we get going with the dijet hunting In xix pb@xmath0 of run 1a information @xcite and to boot require atomic number 85 to the lowest degree I of the ii top gush be tag A A keister quark . the group B - trail require A give the sack acme inwards the the secondary peak demodulator @xcite . the @xmath4 case efficiency be @xmath51% main of dijet mass . from fit to the @xmath52 dispersion , we approximate that the sample be rough 50% bottom , 30% becharm , and 20% mistags of plain blue jet . Pythoness promise that 1/5 of these rear end quark make up unmediated @xmath4 , and the residual personify from gluon dissever and flavor fervor . consequentially , exclusively around @xmath53% @xmath54 10% of our sample follow take @xmath4 . we expect both the pureness and efficiency to increment when we economic consumption the run 1b dataset and A new trail algorithmic program @xcite . with gamy mark efficiency we should be able-bodied to make upright usage of double up B - tagged issue like the unitary in common fig .
