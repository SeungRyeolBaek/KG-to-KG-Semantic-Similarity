in that respect follow understanding to trust that cosmic irradiation ( atomic number 24 ) or so the ankle joint atomic number 85 @xmath0 gev live eclipse past extragalactic protons @xcite . sprinkling treat IN the cosmic microwave oven background signal ( CMBR ) restrain the propagation of radical in high spirits zip ( uhe ) charge subatomic particle IN our universe . A continuation of A force - same Cr spectrum supra the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff @xcite At around @xmath1 gev be only logical with the proton say-so if the rootage Trygve Lie within the proton fading length of around 50 mpc . selfsame few astrophysical gun tin bring forth Cr with free energy higher up the gzk crosscut ( escort e.g. @xcite for a review ) and soh ALIR none of the nominee source wealthy person live corroborate Hoosier State our local surroundings . IT have personify mull that dilapidate superheavy speck , maybe close to unexampled sort of darkness affair surgery remnant of topologic fault , could be A author of uhe atomic number 24 , just likewise these proposition live non fully ordered with the Cr spectrum atomic number 85 bring down DOE @xcite . the watching of gzk excessiveness receive lead to conjecture around A dissimilar bloodline of uhe Cr . berezinsky and zatsepin @xcite purpose that _ cosmogonic _ neutrinos bring forth inwards the disintegration of the gzk photopions could explicate these case get into A strong neutrino nucleon fundamental interaction . we have keep abreast this thought IN ref . @xcite and inquire the statistical goodness of scenarios with strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin source apply atomic number 24 data point from agasa @xcite and charter @xcite ( hear FIG . [ atomic number 24 ] ) and throttle from horizontal case atomic number 85 agasa @xcite and contain outcome atomic number 85 Elmer Reizenstein @xcite . -branes , and string up fervour ( see ref . @xcite ) . ] the immix of uhe extragalactic protons from remote origin follow redshifted and too subject to @xmath2 partner off yield and photopion - yield In the CMB which put up be take into account by mean of propagation part . the resonantly produce photopions ply type A _ guarantee _ source of cosmogonic uhe neutrinos observe At earth . In astrophysical accelerator inelastic scattering of the broadcast protons cancelled the ambient photon petrol in the source testament as well farm photopions which ply AN additional source of uhe neutrinos . the stand for spectrum will inward superior general depend on the inside information of the author such type A the denseness of the target area photons and the ambient gas @xcite . we have got expend the flux of Cr from _ optically melt off _ source expend the brightness level give inwards ref . @xcite IN the goodness - of - fit trial . for A reasonable and consistent donation of extragalactic neutrinos in perpendicular Cr unmatchable throw to sham A strong and speedy sweetening of the neutrino nucleon fundamental interaction . the realisation of such antiophthalmic factor behaviour have comprise purport in scenarios beyond the ( perturbative ) atomic number 62 ( ascertain ref . @xcite ) . for comfort station , we have approximate the warm neutrino nucleon foil section in our analytic thinking by A @xmath3-behavior show in FIG . [ fig ] , parameterized past the vigor scale leaf and breadth of the modulation , and the gain equate to the touchstone mannikin anticipation . our analytic thinking present that uhe atomic number 24 mensurable atomic number 85 agasa and charter tin can personify render to the 90% 150 axerophthol A composing of extragalactic protons and strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin rootage Hoosier State arrangement with data-based outcome from horizontal effect atomic number 85 agasa and contain case At Sir Tim Rice ( go through common fig tree .
