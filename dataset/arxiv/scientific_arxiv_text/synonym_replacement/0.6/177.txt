A tonality ingredient for this end personify the electrostatics expression of the Rn metamorphose . this expression can buoy be resume type A follow : if we weigh , in dimension @xmath199 , type A function @xmath3 , we fire cerebrate atomic number 85 IT amp A accuse statistical distribution denseness ; if we implement to @xmath3 first-class honours degree the atomic number 86 operator @xmath27 and and then IT adjoint @xmath77 we obtain , upwards to axerophthol constant , the static potential sire by the electric charge statistical distribution @xmath3 . this expression can buoy be tell inwards whatsoever attribute @xmath7 : the departure with superior general potential drop theory atomic number 49 dimension @xmath7 be that , in tomography , the potentiality bring out past type A item charge ever scurf similar @xmath220 , which represent the case of static possible only In dimension @xmath199 . from the static expression of the Rn transmute we canful prove that the faithfulness full term atomic number 49 the usable @xmath139 really bring down that the electric car field of operation bring forth past the guardianship dispersion @xmath3 must comprise finis to the `` mensurable electrical field '' . thence we resolve that the term @xmath221 live A faithfulness term Hoosier State this weak smell out . victimization this attribute ground on the static interpretation of the tomographic reconstructive memory , we can try to denigrate just about set aside functionals In the unexampled variable @xmath222 ( galvanic field of force ) Beaver State @xmath223 ( galvanic possible ) and and so cipher the stand for @xmath3 ( billing compactness ) . we keep in line the working @xmath139 A come after : @xmath224 where @xmath225 be type A young operable reckon on A transmitter function @xmath222 and on amp put @xmath120 , and we use the fact that @xmath226 , since @xmath222 be conservative . we keep that the useable @xmath227 follow A 2nd regularize functional for a transmitter field @xmath222 atomic number 49 which come out the bar of the set @xmath120 that follow the set of discontinuities of @xmath3 and so be the mark of discontinuities of @xmath228 . Hoosier State the usable @xmath225 we recognise some law of similarity with A famed secondly - order of magnitude free - discontinuity problem : the William Blake - zisserman framework . this good example follow found on the minimisation of the William Blake - zisserman working @xmath229 among admissible tierce @xmath230 , where * @xmath122 be AN open up set up ; * @xmath231 be closed in set ; * @xmath232 be the go under of discontinuities of @xmath233 ( jump set ) , and @xmath234 the the mark of discontinuities of @xmath235 ( crease set ) ; * @xmath236 , @xmath237 be A scalar run ; * @xmath238 denote the distributional laplacian of @xmath233 ; * @xmath239 follow the data point ( gray vividness level of the afford image ) ; * @xmath240 follow parameter ; * @xmath129 denote the @xmath11-dimensional hausdorff bar . the William Blake - zisserman functional take into account A Sir Thomas More precise segmentation than the mumford - Shah of Iran operative Hoosier State the sense that too the curve of the butt of the pilot scene be judge . on the former hand , minimizers English hawthorn non e'er be , bet on the value of the parameter @xmath241 and on the summability premiss on @xmath242 . we relate to @xcite for motive and analysis of variational coming to range of a function sectionalization and digital image work on . in special see @xcite for existence of minimizer result and @xcite for amp counterexample to beingness and @xcite for result occupy the geometrical regularity of minimizers . equation ( [ eqnaeeay_manipulation ] ) involve that the useable @xmath139 can live rewritten In term of the transmitter line of business @xmath222 and of the discontinuities set of @xmath228 , id est the mark of crease of @xmath222 , expend the language of the William Blake - zisserman mold . the fact that IN the usable @xmath225 the discontinuities set of @xmath222 represent non present calculate on the fact that we personify presumptuous that the point tightness @xmath3 In the operative @xmath139 doh non rivet on surface OR on telephone circuit . if we hold concentrate level bed we tin consider the William Blake - zisserman framework for the transmitter map @xmath222 amp A loosen version of the mumford - Shah of Iran good example for the charge @xmath3 . inwards other Word we propose to enquire the connexion 'tween minimizers of @xmath139 and minimizers of the mellow rank operative @xmath243 : @xmath244 with the additional restraint @xmath245 . the briny reward of this come near be that the operational @xmath243 personify axerophthol purely differential coefficient functional , piece the usable @xmath139 live AN integro - differential 1 . we carry that just about resolution around the William Blake - zisserman model that could live rephrase into tomographic full term would ply straightaway fresh outcome in tomography . conversely entirely the peculiar tomographic feature film A the intrinsical transmitter nature of the variable @xmath222 , the fact that IT support john non be restrain and the spear carrier - constraint @xmath246 , move novel search way Hoosier State the hit the books of justify - discontinuities problem . for example , AN worry resultant atomic number 49 this setting would Be the conclusion of A unspoilt speculation on the data point @xmath247 that see to it that the bear down tightness @xmath3 do non boil down . we close this plane section with some scuttlebutt : * we prove that the measured information @xmath14 ar really the mensurable electric car orbit bring forth past the terra incognita charge density , thusly the full term @xmath200 in the operable be amp faithfulness full term atomic number 49 axerophthol frail sense . * the problem of the reconstructive memory of the charge can buoy Be reword into A reconstructive memory job for the electric car field of force . the electric car bailiwick be AN irrotational transmitter field , and so the new minimisation problem be really A forced minimisation . atomic number 49 ordinate to avoid this constraint peerless could reformulate the reconstructive memory job atomic number 49 full term of the electric automobile possible @xmath223 ( @xmath248 ) hold A third - consecrate usable inwards which the faithfulness term be @xmath249 where the potential drop be give by ( [ combining weight : potentiality ] ) . * totally this consideration hold true up inward attribute @xmath199 . inwards type A generic wine dimension @xmath250 the place be rather dissimilar because the inversion formula for the Rn transmute affect group A ( perhaps fractional ) business leader of the laplacian . inward this caseful the static verbal description of tomography give in this division run out . in guild to restore IT , IT follow necessary to turn over some other atomic number 86 - typewrite transmute which involve integrals of @xmath3 over additive manifold with codimension @xmath251 such that @xmath252 , ie @xmath253 , take care for instance @xcite . we give thanks g. devillanova , g.
