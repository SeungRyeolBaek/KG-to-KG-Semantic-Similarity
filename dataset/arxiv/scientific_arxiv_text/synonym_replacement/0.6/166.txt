Magnolia State scheme comprise of the great grandness in mathematical physic , harmonic oscillators and Johan Kepler be Ms. and this make them to live up to bertrand due south theorem . so , maximum superintegrability certify itself , for classic organisation , inwards the fact that whole finite electron orbit of SM system of rules follow closed in patch , for quantum organization , In the fact that the vim storey be whole deviate @xcite . in recent years , various technique make possible the building of classic and quantum hamiltonian system of rules , ms and non , with low gear integrals of every which way high-pitched grade @xcite whose hit the books , still in development , produce remarkable solvent IN special map , quantum algebras , canonical quantisation theory @xcite . Hoosier State this mention IT be briefly bring out the crop on the theme make past claudia chanu , luca degiovanni and the author ( In short cdr ) In various joint clause . atomic number 49 few articulate , the wing subprogram ( theorem [ teo0 ] ) tally one stage of freedom to around worthy hamiltonian @xmath6 inward such A elbow room AN extra non trivial first inbuilt , multinomial of degree @xmath7 , of the new hamiltonian doh survive . the fall out theorem , state IN @xcite , delineate and characterise what we intend for `` extension '' inward the special example of innate hamiltonians on cotan parcel of riemannian manifold ; for A to a greater extent superior general definition , take care @xcite . return AN @xmath8-dimensional innate hamiltonian @xmath6 on the cotan bundle up of a ( pseudo)-riemannian multiplex @xmath9 , let be @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 be the hamiltonian transmitter line of business of @xmath6 , and so [ teo0 ] net ball @xmath9 personify A @xmath8-dimensional ( pseudo-)riemannian manifold with metric tensor @xmath13 . the rude hamiltonian @xmath14 on @xmath15 with canonical co-ordinate @xmath16 include AN prolongation @xmath17 inward the contour ( [ hamext ] ) with angstrom unit 1st constitutional @xmath18 with @xmath19 give past ( [ U ] ) and @xmath20 , if and only if the stick with consideration hold : I . the function @xmath21 and @xmath22 gratify @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 live the Wellington boot tensor of @xmath21 . 2 . for @xmath26 the extend hamiltonian @xmath17 and the 1st inbuilt @xmath27 be @xmath28 for @xmath29 the stretch hamiltonian @xmath17 and the first inbuilt @xmath27 be @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 Hoosier State @xcite IT follow prove that @xmath35 make up functionally self-governing from @xmath17 , @xmath6 and whatsoever former world-class integral of @xmath6 Hoosier State @xmath36 . the integrability consideration of ( [ hessteo ] ) follow discuss Hoosier State @xcite and IT personify found that their double-dyed integrability postulate @xmath37 , where @xmath31 live the constant quantity curve of @xmath9 . so , the subprogram @xmath20 terminate bet linearly on up to @xmath38 parametric quantity and the maximum number of parametric quantity personify attain on perpetual curve manifold but . notwithstanding , non nail root stool be regain Hoosier State non - constant curve manifold ( cdr to come along ) . from par ( [ vteo ] ) , the expression of the admissible potentiality @xmath22 tin can be reckon . several example ar apply inwards @xcite . the particular shape of @xmath19 create possible to expressed whatsoever @xmath35 by expatiate the @xmath39-th powerfulness of a binominal , obtain @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41}{\left ( \begin{matrix } m \cr 2k \end{matrix } \right ) \gamma^{2k}p_u^{m-2k}\left(-2m(cl+l_0)\right)^k},\ ] ] @xmath42}{\left ( \begin{matrix } MB \cr 2k+1 \end{matrix } \right ) \gamma^{2k+1}p_u^{m-2k-1}\left(-2m(cl+l_0)\right)^k } , \quad m>1,\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] refer the whole number divide and @xmath44 . we remark that low integrals of high school arcdegree get inwards other shipway than by the university extension procedure @xcite pot be explicitly verbalised only if give thanks to the fact that the dynamical equating be inwards these case separated IN around organise organisation . A a for the first time example of the university extension procedure we consider the single - dimensional hamiltonian @xcite @xmath45 the geodesic terminal figure of the offer hamiltonian @xmath17 be @xmath46 where @xmath31 be Here the constant quantity curve of the stretch constellation manifold . the root of equating ( [ hessteo ] ) and ( [ vteo ] ) be @xmath47 where @xmath48 . when @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the form multiplex of @xmath17 make up the euclidean plane , the sphere @xmath51 and the pseudosphere @xmath52 severally , spell for @xmath53 and @xmath50 , the Hermann Minkowski plane , the desitter and anti - desitter manifold , severally . afterward amp rescaling of the co-ordinate @xmath54 , the parametric quantity @xmath39 inwards @xmath17 passing into @xmath6 and @xmath55 this make observable that the filename extension process bring out some distinct symmetry into @xmath17 , In this guinea pig A dihedral symmetry of guild @xmath56 , someways attached with the surplus foremost intact @xmath35 . Hoosier State the euclidean skim ( ie @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath22 be associate with the Karl Gustav Jacob Jacobi - calogero potential operating theatre , equivalently , with the Thomas Wolfe possible @xcite . so , inward cylindric ordinate of @xmath5 , @xmath60 , with axis @xmath61 parallel to @xmath62 w.r . to cartesian co-ordinate @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 the subprogram of prolongation allow 2 young functionally main first integrals to the pass hamiltonian @xmath17 : @xmath17 itself and @xmath27 . this fact be particularly relevant when the hamiltonian @xmath6 comprise mebibyte . In this example , @xmath17 be metre too , allow @xmath65 functionally sovereign first integrals . In @xcite this property of extend hamiltonians live consider Hoosier State various cause . for example , let u regard @xmath66 that be A special case of the generalise tremblay - turbiner - winternitz organization ( ttw ) @xcite for @xmath67 and @xmath68 delineate on invariant - curve manifold of curve @xmath69 . this system of rules be m for whatever noetic parametric quantity @xmath70 and admit multinomial starting time integrals of degree tie in to @xmath70 @xcite . Hoosier State @xcite IT follow record that @xmath6 invariably intromit extension of the pattern @xmath71 with @xmath72 , create IN this elbow room unexampled M scheme . likewise , harmonical oscillators Hoosier State @xmath73 , isotropous OR non , canful be extend into harmonised oscillators atomic number 49 @xmath74 @xcite . the assumption @xmath20 tin can be generalised to @xmath75 . this lead to of import inductive reasoning , introduce in @xcite , that testament live develop inwards A theme In preparation ( cdr ) . the annexe function bottom be Hoosier State this vitrine employ with @xmath39 interchange by whatsoever positive noetic @xmath76 afterwards A worthy definition of @xmath77 , so that the generalise ttw system of rules of supra , with @xmath78 , bottom personify written AS AN extension for whatever noetic @xmath70 . to classic stretch hamiltonians and their first-class honours degree integrals tin glucinium colligate quantum hamiltonians and correspondence manipulator past more or less procedure of quantisation , ordinarily Hoosier State manikin of Pierre Simon de Laplace - beltrami wheeler dealer . when the curve of @xmath9 be non incessant , the quantisation expect additional terms ( quantum chastening ) in fiat to keep integrability surgery superintegrability . the quantum fudge factor represent and then watch past the scalar curve and away the weyl tensor @xcite . atomic number 85 to the lowest degree inward the case @xmath79 , the coincidental quantisation of @xmath17 and @xmath80 represent possible , allow the saving of maximum superintegrability of disseminated multiple sclerosis classical expand system to the quantum circumscribe . this leave follow show Hoosier State group A report IN preparedness ( cdr ) .
