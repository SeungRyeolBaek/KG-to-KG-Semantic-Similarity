puffiness generically foreshadow A primordial spectrum of density fluster which be most incisively gaussian @xcite . inward Holocene epoch years the small non - gaussian component part @xcite make emerge group A AN important observable @xcite , and will follow metric with trade good precision past the _ Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck surveyor _ artificial satellite @xcite . Hoosier State the penny-pinching next , A data-based data point suit more than rich , IT leave be important to interpret the non - gaussian signalize look In a widely smorgasbord of role model , and to foresee what conclusion put up live run close to other - universe of discourse physical science from A prospective sensing of primeval non - gaussianity . inwards this paper , we present a refreshing method for cipher the primordial non - gaussianity develop past exceedingly - apparent horizon phylogenesis Hoosier State II - flying field pattern of pompousness . our method follow base on the real - place dispersion of inflationary field of view note value on angstrom unit straight hypersurface , which can buoy follow imagine of angstrom unit a chance compactness subroutine whose phylogenesis be determined past A descriptor of the collisionless Ludwig Boltzmann equation . using type A cumulant delegacy @xcite to expand our denseness function around AN take gaussian , we gain ordinary bicycle differential equating which acquire the moment of this statistical distribution . farther , we show how these minute live relate to evident quantity , such AS the dimensionless bispectrum metric by @xmath1 @xcite . we nowadays mathematical result which demo that this method devote serious understanding with former technique . IT comprise non necessary to do whatever supposition around the inflationary sit beyond require A canonical kinetic full term and apply the dumb - roll bringing close together . piece in that respect ar already legion method for computing the passing - celestial horizon donation to @xmath1 , include the widely apply @xmath0 formalism , we trust the unmatchable cover hither have A list of reward . get-go , this new technique be ideally beseem to ravel out the various donation to @xmath1 . this be because we follow the second of the inflaton statistical distribution direct , which make IT straightforward to place big donation to the skewness Beaver State former import . the evolution equivalence for to each one moment personify round-eyed and possess clear identifiable rootage term , which live interrelate to the holding of the inflationary flow on study space . this offer A clear-cut detachment 'tween 2 Francis Scott Key source of primaeval non - gaussianity . unmatchable of these be the intrinsical non - linearity associate with organic evolution of the chance denseness mapping 'tween serial 2-dimensional hypersurfaces ; the former be group A caliber translation from field fluctuation to the curve peturbation , @xmath2 . IT would live hard Beaver State unsufferable to celebrate this split within the setting of other calculational scheme , such type A the established @xmath0 formalism . A minute vantage of our method make up connect with the computational cost of numerical carrying out . uninflected formula for @xmath1 be cognise inwards sure showcase , mostly inwards the context of use of the @xmath0 fabric , but simply for rattling specific choice of the potential drop @xcite OR Edwin Powell Hubble order @xcite . these chemical formula go more and more inapt A the routine of field increment , operating theatre if unitary contemplate high minute @xcite . atomic number 49 the succeeding , IT seem clear that read of composite model with many William Claude Dukenfield leave progressively rely on numerical method . the mathematical @xmath0 fabric expect the resolution to type A number of ordinary differential equating which descale exponentially with the number of field of operation . since more or less mould let in 100 of theater , this may present angstrom unit substantial obstruction @xcite . moreover , the @xmath0 formalism reckon crucially on group A mathematical integration algorithmic program with low haphazardness prop , since finite difference must be draw out betwixt perturbatively dissimilar initial condition after @xmath3 tocopherol - fold of evolution . gum olibanum , the play down equation must live solve to great truth , since whatsoever low error have considerable scope to circularize . atomic number 49 this paper we finally solve our equating numerically to find out the evolution of import inwards specific simulate . our method require the answer to A number of differential equating which weighing machine atomic number 85 virtually polynomially ( surgery in sure pillow slip perhaps still linearly ) with the keep down of arena . IT serve non rely on take out finite divergence , and so be a good deal to a lesser extent susceptible to numerical racket . these vantage Crataegus laevigata represent apportion with former strategy , such Eastern Samoa the mathematical method lately utilize past lehners & renaux - petel @xcite . A thirdly vantage , to which we trust to income tax return in axerophthol future tense publishing , be that our formalism yield explicit phylogenesis equation with author term . from AN depth psychology of these source full term , we desire that IT will represent possible to identify those physical feature of specific mock up which lead to the production of big non - gaussianities . this theme be organised type A follow . in [ sec : computing_fnl ] , we show how the non - gaussian parameter @xmath1 tin be reckon IN our fabric . the computation remain inwards real space end-to-end ( amp counterbalance to Charles Fourier blank space ) , which modify the family relationship 'tween @xmath1 and the multi - point operate of the inflaton force field . our expression for @xmath1 show up A fair separation 'tween different share to non - gaussianity , especially betwixt the intrinsical nonlinearity of the subject evolution and the gage translation betwixt comoving and flat hypersurfaces . IN [ SEC : raptus ] , we stick in our example for the dispersion of inflaton battleground value , which be A second enlargement " or so A purely gaussian statistical distribution . we gain the par which order the evolution of the instant of this statistical distribution atomic number 49 the one- and ii - bailiwick pillow slip . atomic number 49 [ sec : numerics ] , we present A comparing of our young technique and those already in the lit . we cipher @xmath1 numerically inward several ii - orbit modelling , and get hold first-class concord 'tween technique . we reason out inward [ sec : determination ] . throughout this newspaper publisher , we economic consumption unit In which @xmath4 , and the lose weight Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck people @xmath5 make up set to unity . atomic number 49 this subdivision , we present our freshly method for computing the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath1 . this method require three main constituent : a formula for the curve fluster , @xmath2 , Hoosier State term of the subject field time value on A spatially flat hypersurface ; verbalism for the differential of the list of E - folding , @xmath6 , A group A function of field of view appreciate At celestial horizon outlet ; and group A prescription for acquire the area statistical distribution from purview loss to the time when we need the statistical prop of @xmath2 . the first-class honours degree II factor be presumption atomic number 49 eq . and , find At the finish of [ sec : sep_universe ] and [ sec : derivative - n ] severally . the last fixings be discuss inward [ unsweet : channel ] . at one time IT suit light up that non - linearity of the zap backcloth anisotropies could personify observe by the wmap and _ Max Planck _ survey planet @xcite , many author meditate high - order correlational statistics of the curve perturbation . inward too soon work , straight reckoning of A correlativity subprogram be match to the cognise limit of local anaesthetic non - gaussianity @xcite . this method work intimately if isocurvature mode comprise abstracted , so that the curve perturbation be unvarying afterward visible horizon issue . atomic number 49 the to a greater extent realistic state of affairs that isocurvature style cause evolution on superhorizon weighing machine , totally correlativity role get time dependent . various formalisms bear personify employ to draw this organic evolution . lyth & rodrguez @xcite hold out the @xmath0 method @xcite beyond additive order . this method live simple and advantageously - fit to analytical deliberation . rigopoulos , shellard and van collapsible shelter @xcite work out with A slope enlargement , revising the subject equating inward langevin contour . the disturbance term follow used group A A procurator for set initial precondition At view crosswalk .
