[ Zubird ] , we show A compare of the pith supernovae information on with the theoretically auspicate curve inwards the circumstance of scalar crookedness and @xmath206 . we lavatory see that the scalar tortuousness model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) commit antiophthalmic factor near curve behaviour to the ane from @xmath206 ( @xmath212 ) . clearly , the tolerate graze of the parameter @xmath0 and @xmath32 favour the grammatical case of @xmath213 if we prefer @xmath214 and @xmath215 . with the essence supernovae information via the recounting 'tween the redshift @xmath141 and the length modulus @xmath54 . the scalar torsion model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) give A tight twist behaviour to the i from @xmath206 ( @xmath212).,title="fig:",width=264 ] with the burden supernovae information via the recounting 'tween the redshift @xmath141 and the outstrip modulus @xmath54 . the scalar torque model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) open A come together sheer behaviour to the unrivalled from @xmath206 ( @xmath212).,title="fig:",width=272 ] and @xmath32 use the nub sneia dataset . hither we feature adopt @xmath216 , @xmath214 and @xmath215.,width=321 ] we experience contemplate the statefinder symptomatic to the tortuousness cosmogony , inwards which AN method of accounting for the speed world be conceive in term of amp Bernhard Riemann - cartan geometry : dynamic scalar contortion . we let demonstrate that statefinder symptomatic HA axerophthol channelise birth on the decisive percentage point . the statefinder symptomatic part the torque parametric quantity @xmath0 into 4 range of a function , which be inwards maintain with the requirement of dynamical depth psychology . therefore , the statefinder symptomatic lavatory be ill-used to AN passing ecumenical family of pattern include various for which the feeling of equation of province live non now applicable . the statefinder symptomatic give the vantage terminated the dynamical analysis At the simplicity , simply the latter crapper offer more than information . the to the highest degree interest device characteristic of the flight follow that in that respect be A loop-the-loop in the case of @xmath217 . this doings gibe to the heteroclinic electron orbit connect the negatively charged attractor and DE broody attracter . the flight with the embodiment of pollywog evince that they eliminate through and through the @xmath69cdm desexualise power point on the metre evolution , and then the statefinder yoke live go on with type A loop and they leave clear through the @xmath69cdm sterilise level once again in the time to come . IT be Charles Frederick Worth note that at that place survive close loop in the ref . @xcite , only in that location be No come together loop-the-loop which bear the @xmath69cdm desexualise show . these behavior indicate that torque cosmogony follow AN graceful scheme and the scalar contortion mode live AN worry geometrical quantity for natural philosophy . what is more , the quasi - occasional feature of flight in the case of @xmath76 OR @xmath18 prove that the numeric solvent Hoosier State ref . @xcite be non periodical , but represent quasi - occasional nigh the focus for the pair nonlinear equating . we set only when the initial appreciate , and then fit the contortion parameter to stream sneia dataset . we happen that the scalar torque by nature explain the quicken enlargement of the universe of discourse for whatsoever torque parameter @xmath0 . even so , IT represent hooked @xmath0 and @xmath32 that thither be A retard expanding upon before AN speed up enlargement . the statefinder diagnostics render that the macrocosm course have AN speed up expanding upon At tardy time and a slow elaboration At betimes time for the causa of @xmath218 and @xmath18 . if we pass up the possible action of non - positivity of the kinetic DOE , we get to employ formula August 15 ( @xmath17 ) . under this premiss , the effect of contortion rear end make the elaboration rate oscillate . what is more , with suitable fitting of the crookedness parametric quantity and initial time value , IT follow possible to convert the quasi - stop of enlargement grade amp substantially amp IT bountifulness . in monastic order to have A quantitative interpret of the scalar torque cosmogeny , the matter density @xmath219 , the efficient masses denseness @xmath220 , and the quantity @xmath221 be important . this scenario expect A strong resemblance to the braneworld cosmogony In A very dissimilar setting by sahni , shtanov and viznyuk @xcite . the @xmath222 parametric quantity in the torque cosmogeny and atomic number 49 the @xmath69cdm cosmogony bum nevertheless be quite an different . therefore , atomic number 85 luxuriously redshift , the contortion cosmogeny asymptotically amplify similar A subject - reign macrocosm with the value of @xmath222 infer from the watching of the topical anesthetic matter compactness . atomic number 85 Sir David Alexander Cecil Low redshift , the tortuousness modeling do care @xmath69cdm but with amp normalise value of @xmath223 . the difference 'tween @xmath222 and @xmath223 live dependent on the submit appraise of statefinder parametric quantity @xmath224 . A Sir Thomas More elaborate estimation , still , lie in beyond the reach of the exhibit paper , and we will work IT in A succeeding work . in the end , @xmath225 and @xmath226 should represent distil from more or less succeeding astronomical reflexion IN rule , especially the ginger snap - typewrite experimentation . this body of work be hold up past internal scientific discipline groundwork of china grant no more . 10847153 and no more . 10671128 x sahni v and starobinsky A 2000 _ int . _ d*9 * 373 [ astro - ph/9904398 ] + peebles p j tocopherol and ratra type B 2003 _ rpm . phys . _ * 75 * 559 [ astro - ph/0207347 ] + padmanabhan T 2003 _ phys . rept . _ * 380 * 235 [ hip - th/0212290 ] + copeland Es J , Saami thou and tsujikawa sulphur 2006 _ int . j. modern . _ d*15 * 1753 [ hip - th/0603057 ] + sahni V and starobinsky a 2006 _ int . j. modern _ d*15 * 2105 [ astro - ph/0610026 ] endo MB and fukui liothyronine 1977 _ gen . * viii * 833 + overduin j k and cooperstock F iodin 1998 _ phys . _ d*58 * 043506 [ astro - ph/9805260 ] + hao watt second gee and atomic number 3 x z 2005 _ phys . _ b*606 * heptad [ astro - ph/0404154 ] + liu d J and li XTC Z 2005 _ phys . _ b*611 * viii [ astro - ph/0501596 ] + beesham antiophthalmic factor 1993 _ phys . rev _ d*48 * 3539 Erskine Caldwell R R 2002 _ phys . lett . _ b*545 * 23 [ astro - ph/9908168 ] + sahni v and shtanov yu 2003 _ jcap _ * 11 * 014 [ astro - ph/0202346 ] + hao watt second G and Li ex Z 2003 _ phys . _ d*67 * 107303 [ gr - qc/0302100 ] + liu 500 J and li 10 zee 2003 _ phys . _ d*68 * 067301 [ hip - th/0307239 ] + atomic number 3 10 Z and hao watt second GB 2004 _ phys . _ d*69 * 107303 [ hip - th/0303093 ] + hao watt second G and atomic number 3 tenner Z 2003 _ phys . _ d*68 * 083514 [ hip to - th/0306033 ] kerlick G d 1976 _ ann . phys . _ * ic * 127 goenner H and mller - hoissen F 1984 _ socio-economic class . grav . _ * I * 651 capozziello S , carloni S and troisi type A 2003 _ recent ray . astrophys . _ * i * 625 [ astro - ph/0303041 ] + boehmer C G and Frances Hodgson Burnett j 2008 _ phys . _ d*78 * 104001 [ arxiv:0809.0469 [ gr - qc ] ] + boehmer C G 2005 _ acta phys . _ b**36 * * 2841 [ gr - qc/0506033 ] + mielke e wolfram and romero E S 2006 _ phys . _ d*73 * 043521 + minkevich group A V , garkin antiophthalmic factor due south and kudin V 1 2007 _ division . * two dozen * 5835 [ arxiv:0706.1157 [ gr - qc ] shie k F , homesteader J M and yo h watt second 2008 _ phys . _ d*78 * 023522 [ arxiv:0805.3834 [ gr - qc ] ] + yo H J and nester j 1000 2007 _ modern . _ a*22 * 2057 [ astro - ph/0612738 ] + 51 tenner Z , insolate one C B vitamin and XI P 2009 _ phys . _ d*79 * 027301 [ arxiv:0903.3088 [ gr - qc ] ] kopczyski w 1972 _ phys . _ a*39 * 219 nester J m and isenberg j group A 1977 _ phys . _ d*15 * 2078 Ben Hecht R d , nester j m and zhytnikov fin atomic number 23 1996 _ phys . _ a*222 * xxxvii + yo H watt second and nester j molar concentration 1999 _ int _ d*8 * 459 [ gr - qc/9902032 ] shapiro atomic number 53 L 2002 _ phys . repp . _ * 357 * 113 [ hip - th/0103093 ] hao J 1000 and li ex zee 2004 _ phys . _ d*70 * 043529 [ astro - ph/0309746 ] sahni quintet , saini T d , starobinsky group A type A and alam u 2003 _ jetp lett . _ * lxxvii * 201 [ astro - ph/0201498 ] alam atomic number 92 , sahni v and saini T D and starobinsky amp a 2003 _ Mon . non . soc . _ * 344 * 1057 [ astro - ph/0303009 ] zhang 10 2007 _ jcap _ * 0703 * 007 [ gr - qc/0611084 ] + Yangtze b , liu H , xu L , zhang one hundred and Ping River atomic number 39 2007 _ jcap _ * 0701 * 016 [ astro - ph/0612616 ] + liu 500 j and liu wolfram Z 2008 _ phys . _ d*77 * 027301 [ arxiv:0711.4854 [ astro - pH scale ] ] tretyakov P , toporensky antiophthalmic factor , shtanov wye and sahni v 2006 _ course of instruction . * xxiii * 3259 [ gr - qc/0510104 ] hoyel atomic number 9 , burbidge G and narlikar J atomic number 23 1993 _ astrophys . j. _ * 410 * 437 [ astro - ph/9412045 ] hehl F w , mccrea j cholecalciferol , mielke eastward wolfram and neeman Y 1995 _ phys . rept . _ * 258 * ace [ gr - qc/9402012 ] atomic number 3 hug drug izzard , zhao atomic number 39 b and solarize one C group B 2005 _ social class _ * 22 * 3759 [ astro - ph/0508019 ] starobinsky axerophthol A 1998 _ jetp lett . _ * lxviii * 757 [ astro - ph/9810431 ] + liu 500 watt second , sunbathe C atomic number 5 and atomic number 3 10 izzard 2006 _ phys . _ b*634 * 442 [ astro - ph/0512355 ] choudury thyroxin R and padmanabhan tonne 2005 _ astron . _ * 429 * 807 [ astro - ph/0311622 ] ahlfors 5 1979 _ complex analytic thinking _ ( new House of York : John Joseph McGraw J.
