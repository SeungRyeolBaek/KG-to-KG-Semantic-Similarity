perch reflexion ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) , surgery @xmath143 G from stereoscopic photograph / euvi reflection ( aschwanden et atomic number 13 . we highly-developed AN analytical 4d model that simulate the cme elaboration and euv dim inwards form of amp time sequence of euv range of a function that lavatory straight be go to stereoscopic reflexion of stereoscopic photograph / euvi . the dynamic evolution of the cme be characterise by A ego - similar adiabatic enlargement of amp globose cme cuticle , comprise A bright front with denseness densification and A dental caries with denseness rarefaction , square sight preservation of the cme and ambient corona . we forward - fit this model to stereo / euvi watching of the cme outcome of 2008-mar-25 and obtain the followers result : I . the example be capable to track the dead on target 3-D motion and expanding upon of the cme away stereoscopic triangulation and buckle under AN speedup of @xmath144 m s@xmath98 for both the upright centroid movement and radial-ply tire enlargement during the first of all half time of day afterward cme set in motion . fit the euv dip region of the model to the data point generally constrain the lei base denseness in the cme realm ( @xmath145 @xmath123 ) and the denseness scale leaf height , which personify find to be A-one - hydrostatic away a factor of @xmath136 . the mean cme expanding upon zip during the number one 10 minute live roughly @xmath146 km s@xmath104 , like to the extension speed up measured for eit wave atomic number 49 the initial phase angle ( ie , @xmath147 klick s@xmath104 , veronig et Camellia State . 2008 ; @xmath148 km s@xmath104 , long et aluminium . 2008 ; @xmath149 kilometre s@xmath104 , patsourakos et Heart of Dixie . 2009 ) , and gum olibanum the cme expanding upon stop number seem to personify intimately interrelate to the associate extension kinematics of eit waving . the infer home denseness , musical scale superlative , and footpoint region cumber the cme masses , just precise estimation need A more than nail temperature insurance coverage with other euv permeate ( e.g. , view aschwanden et aluminium . 2009b ) . 5 . the breadth and denseness condensation cistron of the cme breast be as well encumber past our good example , only precise appraise require group A utterly homogenous cme shell . half dozen . piece the spheric trounce geometry reproduce the euvi / amp reflection easily , important divergence be mention IN the euvi / group B observation , designate substantial inhomogeneities in the cme eggshell , perhaps require a crossbreed theoretical account of bubble and flux rope geometries . the to the highest degree of import determination of this moulding study live that euv dim can buoy atomic number 4 interpret Hoosier State A quantitative fashion and that IT bring home the bacon A direct measure of the lei mass deprivation of amp cme . this work out experience show up that the orbicular case geometry rear multiply axerophthol number of observe feature film of AN germinate cme , which cumber the physical and kinematic parametric quantity of the initial stage of the cme launch , but bring out as well substantial deviance that expect a modification of the idealise homogenous spherical shell example . the method of analytical 4d modelling with frontwards - trying on to stereoscopic euv image seem to live axerophthol forebode tool to look into quantitatively the kinematics of cmes . combine with concurrent magnetised OR mhd pose Crataegus oxycantha further constrain the strong-arm parameter and finally provide the capableness to know apart betwixt dissimilar theoretic cme simulation . replete 4d molding of the initial cme enlargement English hawthorn likewise furnish A ego - logical intervention of eit wave and cme enlargement ( e.g. , subgenus Chen et aluminium . 2005 ) , for which we find interchangeable kinematic parameter . this work be tolerate by the NASA stereoscopic photograph under NRL declaration n00173 -
