[ pdelta ] ( A ) , we lav consider that for squeeze humbled than the trammel squeeze , the binodal surface from the emdyi fundamental interaction be interchangeable to that from the MDI fundamental interaction . this feature imply that the impulse dependance of the correspondence possible have little tempt on the lg form transition inwards red-hot asymmetric atomic thing piece the impulse dependency of the isoscalar single nucleon potential significantly change the surface area of phase angle - coexistence realm for pressing depress than the confine hale . for force per unit area to a higher place the determine pressure sensation , the impulse habituation of both the isoscalar and isovector single nucleon potentiality turn important . Hoosier State sum-up , we experience take the liquid - gas stage modulation in red-hot neutron - rich atomic issue within A ego - consistent thermic mould using ternary dissimilar atomic effectual fundamental interaction , that is to say , the isospin and impulse subordinate MDI fundamental interaction strained past the isospin diffusion data point inwards heavy - ion hit , the impulse - independent mid fundamental interaction , and the isoscalar impulse - qualified emdyi fundamental interaction . atomic number 85 nix temperature , the in a higher place 3 fundamental interaction present the same eos for asymmetric atomic subject . past analyse liquid - gas phase angle changeover Hoosier State live neutron - robust atomic matter with the to a higher place three fundamental interaction , we retrieve that the bound of the stage - coexistence realm be very sensitive to the denseness dependence of the atomic symmetry vigor . A soft balance free energy lead to A high vital pressure and type A big surface area of the stage - coexistence neighborhood . atomic number 49 increase , the region of stage - coexistence region live too see to make up spiritualist to the isospin and impulse dependency of the atomic fundamental interaction . for the isoscalar impulse - dependent emdyi fundamental interaction , A constrictive force per unit area supra which the liquid - gun form changeover tin non submit position get be chance . this act upon be corroborate in parting by the subject instinctive science fundament of China under grant No . 10334020 , 10575071 , and 10675082 , moe of china under labor ncet-05 - 0392 , impress rising - star programme under assignment no more . 06qa14024 , the srf for rocs , sem of Republic of China , the Nationalist China John Roy Major posit canonic search maturation computer program below contract No . 2007cb815004 , the U subject scientific discipline grounding below allot atomic number 102 . phy-0652548 and the explore corporation under grant no more .
