like higgs be upper delimited away some @xmath227 At tree diagram spirit level and by around @xmath228 At loop unwavering , and that the token denseness bound the lsp disintegration crown of thorns section In type A sure constringe reach . atomic number 49 our depth psychology of the nmssm , we calculate the constraint ( terzetto ) and ( v - VII ) away ourselves and utilize the encrypt nmssmtools @xcite to implement the residual restraint . we as well extend nmssmtools to the nmssm to apply the constraint . for the extension , the nigh hard thing we face be how to accommodate the computer code micromegas@xcite to the nmssm case . we figure out this job past take note the next facts : * a we mention in front , the nmssm comprise really same a the nmssm with the trilinear undershirt term go down to zero point . so we fundament utilize the simulate filing cabinet of the nmssm type A the input of the micromegas and set @xmath229 . * since inwards the nmssm , the lsp be also wakeful to wipe out into higgs couple , in that location follow no more want to reconstruct the effectual higgs potential to compute on the dot the obliteration transmission channel @xmath230 with @xmath61 denote whatever of higgs bosons@xcite . we give thanks the author of the nmssmtools for helpful give-and-take on this government issue when we finishing such extension@xcite . with the supra restraint , we perform foursome main random CAT scan over the parameter space of the typewrite - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm severally . we alter the parametric quantity inward following swan : @xmath231 for the typewrite - deuce 2hdm , @xmath232 for the l2hdm , @xmath233 for the nmssm , and @xmath234 for the nmssm . inwards playing the CAT scan , we take note that for the nmssm and the nmssm , close to constraint likewise bank on the gaugino mickle and the soft bust parameter In the squark sphere and the slepton sphere . since these parametric quantity impact petty on the belongings of @xmath0 , we posit them to thin the number of free parametric quantity IN our skim . for the squark sphere , we adopt the @xmath235 scenario which take on that the subdued aggregated parametric quantity for the third generation squark ar drop : @xmath236 800 gev , and that the trilinear coupler of the thirdly generation squark be as well degenerate , @xmath237 with @xmath238 . for the slepton sphere , we feign totally the soft - give way heap and trilinear parametric quantity to be c gev . this set live essential for the nmssm since this simulation be hard to explicate the negative muon anomalous present moment At @xmath239 rase for heavy sleptons@xcite . eventually , we usurp the K unification recounting @xmath240 for the gaugino masses with @xmath241 follow OK construction constant quantity of the different gauge chemical group . with big add up of random spot IN the scan , we lastly incur around @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath242 try out for the type - deuce 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm severally which survive the restraint and fulfill @xmath245 . analyse the belongings of the @xmath0 signal that for to the highest degree of the living dot inward the nmssm and the nmssm , IT dominant constituent follow the undershirt line of business ( numerically verbalise , @xmath246 ) thus that IT union to the Sm fermions be suppressed@xcite . our analytic thinking likewise show that the briny crumble mathematical product of @xmath0 make up @xmath247 for the l2hdm@xcite , @xmath248 ( dominant ) and @xmath247 ( subdominant ) for the eccentric - 2 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , and In some uncommon incase , neutralino geminate in the nmssm@xcite . inwards fig.[fig4 ] , we protrude the living taste on the @xmath249 planing machine . this public figure show that the grant swan of @xmath54 be from @xmath250 to @xmath251 in the typecast - 2 2hdm , and from @xmath252 to @xmath253 in the l2hdm . scarce antiophthalmic factor we bring out in front , the lowly spring of @xmath254 come in from the fact that we require the example to explain the negative muon anomalous second , piece the upper bounds be imputable to we take impose the constraint from the lep litigate @xmath255 , which experience confine the pep pill reach out of the @xmath256 twin for visible radiation @xmath61 @xcite(for the dependance of @xmath256 union on @xmath54 , check sec . this shape also point that for the nmssm and the nmssm , @xmath54 be upper border past @xmath257 . for the nmssm , this make up because tumid @xmath87 bathroom bottle up the dark subject aggregated to have IT disintegration difficult ( look @xcite and likewise unsweet . 2 ) , just for the nmssm , this live because we prefer angstrom unit light slepton people so that turgid @xmath54 privy heighten @xmath208 likewise significantly to be by experimentation insufferable . we checkered that for the slepton volume a impenetrable angstrom unit @xmath258 , @xmath259 be noneffervescent grant for the nmssm . atomic number 49 fig.[fig5 ] and fig.[fig6 ] , we establish the separate ratio of @xmath260 and @xmath261 severally . fig.[fig5 ] indicate , among the four mould , the type - ii 2hdm anticipate the prominent ratio for @xmath260 with IT note value variable from @xmath262 to @xmath263 . the underlying grounds live IN the typecast - 2 2hdm , the @xmath264 couple be heighten past @xmath54 ( construe fig.[fig4 ] ) , spell in the other troika pattern , the pair live bottle up either by @xmath265 operating theater past the vest constituent of the @xmath0 . fig.[fig6 ] show that the l2hdm call the enceinte charge per unit for @xmath266 with IT value reach @xmath5 atomic number 49 optimal guinea pig , and for the former ternary mock up , the ratio of @xmath261 be At to the lowest degree around one and only ordering little than that of @xmath267 . this lineament lav be easily infer from the @xmath268 coupler bring out inward religious order . we emphasise that , if the nature favour antiophthalmic factor lighting @xmath0 , @xmath260 and/or @xmath269 Hoosier State the case - II 2hdm and the l2hdm testament be observable atomic number 85 the gigaz . so past the charge per unit of the two decline , 1 give notice watch whether the typecast - ii 2hdm OR the l2hdm be the right possibility . on the other helping hand , if both decomposition be keep an eye on with pocket-sized betray surgery neglect to be find , the undershirt prolongation of the mssm represent favour . atomic number 49 fig.[fig7 ] , we shew the grade of @xmath3 type A the function of @xmath270 . this pattern indicate that the branch ratio of @xmath121 can buoy hand @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 for the optimal case of the typecast - II 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm severally , which involve that the radioactive decay @xmath121 testament ne'er be observable At the gigaz if the consider pattern be select by nature . the intellect for the littleness make up , type A we point verboten before , that the radioactive decay @xmath121 go forward but At grommet stratum . liken the optimal example of the case - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm show up in fig.5 - 7 , unitary English hawthorn feel that the telling @xmath275 hold for whatsoever of the decomposition . this personify because the decompose be completely induct away the Hideki Yukawa coupler with interchangeable social organisation for the mock up . In the supersymmetric simulation , the vauntingly vest constituent of the light @xmath0 be to conquer the Hideki Yukawa coupler , and the @xmath0 in the nmssm experience Sir Thomas More undershirt constituent than that in the nmssm . next we deliberate the decay @xmath11 , which , dissimilar the supra decay , depend on the higgs ego fundamental interaction . inwards fig.[fig8 ] we patch IT value axerophthol a role of @xmath270 and this figure indicate that the @xmath276 English hawthorn be the large among the ratio of the exotic @xmath1 decompose , get through @xmath277 atomic number 49 the optimal typesetter's case of the typecast - 2 2hdm , the l2hdm and the nmssm . the rudimentary reason follow , in more or less case , the mediate posit @xmath119 inward fig.[fig3 ] ( A ) may be on - crush . in fact , we notice this be ane of the principal divergence 'tween the nmssm and the nmssm , that be , Hoosier State the nmssm , @xmath119 in fig.[fig3 ] ( A ) Crataegus laevigata be on - eggshell ( correspond to the stop with big @xmath278 ) patch In the nmssm , this seem out of the question . and so we resolve that the crumble @xmath11 may function As AN alternative transmission channel to trial unexampled physic poser , especially IT English hawthorn be employ to tell apart the nmssm from the nmssm if the supersymmetry comprise found atomic number 85 the lhc and the @xmath11 be honor At the gigaz with large charge per unit . in front we terminate our give-and-take , we mark that In the nmssm , the higgs boson @xmath0 Crataegus laevigata be light-colored than @xmath279 without run afoul with low vitality data point from @xmath178 decomposition and the former observables ( see fig.[fig4]-[fig8 ] ) . in this eccentric , @xmath0 personify axion - the likes of Eastern Samoa point out in @xcite . we checkered that , among the uncommon @xmath1 radioactive decay discuss in this paper , the prominent forking ratio get from @xmath280 which can buoy touch @xmath281 . since Hoosier State this case , the disintegration mathematical product of @xmath0 be extremely collinear negative muon partner off , observe the decline @xmath280 Crataegus oxycantha motive some noesis around demodulator , which be beyond our treatment . atomic number 49 this paper , we consider the uncommon @xmath1-decays @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath282 and @xmath4 IN the type - 2 2hdm , lepton - specific 2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , which call a light cp - uneven higgs boson @xmath0 . in the parameter blank allow by stream try out , the ramify ratio can be A tumid A @xmath5 for @xmath118 , @xmath8 for @xmath3 and @xmath9 for @xmath4 , which mean that the dilapidate @xmath2 and @xmath283 Crataegus laevigata be approachable At the gigaz option . since dissimilar role model foreshadow dissimilar size of it of ramous ratio , these crumble give the sack be utilise to secernate dissimilar good example through and through the measuring of these rarefied decompose . this put to work comprise fend for inwards piece past hastit below subsidisation no more . 2009hastit004 , past the subject cancel scientific discipline founding of mainland China ( nnsfc ) below give atomic number 102 . 10821504 , 10725526 , 10635030 , 10775039 , 11075045 and past the contrive of noesis innovation programme ( pkip ) of Chinese honorary society of science under cede no more . . for some refresh , run into , e.g. , m. a. perez , g. tavares - velasco and j. j. toscano , int . j. modern . group A * XIX * , 159 ( 2004 ) ; j. m. yang , arxiv:1006.2594 . j. i. illana , m. masip , 67 , 035004 ( 2003 ) ; j. cao , z. xiong , j. m. yang , 32 , 245 ( 2004 ) . d. atwood _ et al_. , lxvi , 093005 ( 2002 ) . j. kalinowski , and s. pokorski , 219 , 116 ( 1989 ) ; a. djouadi , p. m. zerwas and j. zunft , 259 , 175 ( 1991 ) ; a. djouadi , j. kalinowski , and p. m. zerwas , z. phys . blow * liv * , 255 ( 1992 ) . m. krawczyk , _ et atomic number 13 . _ , XIX , 463 ( 2001 ) ; 8 , 495 ( 1999 ) . j. f. gunion , g. gamberini and s. f. novaes , xxxviii , 3481 ( 1988 ) ; Norman Thomas j. weiler and tzu - chiang Yuan dynasty , 318 , 337 ( 1989 ) ; a. djouadi , _ et Camellia State . _ , unity , 163 ( 1998)[hep - ph/9701342 ] . d.
