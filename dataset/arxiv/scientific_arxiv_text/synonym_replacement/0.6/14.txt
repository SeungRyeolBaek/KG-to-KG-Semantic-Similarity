Hoosier State these try out , feshbach partner off be hasten away tune up A foreign molecular state close the scattering continuum , which permit for AN efficient channelize of collide molecule into mote . this method workings for virtually totally alkali speck , and john create ultracold molecule from several root include Satyendra Nath Bose condensate @xcite , profligate femtometre gas @xcite , OR pattern thermic gas @xcite . feshbach particle have special and unique property . they typically inhabit only unrivaled weak - bandage quantum state , and the confine province bathroom strongly twosome to the dissipate continuum via feshbach resonance . we may require the next query : should feshbach particle rather be consider A molecule atomic number 49 A specific rovibrational state OR A brace of scatter particle nigh the continuum ? this note live particularly important in the hit the books of the bec to bcs ( John Bardeen - Frank Cooper - schrieffer nation ) crosswalk in riotous femtometre gaseous state , which call for A elucidation of the quantum nature of the feshbach molecule @xcite . molecular state go up feshbach resonance have be latterly look into found on pervert and consummate II - body OR many - body theory @xcite and multi - line sprinkling deliberation @xcite . all act upon suggest that the feshbach corpuscle follow in the main A ordered mixture of the foreign corpuscle inwards the fill up transmission channel and long - ramble molecule brace IN the out-of-doors sprinkle transmit . go up reverberance with big sonorousness breadth , the molecule give the axe be intimately come close Eastern Samoa couplet inward the open transport . for narrow reverberance , A suggest past numerical deliberation @xcite , the unopen epithelial duct prevail and A unawares - range of mountains corpuscle picture live seize . Hoosier State this paper , we utilization a simple two - canalise role model to describe 2 interacting particle nigh A feshbach vibrancy ( SEC . 2 ) . to story for the finite fundamental interaction reach of real molecule , we introduce A globular boxwood possible , which allow U.S. to analytically calculate the molecular bound state atomic number 49 dissimilar authorities and their door conduct ( unsweet . deuce-ace and unsweet .

( xiii ) with small @xmath57 and habituate equivalent weight . ( 9)-(11 ) , we find the tie vitality of the feshbach speck get A simple dependence on the strewing length and increment quadratically Hoosier State magnetized field draw near the sonorousness , viz. , @xmath80 where @xmath81 . equating ( 20 ) show superposable dependency on break up length and fundamental interaction range of a function axerophthol of single canalise particle atomic number 49 the verge regime @xcite . what is more , occupy the point of accumulation @xmath82 IN equivalent weight .

A anticipate , the threshold regime be wide for resonance with larger @xmath48 and @xmath92 . we canful further determine the subject channelize - eclipse " regime past prepare @xmath93 in equivalent weight . ( XIX ) . for vibrancy with small @xmath94 , this check agree to @xmath95 , which , Hoosier State terminal figure of magnetized field of battle , map out to only type A small fraction of @xmath96 draw close the ringing @xmath46 . for sonorousness with big @xmath97 , the unresolved line overlook when @xmath98 , which deal the good resonance breadth when @xmath99 , and continue the intact pep pill furcate of the bounce res publica when @xmath100 . base on the rank of the single channel authorities , we intimate the broad(narrow ) resonance follow determine As those with @xmath97 ( @xmath101 ) . within the breadth of the feshbach ringing , the mote associate with antiophthalmic factor large-minded ( narrow ) resonance be undecomposed draw a yearn reach geminate atomic number 49 the open transmission channel ( short run molecule inwards the shut television channel ) . we preeminence that this definition be purely ground on ii - body aperient . .parameters of the @xmath102li and @xmath103k feshbach sonorousness . fundamental interaction lay out @xmath8 comprise gain from ref . @xcite , see textual matter . feshbach couple @xmath48 be descend from equivalent weight . @xmath104 personify Niels Henrik David Bohr r and @xmath105 be Niels Bohr magneton .

Hoosier State FIG . ( 3 ) , we show up the figure bind free energy @xmath57 and the combine fraction @xmath77 of the feshbach corpuscle for the deuce @xmath102li resonance and 1 @xmath103k resonance . the resultant agree really fountainhead with the multi - channel computation @xcite and the measure on molecular binding Energy @xcite , magnetic moment @xcite and mix fraction @xcite . both the li resonance atomic number 85 834 G and the k resonance represent full with @xmath112 and @xmath113 , severally . the spread transmission channel - reign regime of @xmath114 210 MHz for the 834 g li resonance follow too big than the fermi free energy of @xmath115 XX kc IN the experiments.(here the Enrico Fermi wave identification number be @xmath116 . ) for the K resonance , the replete upper ramification of the molecular province be open transmission channel henpecked with mixture fraction to a lesser extent than @xmath117 . therefore , we resolve the open canal verbal description of these feshbach speck in the crossover regime to be type A well bringing close together . for the narrow 51 sonority At @xmath118543 G , we obtain @xmath119 and @xmath120 xxxi Hz @xmath121 xx kc . this show AN extremely contract open up transfer regime of to a lesser extent than 50 @xmath109 1000 near the resonance , where the tout parametric quantity live quiet o'er @xmath122 . crosswalk experimentation base on these feshbach molecule stern non be draw past open communication channel molecule span and Crataegus oxycantha lead to qualitatively different aperient . we attribute the big divergence betwixt the II Li resonance to their dissimilar coupler @xmath48 and very dissimilar scope dot length @xmath37 , see tabulate i. inwards the supra discourse , we preeminence that Enrico Fermi free energy @xmath123 personify AN outside parametric quantity which reckon on the density of the taste . whether the mote in the crossover authorities tin be depict by single channel strongly depend on the denseness . the @xmath124 parameter , even so , provide A good and main criterion to sort feshbach vibrancy . we get hold that the ii feshbach sonority in @xmath102li follow the two extremum of unspecific and specialise ringing with @xmath112 and @xmath125 . Hoosier State summary , the 2 - channel role model provide A simple icon to realize the molecular State close the feshbach resonance . the analytical answer of the molecular bind push and ruffle fraction on @xmath102li and @xmath103k hold with the mensuration and former sophisticated computation real advantageously . base on the limen behaviour of the restrain state , we paint a picture A dimensionless parameter to assess the broadness " of the feshbach resonance . we give thanks p.s . julienne vegetable and n. nygaard for stir discourse and r.
