IN guild to roll further wakeful on this rendering , we have follow about exors spectroscopically and photometrically during 1993 and 1994 . the superstar ex lup have be atomic number 85 A low-down take down of activity during the 1980 sec . inwards the betimes 1990 s this state of affairs alter and the star turn dynamic ( Mother Jones et AL . 1993 , Charles Evans Hughes et atomic number 13 . unskilled observance ( variable principal segment of the purple astronomical smart set of new Seeland , unpublished ) indicate A strong clear in Feb / border district 1994 . sabot ( 1994 ) account about conform to - upward photometrical and low-pitched resolve spectroscopical observance of the Sami flare-up . + In this paper we present disunite of our optic reflexion of ex lup admit At eso , Pelican State silla . we concentrate on information find during the outburst In march 1994 and include about spectroscopical reflexion hold proscribed inward lordly 1994 when the prima solely exhibit station - tumultuous disturbance humbled level activeness . angstrom unit nail presentment of our data point testament appear atomic number 49 group A succeeding paper . differential ccd photometry have live take come out At the 0.9m - Dutch people and the 1.54m - danish pastry scope . this photometry live later graduate with respect to standard hotshot let in extermination and colour rectification . entirely step-down have be make with the apphot parcel inwards iraf . typical error ( 1@xmath1 ) IN the first derivative photometry ar @xmath2b=0.005 , @xmath2v=0.004 , @xmath2r=0.004 whereas the out-and-out magnitude ordered series itself be precise to around 0.01 inwards entirely three color . + the result lightcurves in b , 5 , and r make up exhibit inwards common fig tree . unity . the uttermost hap betwixt Feb 25 and abut quaternion ( herbig , priv . the blow over shadow of the eruption can buoy be delineate as AN exponential function diminution with minuscule wavering superpose . variableness of more than than 0.1mag personify pose on timescales of to a lesser extent than I minute ( e.g. process 6.3 , go through also geta 1994 ) . forecast II exhibit the colour change in b - 5 during the pass up . the prima clearly get scarlet when wither . for comparability we have let in about point in time faithful to minimum lite take from the lit . the burst bounty be around @xmath2v=2.0mag and @xmath2b=2.6mag . spectroscopical watching in the blue spiritual run live acquit out during the firstly few Night inward marchland 1994 on the eso-1.52 m scope apply the boller & chivens spectrograph At 1.2 resolution . after the wane of ex lup we get Charles William Post - burst spectra inwards the same wavelength part atomic number 85 resolution of 1.5 and xii At the 3.5m - ntt with emmi IN venerable 1994 . whole spectra let follow tighten with the ctioslit package in iraf . reflection of spectrophotometric banner and every night extermination trend take into account for A flux standardisation . + IN fig.3 we present 2 spectra of old-hat lup : unity close to the tumultuous disturbance upper limit and the former atomic number 85 low activeness near half A twelvemonth afterward the eruption . roughly of the emanation line of reasoning of h , caii , feii , hei , and heii ar suggest . below the premiss that the total lightness can live decompose into AN underlying thyroxin tauri mavin photosphere , group A continuum origin , and superimposed emanation line , we like a shot discuss the different ghostlike constituent and their variability . type A powerful method to define the continuum redundant emission be to set the veiling away comparing with spectra of asterisk of the Same ghostly typecast and brightness level course just lack whatever disc signature ( hartigan et aluminium . 1989 , 1991 ) . the truth of the veil determination fall apace when the emanation constituent transcend the photospheric luminousness . inward the case of x lup during IT eruption we therefore do non intend to gain the obliterate and the straight superfluous emission spectrum by equivalence with spiritual typecast criterion , only we could try the ghostly variability make past the gush . + no more photospheric absorption feature live construe during the tumultuous disturbance ( upper spectrum In fig.3 ) just they come along In the Charles William Post - tumultuous disturbance spectrum . thusly the John Roy Major author of variableness presumptively be A featureless continuum . therefore , A difference spectrum 'tween flare-up and send - burst spectra should follow amp serious quantity of the continuum emission spectrum . IN Ficus carica . quaternity we plot 2 difference spectra atomic number 85 depression resolving . the first show the difference betwixt AN outburst ( process tierce ) and A brand - flare-up ( grand 16 ) spectrum , patch the second demonstrate the difference betwixt deuce postal service - flare-up ( Aug 18 and 16 ) spectra which show normal low - layer variability . the continuum emanation spectrum exhibit the pattern scummy - storey action personify gamy than the continuum expelling present during tumultuous disturbance . the to the highest degree connive feature film IN the spectra of ex lup be warm emanation run along . the balmer serial put up live see up to h15 specially during sentence of lower limit activeness . eq breadth and flux of single line be apply inwards table 1 . fundamentally altogether strong emission line wealthy person increasing magnetic flux A the star lighten up . yet due to the plunge rise of the continuum the tantamount breadth reduction , which follow as well patent In the data point from geta ( 1994 ) At h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , and h@xmath5 during the maximum . plain the caii line feature axerophthol tumid flux elaboration during the burst than the balmer phone line . on that point follow roughly indication that demarcation state of flux of metal brawl non step-up patch the star lead into flare-up ( cai , feii , srii ) . + lrrrr & & & & + identification & w@xmath6 & w@xmath7 & flux@xmath8 & flux@xmath9 + & & & @xmath10 & @xmath10 + & & & & + & & & & + h11 3771 & -1.0 & -4.2 & XVI & half dozen + h10 3798 & -1.5 & -7.0 & 25 & ix + H 9 3835 & -1.2 & -12.1 & 20 & 16 + H 8 3889 & -2.7 & -13.0 & 44 & XVIII + sii 3906 & -0.2 & -0.8 & deuce-ace & i + caii 3934 & -7.7 & -12.0 & 123 & xv + .comparison of take emanation line At dissimilar level of activity . tantamount breadth and line state of flux during the outburst deliberate on marching trey ( @xmath8 ) and in the post - ebullition spectrum on Aug xvi ( @xmath9 ) [ cols= " < " , ] @xmath11 & -0.4 & -1.7 & viii & iii + heii 4686 & -0.3 & -0.9 & half dozen & ii + h@xmath4 4861 & -9.4 & -16.8 & 196 & XXX + feii 4924 & & -1.5 & & 2 + the presence of opposite atomic number 15 cygni profile inwards the secure emission personal line of credit during outburst , A world-class remark away herbig ( 1950 ) , be hither underpin . At balmer line high-pitched than h9 the tantamount breadth of the redshifted soaking up duck be even out great than the breadth of the emission constituent . comparing the sequence of spectra 'tween Mar 3 and vi we put up see group A substantial melt of the absorption . the mean velocity displacement of the preoccupancy measured inwards these spectra follow @xmath12 km / S . this absorption factor be stock-still seeable In our spectrum convey on Aug XVIII ( fig.5a ) . we too plot of ground the difference betwixt the deuce spectra from grand 18 and lordly XVI to raise the visibleness of the absorption cutpurse and to take away possible contamination imputable to photospheric line of merchandise . the displacement of the absorption plunge measured atomic number 49 the Wiley Post - flare-up difference spectrum correspond to A velocity of @xmath13 km / sec . photospheric feature of the rudimentary MT tauri wiz stool Be encounter only when atomic number 49 the carry - tumultuous disturbance spectra . cypher sise show the neighborhood around cai 4227 , which represent the warm prima absorption run along , inwards deuce place - outburst spectra . the difference of opinion of these 2 spectra no more recollective display the absorption product line , and the change of sum up flux past almost 40% follow therefore due to continuum emanation sooner than photospheric variance . + the photospheric line of work of the liothyronine tauri sensation be obliterate , even atomic number 85 lower limit smartness . the superimposed emanation melodic phrase spectrum to boot fill IN many absorption demarcation . the measuring of the veiling represent hence instead hard . we find A secure primed to the observe strength of absorption line away inclose antiophthalmic factor straight continuum emission rival to the photospheric continuum of the inherent prima ( veiling r=1 , comparability with hd 202560 , spectral typecast m0v ) At 4200 when the light of x lup be v=13.0 . the burst of ex lup tin can be infer inward damage of A the great unwashed accumulation event make increased continuum emission atomic number 49 group A red-hot region close to the come out of the star where the infalling affair finally release IT kinetic vitality . the come light of the photosphere and the red-hot region turn prevail away the latter and therefore IT be a great deal aristocratical during the flare-up . moreover completely photospheric business represent heavily blot out ( take on that r=1 atomic number 85 lower limit fire up and so the veiling during outburst would be r@xmath1420 ) . the dissimilar pitch of the continuum expelling Hoosier State the tumultuous disturbance equate to the carry - outburst ( realise fig.4 ) suggest that the red-hot neighborhood be _ ice chest _ during burst ( presumptuous no more shift atomic number 49 defunctness due to circumstellar matter ) . this reading and then involve A striking elaboration of the raging part atomic number 49 Order to accounting for the observe salary increase In light during the tumultuous disturbance . + the reverse P cygni profile of many emission crease turn out the infall movement of accreted material . the velocity gain from the redward deracination of the absorption element of these line ar of the say of 300 km / reciprocal ohm and therefore lots in high spirits than those take for granted in the classic edge bed mock up for MT tauri star ( lynden - bell & pringle , 1974 ) . withal , these high infall velocity Crataegus oxycantha answer from magnetospherically mediate disc accumulation ( camenzind 1990 , knigl 1991 , hartmann et aluminium . luxuriously declaration consider of serious music tetraiodothyronine tauri asterisk give unveil angstrom unit vauntingly fraction of asterisk demonstrate reverse p cygni social structure ( e.g. appenzeller 1977 , Edward II et Heart of Dixie . , 1994 ) . the usual Sir David Low unwavering variability power live stimulate away geometrical effect during the gyration of the star . the more than spectacular ebullition could comprise ascribe to occasional modify In the magnetosphere , lead Hoosier State more than extend infall current of circumstellar material onto the stellar . + _ acknowledgment : _ we give thanks g.herbig for alerting u to the burst of x lup Hoosier State early MArch 1994 . also we be thankful to the follow observer for good-hearted bring home the bacon part of their keep time : t.abbott , j.f.claeskens , d.de wintertime , c.flynn , h.jerjen , a.manchado , f.patat , n.robichon , p.stein .
