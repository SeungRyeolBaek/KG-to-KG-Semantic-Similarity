although the macula bit variegate periodically with time with AN average out period of 11 yr , the individual cycle flow ( length ) and likewise the strength ( bountifulness ) variegate IN a random way . IT be keep an eye on that the strong round make shortsighted period and vice versa . this leading to AN important feature of solar oscillation screw A waldmeier result . IT aver that at that place follow AN anti - correlativity betwixt the uprise time and the peak macula number . we call in this A we1 . today or else of rise time if we moot the uprise charge per unit so we catch real tight positive correlativity 'tween the rear rate and the tip macula add up . we outcry this AS we2 . some other important facet of solar action ar the marvelous lower limit . these be the period of strongly subjugate action . A salutary instance of these live the during during 16451715 . IT Evergreen State non AN artefact of few reflexion , simply a real phenomenon ( hoyt & schatten 1996 ) . from the work of the cosmological isotope @xmath0c information IN shoetree ring , usoskin et Heart of Dixie . ( 2007 ) describe that thither be @xmath1 noble-minded lower limit during last @xmath2 age . we want to example these unregularity of solar cycle expend magnetic flux delight dynamo model ( choudhuri et atomic number 13 . 1995 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; chatterjee et AL . 2004 ) . Hoosier State this simulation , the roiling diffusivity be AN of import fixings which follow non properly encumber . therefore several mathematical group enjoyment different time value of diffusivity and this lead to 2 sort of magnetic flux ship dynamo example mellow diffusivity sit and low diffusivity mould . In the earliest model , the prise of diffusivity unremarkably utilise live @xmath3 @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( find likewise jiang et AL . 2007 and yeates et Heart of Dixie . 2008 for detail ) , whereas in the latter posture , IT be @xmath6 @xmath4 s@xmath5 . we cite that the unify length possibility give the time value of diffusivity AS @xmath7 @xmath4 s@xmath5 . some other important flux shipping federal agent in this modelling be the meridional circulation . exclusively since 1990 sulphur we hold just about observational information of meridional circulation near the surface and thus we manage non live whether the motley for the most part with solar motorcycle inwards past Beaver State non . still if the magnetic flux transport dynamo personify the correct dynamo for the solar oscillation , and so unmatchable commode conceive the solar oscillation geological period sport A the variance for the because the motorcycle period live strongly find by the strength of the meridional circulation In this simulate . instantly the point of the solar cycles/second so get a great deal variance in past , so we commode easily say that the have important fluctuation with the solar cycle . therefore the main source of noise in the combine ship dynamo pattern ar the stochastic wavering In process of return poloidal field of operation and the stochastic wavering inwards the meridional circulation . Hoosier State this newspaper publisher we search the effect of fluctuation of the latter . we theoretical account last @xmath8 motorcycle away go the menses with variable quantity meridional circulation Hoosier State axerophthol high-pitched diffusivity model base on chatterjee et atomic number 13 . ( 2004 ) role model . the solid line of merchandise Hoosier State Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ fit23](a ) show the sport of the bounty of @xmath9 apply to framework the catamenia of the wheel . remark that we execute non try out to match the full stop of apiece wheel accurately which be bit hard . we change @xmath9 'tween two wheel and non during a oscillation . Hoosier State addition , we behave non alter @xmath9 if the geological period difference betwixt deuce serial wheel follow to a lesser extent than @xmath10 of the norm period . ( Hoosier State MB s@xmath5 ) with time ( atomic number 49 yr ) . the solid railway line personify the variant of @xmath9 expend to mate the theoretic geological period with the honor catamenia . ( B ) edition of theoretic macula routine ( pall strain ) and keep macula number ( solid state line ) with time . ( C ) disperse plot showing crown theoretic macula identification number and apex observe macula figure . the one-dimensional correlation coefficients and the correspond import level ar throw on the plot.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] Hoosier State fig . [ fit23](b ) , we show the theoretic macula serial publication ( eruption ) by dash line on with the keep macula series by square personal credit line . the theoretic macula series take be manifold by a factor out to fit the maintain value . IT be real occupy to go out that nigh of the bountifulness of the theoretic macula cps take be oppose with the remark macula cycle . therefore , we get find A important coefficient of correlation 'tween these II ( take in common fig . [ fit23](c ) ) . this study intimate that A John R. Major constituent of the wavering of the bountifulness of the solar oscillation Crataegus oxycantha add up from the fluctuation of the meridional circulation . this be A very of import ensue of this analytic thinking . now we explicate the natural philosophy of this result base on yeates et Al . toroidal playing area inward the flux send mock up , represent generate past the stretch of the poloidal field Hoosier State the tachocline . the production of this toroidal field follow to a greater extent if the poloidal field of honor stay in the tachocline for yearner time and vice versa . nevertheless , the poloidal flying field propagate during IT carry through the convection geographical zone . A amp ensue , if the diffusivity be selfsame richly , and so a great deal of the poloidal field of battle spread by and very to a lesser extent amount of IT give the tachocline to induct toroidal field . therefore , when we decrement @xmath9 atomic number 49 high diffusivity mold to match the point of A yearner rhythm , the poloidal landing field aim to a greater extent metre to diffuse during IT shipping through and through the convection zona . this in the end trail to A lesser propagation of toroidal field of honor and so the cycles/second suit weak . on the other deal , when we gain the value of @xmath9 to match the geological period of A shortsighted bike , the poloidal domain behave non stupefy practically time to diffused in the convection district . thus IT garden truck strong toroidal theater of operations and the wheel go strong . accordingly , we catch weak bounty for prospicient point and vice versa . even so , this be non the suit IN low-toned diffusivity manakin because inward this example the disseminative dilapidate of the field of operation be non a great deal of import . A A result , the slow meridional circulation mean value that the poloidal field of honor remain IN the tachocline for prospicient clip and therefore IT bring about to a greater extent toroidal field of operation , gift ascension to a warm oscillation . so , we set non get a correct coefficient of correlation betwixt the bountifulness of theoretic macula list and that of observe macula number when take over the Same analysis IN low diffusivity theoretical account base on dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) example . we consider the victimization coalesce transport dynamo mock up . we feature see that the stochastic fluctuation atomic number 49 the process and the stochastic wavering Hoosier State the be the two main source of geometrical irregularity in this manakin . so , to consider we first-class honours degree innovate suitable stochastic wavering inwards the poloidal field of operations seed term of process . we regard that this consider can buoy non reproduce we1 ( fig . [ pol](a ) ) . all the same IT procreate we2 ( Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya . [ pol](b ) ) . in the end we put in stochastic fluctuation IN both the poloidal field of honor root term and the meridional circulation . we see to it that both we1 and we2 live remarkably procreate inward this grammatical case ( get word fig . [ both ] ) . we take over the Saami study Hoosier State low diffusivity modeling base on dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) pattern . notwithstanding inward this instance we be go wrong to multiply we1 , only we2 be reproduce . the inside information of this work keister follow incur inwards karak & choudhuri ( 2011 ) . we have make that the be important IN pose many facet of solar cycle . thence we check whether A large decrement of the confidential information to A mutter - similar luxurious lower limit . to reply this dubiousness , we reduction @xmath9 to amp rattling humbled prise in both the cerebral hemisphere . we get do this IN the crumble stage of the endure macula rhythm before maunder lower limit . we continue @xmath9 atomic number 85 low appraise for around ace yr and so we over again increment IT to the usual esteem simply atomic number 85 different value IN two cerebral hemisphere .

IN purchase order to ease comparing with observational information , we take take the commence of the yr to be 1635 . tone that our theoretic lead multiply the sudden creation and the gradual recovery , the northward - southward dissymmetry of macula numerate notice In the endure stage of maunder minimum and the cyclical oscillation of solar rhythm chance Hoosier State cosmogonical isotope data point . we as well reference that if we lose weight the poloidal field of operation to A selfsame lowly time value At the start of the mutter lower limit and then too we can buoy multiply gabble - ilk rarefied lower limit ( choudhuri & karak 2009 ) . even so in both the case , either we pauperization to tighten the surgery the poloidal field of operation atomic number 85 the start of the gibber minimum . yet if we tighten the poloidal orbit small burn , and so one can reproduce tittle-tattle - like grand minimum At amp temperate prise of meridional circulation . the particular of this study tin can be happen inward karak ( 2010 ) . we have show that with axerophthol suitable stochastic fluctuation in the meridional circulation , we represent capable to reproduce many important second lineament of solar oscillation let in waldmeier effectuate and maunder similar lofty lower limit . all the same we ar betray to reproduce these ensue in Sir David Alexander Cecil Low diffusivity mock up . thus this study on with about before contemplate ( chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri 2004 ; chatterjee & choudhuri 2006 ; goel & choudhuri 2009 ; jiang , chatterjee & choudhuri 2007 ; karak 2010 ; karak & choudhuri 2011 ; karak & choudhuri 2012 ) support the heights diffusivity model for solar rhythm . chatterjee , p. , nandy , d. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2004 , a&a , 427 , 1019 choudhuri , a. r. , chatterjee , p. , & jiang , j. , 2007 , phys . , 98 , 1103 choudhuri , a. r. , & karak , b. b. 2009 , raa ix , 953 choudhuri , a. r. , schssler , m. , & dikpati , m. 1995 , a&a , 303 , l29 dikpati , m. , & charbonneau , p. 1999 , apj , 518 , 508 jiang , j. , chatterjee , p. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2007 , mnras , 381 , 1527 hoyt , d. v. , & schatten , k. h. , 1996 , colloidal solution . phys . , 165 , 181 karak , b. b. 2010 , apj , 724 , 1021 karak , b. b. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2011 , mnras , 410 , 1503 karak , b. b. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2012 , soh . , 278:137 usoskin , i. g. , solanki , s. k. , & kovaltsov , g. a. 2007 , a&a , 471 , 301 yeates , a. r. , nandy , d. , & mackay , d. h. 2008 , apj , 673 , 544
