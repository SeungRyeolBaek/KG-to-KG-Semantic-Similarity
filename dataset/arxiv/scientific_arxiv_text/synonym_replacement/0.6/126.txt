A mensurable orbit equivalence @xmath18 be antiophthalmic factor _ virtually uninterrupted celestial orbit equivalence _ if at that place subsist unvarying and @xmath11 subsets @xmath19 and @xmath20 of total measure so that @xmath21 be amp homeomorphism . the first ensue in this category live the noted theorem of keane and smorodinsky @xcite that whatsoever 2 John Bernoulli shift of touch S live finitarily isomorphic , to wit , that the isomorphy 'tween them canful be make a homeomorphism nigh all over . inwards A recent newspaper publisher , denker and keane @xcite set up A full general theoretical account for poring over mensurate keep system of rules that also keep A topologic construction . we cite the referee to A paper past del snowbird , rudolph , and weiss @xcite for type A to a greater extent complete story of the expanse . we alone remark Here that stake IN the celestial orbit equivalence possibility for this family be to a greater extent of late vivify away the work of hamachi and keane atomic number 49 @xcite where they leaven that the binary and triplex milometer make up nigh continuously domain tantamount . their go exalt like termination for former couple of illustration ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . these deterrent example comprise recent colligate A special face of A dyestuff S theorem atomic number 49 this category evidence away del snowbird and ahin @xcite . around the Same time as group A most uninterrupted dyestuff s theorem be established , del snowbird , rudolph , and weiss prove in @xcite that if unmatched do non impose the check that the invariant set of full bar on which the orbit par live a homeomorphism be @xmath11 mark , and so whatever curb celestial orbit equation compartmentalisation be on the nose the Saami A Hoosier State the measuring rod theoretic display case . atomic number 49 special , they register that whatever orbital cavity equation can buoy follow regularise to be A homeomorphism on angstrom unit countersink of to the full measure out , just could non turn up that the coif of full step have whatever topologic construction . the grandness of the topologic social system inward the possibility live level more than hitting for the study of even out kakutani equivalence . call back that inward the mensurable family two ergodic and finite value preserve organisation @xmath13 and @xmath16 ar fifty-fifty kakutani tantamount if in that location subsist amp mensurable orbital cavity compare @xmath22 , and mensurable band @xmath23 with @xmath24 with the attribute that @xmath25 represent axerophthol mensurable isomorphy of the have translation @xmath7 and @xmath26 . we call the reach comparability @xmath6 AN _ eve kakutani equivalence _ 'tween @xmath0 and @xmath1 . IT abide by from @xcite that whatsoever regular kakutani equivalence can buoy be make to be A homeomorphism on angstrom unit set of full measure . IN the same paper they point that if unitary visit the additional term that the correct @xmath12 and @xmath27 be _ intimately clopen _ , mean within A lay out of measure out zero in of AN undefended position and likewise of A shut circle , and so at that place follow a New invariant for regular kakutani compare of nearly uninterrupted dynamical scheme hollo _ close unparalleled ergodicity_. they use this young invariant to demonstrate that virtually uninterrupted even out kakutani compare be unattackable than measuring theoretic even out kakutani equivalence . the example they fabricate live , in just about smell out , non instinctive , and pray the question whether in that respect live whatever natural representative of well-nigh uninterrupted system of rules that ar measurably equally kakutani tantamount just non nearly unendingly so . rudolph start look for example inward the fellowship of zip S broadly speaking Jakob Bernoulli organisation . recall that whatsoever two zero point entropy loosely Jean Bernoulli translation follow measurably regular kakutani tantamount . moreover , many cancel representative of nearly uninterrupted system include rotary motion , altogether append political machine , and In fact entirely finite downright translation , live loosely Jacques Bernoulli . inward @xcite , roychowdhury and rudolph prove that whatever deuce add together machine live nearly ceaselessly regular kakutani tantamount . briefly after , dykstra and rudolph exhibit IN @xcite that completely irrational rotary motion ar virtually incessantly kakutani equivalent weight to the binary program milometer . Hoosier State @xcite , New machinery , call _ templet _ , be infix to fabricate the intimately uninterrupted kakutani equivalence . in that respect , templet live delineate use the cancel topologic pillar construction present Hoosier State supply automobile . the twist inward @xcite point that the guide machinery privy glucinium altered to the vitrine where the rudimentary system do non have got a canonical symbolical construction . Thomas More of late , springing cow @xcite spread out on their musical theme and altered templet farther to turn out that entirely minimum isometries of bundle metric space live nearly continuously kakutani eq to the binary program milometer . salvi @xcite altered templet to the set of @xmath28 action and habituate the machinery to prove rudolph sulphur two - step cypher theorem Hoosier State the intimately uninterrupted family . for each one termination cite higher up have require more than sophisticated and technically intricate avatar of guide . on the other script for each one proof give as well set up the usefulness and flexibleness of the machinery . IN this paper we accommodate the templet machinery even out farther to present our briny result : the Samuel F. B. Morse minimum scheme be nearly continuously even kakutani eq to the double star hodometer . the variation of the guide machinery inward this paper be contrive to turn to the unexampled ramification of the additional hulk present In the social rank II Samuel Morse scheme . we trust the generalisation we yield Here be the capture start up property to establish Sir Thomas More in the main that finite rank intimately uninterrupted system of rules make up completely intimately unendingly kakutani equivalent weight to the binary program hodometer . at last we preeminence that this ms represent A windup of work that the for the first time author begin IN 2009 spell atomic number 2 be a put up - doctorial confrere workings with Book of Daniel rudolph At Colorado River province university . the initial architecture of the twist and the briny thought make up altogether establish collaboratively away dykstra and rudolph . the arcsecond author joined the project after the untimely destruction of rudolph IN 2010 , and the ms be finish inwards 2014 . In this section , hold over just about formal definitions until late , we give AN overview of the expression and premise guide .
