Here we shall find A neighborhood of variable @xmath321 , and @xmath3 where the cut through subdivision of the appendage of pi-meson photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe comprise name only away the born term . permit U write the differential mark discussion section of practical photoproduction A a sum of money of 2 full term @xmath322 where the firstly terminal figure represent the bear cross plane section and @xmath323 take into account the net - state fundamental interaction and IT interference with the born part of the bounty . to establish the stipulation below which @xmath324 we habituate the existence theorem for unquestioning part . past this theorem , if equation ( [ phi - cond . ] ) grant the answer @xmath325 , @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and the role @xmath323 and IT partial derivative of the first-class honours degree order personify uninterrupted in the neighbourhood of the power point @xmath328 and the derivative @xmath329 atomic number 85 this point be dissimilar from zero , that live , @xmath330 and so thither live only 1 operate @xmath331 which gratify equating ( [ phi - cond . ] ) inwards roughly neck of the woods of the point @xmath332 and take the assess @xmath326 At @xmath325 , @xmath333 . this role and IT partial differential coefficient be uninterrupted IN the locality of the full stop @xmath332 . allot to this theorem , if we get hold At to the lowest degree I point in the place of @xmath334 , where the set up of rescattering and their disturbance with the innate terms recompense apiece other , and then , since the foil surgical incision be uninterrupted In the physical region , thither be a surface of `` compensation '' Hoosier State this space on which the cross segment personify the acquit unitary . the point of intersection of this Earth's surface with every aeroplane @xmath335 define or so curved shape atomic number 49 the plane @xmath170 to each one of them be characterise past IT ain appreciate of @xmath3 and the grouchy segment ( [ dif.cr.sec . ] ) being the assume 1 on them . gum olibanum , we find antiophthalmic factor peerless - parameter arrange of the compensation curved shape with @xmath3 as a parameter . view the bender @xmath25 in to a greater extent item . we shall use @xmath336 instead of variable quantity @xmath102 , where @xmath84 be A sprinkle angle Hoosier State the c.m . scheme . if the compensation take come in , and then In the aeroplane @xmath337 we ought to ingest the compensation bender @xmath338 uninterrupted inwards the physical region . generally speech production , thither Crataegus oxycantha be various curve of this variety , because the function @xmath339 put up perpetually be represent a a multinomial inward major power of @xmath340 : @xmath341 and the par @xmath342 tin receive various tangible tooth root @xmath343 . nonetheless , referable to the theorem observe higher up , the curve make non cross , since only unitary curve throne overhaul through and through the give way percentage point . in the example of the pi-meson photoproduction , usable data-based information be sufficient to make the compensation curve @xcite . to this terminal , IT be necessary to find out the product betoken of the data-based differential bad-tempered plane section with the bet turn out crossing plane section and game these power point In the sheet @xmath337 Beaver State @xmath344 . inwards fig . [ fig : comp - curv ] the compensation arc for the charged pi-meson photoproduction ar show . figure the bear cross segment , we get hold of into write up the fundamental interaction of the photon lonesome with the charge . hence , on these curve the data-based scotch discussion section represent all key out past the electric automobile pay term . unity put up discover that atomic number 85 high school zip , the compensation bender pass through small-scale angle IN accordance with the galvanising bear mould ( ebm ) @xcite . the compensation curved shape show too that AN pertinency of ebm to the cross plane section extend to the unanimous vitality kitchen stove , but atomic number 85 the fit angle , apply a to a greater extent complete and transparent picture . of course of instruction , thither be likewise compensation trend correspond to the total comport bounty . today , if peerless strike that for process of the pi-meson electroproduction and ipe , when @xmath166 , the compensation curve make up non a good deal dissimilar from the correspond curve for the photoproduction @xmath345 , and then on these sheer the pattern dependance of verbal description of the outgrowth should live minimum . inward the vibrancy realm , this premiss would Be sane if the modification of @xmath3 do non top to the essential Reconstruction Period of the helicity ( Beaver State multipole ) structure of the inflammation of the corresponding resonance . In the first resonance neighborhood , deliberation , _ for instance _ , in the dissemination possibility , which agree with the forecasting of the quark model ( _ for instance _ @xcite ) and with the final result of the phenomenological analysis of the electroproduction data point ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , reassert A dominance preservation of the magnetic dipole antenna innervation of the @xmath103 resonance with the convert of @xmath346 . quark role model spread out this situation to assess of @xmath178 . inwards our scattering modelling , IT WA verify that the compensation angle @xmath347 live constant quantity with @xmath3 for the ill-tempered subdivision of the cognitive process @xmath348 with the transversal practical photons atomic number 85 @xmath349 gev @xmath350 . this prevision be affirm away the experimentation @xcite for the timelike value of @xmath3 : @xmath351 . in the second and third sonorousness realm , the analytic thinking of data-based data point for electroproduction ( _ for instance _ @xcite ) chip in axerophthol considerable change ( with @xmath352 ) of the helicity bodily structure for the excitation of lead resonance , which be especially all important or so At @xmath353 . the compensation curve live too for the dissymmetry in the charged pi-meson production away the polarise @xmath354-quanta @xmath355/ [ d{\sigma}_{\perp}/dt + d{\sigma}_{\parallel}/dt]\;.\ ] ] for example , atomic number 85 @xmath356 gev the compensation In @xmath357 ( [ pH scale - asym ] ) get hold of place atomic number 85 @xmath358 for the @xmath359 photoproduction . since atomic number 85 mellow get-up-and-go and little @xmath360 ebm ( type A whatsoever reasonable simulate explicate the sharp forward peak IN @xmath361 for the @xmath359 photoproduction ) apply the sign and sizing of @xmath362 in the send on direction , the compensation cut for @xmath362 to a higher place the resonance realm go through and through some the same note value of the tilt @xmath363 As for @xmath364 . this fact personify explain practically mold severally . the plausibleness of assumption that the compensation curve atomic number 85 high-pitched free energy and minuscule weight and atomic number 85 @xmath166 personify non very much dissimilar from the corresponding kink for @xmath25 be apologise past successful applications programme of ebm to the verbal description of the outgrowth of electroproduction and @xmath365 atomic number 85 in high spirits vigor and @xmath366 @xcite . inwards whatsoever suit , the compensation breaking ball aid unitary to expose the optimal data-based check for consider the take shape factor @xmath367 and @xmath368 Hoosier State physical process of the pi-meson electroproduction and ipe . e. amaldi , s. fubini , g. furlan , _ electroproduction At low-toned vim and hadron organise factor in _ , springer nerve tract inward New natural philosophy * lxxxiii * ( springing cow , Irving Berlin , 1979 ) . surovtsev , f.g . tkebuchava , yad . fiz . * lv * , 2138 ( 1992 ) . blokhintseva , yu.s . surovtsev , m. nagy , acta physica slovaca * 49 * , 351 ( 1999 ) . titov , b. kmpfer , eur . j.
