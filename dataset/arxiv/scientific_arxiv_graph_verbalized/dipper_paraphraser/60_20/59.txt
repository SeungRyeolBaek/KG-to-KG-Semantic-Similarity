Phylogenetic Networks is the study of of Phylogenetics.
Phylogenetic Networks uses Combinatorial Approaches.
Phylogenetic Networks uses Algorithmic Approaches.
Phylogenetic Networks is the modeling and visualization of of Reticulation Processes.
Phylogenetic Tree is the number of of Internal Nodes.
Phylogenetic Tree is the xmath0 leaves of Leaf.
Phylogenetic Tree is the xmath2 of Internal Nodes.
Phylogenetic Tree is the xmath5 at most of Internal Nodes.
Network is the two leaves of Leaf.
Network is the as many as possible of Internal Nodes.
Network is the xmath2 at most of Internal Nodes.
Network is the xmath5 at most of Internal Nodes.
Phylogenetic Network is the contains of Reticulation Nodes.
Phylogenetic Network is the if no reticulation nodes , then of Phylogenetic Tree.
Phylogenetic Network is the tree node if root or indegree one , reticulation node if indegree greater than one of Node.
Phylogenetic Network is the not necessarily tree-based of Reticulation Nodes.
Phylogenetic Network is the visible child for every node of Node.
Phylogenetic Network introduces Tree-Based Networks.
Phylogenetic Network is the same leaves as another tree of Leaf.
Node incomings Reticulation Node.
Node is the head and tail of the node of Node.
Node is the visible child for every node of Reticulation Node.
Reticulation Node is the exactly one incoming edge for each of Reticulation Node.
Reticulation Node is the with the same leaves as the network of Subtree.
