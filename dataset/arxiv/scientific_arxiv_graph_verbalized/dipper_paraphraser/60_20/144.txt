Galactic Surveys shows Infrared Dark Clouds.
Infrared Dark Clouds identifys Diffuse Galactic Mid-Infrared Background.
Infrared Dark Clouds acknowledges Dense Column-Dense Masses.
Dense Column-Dense Masses bases Theoretical Considerations.
Theoretical Considerations is the imposes quantitative limits on of Msf-Limits.
Solar-Distance Clouds takes Taurus.
