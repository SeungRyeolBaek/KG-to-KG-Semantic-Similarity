Non-Markovian studys Fig.1.
Non-Markovian is the system-wide criterion to examine behavior of Open Quantum Process.
Classical Stochastics is the criterion is controversial of Non-Markovian.
Non-Markovian is the important aspect of behavior of Open Quantum Process.
Density Operators is the measure of behavior derived from trace distance of Quantum Channels.
Blp is the can not show inexpressible non-divisibility of Infinitesimal Non-Divisibility.
Blp is the measure of non-markovianity provided of Two-Qubit Systems.

Breuer, Laine, And Piilo is the first proposed in ref . of Measuring Device For Non-Markovianity.
Choi-Jamiokowski Matrix (Xmath76) is the negative negativity utilized as measure of Correlations Between Two States.
Entanglement Entropy And Mutual Information is the measure of correlations under local quantum channels of Choi-Jamiokowski Matrix (Xmath76).
Non-United Aspect Of Dynamics is the special feature not observable of Trace Distance.
Trace Distance is the effect of non-unitedness measured of Non-United Aspect Of Dynamics.
Non-Unitality is the measure of non-unitality constructed of Non-United Aspect Of Dynamics.
Quantum Technologies is the new theoretical approaches required of Open Quantum Systems.
