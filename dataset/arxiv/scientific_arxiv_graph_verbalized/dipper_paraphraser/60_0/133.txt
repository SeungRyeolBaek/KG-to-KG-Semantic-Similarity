Steiner-Tree Problem relates Steiner-Trees.
Steiner-Trees is the involves of Pair Of Nodes.
Steiner-Trees is the aims to find of Minimum-Cost Subgraph.
Steiner-Trees is the utilizes of Integer.
Minimum-Cost Subgraph haves Pair Of Nodes.
Minimum-Cost Subgraph is the equivalent to of Minimum-Cost Spanning Tree (Mst).
Minimum-Cost Subgraph is the special case of of Survivable Network Design Problem (Sndp).
Survivable Network Design Problem (Sndp) is the specifies connectivity requirement of Pair Of Nodes.
Survivable Network Design Problem (Sndp) is the aims to find minimum-cost subgraph with disjointed paths of Density.
Density relates Cycle.
Cycle is the contains only one terminal of Terminals.
Cycle is the contains at least two terminals of Terminals.
Cycle relates Terminals.
Cycle is the defines density of Density.
Density connects Terminals.
Density bases Linear Program.
