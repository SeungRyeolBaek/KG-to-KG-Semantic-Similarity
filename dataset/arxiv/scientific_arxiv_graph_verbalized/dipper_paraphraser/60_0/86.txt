Cataclysmic Variables is the primary star of White Dwarf.
Cataclysmic Variables is the secondary star of Low Mass Secondary.
Low Mass Secondary is the fills roche lobe of Roche Lobe.
Low Mass Secondary is the transfers mass to white dwarf of White Dwarf.
Orbital Period Distribution characterizes Hydrogen-Rich Donors.
Accumulation Of Systems is the proportional to time taken to develop through region of Mass Transfer Rate.
Mass Transfer Rate is the increases minimum period by increasing mass transfer rate of Mode Of Consequential Am Loss (Caml).
Mode Of Consequential Am Loss (Caml) is the causes fraction of mass transferred from primary to system of Nova Mass Ejections.
Stellar Code uses Cataclysmic Variables.
Mass Loss is the contributes to orbital angular momentum loss of Angular Momentum.
Deformation Factor is the affects period spike of Period Spike.
Parent Distribution is the comparison with observed distribution of Rejecting The Hypothesis.
Weighting is the obscures period spike of Period Spike.
Magnetic Cvs is the physical cause of fading in systems of Donor Stars.
Donor Stars is the cause of fading in systems of Evolution.
Donor Stars is the not cause of fading in systems of Absorption Physics.
Donor Stars is the not cause of fading in systems of Emission Properties.
