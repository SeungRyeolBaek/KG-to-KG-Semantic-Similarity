Electromagnetic Examination is the reveals of Photons.
Photons is the discovers formation of of Quark-Gluon Plasma.
Quark-Gluon Plasma is the occurs in of Heavy Ion Collisions.
Photons is the affects of Temperature.
Photons is the regulates of Energy Distribution.
Photons is the escapes without interaction of Plasma.
Plasma is the assumes of Caloric Equilibrium.
Photons is the determines of Photon Production Rate.
Quark-Gluon Plasma is the describes dynamics of of Effective Potential.
Effective Potential is the utilizes of Hard Thermal Loop (Htl).
Hard Thermal Loop (Htl) is the applies to of Loop Approximation.
Loop Approximation is the leads to of Collinear Singularities.
Quark-Antiquark Annihilation is the occurs in of Scattering.
Scattering is the affects of Photon Production.
Photon Production is the integrates with of Hydrodynamic Evolution Codes.
Effective Potential is the considers of Perturbative Expansion.
Perturbative Expansion is the explores of Multi-Loop Level.
Photon Production is the depends on of Fermion Damping Rate.
Fermion Damping Rate is the affects of Formation Length.
Formation Length is the considers of Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (Lpm) Effect.
