Optical Maser Beam is the propagate through of Turbulent Atmospheric State.
Optical Maser Beam is the important for of Remote Sense.
Optical Maser Beam is the important for of Trail.
Optical Maser Beam is the important for of Long-Length Optic Communication Theory.
Optical Maser Beam is the follow prop of of Gaussian Statistics.
Optical Maser Beam approachs Resound/Signalise Ratio.
Resound/Signalise Ratio is the limit the performance of of Communication Convey.
Part Tenacious Beam is the metamorphose into of Phase Diffusor.
Phase Diffusor adds Random Stage.
Random Stage affects Transversal Coherency Length.
Transversal Coherency Length is the ratio should be less than unity of Beam.
Random Stage is the device characteristic time should be much smaller than integration time of Integration Time.
Sensor is the average over finite interval of Integration Time.
Refractile-Index Constellation is the determines the intensity fluctuation of Scintillation Indicator.
Intensity Fluctuation computes Chroma Correlativity.
Photon Manipulator is the participate in phase fluctuation of Phase Fluctuation.
Phase Diffusor is the effect of diffusor of Beam.
