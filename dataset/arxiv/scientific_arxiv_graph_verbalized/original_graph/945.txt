Large Hadron Collider is the probes collisions of Protons.
Protons is the results in of Final-State Particles.
Protons is the leads to of Multi-Parton Interactions.
Multi-Parton Interactions is the belongs to of Double Parton Scattering.
Protons is the leads to of Parton Interactions.
Parton Interactions includes Scattering Processes.
Scattering Processes is the determines background of Standard Model Processes.
Standard Model Processes is the consists of of New Physics Particles.
Protons is the explores inner structure of Nucleons.
Meson Production requires Colour-Singlet Model.
Meson Production requires Quantum Chromodynamics.
Quantum Chromodynamics is the improves understanding of Hadronic Production.
Transverse Momentum is the depends on of Parton Distributions.
Muons is the decays into of Muons.
Centre-Of-Mass Energy is the affects of Renormalisation Scales.
Centre-Of-Mass Energy is the affects of Factorisation Scales.
