Superconducting Quantum Point Contact carrys Localized States.
Localized States confines Andreev States.
Andreev States is the exist in pairs of Energy Gap.
Energy Gap is the within of Superconductor.
Superconductor is the depends on of Phase Change.
Phase Change is the affects of Gap Energy.
Gap Energy is the within of Adiabatic Motion.
Adiabatic Motion is the indicates of Pure Ac Current.
Pure Ac Current is the leads to of Ac Josephson Effect.
Ac Josephson Effect is the study in of Non-Equilibrium Situation.
Non-Equilibrium Situation is the introduce of Microwave Radiation.
Microwave Radiation is the couple to of Frequency.
Andreev States is the determine of Resonant Optical Interlevel Transitions.
Resonant Optical Interlevel Transitions provides Energy Transfer.
Energy Transfer is the result in of Dc Current.
Dc Current affects Interference.
Interference determines Scattering Events.
Andreev Bound States is the detect by of Microwave-Induced Transitions.
Microwave-Induced Transitions is the possible to do of Transport Measurements.
Transport Measurements is the address in of Andreev Energy-Level Spectroscopy.
Andreev Energy-Level Spectroscopy is the focus on of Mesoscopic Superconductors.
Mesoscopic Superconductors haves Transport Mode.
Transport Mode determines Transparency.
Transparency applys Bias Voltage.
Bias Voltage is the move along of Adiabatic Trajectories.
Adiabatic Trajectories is the occupy in of Equilibrium.
Equilibrium is the applies to of Single-Mode Sqpc.
Single-Mode Sqpc is the applies for of Theory.
Theory determines Reflectivity.
Reflectivity is the affects of Boundary Condition.
Boundary Condition is the occur at of Resonance.
Resonance is the occur in of Non-Adiabatic Region.
Non-Adiabatic Region is the estimate by of Transition Amplitude.
Transition Amplitude is the affects of Symmetry.
Symmetry is the ensures of Orthogonality.
Orthogonality is the leads to of Delocalization.
Delocalization is the causes of Energy Transfer To The Reservoir.
Energy Transfer To The Reservoir is the resets of Equilibrium Population.
Equilibrium Population uses Quasiclassical Equation.
Quasiclassical Equation is the calculates of Current At The Junction.
