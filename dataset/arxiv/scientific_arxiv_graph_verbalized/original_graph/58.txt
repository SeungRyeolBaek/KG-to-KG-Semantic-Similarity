Sunspot Number is the varies periodically with of Average Period.
Individual Cycle Period is the varies randomly with of Strength.
Stronger Cycles haves Shorter Periods.
Waldmeier Effect is the explains of Anti-Correlation.
Rise Time is the anti-correlated with of Peak Sunspot Number.
Rise Rate is the positively correlated with of Peak Sunspot Number.
Grand Minima bes Periods.
Grand Minima occurs 1645-1715.
Cosmogenic Isotope Data reports Grand Minima.
Flux Transport Dynamo Model bes Turbulent Diffusivity.
Flux Transport Dynamo Model is the leads to two kinds of flux transport dynamo model : high diffusivity model and low diffusivity model of High Diffusivity Model.
High Diffusivity Model is the uses diffusivity value of @ xmath3 @ xmath4 s @ xmath5 of Diffusivity.
Low Diffusivity Model is the uses diffusivity value of @ xmath6 @ xmath4 s @ xmath5 of Diffusivity.
Mixing Length Theory gives Diffusivity.
