Experiments investigates Superfluidity.
Superfluid Hydrodynamics Equations expands Low Velocities.
Thermodynamic Quantities is the dependent on of Superfluid Velocity.
Thermodynamic Functions imposes Thermodynamic Inequalities.
Thermodynamic Stability is the ensures of Thermodynamic Functions.
Entropy is the maximizes of Energy Minimality.
Total Energy is the integral of of Energy Density.
Energy Density obtains Mass Density.
Energy Density is the function of of Momentum Density.
Momentum Density is the parallel to of Superfluid Velocity.
Mass Flux is the leaves unchanged of Conserved Quantities.
Mass Flux is the relative to of Momentum.
Mass Flux conserves Superfluid Velocity.
Stability Criteria is the increases of Total Energy.
Quasiparticles is the contribute to of Free Energy.
Excitation Spectrum obtains Free Energy.
Temperature is the at normal pressure of Pressure.
Quasiparticles describes Critical Temperature.
Orifice Shape is the affects of Vortex-Related Critical Velocity.
Orifice Shape is the reaches in thermodynamic limit of Stability Criterion.
Stability Criterion is the explains experimental results of Critical Velocity.
Kramer employs Phonon-Roton Model.
Kramer obtains Critical Velocity.
Kramer uses Phonon-Roton Model.
