Main Sequence Stars reveals Companions.
Companions is the under 5 m @ xmath6/ @ xmath7 of Masses.
Companions is the unknown of Orbital Inclination.
Planetary Companions is the formation of Circumstellar Disks.
Planetary Companions follows Gravitational Perturbations.
Semimajor Axes is the less than 2.5 au of Jupiters.
Semimajor Axes is the most being less than 0.3 au of Jupiters.
Orbital Migration is the drags planets inward of Gaseous Protoplanetary Disk.
Brown Dwarf Companions is the less than @ xmath111 % of Frequency.
Brown Dwarf Companions is the occur with a frequency less than @ xmath111 % of Dwarfs.
Brown Dwarf Companions is the at masses 10 80 m @ xmath6 , within 5 au of Brown Dwarf Desert.
M Dwarfs is the first apparent planetary companion of Gliese 876.
Gliese 876 is the 10.1 of V Magnitude.
Gliese 876 is the m4v of Spectral Type.
Gliese 876 is the 0.213 of Parallax.
Gliese 876 is the 0.0124 l @ xmath5 of Luminosity.
Gliese 876 is the 0.32 @ xmath3 0.03 m @ xmath5 of Mass.
Gliese 876 is the older than @ xmath111 gyr of Chromospherically Inactive.
Gliese 876 is the age less than 10 gyr of Space Motion.
Gliese 876 is the metal poor by a factor of 23 relative to the sun of Metallicity.
Gliese 876 obtains Doppler Shifts.
Doppler Shifts uses Hamilton And Hires Echelle Spectrometers.
Hamilton And Hires Echelle Spectrometers superimposes Iodine Absorption Lines.
Doppler Shifts obtains Velocity Measurements.
Velocity Measurements is the independent keplerian fits of Orbital Parameters.
Orbital Parameters bases Orbit.
Orbit is the 60.85 @ xmath3 0.15 d of Orbital Period.
Orbit is the 0.27 @ xmath3 0.03 of Eccentricity.
Orbit is the 0.21 @ xmath3 0.01 au of Orbital Semi-Major Axis.
Orbit is the 2.1 @ xmath3 0.2 m @ xmath6 of Minimum Mass.
Velocity Measurements is the apparent from the raw data of Radial Velocity Variation.
Radial Velocity Variation is the apparent from the fits of Orbit.
Orbit rules Stellar Companions.
Orbit dominates Gravitational Scattering.
Gravitational Scattering is the lead to dramatic orbit changes of Orbit Crossings.
Orbit Crossings is the lead to eccentric orbits of Global Instabilities.
Orbit Crossings is the lead to circular orbits of Gas In A Protoplanetary Disk.
Equilibrium Temperature is the too cold for liquid form of Water.
Water is the with the giant planet discovered here of Mean Motion Resonances.
Hipparcos Astrometry is the analysis of Gliese 876.
Nasa Grant is the support of Sun Microsystems.
Nsf Grant is the support of Sun Microsystems.
Sun Microsystems is the allocations of Telescope Time.
