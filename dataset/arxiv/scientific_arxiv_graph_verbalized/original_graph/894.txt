Xmath0 is the mean of of Xmath72.
Extinction Curve Determination is the result from of Systematic Errors.
Extinction Curve Determination is the result from of Biased Xmath46 Values.
Biased Xmath46 Values uses Wegner S ( 2002 ) Calibration.
Extinction Curve expresss Color Excesses To Xmath46 Ratio.
Xmath0 Value is the depends on of Color Excesses To Xmath46 Ratio.
Adopted Xmath46 Calibration is the will of Influence.
Set Of Xmath46 Values is the unknown of More Appropriate.
Difference In Obtained Xmath0 Values is the indicator of of Systematic Error.
