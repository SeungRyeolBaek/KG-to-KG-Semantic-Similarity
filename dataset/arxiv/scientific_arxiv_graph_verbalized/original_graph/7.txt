Comsol Multiphysics Software is the utilized of Linear Optical Response.
Simulation constructs Sic Pillar.
Sic Pillar applys Floquet Boundary Conditions.
Sic Pillar applys Periodic Boundary Conditions.
P-Polarized Plane Wave launchs Sic Pillar.
Sic Pillar records Electric Field.
Electric Field translates Nonlinear Polarization.
Nonlinear Polarization considers Scattered Electric Field.
Scattered Electric Field generates Shg Output.
Fundamental Frequency uses Sic Susceptibilities.
Shg Spectra calculates Samples.
Input Power Density is the kept constant for calculations of Shg Output Power.
Shg Output Power normalizes Area.
Shg Spectra demonstrates Peak.
Peak corresponds Sphp Monopole Mode.
