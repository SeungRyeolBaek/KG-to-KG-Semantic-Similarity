Open Connectome Project is the annotate of 3D Volume Of Neural Em Data.
3D Volume Of Neural Em Data is the connect of Connectome.
Connectome is the elucidate structure and function of Human Brain.
Open Connectome Project is the automatically annotate of Axoplasmic Reticula.
Operating Point is the achieve of High Precision.
High Precision is the enable of Contextual Inference.
Axoplasmic Reticula is the present only in of Axons.
Axoplasmic Reticula is the inform of Surrounding Process.
Brain Data is the use of Color Correction.
Color Correction applys Filters.
Filters is the use of Bilateral Filter.
Bilateral Filter is the consist of of 2D Gaussian Kernel.
Bilateral Filter is the consist of of 1D Gaussian Kernel.
Bilateral Filter is the calculate of Normalization Factor.
Bilateral Filter is the preserve of Edges.
Bilateral Filter is the preserve of Detail.
Bilateral Filter is the cause of Color Bleeding.
Color Bleeding is the undo of Laplacian Sharpening.
Laplacian Sharpening is the compute difference of Intensity.
Intensity is the highlight of Edges.
Morphological Region Growing Algorithm is the locate of Dark Pixels.
