Multistep Compound Processes is the describes of Nuclear Well.
Nuclear Well considers Particle-Hole States.
Bogila Et Al. is the opinion about of Particle-Hole States.
Particle-Hole States involves Excited-Particle Level Density.
Excited-Particle Level Density is the determines of S.P.L. Density.
S.P.L. Density corrects Finite-Depth Correction.
Reaction Calculations considers Reaction Calculations.
Green S Function calculates S.P.L. Density.
Green S Function calculates Strutinski Smoothing Procedure.
Woods-Saxon Potential considers S.P.L. Density.
Woods-Saxon Potential considers Thomas-Fermi Formula.
Thomas-Fermi Formula is the produces of Fgm Shape.
Fgm Shape calculates S.P.L. Density.
S.P.L. Density affects Effective Interaction Strength.
