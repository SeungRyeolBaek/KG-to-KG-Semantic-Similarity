Star Formation Rate is the sets rate of growth and evolution of Galaxies.
Star Formation Rate is the important measure for understanding hierarchical build-up over cosmic time of Universe.
Simulations is the show unregulated star formation leads to overabundance of high mass galaxies of Star Formation.
Star Formation is the must be stopped or quenched before galaxies grow too big of Galaxies.
Supermassive Black Holes harbors Galaxies.
Supermassive Black Holes is the grow through accretion of cold material of Accretion.
Accretion is the converts gravitational energy of cold material into radiation evident across electromagnetic spectrum of Radiation.
Supermassive Black Holes is the deposit energy into interstellar medium through jets of Jets.
Jets is the heat or remove gas through powerful outflows of Outflows.
Outflows is the manifest as feedback processes of Feedback Processes.
Dust is the fills interstellar medium and plays role in heating and cooling of Interstellar Medium.
Dust is the contributes to radiative output in infrared regime of Galaxies.
Dust is the obscures view of agn of Agn.
Dust thinks Torus.
Torus is the absorbs and re-emits optical and uv light as ir radiation of Agn.
Spectral Energy Distribution Models is the suggest torus mainly emits in mid-infrared regime of Torus.
Observations is the support torus emitting in mid-infrared regime of Torus.
