Giant Magnetoresistance Effect is the development of Spintronics.
Spintronics is the generation , control , manipulation of Spin-Polarized Currents.
Spintronics promises Spin-Orbit Interactions.
Spin-Orbit Interactions is the tunability of Rashba Interaction.
Rashba Interaction suggests Datta And Das.
Datta And Das is the proposal of Spin Field-Effect Transistor.
Spin Field-Effect Transistor is the experimental overcoming of limitations of Quasi-Two Dimensional Structures.
Quasi-Two Dimensional Structures is the analysis of intersubband coupling effects of Multichannel Quantum Wires.
