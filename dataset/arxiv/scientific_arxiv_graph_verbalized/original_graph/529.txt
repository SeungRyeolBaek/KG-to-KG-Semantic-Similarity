Spectral Function is the defines of Integrated Spectral Function.
Integrated Spectral Function is the defines of Step Functions.
Step Functions is the identifies of Energy Values.
Step Functions is the identifies of Linewidth.
Energy Values is the determines of Energy Spacing.
Energy Spacing bes Line Width.
Line Width is the scales with of Scaling.
Scaling is the challenge of Difference Between Mean And Typical Line Width.
Procedure For Determining The Linewidth is the explains of Line Width.
Probability Distribution Of The Linewidth is the depends on of Coupling To The Bath.
Probability Distribution Of The Linewidth is the depends on of System.
Probability Distribution Of The Linewidth is the depends on of Disorder Configurations.
