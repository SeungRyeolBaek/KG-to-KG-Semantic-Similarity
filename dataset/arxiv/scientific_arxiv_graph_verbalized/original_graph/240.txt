Magnetic Field Energy Density is the decreases over time of Simulation.
Simulation is the dissipation of Currents.
Currents is the converts into of Thermal Energy.
Thermal Energy deposits Chromospheric Plasma.
Waves is the causes heating of Chromospheric Plasma.
Poynting Flux is the absorption of Chromosphere.
Magnetic Flux Tube is the generates of Magneto-Acoustic Oscillations.
Magnetic Flux Tube is the generates of Mhd Waves.
Magnetic Flux Tube is the generates of Alfvn Waves.
Source Amplitude is the causes heating of Thermal Energy.
Velocity Power Spectrum is the affects of Chromosphere.
