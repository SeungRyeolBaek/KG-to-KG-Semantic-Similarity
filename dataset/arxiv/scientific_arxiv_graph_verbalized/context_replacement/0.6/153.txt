David Dinsdale collaborates Approximate Calculation.
Approximate Calculation is the focuses on of Event Shape Observables.
Event Shape Observables is the utilizes of Method Of Effective Charges.
Method Of Effective Charges is the combination with of Zero-Point Field Theory.
Method Of Effective Charges is the application to event shape distributions of Renormalization Group.
Beta-Function Equation is the satisfies of Dimensionful Constant.
Beta-Function Equation is the dependent on of Leading Coefficient.
Beta-Function Equation is the reduces to of Rs-Invariant.
Scattering Coefficient is the dependent on of Energy Scale.
Scattering Coefficient is the dependent on of Renormalization Factor.
Mass Balance is the uses of Saddle Point.
Saddle Point is the determines power corrections of Parton Subprocesses.
Power Corrections is the affects of Event Shape Observables.
