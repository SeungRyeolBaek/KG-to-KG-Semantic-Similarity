Recognition is the consists of of Classification.
Recognition is the involves of Object.
Classification is the key for achieving of Technique.
Technique uses Object.
Object generates Model.
Object compares Image.
Object calculates Shape.
Object is the part of of Training Set.
Training Set groups Coordinate Set.
Coordinate Set uses Algorithm.
Algorithm is the organizes data into of System.
System is the maps data into of Data.
Data uses Model.
Model obtains Shape.
Shape uses Asm.
Asm is the establishes of 3D Model.
3D Model verifys Point Correspondence.
Point Correspondence establishs Equal Space Landmarking.
