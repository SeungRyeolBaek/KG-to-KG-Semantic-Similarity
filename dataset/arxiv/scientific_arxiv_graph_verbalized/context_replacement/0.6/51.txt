High Spin States is the phase transition of Two-Dimensional Square Lattice.
Spin Interactions is the lead to problems of Spin Models.
Spin Models bes Antiferromagnet.
Antiferromagnet is the on square lattice of Two-Dimensional Square Lattice.
Antiferromagnet is the with nearest-neighbor and non-nearest-neighbor spin exchange interactions of Magnetic Interactions.
Magnetic Interactions is the result in phases at small and very large values of Short-Range Ordered Phases.
Short-Range Ordered Phases is the transition to quantum ground state of Ground State.
Quantum States characterizes Spin Orientation.
Ground State is the second order from nel to quantum ground state of Phase Transition.
Phase Transition is the first order from intermediate to quantum ground state of Quantum States.
Cubic Lattice is the results in band gap of Band Gap Experiment.
Band Gap Experiment is the suggest stability of Spin-Lattice Calculations.
Spin-Lattice Calculations is the due to 3-fold symmetry of Cubic Lattice.
Cubic Lattice is the determines spin correlation function of Spin Correlation Function.
Spin Correlation Function affects Quantum Fluctuations.
Quantum Fluctuations is the role in phase diagram of Phase Transition.
Mean Field uses Variational Method.
