Standard Model is the source of of Cp Violation.
Cp Violation is the main source is of Kobayashi-Maskawa Phase.
Kobayashi-Maskawa Phase locates Unitarity Region.
Unitarity Region is the part of of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa Phase.
Experimental Results detects Cp Violation.
Experimental Results is the yields of World Temperature.
Angles expects Charmless Phase.
Charmless Phase is the cp violation of of Angles.
Experimental Results introduces Penguin Decay.
Penguin Decay is the context of of String Theory.
Error Corrections is the calculations of of Hadronic Parameters.
Hadronic Parameters works String Theory.
Penguin Decay expresss Parameter.
Physical Quantities expresss Physical Quantities.
Physical Quantities is the measurement of of Observables.
Observables fixs Unitarity Triangle.
Penguins is the counting and taking of Unitarity Triangle.
Unitarity Triangle rules Hadronic Violation.
Hadronic Parameters determines Unitarity Triangle.
Hadronic Parameters calculates Su(2) Model.
