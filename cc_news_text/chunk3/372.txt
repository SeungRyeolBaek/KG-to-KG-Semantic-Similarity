EEC 6300/6500 series AC power source capable of outputting up to 300kVA
EEC designed its 6300 and 6500 lines of power sources to handle today’s most demanding industrial and manufacturing environments. Both lines are ideally suited to powering electrical motors, handling application in the aerospace and transportation sectors, and testing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. The broader control provided by the optional, fully adjustable 360-440Hz and 760 – 840 Hz makes these power source products particularly suitable to aerospace testing applications.
“We see growth among many emerging industries utilizing high-power to test their new energy products and components, such as air-conditioning systems, large industrial electric motors, and electrical power charging stations, which demand high-power sources to simulate the real-world conditions and power-supply variations,” said Brian Chen, EEC General Manager. “The 6300 and 6500 series are our answer to this high demand. The 6300 series is the most powerful tri-phase AC source that EEC has ever built, with up to 300kVA output, which is suitable for a wide range of applications.”
Both the 6300 and 6500 series include BNC connectivity for universal control of PLC; automatic voltage adjustment via EEC proprietary Over Current Fold (OCF) for activating DUT; and LED frequency, voltage, current, and power status displays.
EEC’s new 6300 and 6500 series power sources raise the bar on the company’s already exemplary catalog of premium power source and testing equipment, designed to assure the highest level of safety and quality assurance.
