High Accuracy Digimatic Micrometer
The first micrometer to offer 0.1µm/5µinch resolution measurement. The High-Accuracy Digimatic® Micrometer utilizes the Absolute® rotary sensor, which reduces instrument error to ±0.5µm to deliver high-accuracy with no trade-off in operability. Features an extremely rigid frame for stable measurement and a constant-force barrel/spindle mechanism eliminates the possibility of over speed errors. Transference of body heat reduced with use of a dual heat shield design, minimizing errors attributable to thermal expansion while handheld measurements are performed. Available with SPC Output.
QuantuMike Series 293-Coolant Proof Micrometer
Up to 4X faster spindle feed over standard micrometers. 2mm per thimble-revolution as compared to the standard 0.5mm. An additional comparison to conventional micrometers, QuantuMike’s spindle positioning time is reduced by about 60 percent, while overall measurement time is decreased by as much as 35 percent. QuantuMike provides accuracy at an industry-leading ±1μm/.00005” throughout its measuring range. Rated a high IP65, the QuantuMike Series is totally protected from dust and protected against low pressure liquid or coolant jets. Available with SPC Output.
IP67 ABSOLUTE Digimatic Coolant-proof Calipers
Calipers rated a high IP67, total protecting the tool from dust and if immersed in liquid or coolant for a short period, will still work at 100 percent measuring accuracy. A Larger LCD of 9 mm, a 22 percent increase in height for improved visibility. The automatic power on/off shuts down the LCD after 20 minutes of inactivity, but the ABS scale origin is unaffected. Power is restored to the display when the slider is moved. Available with SPC Output.
