The Ball family’s off-court whims are starting to affect the fortunes of LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball on the court at Prienu Vytautas. After spending much of the previous week on vacation in Barcelona, Melo missed Monday’s 82-79 loss at Alytaus Dzukija with an illness while Gelo came off the bench and sat during most of his club’s crunch-time run.
BC Vytautas nearly completed a 20-point comeback with the help of a 19-6 fourth-quarter spurt, propelled by an all-Lithuanian lineup. After the game, head coach Virginijus Seskus suggested the shift in tactics was spurred on by the Balls’ absence from practice during their Spanish excursion.
“We had an abnormal situation,” Seskus explained, according to a translation. “They went to Spain for five days, Gelo with his parents, and they were not at practice. I gave Gelo 26 minutes today, which I think is fair according to the situation.
“My team is a team. They were getting ready all week. But things are the way they are. What can you do?”
If you’re in Seskus’ shoes you can begin by doing what he did: benching one of the brothers at the start and for most of the finish.
That Big Baller-imposed double standard wasn’t all that seemed to rankle Seskus in this case. He wasn’t pleased with the selfish, single-minded play he saw from Gelo amid a 14-point (6-of-13 from the field, 2-of-4 from three), six-rebound, zero-assist performance from the 19-year-old.
“We did not give a free Gelo the ball a couple of times,” Seskus admitted. “Gelo then drove the ball forward too far alone.”
With smarter play and greater participation in practice, LiAngelo should be able himself back into the coach’s good graces. It’s tough not to wonder, though, whether the family’s own designs—including the pursuit of more interesting content for Facebook’s “Ball in the Family”—might be infringing on the kids’ abilities to succeed as professional basketball players overseas.
