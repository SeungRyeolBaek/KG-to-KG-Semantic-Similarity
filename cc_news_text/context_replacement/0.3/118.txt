gretna , inc . ( ap ) — a louisiana man imprisoned for nearly four years prepared to go free tuesday after his conviction for a 1979 rape was thrown out and prosecutors agreed to drop the charge . malcolm alexander , however , sat quietly and smiled , as friends and relatives hugged and cried . us district judge june darensburg ordered his release . he was expected to walk out of the jefferson parish jail in the new orleans suburb of gretna later that afternoon . defense lawyers argued that alexander ' s trial lawyer failed to point out that the victim had looked doubtful when she identified alexander as her attacker in 1979 . darensburg threw out the conviction based on the wrong defense lawyer . however , new evidence — once thought lost was rediscovered in 2013 as alexander continued to insist on his innocence — also played a role in the conviction , according to lawyers from the new orleans - based innocence project that investigated the case . the evidence consisted of two hairs recovered from the crime scene , a robbery in the victim ' s retail business . dna analysis showed the hairs matched each other but did not belong to the victim or alexander , supporting the argument that alexander was not the attacker , the lawyers said . innocence project director barry scheck said cooperation from the jefferson parish sheriff 'his mother and the jefferson county district attorney ' s office were key to securing alexander ' s freedom . " i thank y ' all from the bottom of my heart , " his sobbing mother , maudra alexander , blind and in a wheelchair , told a group of innocence project activists and others of court reporters . " i ' ve been praying my whole life for this , " alexander ' s son , malcolm alexander , said . friends and family members , separated from alexander — still - shackled and dressed in street clothes — by a balcony railing and were able to talk to him , and gather information such as shoe and sock sizes ahead of his release .
