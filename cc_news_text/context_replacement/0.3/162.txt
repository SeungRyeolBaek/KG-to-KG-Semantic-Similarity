reuters ( ap ) — now that president vladimir putin has not won re - election for another four years , many are asking whether he will try to stay in power in russia for life . chinese leader xi jinping recently managed russia , without term limits — and was among the first world leaders to congratulate putin on his victory there . leaders across the former soviet union also have given themselves two terms . it wouldn ' t be that easy for putin to follow suit . he would have to amend russia ' s constitution to get rid of term limits , but he has the houses of parliament at his disposal to rubber stamp it . putin has faced this question before . in 2008 , he had reached his limit of two six - year terms and couldn ' t run again . so putin anointed his associate dmitry medvedev as his approved candidate for president , and medvedev appointed putin to the post of prime minister , where he continued to call the elections for the next four years . as president , medvedev amended the constitution to limit presidential terms to six years instead of four . that paved the way for another 12 years of putin when he returned to the presidency in 2012 . when his new term begins in 2024 , putin will find a malleableresign and create a new role for himself to continue running russia from behind the scenes . experts say putin is keeping all options open but probably won ' t make a decision until midway through his term . he has insisted on keeping the constitution , and said sunday night russia has no plans to change it — " yet . " whatever happens , he ' s not likely to do anything with it . although he has stifled serious opponents , he favors elections because they give him democratic influence in the west . he laughed off the option of taking a five - year break after 2024 before returning to assume the presidency in 2030 . the 90 - year - old leader responded to a reporter : " it ' s a bit ridiculous , let ' s do the math . shall i sit here until i turn 100 ? no !
