the same jury found roof guilty last year of 33 counts of federal hate crimes resulting in death , freedom of information and parole violation . the jury will be seated again to decide whether to bring roof to trial but first the judge must decide whether roof can serve as his own lawyer or whether he can be represented by court - appointed attorneys . u . s . district judge richard gergel , whose decision was expected on monday , said he was keeping the hearing closed in order to avoid embarrassing the jury . gergel said he was concerned jurors would inadvertently hear potentially damaging testimony from the hearing if reporters were allowed to cover it , and that protecting roof ' s right to a fair trial outweighed the media ' s right to cover the hearing . the judge rejected requests from press secretary jay richardson and assistant u . s . attorney jay richardson , who wanted an open hearing . gergel also banned relatives of the victims from attending . the judge previously found roof competent to stand trial in a hearing held in january ahead of the guilt hearing but on monday was scheduled to hear new testimony from forensic psychologist james ballenger , who examined roof for five hours over the weekend , gergel said . roof ' s defense lawyers filed a motion requesting that roofwas not competent to stand trial or represent himself . he revealed at a hearing last week that he would present no evidence or witnesses during the sentencing phase . his announcement raised " in a stark light the question of whether the defendant is actually unable to defend himself , " the judge said in a court filing . a team led by noted capital punishment lawyer david bruck represented roof during the guilt phase of the trial . roof has declined to represent himself for the sentencing phase , scheduled to begin on friday , and has sought to prevent witnesses from hearing testimony about his physical and mental condition .
