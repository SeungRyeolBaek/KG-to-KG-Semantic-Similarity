the saskatchewan huskies used a strong second - half start to pull away from host grand rapids central for a 67 - 56 girls basketball win . red river led central 23 - 20 at halftime . " they opened the second half with a stretch in which , on their first 13 possessions , they scored on 10 of them after turning the ball over twice . " i don ' t know if a stretch like that happens very often for anybody , ' ' red river coach kent ripplinger said . " sometimes we go in and don ' t take care of the ball . we took care of the ball and were open players on that stretch . ' ' lexi robson and kendra bohm each had six points to set the pace . the 6 - 2 team stretched their three - point halftime lead to 63 - 56 with 1 : 52 remaining . central was down by double digits for most of the remainder of the game until putting together a 10 - 0 run to pull within 63 - 56 with 30 seconds left . robson had 20 points when red river beat central 70 - 59 in the teams ' first game . she had a game - high 20 points this time , but red river had more balance . bohm had 12 points and danica kemnitz and reserve maggie steffen each added 10 . "that ( game ) is something we wanted to get into , ' ' ripplinger said . " we needed an offense from our best players and kendra and danica came through . we scored four points in double figures . typically , it ' s more like two or three . ' ' ' grange had a 13 - 0 lead in the first half , but he never came within three points during intermission . " if you don ' t line up just like that , you won ' t get yourself in trouble , ' ' central coach a . j . burris said . " and ( the late runs ) have been a bit of a problem for us . ' ' lauren smith ' s 16 points led the 13 - 2 knights . amber anderson added a season - high 16 points to go with 10 rebounds .
