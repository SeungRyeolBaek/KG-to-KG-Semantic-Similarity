taipei ( taiwan city ) — many people know that zhuzihu ( 竹 子 [UNK] ) ) is home to yangmingshan ' s water ##works , but few have any idea that the area located between the ’ ##山 mt . tatun and mt . qixing was the earliest cultivation base of ponlai rice ( japonica rice ) when taiwan was under japanese colonial rule ( 1895 to 1945 ) . a couple of trails in zhuzihu have been renovated and connected by taiwan ’ ##川 geotechnical engineering office ( geo ) to serve as a reminder of the local rice culture in the old days . during the japanese colonial period , a japanese expedition found that the zhuzihu area was very suitable for growing fine - grained japanese rice , because the area was located in hilly terrain , the temperatures were low and the soil quality was good . therefore , planting of rice began in the area as early as in the 1930s . the geo reported that with the water trail ( 水 車 [UNK] ) and dinghu ( [UNK] [UNK] ) as the center , the japanese had connected the old liao trail , which was used for hauling rice in the old days , with the newly renovated rice ditch trail ( 水 [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) to form a circular trailnetwork . for your connection with the historic rice culture of this area , start a guided tour from the zhuzihu ponlai rice - and - story garden ( 竹 子 [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] 事 [UNK] ) , stroll the trails between the rice fields and the gardens , and end the tour at the historic site of the ponlai cultivation ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] 原 [UNK] 田 ) , the geo museum . members of the public are advised to take routes s8 and s9 and get off at zhuzihu ( hutian elementary school ) . walk for 30 minutes along the hua liao river to reach the irrigation ditch trail ; the whole walk takes about 30 minutes .
