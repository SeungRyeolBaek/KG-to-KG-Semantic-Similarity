the symbol of the london skyline and soundscape , big ben , is falling silent for four years . the bell will continue its daily tolling while major repairs are made to the famous clock tower that towers over the palace of westminster , the home of the british parliament . the massive bell will strike the hour for the last time at noon on dec . 31 and then pause for four years while the elizabeth building , which houses the great clock and the parliament bell , aka big ben , are repaired . a larger restoration of the parliament bell is likely to occur in the early 2020s , according to a parliament spokesman . quieting big ben ' s mighty bongs will also improve the hearing of those involved in the restoration . the keeper of the great clock , steve jaggs , said in a statement that the pause " is a significant step in this crucial conservation project . " if you ' re in london on monday you may have to accept jaggs ' invitation to gather in parliament square " to hear big ben ' s mighty bongs until they return in 2021 . " however , big ben will still bong for important national events such as new year ' s eve and remembrance sunday . the great clock has chimed at every hour for the past 157 years . it has had previous breaks in thefor maintenance and conservation in 2007 , in 1983 - 1985 and in 1976 . the 1 . 7 - ton clock , which was forged in the 1850s , is accompanied by three bells that ring out each quarter hour . the great clock has a victorian - era clockwork mechanism that triggers the bell and chimes . that mechanism and the tower ' s clock faces will also be exposed , which will allow the clock to remain visible . to make sure londoners don ' t get too close and lose sight of the correct face , jaggs says at least one clock face will remain visible . it will keep time with the aid of a small electric motor , while the victorian clock is being repaired .
