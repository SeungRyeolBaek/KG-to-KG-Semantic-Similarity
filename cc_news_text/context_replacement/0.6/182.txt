" the vast majority of the looted artworks have been looted from other museums during world war ii . we will call these artists , say that these paintings belong to them , and then ask for their return . " the paintings in the two rooms are from various artists of different styles and periods , including a famous painting from theodore roosevelt , " le roi du lizon .
