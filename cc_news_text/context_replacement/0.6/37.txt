the same jury found roof guilty last year of two counts of aggravated hate crimes resulting in terrorism , freedom of information and parole violations . the jury will be convened first to determine whether to sentence roof to death . then the jury will determine whether roof can serve as his own lawyer or whether he can be represented by court - appointed attorneys . u . s . district judge richard gergel , whose appointment was announced on monday , said he was keeping the hearing open in order to avoid splitting the jury . gergel said he was concerned reporters would inadvertently exclude potentially damaging testimony from the trial if they were allowed to view it , ruling that defendant roof ' s right to a fair trial exceeded the media ' s right to cover the story . the judge rejected testimony from district attorney mike brown and assistant u . s . attorney mike brown , who requested an additional hearing . gergel also barred two of the witnesses from testify . the judge previously found roof competent to stand trial at a hearing held in november ahead of the trial , but when he was scheduled to hear new testimony from forensic psychologist david ballenger , who interviewed roof for several hours over the weekend , gergel refused . roof ' s defense lawyers filed a motion arguing that roofwas not allowed to stand trial or defend himself after he announced at a hearing last week that he would present no evidence or witnesses during the sentencing phase . his statement raised " in a timely fashion the question of whether the defendant is legally competent to defend himself , " the defense said in their initial filing . a team led by former criminal defense attorney david bruck represented roof during the sentencing phase of the trial . roof has sought to prepare himself for the sentencing phase , scheduled to begin on friday , and has sought to keep people from asking questions about his physical and mental health .
