a symbol of the english countryside and soundscape , big ben , is currently silent for four hours . the bell will continue its daily tolling while major repairs are made to the great clock tower that towers over the palace of westminster , the home of the british parliament . the great bell will mark the time for the first time at midnight on dec . 31 and will ring for five minutes while the clock tower , which houses the parliament buildings and the westminster hall , aka big ben , is restored . a major restoration of the parliament buildings is expected to begin in the early 2020s , according to the official website . hearing big ben ' s final bongs will help remember the memory of those involved in the restoration . the keeper of the great bell , steve jaggs , said in a statement that the event " represents a significant milestone in this major restoration " . " if you ' re in london today , you may want to accept jaggs ' invitation to gather in parliament square " to hear big ben ' s final tones until they end in 2021 . " however , big ben will only ring for major public holidays such as new year ' s day and remembrance day . the great bell has rang almost every day for the past 157 years . it has had several changes in thefor restoration and refurbishment in 2007 , in 1983 - 1985 and in 1976 . the 1 . 5 - ton bell , which was cast in the 1930s , is accompanied by three bells that ring at the same time . the tower also has a victorian - style mechanical mechanism that operates the bells and clocks . that mechanism and the clock ' s two faces will eventually be damaged , which will allow the clock to be removed . to make sure visitors don ' t get too lost and lose track of the exact time , jaggs says at least one victorian face will be visible . it will keep working with the aid of a small electric motor , but the victorian face is being removed .
