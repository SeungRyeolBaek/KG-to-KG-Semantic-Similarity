source : getty in an interview with time , the newly - married scarlett johansson discussed her ideas about marriage , love and whether or not she ’ " “ " ” to want to be with the same man forever and ever . writing in the magazine , she made a number of very convincing arguments against the practice of marriage . even more interesting was the interview . bbc news reported that the interview was actually conducted after her divorce from romain dauriac . even if that were to be the case , none of the stuff she ’ has said is very interesting . “ well , with a divorce can ’ be a loss , right ? with that ’ is a path . you have to find a path . i think the idea of marriage is not natural ; it ’ is a dangerous thing , and the practice of marriage can be a very dangerous thing . i don ’ ##t think it ’ is natural to be a married woman . i should be sorry for that , but i think it ’ s natural . it ’ s a lot of natural . ” it ’ not so natural to have these feelings of love and get married , but after hearing the rest of what she has to say , i feel that scarjo is becoming even more natural —or at the very least , getting married . and “ getting married is different than not being married , and anybody who tells you that is ’ all the time is wrong . it changes everything . i have friends who were married for ten years and have decided to get married , and i ’ ll ask them on their wedding day , right now if it ’ is wrong , and it probably is . it is . ” “ the fact that marriage is not fun for so many , — for everyone — the point of that is that it is not a bad thing , ” she thinks of it . for what it ’ is worth , she and her husband are putting on a united front . [ entertainment weekly ] - yes , they kidnapped alanis morissette and stole $ 2 million worth of jewelry from her brentwood apartment . not , according to sources , the couple escaped with “ large bag containing over $ 2 million worth of jewelry and other jewelry and money . ” morrissette wasn ’ ##t ##m at the time , so at least that ’ is that . there ’ is also this : tmz refers to several “ law enforcement officials ” who have claimed that the instagram videos are like toys for children — the very same accusations made by them against kim kardashi##an ’ - day , saturday . a quick look into alanis ’ - insta - this , which was probably the reason for the visit ? a study of her ‘ clothes . a quick study of kilim ##s , socks and a variety of shoes . very good , highly recommended . # [ people ] # # ’ ##t know what this guy looked like , but # # ’ ##t think it ’ a german geller .
