" the reason for this is that the family of british columbia has made mental health , especially for young people , a major part of their philanthropic activities . he said he wanted to make a difference . he and the rest of his side of the family remain “ ' unknown ” to the world , which often requires more self - confidence than one would expect from a normal person . especially for them .
