australia ( ap ) — new coach bert van marwijk is confident australia will qualify from the 2018 world cup group stage and that he will make the team follow his lead to get there . a few days after arriving in sydney on arrival , the new coach said in a press conference that there was nothing wrong with the style of his predecessor , ange postecoglou , and that he is a " good coach " who will do what it takes to win . postecoglou was criticised at first for playing with a three - man defensive line , and for australia ' s style of play in front of goal in some games when missed penalties forced them into the long road back to europe . he quit as coach in just a month after leading australia to a one - point world cup victory over japan . " i have respect for the new coach , ( but ) i do it with my heart , " van marwijk said . " i go to the world cup with the only thing that matters , ( and that ' s ) to reach the final " . australia will play in group b of the world cup with germany , italy and japan . " i ' m a good coach , " van marwijk said . " i like australian football , i liketo have the fun , but to always try to do — that is the most important thing . " van marwijk said his biggest challenge was the short time that he had to align himself with the other players before the world cup finals in australia . the 34 - year - old player first entered the transfer window in january , when australia faces germany and sweden in germany , and then a friendly match in sweden . " i want to get to know the players very well in a very short time , " he said . " that makes the challenge for me even bigger . " van marwijk , who led saudi arabia to direct players from australia ' s squad as an assistant coach , described himself as the socceroos ' greatest asset . " they are very , very physical , " he said . " the challenge is to make them play in a way that gives them a chance to win games . "
