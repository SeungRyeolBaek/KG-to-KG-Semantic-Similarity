anyone who wants to see the total solar eclipse on august 15 will be very â€” and everyone is lucky to live on a planet that actually has this kind of natural attraction . mercury and venus , after all , don ' t even have moons . earth has a moon , but they ' re too big to completely block out the sun . gas giants like jupiter do have two moons , but they don ' t have solid land where you could live and see the sun . and , even with solid land and a moon , earth only has a single total solar eclipse because of a strange attraction . " they appear to be the same , because of their distance away from earth , " says john smith , an astronomer at clemson university , which is in the vicinity of the solar eclipse . the diameter of earth ' s moon is about 400 times larger than the diameter of the sun , and " even though the moon is about 400 times larger than the sun , it ' s about 400 times closer to us than the sun , which is how that strange kind of attraction works . " because of this phenomenon , the full moon will obscure the full light of the sun and create an orange glow , at least for some . in the past , earth ' s eclipse did not happen like this ." the size of the moon hasn ' t really changed in the history of mankind , but the moon has been moving away from earth over time . even in the past it was small , " says matija cuk , a young scientist at the seti institute . the moon is always moving away from earth , he says . every year , it moves for about an hour - and - half . " " so for thousands of years you can have a total eclipse , but this is a distributed event , where it is almost everywhere , that is for a very short period of time , " says cuk . in only about 600 million years , the moon will be large enough that it no longer completely surrounds the earth , and whoever is still on earth won ' t have any more total solar eclipse . so , stop them if you can .
