gretna , inc . ( ap ) — a black man who for over 20 years prepared to walk out , after his conviction in the 1979 case was thrown out and he refused to drop the case . malcolm alexander , 58 , sat quietly and wept , while friends and relatives clapped and cheered . federal district judge richard darensburg ordered his release . alexander was expected to walk out of the jefferson parish jail in the new orleans suburb of gretna on tuesday morning . defense attorneys said that alexander ' s defense had failed to point out that the victim had looked different when she identified alexander as her attacker in 1979 . darensburg threw out the case based on the supreme court ruling . however , dna evidence — previously thought impossible , discovered in 2013 by prosecutors trying to build on his innocence — also played a role in the case , according to lawyers from the new orleans - based innocence project that investigated the case . the evidence consisted of facial hair taken from the crime scene , the jail and the victim ' s grocery store . dna analysis showed the hairs matched each other but did not belong to the victim or alexander , supporting the claim that alexander was not the attacker , the lawyers said . innocence project director barry scheck said lawyers from the jefferson parish women '# ##nell and the jefferson county district attorney ' s office were close to solving alexander ' s case . " i love y ' all from the bottom of my heart , " his elderly mother , maudra alexander , frail and in a wheelchair , told a group of innocence project lawyers and others as court reporters . " i ' ve been waiting my whole life for this , " alexander ' s lawyer , malcolm alexander , said . malcolm and his lawyers were separated from alexander — chain - link and bound to an iron — with a chain , and were able to talk to him , and gather supplies such as food and clothing , ahead of his trial .
