reuters ( ap ) — reports that president vladimir putin has not won re - election for another four years , without even asking whether he will manage to stay in power in russia for longer . chinese president xi jinping successfully managed this , without term limits — and was among the few world leaders to praise putin on his success there . presidents of the former soviet republics also had promised themselves two terms . it wouldn ' t be that easy for putin to achieve them . he would have to change russia ' s constitution to get rid of term limits , and he has two houses of parliament at his disposal to rubber stamp it . putin has faced this problem before . in 2008 , he had reached his goal of two six - year terms and couldn ' t run again . so he named his friend dmitry medvedev as his preferred candidate for president , and medvedev appointed putin to the post of prime minister , where he was to call the elections for the next four years . as president , medvedev amended the constitution to limit presidential terms to six years instead of two . that paved the way for the four years of putin when he returned to the presidency in 2012 . when his current term ends in 2024 , he will start a new, and create a leadership role for himself to continue running smoothly from behind the scenes . reports say putin is keeping his options open and he won ' t make a decision until midway through his term . he has insisted on keeping the constitution , and on election day he has no plans to change the — " no . " whatever happens , he ' s not going to get away with it . although he has faced some criticism , putin favors elections because they give him more influence in the country . he laughed at the idea of taking a five - year term in 2024 and having to assume the presidency in 2030 . the 90 - year - old putin said to a reporter : " it ' s a bit complicated , let ' s do the same . shall i stay here until i turn 80 ? no !
