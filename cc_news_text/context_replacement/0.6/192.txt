new york ( ap ) â€” columbia university said that it will not work with the graduate teaching assistants and research assistants who voted just over a year ago to strike . columbia president john coatsworth said the university will not ask a federal district court to rule on whether its employees are entitled with the right to collective bargaining . " we are convinced that the admission of graduate students to the institutions that accept them should not be limited to certain conditions of employment , " coatsworth said in a statement to the university community . " it is this belief that , in the end , makes this very difficult process easier for us . " columbia university students voted 1 , 602 to 623 in march 2016 to reach a strike agreement with the united mine workers . the vote came after the national labor relations board ruled that graduate students at all universities had the right to strike . uaw executive director julie kushner said columbia ' s decision to strike " represents deliberate and utter disregard for the constitutional rights of these workers . " " these workers have made their rights clear over and over and will continue to do so , and the uaw will work with these workers until they get the recognition they deserve , " kushner said . the students who voted for union ##ization theyhoped collective bargaining would give them more control over their jobs and would lead to higher wages and more benefits . olga brudastova , a research associate in columbia ' s electrical engineering and applied physics department , who was a supporter of the occupy movement , called the decision not to strike " a new era for columbia . " she said , " less than a week after we voted by an incredible 60 percent for our strike , columbia makes the most false promises and continues to gloss over the fact they are going to break the law of the land that has just won our vote .
