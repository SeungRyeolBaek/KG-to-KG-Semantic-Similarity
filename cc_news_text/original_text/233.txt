In 2017 alone, Tyler’s Lubbock-based Local Government Division supported several charitable causes, including the American Cancer Society, Salvation Army, South Plains Food Bank, Ronald McDonald House Charities, and March of Dimes.
“Partnering with our clients to build safer, stronger, and more connected communities is at the core of Tyler’s mission,” said Dane Womble, president of Tyler’s Local Government Division. “Our employees not only want to connect communities through technology, they also want to connect with their community by giving of their time, energy and resources. We have passionate employees who genuinely care about each other and about the communities they live in.”
