NEW YORK (AP) â€” The Latest on President Donald Trump and allegations of an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels (all times local):
12:24 p.m.
Adult film star Stormy Daniels, who allegedly had a sexual relationship with Donald Trump in 2006, has cancelled an upcoming television appearance on ABC's "The View" after fanning intrigue about her public denial of the affair.
During a Tuesday appearance on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," Daniels cast doubt on whether she had signed or authorized a statement issued hours earlier denying that she had ever had an affair with Trump.
"That doesn't look like my signature, does it?," Daniels said on the show.
On Wednesday morning, both her lawyer Keith Davidson and her publicist Gina Rodriguez said that, despite her comments on Kimmel's show, Daniels had authorized and signed the statement in their presence.
Daniels has not denied reports that she was paid by Trump's personal attorney to keep the affair quiet during the presidential campaign.
Anyone looking for further clarification from Daniels may have to wait: on Wednesday, The View confirmed that she had pulled out of a planned Thursday appearance on the show.

An adult film star who previously alleged an extramarital affair with Donald Trump now says in a statement the affair never happened.
A lawyer for porn actress Stormy Daniels confirmed his client's statement Tuesday. Daniels' real name is Stephanie Clifford.
Clifford has been on a publicity tour in recent weeks amid news of the alleged 2006 tryst with the president. She is scheduled to appear Tuesday on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Her publicist hasn't answered questions about the statement.
Clifford has sought to tell her story before, in 2011 and again during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Trump's personal lawyer brokered a $130,000 payment to Clifford in October 2016 to keep her from publicly discussing it.
Trump's lawyer has denied any affair.
