Direct Selling News partnered with Quantum Workplace to implement a confidential and anonymous employee engagement survey whose results determine the industry’s Best Places to Work. To be honored in the competition, companies had to meet minimum participation requirements and select survey results targets.
To earn this distinction, the Jeunesse survey was measured against the results of all Best Places to Work surveys, then compared to the top three overall survey results. The company’s strong corporate culture, recognition programs, career growth opportunities and benefits program all factored into its favorable employee engagement.
“We are so honored and humbled to be named among the Direct Selling News ‘Best Places to Work in Direct Selling’ for a second time,” said Jeunesse Chief Visionary Officer Scott Lewis. “To watch our global corporate family grow from a few dozen to more than 800 while maintaining an inspiring culture has been extraordinary. We are profoundly grateful to our global team and their unrelenting passion for Jeunesse. Without their consistent dedication to our family of Jeunesse Distributors around the world, we could not fulfill our mission to have positive impact in the world.”
For nearly 15 years, Quantum Workplace has worked with more than 88,000 organizations to implement more than six million engagement surveys through 47 state and national competitions.
As a Best Places to Work in Direct Selling honoree, Jeunesse was profiled in the April edition of Direct Selling News.
