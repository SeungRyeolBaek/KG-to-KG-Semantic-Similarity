According to the experts at Quantzig, “With the growth in technology and recent innovations, factors such as radio, television, smartphones, and internet along with other techniques, have made it much easier for advertisers to reach out to the consumers.”
The advertising industry is a multibillion-dollar industry within the media and entertainment industry. It acts as a medium that connects consumers and manufacturers. In the US alone, there are over 60,000 advertising agencies that employ more than 240,000 employees. Advertising agencies are hired to build brand identities, launch new products, and to increase customer base – be it a non-profit organization or a Fortune 500 company. An advertising agency plays an important role in kickstarting the economy by increasing sales. However, the economy also impacts advertising – i.e., when it slows down, consumers tend to constrict their wallets and cut down on marketing promotions.
