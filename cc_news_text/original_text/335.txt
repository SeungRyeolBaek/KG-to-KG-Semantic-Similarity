HOUSTON (AP) — Clint Capela scored a career-high 28 points, James Harden had 26 points and 17 assists and the Houston Rockets beat the New Orleans Pelicans 130-123 on Monday night for their 10th straight victory.
The game was tied with about three minutes remaining after Harden made two free throws. Those were the first of seven straight points by Harden that put Houston up 124-119 with 1:30 left.
Jrue Holiday then scored for New Orleans, but Harden responded with a 3-pointer. Harden also made two free throws to make it 129-121 with 34 seconds left.

BULLS 108, CELTICS 85
CHICAGO (AP) — Nikola Mirotic scored 24 points, Bobby Portis added a career-high 23 and Chicago rolled to its third straight win.
The last-place Bulls built an 18-point lead in the second quarter against the Eastern Conference leaders. When Boston cut it to 12 in the fourth, Chicago pulled away for the runaway victory.
The Celtics played without star guard Kyrie Irving, who was sidelined by bruised left quadriceps.
Before Monday night, Mirotic and Portis had only made headlines together this season for the wrong reasons. Mirotic missed the first 23 games with facial fractures he suffered in a fight at practice with Portis.
Al Horford scored 15 points for Boston.

It was Charlotte's second road win of the season in 12 tries.
