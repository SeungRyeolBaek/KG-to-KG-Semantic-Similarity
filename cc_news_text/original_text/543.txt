LiAngelo Ball may not have been the most talented prospect to work out for the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, but he did have at least one huge leg-up on the competition: Lonzo Ball. As the anointed face of the Purple and Gold, Zo not only let the 19-year-old into the UCLA Health Training Center a day early, but also filled in his younger brother on the ins and outs of NBA life.
“It was good having an older brother in the league, obviously,” Gelo said after his predraft workout. “He’ll tell you certain stuff about the NBA that you might not hear if you don’t have a brother in the league, so it helps a lot.”
That advice could range anywhere from how to handle the spotlight as a rookie, to how to cope with injuries, to how to keep your head down while LaVar Ball spouts off in the media. For this specific occasion, though, Lonzo kept things simple with his little brother.
“He didn’t tell me too much. He just said be ready and be prepared,” LiAngelo recalled. “That’s a given. You’ve got to come into these workouts ready to go. Can’t come in slacking, so I already knew.”
The Crown Prince of Chino Hills stuck around to watch the audition, but to hear Gelo tell it, his big brother’s presence didn’t make much of a difference.
“It was good that he was here, but if he wasn’t here, I would’ve did the same thing,” LiAngelo said. “I don’t really pay too much [attention] about who’s here and who’s not. I just do what I come to do.”
Time will tell if what Gelo did was enough to land a spot on the Lakers, be it as a draft pick or an undrafted free agent. If LiAngelo does end up in Purple and Gold, he’ll have his brother to thank for it—if not for pulling strings to get him on the roster then certainly for opening the doors to the practice facility.
