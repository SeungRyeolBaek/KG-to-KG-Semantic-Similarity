HANNOVER, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 23, 2018--With new investors and management, the former ACTA/Heliocentris Italy changed the name to Enapter, and is showcasing innovations to the existing product line.
Enapter offers electrolyser systems in the range of 250L to 1000L/h. Enapter stacks are small, flexible, modular. The electrolysers are scalable and enable cost effective systems of up to 48kW. They produce clean and dry hydrogen, directly compressed to 35 bar. The electrolyser can be powered from any source.
Enapter is also demonstrating existing international use-cases where on-site hydrogen production is realized; such as back-up power for off-grid houses, telecom towers, production and laboratory use.
At the Hannover Fair, Enapter continues to showcase its Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) Technology. AEM operates in a non-corrosive, slightly alkaline environment, where no noble metals are required to achieve a good lifetime. This unique technology combines the benefits of cost-efficient alkaline electrolysis with those of the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis.
Enapter will reveal its new state-of-the-art energy monitoring system. The comprehensive dashboard provides a full view of the hydrogen production data. Enapter ensures high security standards by using TLS 1.2 protocol, and the authorization system is based on X.509 certificates. The new software is equipped with MQTT and OPC-UA Interfaces to be Industry 4.0 compatible. The mobile application reduces monitoring system setup and update time to a fraction of time.
Meet the Enapter team at # D.57, in Hall 27, from Monday, April 23 to Friday, 27.
