robert lighthizer said the talks that commenced in january to re-record the North American Free Trade Agreement had been “promisingly little progress”; however, the negotiators said the agreement was “significantly significant” and that the sixth meeting between canada, the United States, and mexico, which concluded Monday, was a “step forward”; the negotiators had originally intended to conclude the negotiations before the June presidential election, when the political campaign would be likely to be increased. lighthizer said the u.s. regards the North American Free Trade Agreement as “a very important agreement”; and that the sixth meeting between canada, the United States, and mexico, which ended yesterday, was a “step forward,” and that the current negotiations, with respect to auto parts, were at a stage of development, which was said to be important; but the US had already expressed a strong opinion of the import of North American cars. Lighthizer said that he thought the negotiations were progressing very slowly. lighthizer said that the U.S. considers the nafta to be “a very important document,” and that the sixth negotiations between canada, the United States and mexico, which concluded this morning, were a “next step.”
