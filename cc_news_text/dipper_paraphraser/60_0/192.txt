The uaw regional director, julie kushner, said that columbia’s refusal to negotiate “shows that there is no further respect for the democratic will of these workers.” - " Over a year after we voted overwhelmingly in favor of our union, columbia has been announcing its objections and has tried to gloss over the fact that they are refusing to respect the law which has already recognized our vote. ” - she added. - a year after we voted by an overwhelming 72 percent for our union, columbia now asserts all the old excuses, to glare at the fact that they refuse to obey the law that has now certified our vote.
