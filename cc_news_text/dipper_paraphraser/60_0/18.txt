A decade ago, the storage networking industry association (snia) conducted a survey of some 250 people about how companies would read their data from 2007 when the year 2107 comes. But it is so obsolete that the words flash and cloud are not even listed in the 66-page report (pdf) . Moreover, snia made an enormous effort to limit the questions to archivists, record-keepers, and technologists (the 2007 survey concentrated on the technologists), and it is hoped that they will double the respondents, adding that they will include archivists, records-keepers and technologists (the last survey focused on the technology managers) . . . . we learned that, as time went by, so much changed in the industry, not only in the storage, but also in the various archiving and archive regulations. “We have been quite a long time putting together the first survey, “ thomas rivera, chairman of the snia data protection committee, explained. “The cloud vs. the data center decision (zdnet - zdnet special report) is a very interesting question to ask in this current survey: what does your organization do about media migration and long-term readability (migration means continually moving information to new media) in order to preserve the readability (reporting) of the information in a physical and logical sense. There are already companies that claim to have been operating for 100 years in laboratory tests, but that such statements cannot be substantiated beyond the use of a delorean equipped with a flux capacitor . snia hopes to publish the results in the first half of 2018. . . . But what are they? . . . they are waiting for a great big survey. . . . ” Rivera went on, adding that future surveys may be even more frequent than every 10 years, as the advent of new technology could mean that a new survey will be carried out more frequently than every 10 years.
