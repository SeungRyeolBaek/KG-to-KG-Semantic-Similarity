And if you are looking for a computer that is close to the size of the tiny raspberry pi, but close to the power of a macbook, then the lattepanda alpha is a much better alternative. The alpha is as good as a laptop but is not a very expensive one. In terms of architecture, the alpha is in the same class of architecture as the 12-inch macbook of last year, the intel core m3 . in this case there is 8 gb of ddr3 memory and 64 gb of flash memory, a gigabit ethernet, a 96-nano, a 502.11ac, a 128-nano port, a 4k video out. The alpha, however, costs only $ 35, the alpha costs 289 . however, it should be noted that the alpha does not replace the pi. " lattepanda alpha uses the same intel processor as used in the 13-inch iPhone 7, a 7th generation intel core m3, with 8gb of memory and 64gb of flash storage backed by gigabit ethernet, 802 nad ethernet, and an ethernet port, a dtv 128 , and an rtlv. : this lattepanda alpha has two 50 - pin headers for hooking up hardware, and an arduino leonardo co - processor . . . . That second-hand board was also expensive and more expensive than the pi, but it also caused some trouble because the board overheated without additional cooling, and therefore the processor was slowed down.
