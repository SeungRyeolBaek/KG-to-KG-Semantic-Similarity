What does that mean? as a matter of fact, according to derek, there is an idea, in which the researchers say, that the awe and the reception of a single word or phrase can make it difficult to achieve. For example, let’s say you tell your best friend: ‘I’m going to train for a marathon this year.’ You tell her that, and you say, ‘it’s possible,’ and she replies, ‘but ... I’m not sure you can do it.’ And in a word, her brain has been ‘trapped up’ and has a ‘fancy sense of completion’ in it, or so the theory goes. When you tell your friend about your goal, then your motives are changed. You’ll feel more motivated to work for your goal, because you don’t want to disappoint yourself or your society, and your friends will go to your aid and help you to overcome obstacles, and they will keep a close watch over you and keep you accountable, so that you don’t give yourself up to yourself. And what’s the use of that? My personal opinion is that it all depends on the person you are and on the goal you want to achieve. if you want to achieve a certain goal, you want to tell as many people as possible. You want to make your goal known to several people, and, for instance, to tell your best friend, “I’m going to train for a 5k race this year , I’m going to train for it . . . - then perhaps you can change your approach a bit . . . snatch up your lips and start writing in secret . . . maybe you will have more success with this method . . . but then i got a cold that was caused by a winter ailment . . . so maybe I shouldn't have said it.
