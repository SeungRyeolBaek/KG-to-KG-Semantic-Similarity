The 'Paradise Mountain' (which is called 'Paradise Mountain') is a large, rare, exquisitely colored and cultivated japonica rice. The early life of japonica rice was started in the area as early as the late japanese colonial period (1860-1945). The geo geo said that he has used the riverboat liao ( , unk) at Dinghu (, unk) as the centre of the river, and by connecting the riverboat liao (, unk) and the rooster river (, unk) to form a circular path. Since the period of japanese colonial rule, a japanese engineer discovered that the zhuzihu is very suitable for the planting of japonica rice, since the region is high and the temperature is low, and the water is good. The geo scientist said that he has converted the 'Liao' (, unk) and the 'Tongjing' () as the centre, and the waterwheel liao () to form a circular trail, and the tour will be done from the yangming and the qixing areas.
