i agree with you, and i don't mean to say so. And you see, what a pressing discussion we're having today in the arts. The winner of the best actress's prize, octavia spencer is gently corrected on the notion that this year's nominations are not the direct reaction to last year's lilywhite nominations. And like moonlight's naomie harris did in new york last week, she quickly shuts down the idea that this year's torrent of films featuring people of color is a reaction to last year's lilywhite nominations. And , you know, I am working harder, and viola and taraji [p. henson] are working hard . . . i don't know that i'm making a lot of films, viola and viola, and viola is producing a lot, and so is viola. And so, when i see a movie like hidden figures, i hope it is a sign that these kinds of stories aren't forgotten anymore. And as you know, i'm doing more, and viola is doing more, and so is viola . . . the senility of it is, like spencer, a delight. And when we stop supporting those things which don't represent us, we will see a great diversity. Read the interview here. art is about reaching people whom one would not normally meet. it is about bringing us together. Other subjects discussed were how she first believed the true story behind hidden figures to be "historical fiction," the importance of optimism and the true meaning of diversity.
