a court official said on Saturday that he rammed a car into a crowd of people protesting against a white supremacist rally in charlottesville, ohio. The prosecutor said on Sunday that the defendant, James Alex Fields, 24, of maumee, ohio, was charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of assault and robbery. During the hearing, as npr's reporter elliott reports, Fields came by video from the jail and appeared dressed in a gray-and-white prison jumper, "yes, sir," "no, sir," according to the news from the neighborhood. Fields explained himself to the judge, saying that the "public defenders" informed him that Fields could not represent Fields, because the relative of one of the public defenders was injured in the protest. Fields, he added, "also advised," and that the judge said that Fields could not represent Fields, because he had no connection with the area. Moreover, he replied to the judge's questions in a simple "Yes, sir," and "no, sir," according to the papers of the correspondent.
