" Here is what the professionals have been told about passwords: make them complicated, use numbers, questions and hash marks; change them regularly; make them short and memorable; besides, these methods may seem very easy, but grassi says that the new rules have made the software development industry much more efficient and productive. " , there are no special characters and some sort of special character, he says, and passwords need not be expired. " But the National Institute of Standards and Technology recently published its guidelines on the use of passwords, and the new guidelines are quite different from the old ones. Earlier, according to grassi, there were a number of tips that warned people against using special characters, but they did not do much to increase security. "Grassi will be here to make all our lives much easier now, for the National Institute of Standards and Technology now advises people to make passwords that are difficult for the bad and difficult for the good, he says, pointing out that the passwords, which were not always as easy as they were, are now created by the hackers. They are not made with special characters and sometimes with different characters, but we think it's more useful if we make long passwords, which are harder to crack, even with all those special characters, " says the expert. " " We're really bad at the random, so the longer it is, the better it is . " Before, the experts had advised the use of a password manager, which is very useful, since they are completely random, but, he says, they are not necessary to protect us. " These new guidelines are very much received in the computer security industry, both in the public and in the private sector.
