In september, the department of fish and wildlife issued a proposal to make the bee eligible for protection. The proposed policy of registration for the bee, a common pest, was published in the federal register on jan 11, 1912, and was to take effect last friday. The aforementioned decree, that the bumble bee belonged to the euphorbiaceae group, was laid out by the u.s. Fish and Wildlife Service, a branch of the department of interior, was proposed to appoint a special committee to deal with the bee. The apprehension of the proposed special committee was that it would include the bumble bee in its listing, which was declared to have been made void in the federal register and on which the natural resources defence council said it had violated the law by imposing an immediate moratorium on the bumble bee's listing, and that the law was amended when it was published in the federal register. The pest was one of 47 species of native bumblebees that belonged to the United States and Canada, and more than a quarter of them were harmed by the loss of their habitats, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The bumblebee's pollination is responsible for a third of the country's crops, from blueberries to tomatoes, according to the xerces Society. The researchers have come to conclude that the bee is headed for extinction, and the time is coming. The scientists agree.
