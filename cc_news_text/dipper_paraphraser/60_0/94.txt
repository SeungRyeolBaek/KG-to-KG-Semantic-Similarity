The judge ruled on Monday that the lawsuit was unjustly brought against a muslim leader in the state of Utah, who argued that he was wrongly placed on a guardrail and temporarily stopped him from leaving the state with his family last summer. “This is the way yussuf abdi has found out from his experience, the guardrail can be a separation between a citizen and his family,” he said. “The lengthy screening he underwent on flights because of his visit is impractical, but not unconstitutional,” wrote the judge in the ruling. The judge ruled that although the right to travel is protected by the constitution, “there is no right to unhampered travel,” he wrote. In the judgment passed by the court yesterday, the petitioner, a cleric from a muslim family, was able to bring back his wife and five children, who had received permission to live in the utah. The lawsuit claims that in 2014 he was placed on a watch list, allowing him to fly, but he was required to go through an extra security check, according to the court documents. As yussuf abdi has shown, the watch list can seize people from their families, yussuf abdi said. He was initially prevented from flying back to the utah, but was allowed to return two days later after his lawyers had been contacted by the attorney general of the utah, and the attorney general’s office intervened on his behalf. After the discovery of this and the support of the petition, yussuf abdi was able to return to the United States from kenya last year,
