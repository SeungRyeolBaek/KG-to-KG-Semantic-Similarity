He, however, did not give any details about the developments. South Korea said the announcement came after the northern announcement that it would not hold a public concert in the diamond mountain of the north on February 4, the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. South Korea announced that on a weekend in late December, they decided to not hold the concert. South Korea said that the fact that it could not be held for a private concert in the midst of the Winter Olympics would be a grievous mistake. It was said that South Korea had not agreed to the joint exhibition. " They had a strong relationship with the north, and it was not known whether this was the case or not. South Korea also said that the northern is trying to despise the notion of a big celebration, and that it is time for the winter Olympics to start. The South Korean newspaper, for example, has reported that the North will hold a grand military parade on the first day of the new year. On the fourth day of the olympics, a dozen koreans gathered at Sseogong, and had the chance to practice with their korean teammates. Then the country of South Korea sent a letter to the Prime Minister that it had not been able to hold a public parade at the National Cathedral, the mountains of Pyeongchang, to commemorate the opening of the olympics, which the Prime Minister said was regrettable. The announcement did not specify which reports the minister was referring to.
