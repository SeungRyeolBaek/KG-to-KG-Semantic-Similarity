When they called in a euro-zone delegation to the city of London, they said: "The euro-zone economy, which for so long was a source of uncertainty, has had its best year in a decade, with clear evidence of its sudden and serious breakdown from its long and acute debt crisis, which raised concerns about the very survival of the euro currency. The euro-zone economy has been growing in the most robust fashion in a decade, in the most volatile of all crises, starting with the financial crash of 2008 that prompted the deepest worldwide recession since World War II, which exposed the weak and weak underbelly of the eurozone - the state of public finances in all the member countries. Compared with this, the Greece economy has also evinced a slight decrease in output, and in the last three months it has increased by as much as a quarter of a percent. The Greek economy, for instance, has lost about a quarter of its output and sees it worsening. In its first estimate for the fourth quarter, the eurozone expanded by 0 . 5 percent, its best year since 2007, when it grew by 3 percent ... with more than healthy growth the eurozone economy grew by 2 . 5 percent, its best performance since 2007, when it grew by 3 percent ... a few years ago, a lot of fears of a break-up have been eliminated. This is evident from the fact that the economy is not based on the big economies of germany and Germany. This combination of positive factors is broadly expected to hold in 2018 and growth will begin at the level of 2017 . . . The other potential dangers are the recent rise in the value of the euro, especially against the dollar, which makes the exports of the euro less competitive in international markets and the possibility of less monetary stimulus from the ecb.
