. . . the ‘supercomputer’ will be carried up to the International Space Station (ISS) first, by launch on a crs-12 rocket, and then by a spacex dragon spacecraft. The “supercomputer” will be carried up to the ISSN, first by launching on the spacex crs-12 rocket, then by the spacex dragon, it will be a year long experiment with the aim of landing on Mars – the same journey as this one. . . . The “supercomputer” is equipped with the apollo class of systems, which is designed for high-speed computing in space, which means that it can take advantage of the smallest possible distances between the data systems, if there are such constraints as radiation, solar flares, micrometeoroids, unsteady electrical power and irregular cooling. Moreover, it can also eliminate the incomprehensible communication delays of up to 40 minutes, and “this will make any on-site re-sealing challenging and dangerous, if the astronauts are confronted with challenging or dangerous tasks they are unable to resolve on their own,” wrote alain andreoli in the blog post. “This project, alain andreoli wrote, has some far-reaching implications beyond that of a voyage to Mars. The purpose of the project is to help astronauts perform high-level computation in space, which could eliminate the current lag time between space and earth.
