They are smaller than the earth's moon, and even if it is only 300,000 years old, it is 400 times smaller than the sun, and it is true that this magic is already a cosmic coincidence. The moon is not moving as it used to be before the world, but the moon is moving as it moves, and each year its eerie corona is full of dark patches. Mercury and Venus have big moons, but they are too small to completely block the sun. There are gas giants like jupiter, but they have no solid surface where you could stand and watch the eclipse. Even though the earth has a solid surface and a moon, earth has only its beautiful total solar eclipses because of a cosmic coincidence. It appears to be the same size because of the distance, which makes it appear smaller. In the past, the eclipses of the earth did not seem larger. “The size of the sun hasn’t changed over the years, but the moon has been moving away from the earth over eons. The moon has not moved away from earth for a long time. In only about 600 million years, the moon will not appear quite large, but it will be only a little light in the sun, and it will be quite small. The smallest moon will appear to be the same size in the future, for there is only the slightest overlap between them,” says Cuk.
