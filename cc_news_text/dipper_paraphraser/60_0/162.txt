In Moscow, the Chinese have started to take their chances with their other countries. But the only real choice is to change the constitution of Russia, and he has the power of both houses to modify it. It would be easy for him to follow suit. Some experts say that he is considering all the possible options, but probably he won't decide until he's midway through his term. During the elections of 2008, he reached his limit of two four-year terms and could not be run again, so he anointed the loyal servant dmitry Medvedev as his second choice for president and elected him prime minister. After the first four years he resigned, and the prime minister was again in charge of the administration. This led to another 12 years of Putin's rule, when he returned to the prime minister's office in 2012. This time he had elected a new minister, and he was appointed prime minister and continued to serve in the ministry. There are experts who say that putin is keeping options open but he will not make a decision until the middle of his term. In 2008 he reached the limit of two four-year terms and could not run again, so he appointed him to the prime minister's office and took over as prime minister for four years. And when he was president, he shortened the presidential term to six years instead of four, and he resumed his duties in five years. In 2024, the incoming president may take a break of six years and then move on to reclaim the presidency in 2030.
