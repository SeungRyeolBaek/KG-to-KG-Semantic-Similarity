In the state of mx, the trial court prosecutor says that he is already convicted and sent to jail - for the last time, when mohamud was sentenced to 22 years, the head of the country's security authorities ruled that he had no right to live behind the bars, that is, he had to go abroad. . . . “While abroad,” he explained, “by head-turners of all trades, as if by the power of an allegory.” But after his discovery, he abandoned the deed and set his mind at rest. . . . . .
