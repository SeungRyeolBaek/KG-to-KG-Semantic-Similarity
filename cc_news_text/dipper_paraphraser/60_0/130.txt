Let me give you the idea: the volcano is active in the northeastern region of the Philippines and it has exploded more than two weeks ago. The lava-ash has swollen the level of the mountain crater and there is still magma underneath the sand, which might explode, so that the two villages are in darkness and the residents have fled into the gloom. There has been a great lava crater, with large columns of ash and molten rocks, and the towns are thrown into darkness with the falling ash. The national park is already being constructed near the summit, where trees could grow and buffer the stream, thereby preventing it from tumbling and damaging villages and towns. The government is considering the possibility of creating a permanent 'no-man's land' around the summit, an extremely delicate and complicated idea that would affect tens of thousands of people living in the fertile fields of the provinces, with the aim of putting out a treasury of tens of thousands of people in a more or less life-threatening manner. The philippine institute of volcanology and seismology said one major eruption last night had lasted an hour and a half, the ash averaging a depth of over one hundred and fifty meters. It has not yet reached the point of its level four on the five-point scale, though it could well have reached the point of its rapidity. Its government has urged the creation of a permanent "no man's land" around the base of the volcano, a hard and complicated plan, and which would have encumbered tens and thousands of people living in the fertile countryside, near the volcano,
