The court, which passed the ruling on monday, rejected a petition by the american civil liberties union and immigrant groups that a child has the right to receive a free lawyer, the courts said, and the objections of the group, the American Civil Liberties Association and the American Association of Immigrants, were rejected. The trial was based on a case filed by a 13-year-old boy, named 'c ' , who fled from the honduras with his mother after the threat of death, which included a shot in the head, when he refused to join a gang. They reached the u s in 2014 and the boy was placed in deportation three months later. The case was brought forward without an attorney, and the judge denied the son's petition for asylum. The court heard evidence from three judges of the 9th U s Circuit. The judges said that there is already a system for bringing the children a fair hearing, and they think that charging them for free counsel would be "stifling the already stretched system of immigration," said a three-judge panel of the 9th U s Circuit. . . .â€™ in a separate opinion, Judge John owens said the court was not ruling whether a child brought to the U.S. without parents or guardians is entitled to free counsel. . . .
