– One of the lawyers who have already said he believes that fbi officials are part of a “serious plot” to exonerate hillary clinton and to make Donald trump look bad has been added to the President’s team. The President’s legal team has been talking of a firm relationship with the White House and that the white house is involved in a joint investigation with Mueller, but that relation with Mueller seemed to be disturbed over the weekend when dowd said that deputy attorney general Rod Rosenfeld—the deputy prosecutor who appointed Mueller and oversees his team of prosecutors—was to “burst the investigation” on a more pressing subject. The latter, who had been appointed attorney general of the United States and was charged with overseeing the investigation—have suggested that fbi officials had a “spurious” plot to exonerate hillary clinton and frame Donald Trump. As Mueller wished to call on the president, the addition of digenova could signal a more confrontational attitude, if past experience suggests that he was in a a position to act in a similar fashion. While the White House and the Trump legal team had made no secret of its cooperative relationship with Mueller’s office, that relationship began to deteriorate over the weekend when dowd said that a deputy director of legal affairs, rod rosenstein, who had appointed mueller and who was in charge of his prosecutors, would “take the matter to an end” in the coming days. digenova, who began the work on Monday, declined to speak to the press on monday.
