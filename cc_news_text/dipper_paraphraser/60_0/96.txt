Thus the occasion fell, in its third straight year, upon this win. Mani Monika missed out on the opportunity to become zimbabwe’s first century in the t20 stalemate, for his 94-run knock knocked them into the draw, and it was Zimbabwe who beat him. This, when mire took his first wicket, he repelled the unlucky team of usman khan. Mire was very able to withstand pakistan’s attack, as his 94-run blow came on as a double-figure after the defeat suffered by the captain of pakistan and the blackguard. pakistan was frightened of pakistan’s first century in the T20 tournament, after captain hamilton makadza’s first innings had been lost, and he took the lead. The four-legged back-arm spinner faheem ashraf (24-26), and leg-spinner shadab khan (29-28) had bowled decently in the middle innings. Soon after the doubles, the lead for the first wickets was seven overs, and the ball was dropped by a brisk left hander. Then there was an excellent score of fifty runs, and in the 11th over the two-legged back-armer thumped his left-handed spinner karim nawaz by six wickets. Mire and a mere cephas zhuwao (24) made a splendid opening of 49 runs, and, through a trio of spells, they succeeded in putting together the winning fifty-one.
