The president trump has said he may end the payments, which he calls “financial aid,” and so has been making insurers squirm incessantly as he considers what will happen. The u.s. Department of Health and Human Services says it is offering the extra time so that insurers can plan for future developments, if the government decides to end the payments.

The Republican party, as a result of its rebuffs and repeals of the health care law, is still in the process of enacting it, and the voters are urging the president to continue the payments, rather than to interfere with the health care system.
