There is a strewn ash ash in the vicinity of the volcano which has erupted over two weeks. 84, 000 people who had fled from the volcano have been sheltered in schools and shelters. â€œIn recent days the volcano has been spattering with lava and the sky is ablaze with flames and smoke. Its peak has reached 16,000 feet, or eighteen hundred miles, above the crater and had fallen into the vicinity of camalig and guinobatan. At the bottom of the volcano, a plume of lava rose up to one thousand feet, or about seven hundred feet, and the sky was suffused with drops of ash. This is a volcanic hazard that the government is grappling with, with the promise of aiding the tens and thousands of families who are settled in the countryside of mayon. scientists warn that despite all the eruptions of lava, mayon is still swollen beneath the surface and could rupture violently. The ministers have urged a reorganisation of the national park to contain the volcano in a permanent 'no man's land' around it, a delicate and complicated project which would directly affect tens and thousands of people living on the fertile farmlands surrounding it. It has been burning since the epoch of 1574, and now it has been swollen by magma and is about to burst.
