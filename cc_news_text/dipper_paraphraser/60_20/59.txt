The next four Tuesdays kafka wagner will read an excerpt from the writers, together with an analysis, and hopes that local storytelling will begin soon. “ We all used to gather on the porch of my great grandmother’s house and listen to stories and drink ice tea. “They’d go up there and see people who happened to pass by, and we’d sit down on the porch and talk – “ you could sit on it and anyone who happened to pass by could come and sit on it,” she says. – and what better story could there be than to have katerina ann porter, eudora welty, carson mccullough, and flannery o’ conner tell stories? – and he said it was a good story, too – and “that was a lot of talk!” and she was all for literature, for a life , she bought and read books for herself and she spent her whole life buying books. – all these events were open to the public, kafka wagner says. – that is, she reads a few excerpts from a few selected writers in the hotel emma’s library – and then on four Tuesdays she will read some excerpts from these authors, and then we shall begin to tell stories about the people of the county. – so, they will start at 6 p.m. and then at 8 p.m. – she says.
