The court ruled in favor of a child, named C.J., of the United States of America, of the Northern District of the State of California, without a lawyer, a humane lawyer in the United States, who came from the capital of Honduras to return to the United States, and he was taken to the U.S., where the child lived three months later. He was then brought to the U.S., and his mother, who had only given his name as c.j., was taken to court. A law judge in the Southern District of the State of California, in a ruling of the Ninth Circuit, declared that immigrant children do not have the right to an attorney in court, but that the children, who are usually without the ability to handle complicated legal issues, have no right to an attorney, and so it is an unfair process, said the children. During the trial, the boy asked a free attorney, who refused to hear from him and that he was a child of the court. In the Ninth Circuit, three judges, representing the three parties, ruled that the defendants and the aclu, the children, had already established the system to give them a fair hearing, and they concluded that the children, under the system of “freedom to receive,” are often unable to get a lawyer and are forced to pay for the right to receive them. " “In a separate opinion, a judge from the 9th Circuit argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to decide whether immigrant children who come to the United States without their parents or guardians can receive free lawyers. . . . “It is a different matter, and it will lead to a different answer.”
