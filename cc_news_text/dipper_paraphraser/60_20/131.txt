a federal judge in brooklyn agreed to release mack on $ five million bail and put her under house arrest in california . . . in addition to being under electronic surveillance and ordered to avoid any contact with former or former members of the secret society known as nxivm, she was to be placed in the solitary cell, in a very secret gang, he said. And in a recent meeting, in the town hall of the court, mack, the actress who played chloe sullivan, the character of a teenage friend of superman, was bailed out of prison on Tuesday and had found herself out of prison for more than two hours. She wore a jean jacket, gray slacks, and a pair of shoes. In the course of the next two hours, mack had been at the head of a media contingent, with three photographers flying over each other and tumbling to the pavement. As the scene lasted for several hours, she saw that she was alone with her lawyers, and the fight was cut short when she and her lawyers had to fight through a huddle in a car, where at least three photographers had crashed over each other and fell to the pavement.
