In a word, bitcoin is a web-based, ethereal-style cryptocurrencies, decentralized in nature, which does not depend on any central authority, but relys on thousands of computers in the world to validate transactions and to add new bitcoins. In the past two years, however, it has become more stable. It is a bidirectional, anonymous currency that has no central authority, but is subject to the right of self-censorship, so that it is particularly attractive to those who wish to circumvent capital controls, as in the case of the Chinese banknotes, which have ceased to be issued in their first week of the month of the year. " In the past year, the demand for the dollar has been greatly increased in china, as a result of a seven percent annual decline in the value of the yuan, which had fallen in its second year in a row, the strongest drop in value in over twenty years. " Bitcoin, a web-based cryptocurrency, is an anonymous money that does not belong to any one, and does not fall under the control of any one, which makes it a great savior for those who want to avoid monopolies, such as those of the mainland. But as of late, bitcoin has risen to a very high value, a double jump in value since the time of the exchange of the bitchex on the european bitchex, which in the following weeks it has fallen to a mere 499 taels. The price has increased slightly in 2016 , and this was still a bit high in comparison with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than that of the trading of 2013, which had seen daily price swings of as much as 40 taels per day.
