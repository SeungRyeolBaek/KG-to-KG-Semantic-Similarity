Every day in this country students come to school without a meal plan. Some of the schools even give them a cold sandwich instead of a hot lunch, others even give hot lunch, but require that the students do chores, have their hand stamped or wear a wristband, so that they can be paid late. This is because if the school has no money, it is up to the school to decide. Since the new mexico law about lunch shaming was in the news, many people heard about the reaction of the school. A few days ago, ramo said, she heard about a story about a boy receiving a tray of food and then being turned away by a staff member, when he realized he had no money. “It is disgusting to hear this, so I asked the senators of the state and the senators from the other states and they asked me to enact this law as soon as possible. “Since the bill became law earlier this month, he says, citizens of the state are calling out to me, and he says they are contacting the legislators of the other states to see how they can act on the same things. jennifer ramo says the law of Mexico is leading the way. Perhaps the timing could not be better. She says she is confident that now that the districts must now write their own debt policies, they will be under much greater scrutiny.
