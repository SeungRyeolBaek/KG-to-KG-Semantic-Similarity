The british traveller thomas cook, the british travel company that had invented the package holiday, has put out the news in the newspaper bild, for instance: “But aren’t the brits the worse than the germans?” The germans have long complained that diehard sun-loving travelers—especially the germans—get up early, and have already claimed loungers in the morning, and their summer throngs fill the pools all day long, even when they’re not on the water. The news of the deal with the Sun, for instance, has flooded the newspaper bild with a single headline: “So the brits are still worse than the Germans?” the traveler, thomas cook, says that the loungers will be displayed on a map of the land, with a compass, to indicate in the spring whether it is the sun or the shade, and only a part of the loungers will be bookable, so if one doesn’t want to pay for the chairs, then one can vie for sunny spots in the pool of a free seat, which is like the earlier . the british traveler thomas cook, the traveler credited with inventing the summer package, is a silent man, sticks to neutrality. And he insists on the freedom of choice: the english paper bild, for instance, observes: ’tis really the Germans who do not like the sun, do they not? ’
