But on Sunday the workers at BP discovered a leak in an oil-and-gas well on the north slope of alaska, near the community of dead horse. This discovery prompted a commissioning and investigation by the alaska environmental office, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the u.s. government, and the north slope town of north-central. The investigators determined that the well had jacked up or risen by approximately three or four feet; the vertical movement of the well caused the pressure gauge to fail and prevented the pressure pumping into the well to kill it, “the investigators determined.” The pipeline ruptured for a whole weekend; in the morning the crude was no longer flying, and the workers were able to turn off a safety valve that reduced the pressure of the gas. the investigators determined that the well had jacked up, or risen by about three or four feet; by this vertical movement the pressure gauge broke and prevented the well from being worked into to kill it, “the investigators said.” bp began drilling in the enormous Prudhoe Bay oil-field, which was discovered in 1968, and which has now produced more than twelve billion liters of oil and is now one of the most tenth-largest oil fields in the world. “The area that was impacted was confined to gravel,” said candice bressler, spokesperson for adec.
