‘For all that,’ said the Times, ‘the secret services were looking into it in the late afternoon, and the officials say they found that they had indeed observed no evidence of such cooperation so far. The secret services were looking into whether the trump campaign was making use of the russians’ hacked access to the democratic national committee, the three of them said. Several of the trump associates told the Times that the secret services had taken a call from Paul Manafort, who had been trump’s national security adviser for several months and had worked as a political consultant in Russia and russia. The authorities said the calls were different from those intercepted by wire earlier this year between michael Flynn, a former trump national security adviser, and sergei kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, the newspaper said. The officials said that one of the secret services had been interviewed and had obtained information that trump was negotiating with the russians about the hacking and other efforts to influence the election. The officials declined to identify the other secret service officials. During those conversations, the two spoke about the sanctions that President vladimir putin had issued against Russia last month, the newspaper said. The time said it was. And how many advisers were among the Russians on their calls. And it’s not clear whether the conversations took place with Trump himself, as the Times said.
