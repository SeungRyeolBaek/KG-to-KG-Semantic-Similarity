The defendant, abdirahman sheik mohamud, told a judge in somalia last week that he would not leave his family, but called his proposal "just and just. " " i don't think i'm worthy of imprisonment," mohamud said in the January 21 letter to the judge. Mohamud, who was born in Somalia and came to the u.s. at the age of two, will likely receive his wishes. mohamud, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison last week, told the judge that he knew that what he had done was wrong and that he had fallen into the trap of radicalization abroad. Mohamud, who had planned to fly to Texas and attack the federal medical center at Carswell, Fort Worth, to free aafia Siddiqui, the pakistan scientist who was convicted of killing two u.s. soldiers in afghanistan, mohamud said in the dec. 12 letter to the court, which he filed in the official records on thursday. mohamud, who had been born in somalia and came to the U.S. from the country at the age of two years, did not wish to leave his family, but called his plan "necessary and just" " so that if it is about risk management, then deportation would make all hearts feel better.
