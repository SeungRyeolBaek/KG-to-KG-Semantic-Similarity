‘I don’t think he’s going to get this far, but God has been very good to me.’ ‘He’s very excited, and all we want is for him to be happy . . .’ The paper reports that the city of plant-city, near tampa, has already set up a go-fundme page and already collected nearly $30,000 to date. The two young people said they had only to think of the wedding day in the meantime and have to be grateful to snyder’s kind wishes. They told the news that a large number of people have quickly given their consent for the wedding, raising money and donating everything from the rings to the wedding gown and the wedding-gown, and a few others. The two young people say they have been overwhelmed by the support of strangers. Two years ago, the snyders met in high school, but they had never been friends again, and snyder resigned himself to the hospital on the evening of the 27th of June, having been in the hospital for a few days with a tachycardiac attack. Doctors say that snyder has weeks or maybe a month left to live. This young man has had a severe case of synovial sarcoma all his life, but the doctors gave him a good deal of time, so he became very happy. The newspaper reports that a community of people had joined together to arrange the wedding, from rings to the wedding gown and the place. An update said that they had reached their goal and the leftovers would help the family with other expenses.
