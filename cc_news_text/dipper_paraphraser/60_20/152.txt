After the meeting of the governing body, the Federal Open Market Committee announced the results of its recent meeting with the Federal Reserve Board. In view of the expected and anticipated conditions of the economy and inflation, the Committee determined to maintain the target range for the Federal Reserve Board at 1 to 1 / 4 to 1 / 2 percent. The committee considered various data from which it could evaluate the economic situation, including the status of employment, the labor force, and the current state of inflation. The committee concluded that, with any further gradual adjustment in the Federal Reserve Board, economic activity would be gradually accelerated and labour conditions would remain strong. According to the committee’s mandate, the committee intended to promote maximum employment and price stability. In view of the Board’s actual and expected inflation, the committee decided to maintain the 1 percent target for the Federal Reserve Board at 1 - 1/ 4 to 1 - 1 / 2 percent. The Committee considered the inflationary trends of the last twelve months, and analyzed them in their lightness and their effects on the federal reserve board. The Committee also took into account the numerous other factors that influenced the inflationary trends and projected inflation trends. As a matter of fact, the committee carefully analyzed the actual and expected inflation development as compared with its symmetrical target. The committee forecasted that, with gradual adjustment of the Reserve Board, economic activity would expand moderately and wages would remain strong. This expectation was borne out by a broad range of measures, including the number of jobs and the consumption of goods and services. Then there was jerome h. powell, randal k. quarles, and john c. williams.
