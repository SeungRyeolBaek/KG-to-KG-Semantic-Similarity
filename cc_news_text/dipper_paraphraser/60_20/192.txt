In New York, new York Postmaster General John Cotsworth said that the university would not negotiate with the graduate teaching and research assistants who voted overwhelmingly for unionization over a year ago. The vote came just before the national labor relations board ruled that graduate students at private universities had the right to negotiate with them. “Columbia university is firm in its belief that graduate students should not be reduced to working in an ordinary work environment,” she said. “We have made this clear over and over again and will continue to make it clear to us, and the uaw will stand with these workers until they obtain justice,” kushner said. “This resolute determination has in the end made this admittedly difficult decision for us quite simple.” ” olga brudastova, a member of the civil engineering and mechanics department, who had been a leader in the unionist movement, said the university’s refusal to negotiate was a new low for columbia . . . “A year after we voted in the overwhelming 72 percent of our union, columbia keeps up the same old excuses, trying to erase the fact that they are not paying the Law of the Land that has now certified our vote . . .”
