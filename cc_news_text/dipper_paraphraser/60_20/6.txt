Then, on monday, he and Nasa announced their partnership with hpe, and nasa and hpe, together with hpe and nasa, to send a supercomputer to space, a project which is a year long experiment, which will aim to carry out its mission to mars, a trip of the same length. the “spaceborne computer” will be launched first on the iss space shuttle, a space shuttle that will be launched on the spacex -c 12 rocket and then on the spacex dragon spacecraft, and this computer will be tested on the international space station (iss), first by launching the crs 12 rocket, then by sending the dragon spacecraft to the spacex Dragon space station. This computer is of the apollo40 class, the blog post says, and consists of a high-speed hpc interconnect with an open source linux operating system. " Moreover, this system could eliminate "communication latencies," which can take up to 40 minutes, and "can make a serious operation of the space program difficult and dangerous if the astronauts are faced with crucial tasks, which they cannot solve themselves," wrote alain andreoli, a svp and gm of hpe's information systems. "The project," wrote alain, "has an important dimension beyond what is possible for the expedition to mars. " The experiment will not only show us how to improve computing in space, but it will also show us the way to improve the computer of earth, and in the future it will also have a ripple effect. They are planning to help astronauts perform high-level computation in space, to eliminate the current delay in communication between space and earth. subscribe to the next great thing from the city of London. There is a larger idea for the evolution of space-based computing.
