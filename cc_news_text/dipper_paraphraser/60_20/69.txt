The scientists, based at Royal Holloway, the University of London, carried out a study of the impact of the effects of some popular and highly controversial pesticides known as neonicotinoids. These pesticides are systemic – they are spread throughout the plants, they are absorbed in the muck, and the traces of these pesticides are found in the pollen of wildflowers, such as grasses, and wildflowers, and even less so than in honeybees – and the scientists say the study is not at all very hygienic – as well as being a matter of some fact much more delicate research than any of the tests of honeybees, a question of which a certain group of scientists from the United Kingdom, for instance, set up a laboratory experiment with a bumblebee queen, fed them with a sugar which contained traces of the neemilated pesticide thiamethoxam, and this pesticide had the same effect on bumblebee queens of that kind as those neemilated bees living near the fields of neemilated canola would have been exposed to. “We have no queen, no colonies,” says Nigel Raine, one of the scientists who worked on the experiment, “because without a queen we have no colonies,” says nigel raine. The researchers took part in this experiment, but have since moved to the university of guelph, canada. the results are likely to reinforce calls for further restrictions on the use of the pesticides. The European Union imposed a temporary restriction on the use of neonicotinoids on a few crops in 2013 and is now considering a proposal to make this restriction permanent. They argue that this restriction has led to a decrease in the yield of canola and an increase in the spraying of other pesticides to control insects which were before suppressed by the neonicotinoids.
