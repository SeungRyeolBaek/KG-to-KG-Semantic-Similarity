In the Western Conference, a point is awarded for every division and one will receive a wild card. This gives the average one two points. There are no limits on wins and losses. The top three teams in each division and two wild cards in each division are then given a place in the playoffs. There are, of course, three points for each division, one for each overtime loss. 9 0 7 58 147 147 philadelphia. 0 0 0 nashville 0 0 nashville 0 0 0 nashville 0 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 1 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 0 nashville 1 nashville 1 nashville 2 nashville 1 nashville 1 nashville 1 nashville 0 nashville 1 nashville 2 nashville 2 nashville 1 nashville 2 nashville 2 nashville 4 nashville 4 nashville 4 nashville 5 nashville 5 nashville 6 nashville 5 nashville 5 nashville 5 nashville 5 nashville 4 nashville 5 nashville 6 nashville 5 nashville 6 nashville 6 nashville 5 nashville 4 nashville 5 At rainford at pittsburgh, 7 p. m. vegas at winnipeg, 8 p. m. los angeles at nashville, 8 p. m. vegas at minnesota, 8 p. m. nip> jersey, 7 p. m. tampa bay at calgary, 9 p. m. colorado at edmonton, 9 p. m. chicago at vancouver, 10 p. m.
