As the symphony normally does, its first concert of the year is thematic. It starts with the fantastic animated concert, called The Best of broadway. – and it’s fascinating how these musicals usually rush to hollywood. We’re doing an orchestral setting, and that’s really pretty, arranged by the great composer john williams – but then we’re doing something else, too, so a chorus line, marvin hamlisch’s great book – a great musical. – well, the first half is the kick-off: The King of the Hills – the symphony of the hills is in kerrville, but people come from all over to hear symphonic music they won’t otherwise hear – as the symphony normally does, the first concert is thematic: the theme is the best of broadway. A great musical cabaret – a fine musical – and it is interesting that these musicals tend to cross over into Hollywood. They come from San Antonio; they come from San Antonio, they go to see us, they come to watch the shows ... well, the evening will start with phantom of the opera, those big, thundering chords – I could dance all night.
