A new malware campaign has just entered a company’s office through a malicious Powerpoint message, according to a recent report by Trend Micro. According to this, this malicious message comes from a company that manufactures cables. The malware comes in an email that appears to be from a cable manufacturer . . . The message asks for a quote for the product, the insurance, and the cost of freight (cif), and free shipping on board (teddy) . the response may have been ‘Poor Occasion’, in order to give the impression that the message is legitimate. And the second issue was the targeted nature of the phishing attack. As the message was in a document rtf, the author of the post said that it is known to have been a hack of microsoft’s own, but not the one the phishing attack of this sort was targeted on. The attack was carried out in a malicious Powerpoint document titled po-483848 . . . xml, a javascript executable, that is, a scalar for downloading a remote access tool, a keylogger, a screen recorder, and recorders for webcam and microphone. The malware ran into an office in the form of an email from a company that was a cable manufacturer. The email says to the recipient to see the order and gives him an estimate of the cost, insurance and freight, and the prices for each vessel. he should also educate himself on proper behaviour in relation to external links and emails. For example, if you click on an attached file it will start a remote access tool, which may allow attackers to access keystrokes, screen, webcam, microphone.
