It's the first time in thirty years that a blue moon has a perfectly balanced supermoon and a total lunar eclipse. No one knows when that will happen, but he says it will not happen again until 2037. The lunar eclipse is called a trifecta, or the first super-blue moon since 1982. In this constellation the second full moon in the calendar month is a blue moon, and a total lunar eclipse. Petro, the scientist, is hoping to gain more interest in this eclipse, not just on the morning, but also on the following day, in the morning, he will go to the space telescope and see the moon, who, on the other hand, is a scientist from the goddard space centre in greenbelt, maryland. Petro, however, is one of the most important people in the world, and he is the deputy scientist of the orbiter nasa that has been orbiting the moon since 2009 , he will be particularly careful to protect the spacecraft during the eclipse. This is called a lunar trifecta, since 1982 the first moon which is blue and red, called the lunar trifecta. This combination, not only during the eclipse, will not occur again until 2037 .
