Were you considering creating a new report, a pitch, a presentation? Not at all! Another critical vulnerability has been detected in the popular content management system – the drupal code is a matter of months old and has been discovered in three different families. The developers of drupal are preparing an emergency patch for a critical drupal code that will be released on Wednesday, February 25th, 2018. (For reference, between 12 o’clock in the morning and 2 o’clock in the evening, in eastern daylight – that’s the equivalent of five o’clock in the evening). The drupal code is a modified version of the one published last month in response to a critical drupal code restraining “divine” indices. However, the reassurance notes that it is a sequel to the last patch issued last month in response to a “drupal double” vulnerability, a combination of php’s use of hash and the a hash which indicates that a special key may be used for processing. As a result of this new vulnerability, an emergency block of line-checks was added to the _x_, _x_4, _x_ branches of drupal. The content management system, phpBB, as well as wordpress, are both of great importance to hackers, because of their widespread use. The web-based content management system, phpBB, and phpBB are the most popular of all hackers, because they are commonplace. For administrators of phpBB installations, which cannot be patched, Trend Micro’s deep security provides filters for the original phpBB vulnerability, which allowed hackers to obtain control of the vulnerable system. The vulnerability is particularly prone to exploitation by the phpBB, as was the case with the original phpBB vulnerability in 2014.
