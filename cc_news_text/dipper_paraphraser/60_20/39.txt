And as a result of the billâ€™s passage in the House of Representatives, Mr. Al Carlson, Mr. Fargo, urged the House of Representatives to veto the bill, indicating that it would be better to concentrate on securing funding for oil-rich districts when the revenue forecast is made public. Accordingly, the legislation was amended and included funding for the airports in Williston and McWilliam and other local grants that the committee approved in the last session but which have not yet been sown due to a lack of funds. A number of lawmakers in western North Dakota expressed their support for the bill. "It's a fact that there are some who think that things are going down in western North Dakota, but that couldn't be further from the truth," said the representative of the municipality of the states of watford and watford. According to a study conducted by the department of Justice and Public Safety at the time, the cities of dickinson, williston and minot, as well as the smaller communities in the oil region, testified in the hearing that the bill was needed to meet the debts that had already been incurred during the previous year. Moreover, the bill will fund the airports in williston and dickinson and other oil-related grants, which were approved in the last session, but were not yet delivered because of shortfalls in the budget. Then, the bill was amended to account for $7.5 million in fiscal expenditures, which the legislature considered necessary to pay for the additional expenses that were incurred by the oil-producing districts.
