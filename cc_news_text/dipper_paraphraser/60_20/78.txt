And that was one of the songs you performed at the "living since New York," a song which astonished those who do not know you as well as I do - it was a little ryan adams, with a '70s rock 'n' roll chorus and a super-sweet old time (he's about 23; it's fine, he's young , it's fine, it's a ballad, and he also sounded a little hot while singing, which was not in the least surprising to my co-workers, but could never have been a surprise to me ... the movie ' since new york' , the song you performed shocked those who do not know you as i do , it was a little ryan adams, a little '70s roots rock,' and a real sluggard (he's twenty, that's all right, but he's a little cool too , he's also in a sluggard , his singing faces and his guitar seem to me like they're barely playing ) he was even a little hot in the voice, which might have surprised my coworkers, but could never have surprised me ... oh, harry, my dear elven prince. you got me to like you so much when work made me sit through two showings of morgan spurlock's "adverse avenues" a couple of times this weekend, and the first time that you performed a solo song, you proved yourself to be a very good singer, and even in the midst of all your weird singing and guitar playing it
