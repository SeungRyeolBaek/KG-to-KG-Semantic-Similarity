The service, a branch of the interior department, proposed to include the bee in the federal program. The scientific consensus is that this bee is nearing extinction and will soon be able to do so. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the bumble bee population and range has been reduced by more than 90 percent, according to scientists. The law, as a result of the restriction of its property, was implemented, as it were, on the eleventh day of january, and was expected to take effect last friday. The case was submitted in the national court in the southern district of new york, in which the chief justice of the peace made its rulings, including a case for judicial review, to rescind the ban, which had been issued by the prior administration on the grounds of the protection of public health and the environment. . . . the u.s. fish and wildlife service, a branch of the interior department, in september proposed bringing the bee under the national protection. The club contends that the u.s. fish and wildlife service has been improperly regulated and that the national listing has been suspended until March 21, in the wake of a broader freeze by the White House of the United States in respect of the rules he issued in the past to safeguard the public health and the environment. The bee is one of 47 varieties of native bumblebees in the United States and Canada, more than a quarter of which are at risk of extinction, according to the international conservation of biodiversity.
