I’ll tell you that it has been a joy for twitter all year long. twitter has also been a joker, a social media platform, magically enmeshed in human emotions, which seem to always express one single feeling at a time, has a tendency to go mad, has a dark side and loves to attack, knowing that it has the power to build and destroy. Twitter has even gone mad at the cubs in the month of september. twitter in november, when donald trump finally admitted that barack obama was actually a born american, twitter imploded. Many times, twitter has been smashed. from one day to the next, it has proved to be all over the place, cannot decide what it wants to be, who it wants to be, how it wants to feel, up or down, and how it moves around the world. Twitter has lost all traces of what it wants, but it can’t be said for certain. It has even appeared as if twitter were enmeshed in a fantasy world. This year, too, Twitter was pretty much the same. And at one time, it even snarled. The point was, a puppy lost its mind about the wrecked house. Once, it even snarled . . . At one time, twitter even snarled. Twitter, the magical social media platform of human feeling which, however, seems to be always showing one emotion at a time, has a tendency to go crazy, has a dark side, and loves to attack, perhaps knowing that it has the power to destroy or build.
