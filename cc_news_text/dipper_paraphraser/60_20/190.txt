sydney (ap) - new coach bert van marwijk is confident that the Australian team can get past the group stage of the world cup and will be in the right to play their way up. a few hours after arriving in sydney, the coach said at a press conference that there was nothing wrong with the philosophy of his former coach ange postecoglou, but that he was a "really realistic coach" who would do whatever it took to win. "I respect my former coach (but I do it in my own way)," he said. " I like a creative football, I like to play the ball, but I also like to win - that is the main thing. " The main challenge of the new coach was that he had only the short time to get to know the current players before the tournament started in june. "At the tournament, we are playing in group c with france, denmark and peru. " I want to get to know the players very well in a very short time, he said. "I'm not good with the former coach, but i'm working in my own way," van marwijk said. "It's my job to be a very realistic coach," he said. "It's hard to compete with the old coach, it's difficult for me to be honest. "
