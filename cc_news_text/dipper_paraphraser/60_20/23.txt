The main thing is, that we are very much in need of a large, wide-ranging plan . . . but what about fargo? And what about bismarck? It’s always difficult to compare the two cities, because they have so many choices to make when it comes to examples. In both cities the north dakotas are enthusiastic about saving money. For example, in 2004, the town of Fargo passed an 18-month, half-cent sales tax to construct a new town library and two branch libraries with a 63-percent approval. In addition, in bismarck, the chamber of commerce and a steering committee recently raised more than $ 8 million to renovate the community bowl, in order to preserve the days when the municipal high school track meet was held there. ... But it seems—that's just the way it seems to others—that there's more "importance" in government. "This, however, is just how it is," writes omdahl. "We want a big role in government ... There are many places where citizens can be involved in government ... the great idea of making all citizens have a hand in it promotes the idea that everyone is important and should have a hand in it ... and when the town is worried about fargo or bismarck, it must have good reasons. " . . now it is our hope that grand forks' deeds will follow . . . that the city and its people will follow the mayor's lead in deciding on a lofty project (as the mayor did with choice health and fitness) and find ways to accomplish it.
