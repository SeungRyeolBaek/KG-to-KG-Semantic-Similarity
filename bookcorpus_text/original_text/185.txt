and there are actually a couple things i 'd like to pick up for myself .

i meet her at the anthropologie in georgetown mall , and we start going through the sale racks as we catch up .

while she 's not looking , i slip a couple sets of lingerie and sexy bras into my basket .

i want to wear something a little sexy for nate , but i do n't want to face allison 's inevitable questions if she sees what i 've picked out .

we eventually make our way to the changing rooms and begin trying on our choices .

i quickly slip on the first matching set of bra and panties .

i admire myself in the mirror .

the lace is a pale violet , and not overtly sexy-it 's anthropologie , not victoria 's secret , after all .

`` what do you think ? ''

allison asks suddenly , pulling the curtain aside and stepping into the dressing room with me .

she 's wearing a blue cotton dress and twirls for a second before she realizes what i 'm wearing .

her eyebrows raise .

`` whoa . ''

`` allison , '' i groan , pulling one of the more substantial pieces of clothing off a hanger to cover myself .

`` you know , i had a feeling something was different with you , '' she says , beginning to smile .

`` really ? ''

`` yup .

and i was right .

i always thought you two would make a good match . ''

`` what ?

that 's not what you said . ''

`` yeah , i totally called it ! ''

`` no , you completely warned me against the whole thing , '' i reply , confused and even slightly annoyed .

`` wait , '' she says with a frown , `` who are you talking about ? ''

`` who are you talking about ? ''

`` greg , obviously ... '' `` oh , right . ''

`` brynn ... '' `` what ? ''

i ask innocently .

`` if it 's not greg , who did you think i was talking about ? ''

she asks , her eyes widening .

`` it 's not important , ok ? ''

i reply , blushing .

`` brynn , no .

please tell me it 's not nate .

please .

i mean , he 's your stepbrother .

it 's ... it 's gross . ''

`` thanks a lot , allison .

not exactly what i needed to hear right now , '' i snap , turning my back to her to pull off the lingerie .

`` um , maybe it 's exactly what you need to hear right now .

i mean , what 's with you ?

you 're ignoring a perfectly nice guy to go out with some jock like nate . ''

`` well , first of all , it 's none of your business .

second of all , you 're actually completely right about greg .

he is 'perfectly nice . '

there 's no spark at all .

zero .

third of all , nate 's not 'some jock . '

he 's really smart , and kind , and funny .

and with him ?

sparks galore ! ''

`` god , brynn , i 'm just trying to look out for you .

you 're making some really bad decisions . ''

i take a deep breath , not wanting to raise my voice in this public place .

`` no , allison , you 're not trying to look out for me .

what you 're doing is judging me .

completely different .

and i really do n't appreciate it . ''

i finish pulling on my skirt and quickly slip my flats on as i grab my purse and walk quickly out of the dressing room .

i walk straight out of the store and toward the elevator to the parking garage , my cheeks burning with anger , though i also feel a bit like crying .

i 've never had a big fight like that with allison before , and i do n't like it .

i freeze outside another store just as i 'm about to reach the elevators .

victoria 's secret .

my relationship with nate is n't `` gross . ''

there 's nothing wrong with what we 're doing .

if anything , my conversation with allison has made me want to lean into my relationship with nate , not out of it .

i march in and straight to the raciest pieces i see .

when i get home , i hear my mom and pierce laughing in the kitchen , and the tv from the den .

i walk in there and smile in relief at the sight of nate with his feet up on the couch .

he moves his legs over and i plop down .

`` hi , '' i murmur with a smile .

`` hi , '' he replies .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

i frown at him , and he reaches up to his shoulder , miming pulling at something .

i stare at him for a moment before realizing he 's mirroring my own action of pulling at my hair .

i sigh and drop my hand .

`` it 's allison .

we had an argument , '' i explain .

`` she ... she found out . ''

he cocks his head and then lets out a low whistle as he realizes what i mean .

`` well , i suppose it 's not that bad .

i mean , i always thought ... '' he lowers his voice , looking back toward the kitchen where our parents are still talking .
