i walk straight to my bed and grab my pillow and swing it down as hard as i can onto the mattress .

i .

ca n't .

believe .

i .

ever .

had .

feelings .

for .

that .

asshole .

i think as i bring the pillow down again and again until i 'm out of breath .

it 's officially time for me to move on .

chapter fifteen `` you look nice , '' my mom says as i enter the kitchen , giving me a wink .

`` mom ... '' i reply , rolling my eyes .

`` well , you do !

where are you two going tonight ? ''

`` la mirabelle . ''

`` french-how romantic ! ''

`` it 's just a first date , ok ?

do n't get too excited . ''

i turn as nate and pierce enter from the dining room .

`` i just have a good feeling about this one , that 's all . ''

she continues , pouring me a glass of water , `` and he 's picking you up , right ? ''

`` oh , do you have a date tonight , brynn ? ''

pierce asks , wiggling his eyebrows at my mother .

`` yes , '' i groan , not wanting to make a big deal out of it .

`` greg !

the intern from your office , '' my mom tells him .

`` well , well .

you know , i remember seeing you two huddled together in the copy room last week , and thinking to myself , 'those two would make a fine couple . ' ''

i blush as my mom smiles enthusiastically .

it 's amazing how quickly things have gotten back to normal after that woman went on tv .

for about a week , a handful of photographers waited around outside the gate , but they eventually left when the buzz died down .

pierce told us he has investigators working to discredit the woman 's claims , and that everything will be back to normal .

as for nate and me ... `` so it 'll just be the three of us for dinner then , '' my mom chirps .

`` two , actually .

i 'm going out tonight , as well , '' nate replies casually .

i manage to resist the urge to look at him .

`` oh ? ''

my mom asks .

`` nate , you should 've let holly know about your plans .

how many times have i had this conversation with you ?

responsibility , responsibility , responsibility , '' pierce says as he crosses to the fridge .

i glance at my mom , but she 's looking down at her chopping board .

`` sorry , holly , '' nate says dutifully .

`` it 's alright , really , '' my mom says quietly .

thankfully , the doorbell rings and i can excuse myself .

angry as i am at nate , i still do n't like to hear his dad speak to him in such a condescending way .

i walk down the hallway to the foyer , and hear my mom and pierce following me .

i wince .

i was hoping i 'd get out the door without them all meeting-wishful thinking , clearly .

i smile at greg as i open the door .

he 's wearing a navy blazer and khakis , and looks a little nervous .

`` hey , greg , '' i greet him .

`` greg !

it 's so nice to meet you , '' my mom says from behind me , forcing me to open the door all the way .

`` good to see you , '' pierce says , shaking his hand .

`` mr. thornhill , '' greg replies formally .

i see nate appear in the entrance to the living room , leaning casually on the doorjamb but saying nothing .

he smiles at me as i catch his eye .

i frown at him and look away .

`` have her home by ten , '' pierce instructs greg .

`` yes , sir , '' greg replies .

pierce slaps him on the back just as i 'm about to protest .

`` do n't worry , greg , i 'm just giving you a hard time . ''

`` oh , you had me for a second there , '' greg says , exhaling in relief .

`` well , we should get going , '' i cut in so that pierce does n't have the chance to make any more hilarious jokes .

`` see you later ! ''

i call , pulling the door closed behind me .

i just catch nate 's smirking expression before i shut the door .

`` you alright ? ''

greg asks as we walk to his car .

i force a smile and nod my head .

`` yes , sorry !

my mind wandered for a second .

so , have you ever been to this restaurant before ? ''

greg chose a very nice french restaurant for our date , it 's a cozy , softly lit place set in the hills of potomac .

the wait staff is clearly passionate about their food , and delighted to have a young couple on a date that they can fawn over .

`` so , how is it working for your stepdad ? ''

greg asks with a grin .

`` you know , it 's not that bad .

i hardly ever think twice about it , really .

he 's all the way at the top of the company , and i 'm all the way at the bottom , so we rarely interact on a day-to-day basis . ''
