megan shook her head .

`` we need to get you cleaned up . ''

resignedly , he followed her into the room .

for the first time in a long time , he found himself on the opposite line of care .

he eased down onto the examining table .

`` really , megan , this is n't necessary . ''

as she busied herself taking out gauze , cotton balls , and antiseptic , she replied , `` quit your bitchin ' . ''

she glanced over her shoulder at him .

at what must have been his incredulous expression at her word choice , she grinned .

`` that 's right .

just shut up and let me take care of you . ''

`` when you put it like that , how can i not ? ''

he teased .

her laughter warmed his heart .

deep down , he was pleased to find her so attentive to him .

she obviously really cared about him if she insisted on cleaning him up .

or was she just attentive because she was a great nurse ?

but then there was the fact she punched dev for insulting him .

of course , that was also mortifying .

did that mean she questioned his manhood since he did n't go toe-to-toe with his brother ?

god , what she must think of him now .

as he allowed megan to treat his cuts , his thoughts turned to dev 's last verbal punch .

he grimaced about dev 's alluding to the fact he was in love with a ghost .

was that what stopped megan from believing his attraction to her ?

was she really hiding her commitment phobia behind a belief that he was still completely in love with his wife ?

his feelings gave him away when megan asked , `` are you hurting ? ''

`` no , i 'm fine . ''

when she gave him a skeptical look , he replied , `` it 's more the fact that i 'm angry than i am physically hurt . ''

`` so what exactly was all that about ? ''

she asked , as she dabbed some antiseptic along his jawline .

he winced when the medication hit the broken skin .

`` my brother is angry with me . ''

megan snorted .

`` no shit . ''

she held the cotton ball frozen as she eyed him curiously .

`` what i 'm wondering is what got him so fired up that he would stomp into a hospital , call you out , and then punch you ?

you are the last person on earth i would imagine being in a fight . ''

`` the reason is so cliche , '' he murmured .

`` enlighten me , '' she urged .

`` he 's a petulant child who did n't get his way-he 's lashing out at me because he thinks it 's all my fault . ''

`` i heard the name mia .

was it all about a woman ? ''

`` yes , that 's why i called it cliche . ''

he sucked in a harsh breath before filling megan in about what all had transpired between him , dev , and mia .

`` wow , '' she murmured , when he finished .

`` i suppose that is all one can say about the situation . ''

`` you were awfully kind to take care of her like you did-i mean , with both her abusive ex-boyfriend and dev . ''

he shrugged .

`` what else was i supposed to do ?

i cared for her , and i wanted to see her happy . ''

at the look that flashed in megan 's eyes , he quickly added , `` there was no amorous love between us .

i was happily married at the time , and she desperately needed someone to be strong for her . ''

megan cupped his unhurt cheek in her hand .

`` you really are the most decent man i 've ever known . ''

`` i do n't know about that , '' he murmured .

`` you truly are . ''

she shook her head .

`` no wonder women are so crazy about you .

it 's one thing for you to be so good-looking and a smart doctor , but then when you add in the fact of how sweet , caring , and compassionate you are , it 's like you 're a triple threat . ''

she turned to throw the cotton ball into the trash can .

his heartbeat thrummed louder and louder at her words while he sat unblinking and unmoving .

part of him wanted to rail at her for not seeing him like all the other women did .

if she truly saw what others did , then she would want to date him , would n't she ?

why could n't she see how good he could be for her ?

when megan met his tense gaze , she jerked back and momentarily faltered by dropping the piece of gauze in her hand .

she quickly deposited the soiled one in the trash and then got another one .

`` so this mia chick , she 's run off with some drummer , huh ? ''

she asked , clearly trying to change the subject and lighten the mood in the room .

`` not just any drummer .

a famous one at that . ''

`` really ?

what band ? ''

pesh 's cocked his head as he tried remembering .

`` something train . ''

megan gasped .

`` not runaway train ? ''

he snapped his fingers .

`` that 's it . ''

clapping her hand to her chest , megan 's eyes widened .

`` you know someone who knows aj resendiz ? ''
