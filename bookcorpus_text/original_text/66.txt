kristi chuckled .

`` you know exactly what i mean . ''

`` it is true that we know each other outside of the hospital , but when we 're in the er , our relationship is strictly professional . ''

`` i never said it was n't . ''

after gazing around the somewhat deserted parking lot , he shook his head .

`` what you 're alluding to between me and megan ?

nothing good can come of those types of rumors . ''

patting his arm , kristi smiled .

`` there are no rumors-merely an observation by someone who loves and admires you . ''

his brows rose in surprise .

`` you do n't disapprove ? ''

`` of course not .

i think it 's a good match for both you and her . ''

he remained silent for a few moments , contemplating her words .

`` perhaps i should call and check on her . ''

`` i think that would be a very good idea . ''

she took her keys out of her purse and motioned at the honda they were standing in front of .

`` well , this is me . ''

`` have a good night , kristi . ''

`` same to you , dr. nadeen .

and good luck . ''

he smiled .

`` thank you .

i appreciate that . ''

when he got to his car , he slid inside and took his phone out .

he scrolled through his contacts to find megan 's number .

after he dialed , he anxiously drummed his fingers on the steering wheel .

the call went to her voicemail , leaving him with a defeated feeling .

although he knew it probably was n't the best idea in the world , he decided to go to her house to check on her .

the moment he rang her parents ' doorbell he really regretted making a house call .

one of her younger brothers answered .

`` hey , what 's up ? ''

he asked .

`` hello .

i 'm dr. nadeen .

i work with megan . ''

snapping his fingers , he pointed at pesh .

`` wait , i know you .

are n't you noah 's godfather ? ''

pesh smiled .

`` yes , i am . ''

`` cool .

listen man , megan 's downstairs .

if you go around the side of the house , she has her own door . ''

`` i see .

thank you then . ''

`` no problem . ''

when the door closed , pesh debated going straight to his car .

but he knew it would look even worse if her brother told her he had been there and then he had left without seeing her .

heaving a frustrated breath , he headed off the porch .

he followed the sidewalk around the house to where it sloped down the hill .

at the side door , he knocked loudly .

when the door flew open , megan stared at him in a mixture of both surprise and horror .

`` what are you doing here ? ''

she demanded .

pesh shoved his hands in his pockets .

`` you called in sick today .

i was worried . ''

`` i 'm fine . ''

he fought the urge to say that by her disheveled appearance and dark circles under her eyes , she most certainly did n't seem fine .

`` i tried calling you , but you did n't answer .

kristi and i were worried about you . ''

her expression softened a little .

`` i 'm sorry .

i must 've forgotten to charge my phone . ''

`` can i get you something to eat ?

some soup maybe ? ''

`` really , i 'm fine . ''

`` but you look so pale .

will you let me do an exam ?

you know the flu is- '' `` i do n't have the flu . ''

`` how can you be sure if you have n't been checked ?

did you get the flu shot at the hospital ?

sometimes it can give you a mild case . ''

she shook her head and smiled .

`` i do n't have the flu .

since you 're going to keep on and on , i 'm going to go ahead and tell you .

i have really horrendous cramps with my period .

usually , i can manage them with birth control , but when i started clinicals and stopped working , i could n't afford the birth control without health insurance .

and it was n't like i was ha**ng s*x anyway . ''

while he appreciated her honesty , he was also slightly mortified .

`` oh , i see . ''

`` i 'm sorry to have embarrassed you , '' megan said .

he waved his hand dismissively .

`` listen , when you return to work tomorrow , there will be a script for you for birth control .

i do n't like the idea of you in pain , so i do n't want this to happen next month . ''

`` but the money , '' she protested .

he shook his head .

`` it will be discounted through the hospital pharmacy . ''

`` thank you , pesh .

that 's a very decent thing for you to do . ''

a blonde head peeked around megan .

`` hi esh .

you play ? ''

he smiled at mason .

`` i came to check on your mommy . ''

mason tilted his chin to look up at megan .

`` her tummy hurts .

she no play .

u play ? ''

`` um , well ... '' he wanted nothing more than to spend time with mason , and in the same token , with megan as well .
