`` forget other people .

me having to hear it was painful enough . ''

crossing his arms over his chest , aidan said , `` i came over here to ask if we were going to eat or not ?

people are getting restless .

i had no idea i was going to interrupt such an interesting conversation .

of course , i do n't think i want to know why the two of you are discussing emma 's and my sex life right now . ''

emma waved her hand dismissively .

`` we were n't .

and yes , we 're ready to eat .

let 's round everyone up . ''

as emma walked off to call people to sit down , aidan grinned at megan before saying , `` total freak . ''

megan closed her eyes as if in pain .

`` spare me .

please . ''

`` just saying .

because you never know if your gentleman might be a super freak too . ''

and with a wink , he walked off to join emma , leaving megan to wonder why everyone seemed so concerned with hers and pesh 's love lives .

as the sunlight started fading , most of the party guests began to trickle out the door .

by the time it was dark , it was only a few of aidan and emma 's close friends left .

megan had let her parents take a sleepy mason home , vowing she wanted to stay to help emma clean up .

the truth was she wanted to spend as much time as she could with pesh .

thankfully , she found herself sitting next to him at one of the poolside tables .

somehow they managed to end up by themselves after some of the other guests had left .

leaning forward in her chair , she asked , `` did you always want to be a doctor ? ''

pesh nodded .

`` for my fifth birthday , my father bypassed the usual play doctor 's kits by giving me a real medical bag with tools from the hospital .

i examined everyone who would stand still long enough , including the two dogs . ''

megan laughed .

`` i bet you were a cute little doctor . ''

`` my mother has some embarrassing pictures , '' he replied , with a smile .

`` so your father was also a doctor ? ''

`` yes , he had a general medicine practice for forty years .

he just recently retired . ''

`` did he pressure you to follow in his footsteps ? ''

he grinned .

`` i 'm starting to feel like i 'm being interrogated . ''

she laughed .

`` i 'm sorry if you feel that way .

i 'm just trying to get to know you . ''

`` you 're certainly a very attractive interrogator , '' he said .

`` i think you 're avoiding the question by flattering me . ''

`` there 's flattery and then there 's the truth . ''

cocking her brows , she replied , `` and then there 's not answering my question . ''

he held up his hands in defeat .

`` fine , fine .

no , i did n't feel pressure to become a doctor .

my father would have never wanted me to pursue a profession where i did n't feel useful . ''

megan smiled .

`` so you 've always had a need to help people ? ''

`` pretty much .

as the oldest , i always looked out for my two younger brothers and sister .

my mother has always called me an old soul . ''

`` i can see that about you . ''

leaning forward , he rested his elbows on the table .

`` now it is my turn to be the interrogator . ''

`` okay , i do n't mind . ''

`` what about you ?

did you always see nursing in your future ? ''

`` yes and no .

originally , i wanted to be a doctor . ''

his brows shot up in surprise .

`` really ? ''

when she nodded , he asked , `` what happened ? ''

there was no way she was going to tell him the truth about her past and why she had been forced to abandon medical school .

instead , she shrugged .

`` life happened , i guess .

i decided on the next best thing , which was nursing . ''

pesh stared thoughtfully at her .

`` was it your son ? ''

`` excuse me ? ''

`` was it your son who changed your plans about medical school ? ''

she shook her head .

`` no , it was before i had mason . ''

`` does he ... are you ... ? ''

pesh shook his head .

`` forgive me .

i was being too forward . ''

`` no , go ahead .

i told you i was n't afraid to answer your questions . ''

he grimaced .

`` but it 's rude to pry , and it 's not my business . ''

`` just ask your question , '' she replied .

after a resigned sigh , he finally asked , `` were you married ? ''

`` no , i 'm not divorced .

and no , mason 's father does n't have anything to do with him . ''

anger flashed in pesh 's dark eyes .

`` even though i know nothing of him , i know that he is not a man .

a man does not abandon his children and his responsibilities . ''

`` you would be right .

he 's just a boy playing at being a man , '' she replied , glancing down at the table .
