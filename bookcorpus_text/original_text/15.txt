after spending a few moments in tense silence , megan leaned forward to flick on the radio .

`` do you mind ? ''

`` go ahead . ''

humming along with one of the songs , she laid her head back on the seat .

`` i wo n't hurt your ears by singing . ''

`` do you not sing ? ''

`` oh , i sing , but i do n't do it well .

emma 's the one with the voice . ''

`` so i 've heard . ''

turning to look at him , megan asked , `` did she ever sing for you ? ''

`` sadly , no . ''

megan harrumphed as she crossed her arms over her chest .

`` she made out with you , but she would n't sing for you ?

that 's just rude . ''

pesh made a strangled noise .

`` emma told you ... about us ? ''

`` mmm , hmm . ''

she grinned at him .

`` i hear you 're a great kisser . ''

cutting his eyes over to her , he gave her a pained look .

`` it really was n't like that for us .

i mean , we were n't in love with each other . ''

`` yeah , that 's what she said .

course , she did admit that you got her all hot and bothered . ''

`` s-she did ? ''

he stammered , embarrassment coloring his cheeks .

`` hey , the ability to get a woman hot is nothing to be ashamed of .

hell , i got turned on when i first saw you today .

like my panties got wet . ''

`` megan , do n't , '' pesh warned , gripping the steering wheel to where his knuckles turned white .

turning in her seat , she eyed him before licking her lips .

`` you do n't want me to say how you got me hot in a church ?

how you still get me hot acting all bashful about the sex talk ? ''

`` please .

just do n't . ''

`` fine , '' she muttered , before flouncing back in her seat .

she did n't speak to him for a long time .

instead , she closed her eyes and laid back with her head cushioned on the head rest .

when the car started to slow , she snapped her eyes open .

she did n't know if she fell asleep or passed out .

sitting up , she peered out the window at the posh houses of the subdivision they were in .

as they pulled into the driveway , megan could n't help staring up at the house .

`` holy shit , this place is beautiful . ''

pesh chuckled .

`` thank you . ''

`` i know you think it 's just the alcohol talking , but i 'm serious .

you have great taste . ''

`` i hope you 'll like the inside just as much . ''

`` i 'm sure i will . ''

after he came around to open the door , she hopped out of the car a little too fast .

her wobbly legs wavered , and she ended up crashing into pesh 's chest .

staring up at him , she gave an apologetic smile .

`` sorry about that . ''

`` it 's fine .

need some help ? ''

with the alcohol fueling her libido , she replied , `` if it means having your hands on me , then sure . ''

pesh grimaced , but his arm still came around her waist to steady her .

she loped along beside him .

after he unlocked the door and punched in the alarm code , she followed him inside .

her blurry vision took in the expansive kitchen with his gleaming stainless steel appliances .

she followed him as he made his way into the living room .

motioning toward the couch , he said , `` why do n't you have a seat while i fix you some coffee ? ''

while it was a nice idea to sober herself up , she did n't want any coffee .

she just wanted pesh .

grabbing the lapels of his suit coat , she pulled herself flush against him .

`` when did you put this back on ? ''

she wondered aloud .

she felt so tiny against his massive chest .

it was a good feeling though-one of safety and protection .

it also lit her even more on fire with lust .

cocking her head , she glanced up at him to survey his expression .

even in the semi-darkness , she could see his dark eyes burning with desire .

she ran her hands up his chest to his neck .

she tugged him down to where his face was inches from hers .

fortified with liquid courage , she brought her lips to his .

she could n't help the little moan that came from deep in her throat .

pesh 's mouth was warm , soft , and inviting .

the brief connection made her want him all the more-for him to devour her .

tentatively , she slid her tongue across his bottom lip , beckoning him to open for her .

almost instantaneously , the warmth of his tongue met hers .

they slid against each other , tasting , searching , and seeking .

he gripped her face in his hands , holding her captive as his tongue plunged in and out of her mouth .

emma had been right-the man could kiss like there was no tomorrow .

he knew when to be gentle with his mouth and then when to switch to more demanding , almost conquering kisses .
