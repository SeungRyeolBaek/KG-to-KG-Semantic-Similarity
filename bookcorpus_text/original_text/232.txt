deb says enthusiastically , `` you do n't want to hang out with us old farts on your birthday .

go have fun with emerson and his friends !

do n't you think she should , bob ? ''

`` sure , '' my dad says , `` sounds like it could be a fun time for you kids . ''

`` what do you say , abby ? ''

emerson asks .

there 's a glint in his blue eyes , a spark of secrecy .

i do n't quite know what he 's up to , or why he 's scrapped our plans for the weekend , but anything would be better than being stuck here alone with our parents on my birthday .

`` ok , '' i say flatly , leaning back against the couch .

`` sounds ... great . ''

`` as long as you 're on time for the wedding , '' my dad reminds us warningly .

`` super , '' emerson grins , snatching away the bag of milano cookies i 've been noshing on .

`` we 'll leave tomorrow after school .

get as much out of the weekend as we can . ''

`` sounds good , bro , '' i say , glowering at him as he steals my snack .

`` oh , is n't that just so precious ? ''

deb grins , as emerson disappears upstairs .

i watch his retreating back , my mind reeling .

i 'm hurt , and confused , and incredibly disappointed about our plans being scattered .

how can he think it 's ok to just blow me off like this , after everything i shared with him last night ?

it does n't make any sense .

he seemed just as eager to have some ... alone time together as i did .

what the hell gives ?

my concentration has been absolutely demolished .

there 's no way i 'm getting any more homework done today .

unwilling to listen to my parents ' sickly-sweet chatter , i head up to my own room , lock the door , and whip out my battery-operated boyfriend .

if i 'm not going to get any action this weekend after all , i 'd better stock up on the self love every chance i get .

i 'm well accustomed to taking care of myself , anyway .

still smarting from emerson 's dismissal , i leave for the school the next morning without even sticking around to wish him a happy birthday .

i halfway expect the rest of the student body to burst out laughing as i hurry into school , convinced that emerson will have spread the word about what a dramatic weirdo i am .

but as usual , my entrance into homeroom goes unnoticed by all my peers save riley .

my best friend waves me over , noticing at once that i 'm in a terrible mood .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

she asks , as i sit down beside her .

`` oh , you know , '' i sigh , `` just everything in the entire world . ''

without a word , she takes my hand and tows me toward the classroom door .

our teacher , a beleaguered , balding man in his forties , looks up from his game of computer solitaire as we march past .

`` excuse me , '' he says testily .

`` where do you ladies think you 're going ? ''

without missing a beat , riley spins around to face him , plants a hand on her hip , and says , `` we both just got our periods simultaneously .

they 're super heavy too .

like , horror-movie level .

so we 're gon na go take care of our woman issues together .

ok ?

bye ! ''

the teacher 's face drains of color as we traipse out of the room and slam the door behind us .

the rest of our schoolmates are in their classrooms already , so we 're all alone as we beat a quick path through the halls and hole up in one of the girls ' bathrooms .

we squeeze ourselves into one of the larger stalls and settle down for a good long talk .

riley cracks a window so that she can enjoy a gossip-session cigarette , and i tell her about emerson 's surreptitious change of plans for the weekend .

`` that does n't make any sense , '' she says , putting her smoke out on the windowsill .

`` tell me about it ! ''

i exclaim , letting my head fall back against the tile wall .

`` there 's got to be more to it , '' she says resolutely .

`` why would he all but profess his love for you one night- ? ''

`` he professed his wanting to bone me , '' i correct her , `` not his love . ''

`` right , '' riley says , rolling her eyes , `` why would he profess his whatever , only to leave you high and dry ?

does n't follow . ''

`` you 're the expert on man-brains , '' i reply , `` you tell me what i 'm supposed to make of all this . ''

`` just wait it out , '' she tells me , resting her hands on my shoulders .

`` i 'm sure there 's an explanation , here . ''

having unloaded some of my frustration , i feel like i can at least make it through the rest of the day without exploding .

we 'll see how i feel once i 'm cooped up in some beach house with a bunch of emerson 's buddies .

as i step out of the girl 's bathroom with riley right behind me , i very nearly crash into a wall of person that appears out of nowhere .
