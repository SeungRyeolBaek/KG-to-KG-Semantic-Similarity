or the month after .

he descended into an alcoholic depression that far exceeded the one he 'd fallen into after mom 's death .

i could n't go back to his house-i did n't feel safe there .

i stayed with riley for a few days before my grandparents arrived on the scene .

they came up from florida and took me in to one of their nearby summer homes for the duration of the school year .

dad did n't even put up a fight when they took me away .

but he did tell them all about finding me in bed with emerson the morning after the wedding .

and even though nothing had happened between us that night , my grandparents looked at me a little differently from then on .

in no time at all , the marriage was annulled .

no one will tell me where emerson and deb have gone , and i do n't even know where to start looking .

but to be honest , i 'm too brokenhearted to search very hard .

if emerson wanted me to know where he was , i 'd know .

as painful as it is , i have to accept the fact that he does n't want to be a part of my life .

even once our parents ' marriage is dissolved , there 's no trace of him .

so be it .

i dive into the last semester of my schoolwork , and end up graduating in the top ten percent of my class .

riley and i both decide to continue our studies in the fall at the new school in new york city .

my grandparents agree to pay for the portion of my tuition that is n't covered by scholarships , and even let riley and me stay in the apartment they own in new york as an investment property .

i spend the summer by my best friend 's side , slowly but surely coming to terms with everything that 's happened .

i tell myself every day that come fall , i 'll be able to leave the whole ugly mess of my childhood behind me .

and hopefully , my memories of emerson sawyer along with it .

chapter twelve new york city eight years later `` which do you like better ? ''

i ask anxiously , holding two dresses up before me , `` the black , or the navy ? ''

riley rolls her eyes at my outfit choices .

`` i 'd like it if you ever bought anything that you could n't also wear to a funeral , '' she replies .

`` would you be serious ? ''

i plead , `` my interview is in two hours , and god knows it 's probably going to take me an hour to get there , and i might have to stop and find a starbucks to pee in first because i ca n't ask to pee during an interview- '' `` abby , '' riley says , taking my just-scrubbed face in her hands .

`` relax .

you 're going to nail this .

you are perfect for this job . ''

i stare back at her , trying to have as much confidence in me as she does .

in the past six years , riley has transformed from a dissatisfied party girl to a successful pr powerhouse .

she 's traded in the cheap vodka for top-shelf martinis and the house parties for bottle service and chef 's tables at all the best places in the city .

we 've been living together since we were eighteen , and are closer than ever because of it .

but being close means being blunt , and she does n't hold back with me now .

`` if you do n't take a breath and cool it , you 're going to be kicking yourself all the way home , '' she says , marching me over to her closet .

she rummages through her colorful wardrobe and hands me an emerald green blouse and yellow pencil skirt .

`` here .

put these on . ''

`` they 're very ... bright , '' i say .

`` just like you ! ''

she grins .

`` you 're interviewing at a creative agency , not a morgue , for christ 's sake .

a little color will be good , trust me . ''

`` well .

thanks , '' i sigh , taking the pieces and heading back into my room to change .

`` i wo n't fill them out as well as you , but ... '' `` if you think i 'm going to cry you a river for having stayed the same size since you were seventeen years old , you 've got another thing coming to you , '' riley tells me .

`` speaking of getting older , though , what do you want to do for your birthday this weekend ? ''

`` nothing , '' i tell her through the crack in my bedroom door .

`` that 's not an option , '' she replies , as i slip into the clothes she 's leant me .

`` you know i hate my birthday , '' i call back , piling my hair into a quick , wispy up do .

it 's still blonde , if a bit of a darker shade than when i was a kid .

`` all i ever want is to have a quiet night at home . ''

`` and you know that i 've never taken that for an answer , '' riley reminds me , rustling around the kitchen .

`` my grandparents are already taking me out to some swanky restaurant , '' i tell her , `` i owe it to them for letting us stay in this place . ''
