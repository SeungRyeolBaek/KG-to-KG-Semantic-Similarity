she gave megan a pointed look .

`` most of all , he wants that for you , too . ''

megan wrinkled her nose .

`` but i 'm really not ready for all of that yet . ''

`` then think long and hard before you agree to do anything about pesh .

he is unknowingly very persuasive , and in the moment , you might forget your resolve only to have it come back later to hurt you ... or him . ''

megan held up her hands in defeat .

`` okay , okay , i promise . ''

emma smiled .

`` nothing would make me happier than if you were to fall in love with pesh . ''

with a laugh , megan said , `` did you just hear anything that i said ?

i 'm anti-love . ''

`` so was aidan . ''

just as megan opened her mouth to protest , aidan waltzed into the room .

`` everything okay ? ''

`` fine .

just finished feeding and dressing him , '' emma replied `` good .

the natives are getting restless to see the little man of the hour before the baptism . ''

he strode over to them and took his son into his arms .

`` you ready to go work the crowd , noah ? ''

noah 's response was to grunt and reach for aidan 's tie .

with a laugh , aidan announced , `` i 'll take that as a yes . ''

he then leaned in to kiss emma 's cheek .

`` ready mrs .

fitzgerald ? ''

she smiled before linking her arm through his .

`` yes , mr. fitzgerald , i am . ''

megan and casey followed them out the door and down the hallway .

they entered a noisy room crammed with family and friends .

she left aidan and emma 's side to seek out her parents to check on mason .

she found her parents , but their arms were empty .

in a panic , she demanded , `` where 's mason ? ''

her father smiled and pointed over to where a pile of her younger cousins were .

mason was on the lap of her aunt becky 's oldest son , john .

mason was mesmerized with what whatever john was doing on his phone .

megan smiled as she walked up to them .

`` everything okay ? ''

without taking his eyes off the screen , john replied , `` we 're fine . ''

`` are you sure he 's not bothering you ? ''

what she was n't asking was if john was actually keeping an eye on mason between playing on his phone .

john glanced up .

`` considering i have two younger brothers , i think i can handle him .

besides , he 's really into this game . ''

`` okay then , '' megan replied .

she spoke to john 's brothers , percy and georgie , before making her way around the room .

all her relatives were interested to hear how her schooling was going and how mason was .

she had just turned away from talking to her great aunt and uncle when someone pressed up against her back .

`` do n't look now , but there 's dr. mcdreamy bollywood now , '' casey whispered into her ear .

without hesitation , her eyes scanned the crowd .

and then she saw him .

ankle was taking him around and making introductions .

pesh was impossibly tall and wearing a tailor-made black suit .

even beneath the lines of the clothing , she could make out his large biceps and thick thighs .

he obviously spent his downtime between hospital shifts working out .

his wavy , jet-black hair was cut short , and his dark eyes took in all that ankle was saying .

and while she may have been in a church about to stand up as a godmother , she could n't help the ni**les tightening and panties moistening reaction of seeing him .

he was all the way across the room , but he had the same effect as if he were standing by her side , rubbing against her .

`` see what i mean ? ''

casey questioned .

megan licked her lips .

`` oh my , '' she finally managed .

`` sure you do n't want to give him a chance ? ''

fighting the urge to fan herself , megan quickly replied , `` i 'd like to give him many , many chances . ''

chances at ripping off my clothes , chances at kissing and licking me all over my body , chances at allowing his hands , fingers , and the promising bulge in his pants to stroke me until i orgasm ... yep , many , many chances .

as if she could read megan 's mind , casey laughed .

`` oh girl , this has trouble written all over it . ''

chapter three pesh paced nervously around the back of the cathedral .

the fact he was in a catholic church was n't the only reason he felt out of his element .

as he eyed the massive statue of jesus , he fidgeted absently with his tie .

although emma had sworn aidan was fine with the idea of him as godfather , he was still a little apprehensive about seeing aidan again .

the last time they 'd been together , pesh was the hero flying aidan from north carolina to atlanta just in time for noah 's unexpected birth .

but that was six months ago .

the euphoria of the moment now had time to fade , and to aidan , pesh could still be the man who almost stole emma away .

a side door opened , and aidan stepped out .
