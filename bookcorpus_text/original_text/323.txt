`` i do n't think this is an appropriate conversation , '' she snapped .

`` i agree , '' dharr said .

but victoria ignored them .

`` well , think of your memories of your mother and father .

what 's the one thing you remember the most ? ''

she asked , turning to arina first .

arina looked to ms. mattingly , then to dharr who slowly nodded his head .

given permission , arina pursed her lips , thinking hard .

after several minutes , she whispered , `` bedtime kisses . ''

`` what did your mother smell like ? ''

victoria asked softly .

`` flowers . ''

victoria smiled encouragingly , feeling a huge sense of relief that she was breaking through , even in a small way , with arina .

`` and what did she feel like ? ''

`` soft , '' bajan stepped in .

arina looked over at bajan , wanting to cry but knowing her brother would n't do it , therefore , it was probably inappropriate at the moment in her eyes .

`` think about those feelings .

i guarantee that they will last forever , '' victoria said .

she then clapped her hands together gently .

`` know what ? ''

she said and all four sets of eyes looked up at her again .

`` your uncle has given me permission to play with you for the morning .

what do you think of that ? ''

victoria asked , looking at both children .

both of them turned to face ms. mattingly who nodded her head .

`` if his highness has approved the interruption , then i suppose it is okay . ''

dharr stood up and bowed .

`` i leave you both in ms. mason 's hands .

mind your manners and behave , '' he said sternly .

when both children nodded in response , dharr turned on his heel and left the breakfast room .

as soon as he left , ms. mattingly also departed , although her body language conveyed the message that she disapproved of the interruption to her daily schedule with the children .

arina and bajan both stared at victoria who just grimaced after the stern lady 's departure .

`` she 's pretty tough , is n't she ? ''

neither child agreed , nor would either of them crack a smile .

`` can either of you show me to the play room ? ''

victoria asked , searching for something that would break through their silence .

`` i 'd rather not spend our short time together in the school room and i do n't know the palace well enough to suggest another place where we can get to know each other . ''

they led her down the hallway to a sunny , wonderful room filled with lovely toys for all ages .

it took a while , but eventually , victoria got them to engage in the toys .

as they played , she talked to them , getting them to slowly start to talk about their feelings and their grief .

but at lunchtime , ms. mattingly arrived and halted the play , escorting the children to the schoolroom where victoria sat and observed , fuming at the woman 's need to control little people who were supposed to wriggle and squirm .

instead of waiting for dharr to come to her that night , she sought him out , waiting outside his office this time until he finished his meeting .

she did n't want another repeat of the previous night 's interrogation .

unfortunately , she did n't have much to report .

but she promised to keep trying .

as soon as the discussion was over , she hurried out of his office , almost running to her suite of rooms in order to avoid dharr .

that 's how the whole first week went .

the children did n't open up very much , nor did she do so to dharr .

she refused all dinner invitations , explaining that she 'd rather eat with the children but some nights , she ate in her own room , not able to deal with ms. mattingly 's sternly disapproving demeanor any longer .

saturday morning , ten days after her arrival , she had a breakthrough of the most amazing kind .

she was sound asleep when she heard the door to her suite open .

turning , she was about to pull the sheets up over her revealing tee-shirt when she heard the small footsteps .

it was arina .

she was staring at victoria 's sleep drugged face , tears streaming down her chubby , beautiful cheeks .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

she asked , pulling the little girl into her arms , cradling her and rocking her back and forth .

`` arina , please tell me what 's happened , '' victoria begged , genuinely worried about the small , shaking little girl in her arms .

`` i miss my mommy , '' she whispered as if it were an awful secret .

`` oh , dear .

i 'm so glad , '' victoria said , pulling the child closer to her .

`` i know , sweetheart . ''

`` you know ? ''

the child asked , looking up into victoria 's face .

`` how did you know ? ''

victoria smiled through her own tears .

`` arina there 's no way anyone could lose their mother and father and not feel sad , '' she said .

`` but i 'm supposed to be strong , '' she said , laying her head against victoria 's chest .

`` who said ? ''

victoria asked carefully .

if dharr or ms. mattingly had said that to her , she would absolutely contradict them .
