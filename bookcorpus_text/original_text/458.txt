she shook her head .

`` you ca n't embarrass the staff by bringing me into that elegant restaurant , '' she stated emphatically .

`` believe me , i 'm one of the staff that becomes embarrassed almost daily .

it 's horrible . ''

if she had put it any other way , he would have just ignored her and taken her anyway .

`` what kinds of things embarrass you ? ''

he asked , eager to hear more about her life .

she shrugged causally , but her eyes were twinkling with amusement .

`` maybe not so much embarrassment , but perhaps there are some guest proclivities that are shocking . ''

he laughed softly .

`` i have a feeling that it does n't take much to shock you . ''

she shook her head .

`` initially , that might have been true .

but i 've been working at this job for about a year now and , believe me , there are shocking things that occur in a hotel .

i do n't understand why people do some of the things they do , but it boggles the mind . ''

zayn knew that some people enjoyed hotels because of their anonymity , which released them from their normal moral codes , freed them from inhibitions .

`` i doubt that much would boggle my mind . ''

except for a strikingly beautiful woman like ella who was untouched at the ripe old age of eighteen .

`` so give me the juicy details . ''

she grinned , thinking back to some of the issues she 'd encountered .

`` well , the security guards see much more than i do , but there have been several occasions when i 've walked in on a couple ... being intimate , '' she said as if `` having sex '' were too graphic .

his eyebrows slashed down again as his anger surfaced .

`` what were you doing when they were in flagrante delicto ? ''

he asked .

she laughed softly at his term .

`` i have to check the rooms as they are cleaned and report back when they are ready for guests .

there have been several times when i 've knocked , announced myself and walked in on couples . ''

his eyebrow went up .

`` does this happen often ? ''

he asked .

she shrugged one delicate shoulder but moved on .

they continued to discuss the amusing things that occurred in a hotel until they arrived at the restaurant .

she looked out , her eyes looking worried and her hands once again trying to smooth out any wrinkles in her plain dress .

compared to the others that were walking into the restaurant , she looked cheap and poor .

`` zayn , i 'd really rather not go inside , '' she said carefully , unaware that her fingers were tangling together in her lap nervously .

zayn looked down at her , taking pity on her anxiousness .

he picked up his phone and said something in a language she did n't understand .

a moment later , he nodded and closed the phone .

`` a private dining room has been arranged , '' he explained and without waiting for her to say anything else , he stepped out of the limousine and extended his hand for her , not accepting any more excuses .

ella cringed at the extra expense but put her hand into his warm one and followed him into the restaurant .

a huge fuss was made upon his arrival , but she was relieved when they were escorted to a relatively large private dining room .

the view was extraordinary with large windows looking out over the potomac river with all the boats moving about on the water .

she smiled , delighted with the room .

`` this is lovely , '' she said , pretending that the cost would n't be an issue .

ella did n't dare order a pizza , but savored spicy , cheesy pasta in a delicate red sauce with all sorts of seafood as well as crusty bread that was drenched in garlic butter .

she 'd never tasted anything so delicious and could barely keep up her end of the conversation as she feasted on the amazing foods .

when the entire plate of pasta was gone , she sat back in her chair , delicately wiping her mouth with the linen napkin .

`` thank you , zayn .

that really was delicious , '' she said with a shy smile .

zayn leaned forward , enjoying her pleasure .

`` what would you like for dessert ? ''

he asked , thinking about what he wanted for his after dinner pleasure .

not to be , he reminded himself .

ella was barely a woman .

she deserved so much more .

ella shook her head and raised her hand .

`` nothing more , '' she begged with a soft , lilting laugh .

`` i could n't eat another bite . ''

he shook his head .

`` you ca n't miss the chocolate delicacies here , '' he argued .

`` they 're incredible . ''

she laughed again .

`` you 're taunting me .

you know how much i love pasta and i 've already overindulged .

now you 're teasing my sweet tooth but it is n't going to work this time .

i am too full to even be tempted . ''

zayn raised an eyebrow at her challenge .

turning to the waiter who was standing by the wall , he said , `` pack up one each of all of your desserts .

we 'll try them later , '' he said .

the waiter bowed and left the room quickly , eager to fulfill the order .
