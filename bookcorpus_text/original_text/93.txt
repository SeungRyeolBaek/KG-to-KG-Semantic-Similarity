`` there 's my baby boy ! ''

emma cried hoarsely , smothering both his cheeks in kisses .

he snuggled up to emma 's side .

`` come on , meggie .

you and pesh come in first , '' aidan suggested .

megan did n't argue with him .

instead , she took pesh 's hand and followed aidan inside .

emma glanced up and shook her head .

`` i 'm so sorry for ruining your engagement party . ''

`` you did n't ruin our night , '' pesh reassured her .

`` that 's right .

we kept right on partying-it did n't bother us at all , '' megan teased .

emma laughed .

`` i 'm glad to hear that . ''

megan smiled and jerked her chin over at aidan , who sat in the rocker with caroline .

`` congratulations on a beautiful baby girl . ''

`` thank you , '' emma replied , as a beaming smile lit up her face .

`` are you feeling okay ? ''

pesh asked .

emma nodded .

`` it was a little easier this time and a lot quicker . ''

she turned to aidan .

`` and this time i did n't have to worry that aidan might not make it . ''

aidan chuckled .

`` no , you just kept screaming at me to drive faster because you were not going to deliver caroline on the side of the interstate . ''

emma 's cheeks flushed .

`` i guess i was a little panicked . ''

pesh took megan 's hand and squeezed it .

`` we better go and let the others have a turn , '' he said .

`` do you want us to take noah back with us ? ''

considering he was plastered to his mother 's side , megan was n't really looking forward to trying to take him .

emma gazed down at her son with love burning in her eyes .

`` no , i think he can stay here with us a little longer .

i might get connor to take him home .

i know he 'll be here until casey delivers . ''

`` are you sure you wo n't need your rest ? ''

megan asked .

`` oh , i 'll pawn him off to aidan and make sure i get plenty of sleep until miss caroline needs me , '' emma replied , with a sly smile .

aidan did n't argue with her .

he looked perfectly content to lose sleep if it meant being surrounded by his wife and children .

after exchanging a few hugs and kisses , she and pesh headed out into the hallway and let the next group in .

as they walked down the hall hand in hand , pesh turned to her and smiled .

`` you know , i never thought i would see the day i would be envious of aidan again . ''

`` what do you mean ? ''

he heaved a sigh .

`` seeing him with his children makes me envious .

one day i hope that 's you with my child in your arms . ''

`` oh , '' she murmured .

whether or not they would have children together had never really been discussed .

it was almost a given that they would , so it did n't seem necessary to iron out when and how many .

she wanted nothing more than to give pesh a baby of his own .

he was truly the father mason had never had .

`` give me a year , '' she said softly .

his brows furrowed in confusion .

`` what ? ''

`` i 'd like one year for us to be together as a married couple before we try to have children . ''

`` that only makes me an even older father , '' he protested .

`` you 'll be fine .

you 're awfully spry for your old age . ''

he laughed .

`` i just do n't want to be on a walker at his or her high school graduation . ''

she smacked his arm playfully .

`` one year is not going to make that much a difference . ''

`` fine .

you win .

we 'll wait one year . ''

as the elevator doors dinged open , they stepped inside .

gazing down at her , pesh said , `` i could n't have picked a more amazing mother for my future children . ''

`` yeah , i got ta agree that you did good , nadeen .

real good , '' she teased .

he cupped her face in his hands and gave her a lingering kiss that silenced anymore of her comebacks .

when he pulled away , she smiled at him .

`` keep kissing me like that , and i might decide to wait even longer for a baby .

you 'll make me want you , your lips , and your dick all to myself for as long as possible . ''

`` and here i thought my kisses might get you in the mood for baby-making , '' pesh mused .

megan laughed .

`` either way , it 's a win-win situation .

so bring it on , nadeen .

bring .

it .

on . ''

chapter twenty-two although her stomach screamed in protest to drop her fork , megan could n't resist popping in the last bite of delicious crepe into her mouth .

as she chewed , she closed her eyes at the delicious combination of chocolate and strawberries danced along her taste buds .

`` good ? ''

a voice asked from across the table .

her eyelids popped open to take in pesh , her new husband of three days .
