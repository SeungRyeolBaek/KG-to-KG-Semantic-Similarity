pesh squeezed megan 's knee under the table .

she cut her eyes over to him and smiled .

once the plates had been passed around and everyone served , they began to eat .

`` mmm , the samosa is delicious , '' megan complimented .

`` thank you , '' lavani replied , with a beaming smile .

as his mother turned her attention to shveta , pesh bowed his head and spoke in a low voice to megan .

`` once i tried bribing beau with some samosa . ''

she laughed .

`` you did ?

why ? ''

`` i was at aidan 's house checking on emma when she was on bed rest .

i guess you could say he did n't like me invading his turf . ''

`` would he not take it from you ? ''

`` oh , he took it , ate it , and seemed to enjoy it .

but i did n't make any friends that night . ''

megan grinned .

`` good old beau . ''

pesh raised his brows .

`` you 're siding with the dog ? ''

`` in that scenario , yes .

he was merely protecting emma and noah . ''

`` i see . ''

tilting her head at him , she added , `` besides , i do n't like any scenario where you and emma are anything more than friends . ''

`` i was there in a medical capacity , '' he argued .

she wagged her finger at him .

`` you brought dinner with you .

that fact alone shows you were there for more than just practicing medicine . ''

when he quickly pushed her finger down , she gave him a look that was a cross between puzzled and infuriated .

`` are you trying to silence me ? ''

`` no , i 'm just helping you save face .

we do n't point-it 's considered rude . ''

megan 's eyes widened .

`` i 've done something else wrong now ? ''

`` you 're fine . ''

she shook her head .

`` next time , you better plan on giving me a crash course in indian culture before you even think about bringing me around your family . ''

across the table from them , shveta cleared her throat .

when pesh and megan glanced at her , she smiled .

`` you 're doing fine , megan .

please do n't worry about following all the rules of our culture .

we certainly do n't expect you to . ''

megan returned shveta 's smile .

`` thank you .

i would never dream of doing anything to offend you . ''

`` of course you would n't , '' charlie replied .

pesh did n't dare sneak a peek at his mother .

after all , she was the one who upheld the traditions and customs of their heritage while his father had tried to americanize himself as much as possible , right down to changing his name .

charlie dabbed the corners of his mouth with his napkin .

`` i understand you have a son , megan . ''

she smiled .

`` yes , mason is almost two .

he 's my entire world . ''

`` you should have brought him with you this evening .

we would have loved to meet him , '' shveta said .

`` maybe next time .

of course , after you see how much energy he has , you might change your mind . ''

as the table laughed , she glanced over at pesh .

`` mason truly adores pesh , and pesh is so good with him .

his patience is infinite . ''

pesh smiled .

`` he 's a good boy .

i enjoy spending time with him . ''

`` so it 's serious between you two ? ''

lavani asked .

`` uh , well- '' megan began before she was interrupted by the doorbell .

sanjay rose out of his chair .

`` that must be dev . ''

`` how surprising that he 's so late ? ''

shveta mused with a smile .

pesh almost laughed at the horrified expression on megan 's face at the mention of dev .

`` you did n't tell me he was going to be here ! ''

she hissed .

`` i was n't sure if he was coming or not .

but do n't worry .

things are fine between us now . ''

megan gave him a skeptical look as dev walked into the dining room .

`` hey everybody , '' he said , throwing up a hand .

at the sight of megan sitting next to pesh , dev 's eyes widened .

`` well , well , if it is n't miss right hook , '' he mused with a smirk .

`` it 's miss left hook , actually , '' she corrected .

dev grinned .

`` good to know . ''

`` you 've met megan , dev ? ''

lavani asked curiously .

`` we had the pleasure of meeting each other one day when i went by the hospital to see alpesh . ''

at megan 's sharp intake of breath , dev winked at her .

he then eased down across from them and began piling food on his plate .

`` so you guys work together and now you 're dating , huh ? ''

`` yes , '' pesh replied .

after taking a bite of his samosa , dev motioned at them while he chewed .

`` alpesh is sort of your boss , right ? ''

pesh could feel megan 's anger rising .

`` no , actually he is n't .

i have a preceptor , or head nurse , who is my boss .
