but pesh took his hand .

`` we 'll come back another time . ''

his reply seemed to pacify mason , and he happily slung his and pesh 's arm back and forth as they walked to the car .

when they got buckled up , megan turned back to mason .

`` what do you say to pesh for bringing you ? ''

`` tank you , esh , '' mason said .

his words sent a broad grin stretching across pesh 's face .

`` you 're welcome , buddy .

i had a good time . ''

when he glanced over at megan , she gave him a genuine smile .

`` i had a good time , too . ''

taking one of his hands off the steering wheel , he reached over to take her hand in his .

while the gesture was a little too lovey-dovey for her liking , she did n't argue with him .

instead , she just enjoyed his touch .

once they had deposited a sleepy mason back home at megan 's , they abandoned her suv and gotten into pesh 's jaguar .

`` so where exactly are we going ? ''

megan asked , as she buckled her seat belt .

`` it 's a surprise . ''

`` seriously ?

you 're still playing coy about it ? ''

`` for just a little while longer . ''

she shifted in her seat where she could look at him better .

`` can i try to guess ? ''

`` i suppose .

i 'm not sure i 'd tell you even if you guess , '' he teased .

`` are we going to atlanta ? ''

he cut his gaze from the road over to her .

`` have patience . ''

crossing her arms over her chest , she huffed , `` i do n't have patience for games . ''

`` okay , i 'll give you a little hint .

actually , it 's more of a question than it is a hint . ''

`` yeah ? ''

`` do you have a fear of heights ? ''

she snorted .

`` no , i do n't .

why ? ''

he gave her a sly grin .

`` i told you .

it 's a hint . ''

`` i went skydiving when i turned twenty-one , so i 'm totally fine with heights .

of course , i seriously doubt we 're going sky diving in these clothes . ''

`` no , we 're not . ''

she wrinkled her nose .

`` please tell me it 's not box seats at the opera or something like that . ''

his face fell .

`` you do n't like the opera ? ''

`` never been and never want to . ''

pesh appeared almost personally insulted .

`` i 'm going to have to change your mind on that one . ''

`` why am i not surprised you like opera ? ''

`` do n't knock it until you 've tried it . ''

`` a bunch of screeching men and women singing in a language i do n't understand ?

not my idea of a good time . ''

`` but there is such love and passion in their delivery , '' he argued .

`` um , i 'm just going to have to agree to disagree with you . ''

`` for now at least , '' he said , with a wink .

when the car started slowing down , megan peered out the windshield before turning to pesh .

`` we 're at mccollum ? ''

`` yes . ''

`` you 're taking me flying ? ''

he smiled .

`` yes , i am . ''

even though she had known he had a plane from how he 'd helped get aidan to noah 's delivery , she could n't believe their date included something as unique as flying .

`` so let me get this straight .

i 'm dressed like this , '' she did a little hand motion over her dress , `` to go flying ? ''

an amused look twinkled in his dark eyes .

`` you have absolutely no patience , do you ? ''

`` no , i do n't . ''

as he put the car in park outside the hanger , he turned to her .

`` by your lack of being able to withhold gratification , i 'm assuming you 've never partaken in any tantric sex ? ''

she could n't stop her mouth from dropping to her chest .

`` w-what ? ''

she stammered .

turning in his seat , he pinned her with a hard stare .

`` have i managed to shock you again ? ''

unable to speak , she merely bobbed her head .

pesh only chuckled at her response .

`` come on .

let 's get going . ''

still in shock , she remained rooted to her seat .

when he came around to open her door , she peered up at him .

`` tantric sex ?

like sting , trudie styler , and tantric sex ? ''

`` yes , i suppose so , '' he replied , as he offered her his hand .

ordinarily , she would n't have taken it , but at the declaration that pesh was actually into something outside the sexual norms , she was too floored to argue with him .

`` i did n't think you 'd like anything ... kinky . ''

pesh 's dark eyes widened .

`` tantric is n't kinky .

it 's about connecting with your lover on a more intimate level .

it 's about breathing them in and truly being one . ''

`` so it 's not about marathon sex that lasts for days ? ''
