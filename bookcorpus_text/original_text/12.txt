when pesh took her hand in his , she jerked her head up in surprise .

in a soft voice that vibrated with empathy , he asked , `` he hurt you very much , did n't he ? ''

as she shifted in her chair , she tried downplaying the moment by wagging her free finger at pesh .

`` now you 're really turning the heated questions on me , are n't you ? ''

he quickly released her hand .

`` i apologize . ''

she sighed .

`` no , it 's okay . ''

she raked her fingers through her hair as she tried processing if she was really going to be honest with pesh .

gazing into his eyes , she did n't detect any judgment or prying-there was only compassion .

`` yes , he hurt me .

he continues to hurt me each time i look at mason and realize what he 's being denied . ''

she jerked her chin over to where aidan cradled a sleeping noah in his arms .

as the others talked and laughed around him , aidan stared down at his son with such love in his eyes and adoration on his face that it cut a jagged hole in megan 's chest .

her chin trembled as she replied , `` i want that for my son . ''

pesh 's dark eyes pooled with empathy as he once again took her hand in his .

`` it is n't the same pain , but i do know how you feel .

i experience it every time i see a husband and wife sharing a loving moment .

it drives home what i do not have ... what i have lost . ''

megan wiped her eyes with the back of her hand .

`` emma told me about your wife .

i 'm very sorry . ''

`` thank you , '' he murmured .

nibbling her bottom lip , megan then hesitantly asked , `` what was she like ? ''

by his raised eyebrows , pesh seemed surprised by her question .

megan hoped she had n't stepped over a boundary in asking .

he leaned back in his chair and drew in an agonized breath .

`` she was my world-the sun , the moon , and the stars . ''

he met her intense gaze , checking to see if she really wanted him to continue .

after she gave a brief nod , he began to talk .

he told her how they had met and all the little attributes that jade possessed that made her special .

as megan listened to him speak with such reverence and love about his late wife , she could n't help feeling just a little bit jealous .

she 'd never had a man possess such intense feelings for her .

she could n't imagine ever being loved so completely by a man that not even death could lessen his feelings .

`` what you had with jade , what you still feel for her , it 's really beautiful , '' she murmured when he finished .

pesh jerked a hand through his thick hair .

`` it 's interesting to hear you say that .

i think most women are turned off by what they perceive is a man who ca n't let go of his dead wife . ''

megan shook her head .

`` i do n't think so .

who would n't be turned on by a man who feels so deeply that he did n't stop loving his wife just because she died ? ''

pesh 's eyes widened at her statement , and he sucked in a harsh breath .

`` most women do n't want to share your heart , '' he challenged softly .

`` then they 're obviously insecure .

all of us have the ability to love people in infinite capacities .

i love my son with all my heart and soul , but there will still be room for a man ... someday . ''

he stared at her for a moment , unblinking and unmoving .

`` i have to say that i find your reasoning absolutely fascinating . ''

`` you do ? ''

`` yes . ''

the intensity of his gaze caused her to laugh nervously .

`` i do n't think a man has ever called me fascinating . ''

`` that 's a pity . ''

before she could try changing the subject , aidan came by their table with noah in his arms .

`` after i put him down , i 'm going to make some drinks .

emma wants one of her margaritas .

you game ? ''

he asked megan .

she nodded .

a drink would certainly help cool her off after the conversation she 'd been having with pesh .

`` sure .

i do n't think i 've had one in forever . ''

`` neither has she .

i may be peeling her off the ceiling tonight , '' he teased .

megan laughed .

`` you have seriously got to stop with the innuendo .

you are my uncle , and it is mortifying and disgusting to have to think of you in that capacity . ''

`` i am so terribly sorry for scaring your sensitive mind . ''

grinning , aidan turned to pesh .

`` beer okay with you , or would you like something fruity , too ? ''

`` i 'm fine with a beer , '' pesh replied .

aidan bobbed his head .

`` be right back . ''

after aidan headed in the house , pesh caught her staring at him .

`` what ? ''

he asked .

`` just surprised you wanted a beer , that 's all . ''

`` and why is that ? ''
