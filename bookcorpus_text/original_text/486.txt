`` zayn , give me some space .

you 're a bit ... overwhelming . ''

he chuckled at her description .

`` see ?

even you ca n't deny that we are good together . ''

she shook her head .

`` knowing that and not wanting to trust you are two completely different issues . ''

he let her go , knowing that she had a point .

`` well , we 've made progress anyway . ''

she blinked up at him , wondering what she could have revealed .

what progress ?

`` what do you mean ? ''

`` you at least acknowledge that you want me . ''

`` i did n't ! ''

she gasped .

`` you did , '' he laughed softly at her outrage .

`` you just said that you know that we 're good together .

no , '' he raised a hand to stop her arguments .

`` if you try to deny it again , i 'll just have to prove you wrong again . ''

he looked down at her beautiful features , astonished that she was lovely even without makeup .

she looked fresh and alive , more alluring somehow .

`` i know i 'll enjoy the process . ''

she twisted out of his arms , accepting that the only reason she was free of his touch was because he allowed it .

`` zayn , let 's get some ground rules set up here .

i do n't really understand what 's going on , but i do understand that you 're not trustworthy .

i trusted you once and you disappeared .

i was thrilled that you were okay , amazed even , six years ago .

and you just left after you got what you wanted . ''

`` we both got what we wanted . ''

she blushed at the memory of how voracious she had been in his arms that night .

`` i 'll concede that point .

but that does n't mean i 'm going to jump into bed with you .

you have your heir .

if you need ... female companionship ... '' she said the words uncomfortably , aware of the pain ripping through her at the idea of another woman in his arms , `` then go find it . ''

zayn controlled his temper , wondering how she could say something like that .

he could tell by the hurt look in her eyes that she did n't mean it .

but he acknowledged that he had a great deal of hurt to heal .

she 'd trusted him six years ago and he 'd unintentionally betrayed that trust .

even before that , he 'd disappeared sixteen years ago and had n't explained even when he saw her again .

yes , there was a great deal of trust that needed to be fixed .

he did n't move closer to her , but he stepped in front of her , his hands on his hips as he tried to control his temper .

he never had problems with anger but ella ignited emotions in him he had n't known he possessed .

`` ella , you 're my wife now .

and you will learn to trust me again .

i 'll make sure of it . ''

he saw his assistant out of the corner of his eye and nodded slightly , running a hand through his hair with the increasing frustration over his responsibilities .

he did n't want to face them now .

he was actually torn between the options of tossing this woman over his shoulder and making love to her and the equally appealing idea of getting to know his son .

unfortunately , neither was a possibility at this point .

`` we have to get going , '' he said curtly .

`` and you need to get dressed . ''

ella looked down at her jeans and tee-shirt , confused .

`` i am dressed .

what 's wrong with my clothes ? ''

he sighed , wishing he did n't have to do this but it had to be said .

`` i know this is going to be frustrating to you , but just about every reporter in the world is going to try and take your picture as soon as we step outside of this hotel .

possibly even outside the suite .

we need to release a photo of you to the press , but they 'll want to see you before that can be arranged . ''

he braced himself for the next words , not wanting to hurt her or anger her , but she needed to hear the truth .

`` and you ca n't be seen in jeans .

ever . ''

she shrunk back slightly , not completely sure what he was saying .

`` why ca n't i wear jeans ? ''

`` you can wear them , you just ca n't wear them outside of our private suite . ''

she swallowed , shaking her head .

`` zayn , i love wearing jeans . ''

he smiled slightly .

`` and i love seeing you in them . ''

he almost laughed at her blush and her hands immediately went to her bottom .

she knew exactly what he was looking at in her jeans .

`` but you represent me and tusain now .

you represent all of the people of tusain and they are good , decent people who work hard and take pride in their efforts .

you ca n't shame them by wearing jeans . ''

he could tell that her stubbornness was almost choking her .

`` i 've had one of my assistants get you some new clothes .

they are already in the bedroom we shared last night . ''

she glared at him .
