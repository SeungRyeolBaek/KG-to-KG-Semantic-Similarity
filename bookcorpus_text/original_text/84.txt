when mason nodded , pesh gently sat him back down on the floor .

after he raced out of the dining room , pesh finally glanced at the others .

`` excuse me , '' he said , before rising out of his chair .

he made his way down the hallway .

he did n't have to look hard for megan-she was in the one bedroom with the door closed .

he rapped lightly on the wood .

when she did n't answer , he went ahead and opened the door .

he found her sitting on the edge of the bed with her head in her hands .

he went over and sat down next to her .

tentatively , he put his hand on her back .

`` i 'm sorry for not setting mason straight and telling him i was n't his daddy .

he looked so happy , and i did n't want to hurt him . ''

with her elbows braced on her knees , megan turned her head to look at him .

tears streamed down her cheeks .

`` you think i 'm angry at you ? ''

he nodded his head .

she hiccupped a cry .

`` oh pesh , you 're so naive sometimes ! ''

he jerked back at her words .

`` excuse me ? ''

`` just when i think i ca n't love you more , you go and do something like that . ''

before he could process her words , she threw herself at him , kissing his cheeks and mouth .

she straddled his lap and brought her hands around his neck .

`` you really love mason , do n't you ? ''

`` of course i do . ''

`` you could see yourself really being a father to him ? ''

`` yes , i could .

but what- '' she silenced him with a kiss .

it was one that was laced with desperate emotions .

he wrapped his hands around her waist and drew her closer to him .

just as he was about to deepen the kiss , she pulled away .

`` you love me too , do n't you ? ''

`` you should have no doubts on that one . ''

`` you love me enough to be a husband to me ? ''

her question caused him to suck in a harsh breath .

he felt like he had been kicked in the gut .

`` yes , i could-i always have . ''

she tilted her head at him and smiled .

`` then marry me . ''

`` excuse me ? ''

bringing her lips to his , she murmured against his mouth , `` marry me .

make me your wife . ''

at that moment , he thanked god he was sitting down because if he had n't been , he was pretty sure he would 've done something totally emasculating like fainting .

he also questioned both his hearing and his sanity .

had megan just proposed to him ?

surely , he was hallucinating .

`` did you just ask me to marry you ? ''

he questioned lamely .

giggling , megan nodded her head .

`` i wish you could see your face right now .

i should be insulted . ''

`` i 'm sorry .

it 's just you surprised me . ''

she cupped his face in her hands .

`` i 'm sorry i do n't have a ring , and i did n't get down on one knee , '' she lovingly teased .

he brought his hands up to touch hers .

`` you 're really serious ? ''

`` yes , i am . ''

bowing his head , he tenderly kissed the tops of her hands .

`` i love you so much , megan , and i want nothing more than to make you my wife . ''

`` so is that a yes ? ''

`` i just want to make sure you know what you 're saying .

one minute you 're in the dining room , laughing with your family , and then the next you 're in here weeping and then proposing to me .

and let 's not forget how adamant you have been the entire time i 've known you about being too young to get married . ''

megan 's lips turned down in a pout .

`` ca n't a girl change her mind ? ''

`` yes , of course , but i just want to make sure this is really what you want . ''

tears sparkled in her blue eyes .

`` you are everything i could ever want in a man .

you love me , you watch out for me , you want the best for me .

while that would be enough to make me want to marry you , you love my son .

you watch out for him and you want the best for him .

i could n't ever imagine loving someone more than i do you .

i ca n't imagine wanting to be anyone else 's wife but you . ''

she sniffled .

`` i was so stupid for so long .

i could n't believe that someone like me could truly deserve someone like you .

but you never gave up on me .

if you give me the chance , i 'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy . ''

pesh could n't stop the racing of his heart .

he was sure both his heart rate and blood pressure were off the charts at this moment .

he cupped her cheeks .

`` nothing in the world would make me happier than for us to get married . ''

`` so we 're engaged ? ''

`` yes , we are . ''
