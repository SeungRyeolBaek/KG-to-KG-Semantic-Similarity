`` i 'm sorry i ran ... i thought ... i mean , from the back , i thought you and he were ... '' `` oh ! ''

she exclaims .

`` well , i suppose i 'm flattered ... i mean , i do put my time in at the gym . ''

she steps forward and takes my hands .

`` i 'm so glad to see you brynn .

if you had n't gotten involved , i would n't be here with nate today . ''

i try to blink back tears , but they roll down my cheeks anyway .

`` i 'm so sorry for everything you 've been through-nate told me- '' `` mom ? ''

nate says , stepping forward .

`` mind if i talk to brynn alone for a minute ? ''

`` of course ! ''

she calls over her shoulder , then turns to me .

`` it 's so nice to hear him call me 'mom , ' '' she says , then leans forward and whispers in my ear , `` do n't give up hope . ''

i blink at her in surprise as she pulls away and walks back toward nate .

they share a smile and a few murmured words before she continues back toward the crew house and nate approaches me .

`` hi , '' he murmurs as he walks up to me .

`` hello , '' i reply , a bit more stiffly .

`` i found her number where you left it , '' he explains .

`` we met several times while i was still up in maryland , but it hardly seemed like enough time , so she drove me back down here and is staying for a few days . ''

he takes a deep breath .

`` when you told me you loved me- '' i raise my hand to stop him .

`` you do n't have to explain .

you told me from the beginning that you did n't do relationships ... that you did n't lead girls on .

so i should have known .

i should n't have expected- '' `` brynn , please .

just give me two minutes , ok ? ''

i nod , shifting from foot to foot as i wish i could just run away , all the way back to my room and pull the covers over my head .

anything so that i do n't have to hear all the reasons why he does n't love me .

`` when you told me you loved me , '' he resumes , `` i felt empty . ''

tears spring to my eyes-oof , that was worse than i thought .

`` no , not like that ! ''

he says , seeing my reaction .

`` i mean , i felt ... inadequate .

like i had nothing inside me to give back to you .

here you were , so strong , and smart , and intelligent , and i felt like such a failure . ''

i 'm shocked to hear his voice break .

he clears his throat before he continues .

`` i had failed you .

i felt ...

i mean , everything my dad had ever told me was a lie ! ''

he exclaims , his voice rising .

`` in that moment , i do n't think i knew if i was capable of love .

what my father had shown me for years was n't love , i do n't think , it was control .

i felt so undeserving to be loved by you , and for me to even tell you that i loved you , it would n't mean anything , because it would be from someone who was empty . ''

`` you 're not empty , '' i murmur , unable to hear him talk about himself like this even though he broke my heart .

`` i 'm starting to realize that .

it 's been good , seeing my mom , talking to her , hearing the truth about my past .

all the things that you were trying to help me with .

you were right all along . ''

`` i was n't trying to be right . ''

`` i know , that 's not-sorry , this is coming out all wrong .

i 've been thinking about you every day , imagining us meeting up back on campus , and it 's just happened a lot quicker than i thought it would .

i wanted to call you every day , but i needed to make sure i was ready .

that i had done some work on myself before i tried to reach out to you .

i know the kind of relationship i want to have with you , and i want to make sure i 'm ready for it . ''

i blink at him , feeling confused .

`` so , what are you saying ? ''

`` i 'm saying that you 're not my stepsister anymore , first of all , '' he says with a small grin .

`` they filed today . ''

`` you talked to your dad ? ''

`` just once .

i couch-surfed with friends after you left .

i did n't want to stay in the same house with him . ''

i stare at him as a realization begins to trickle through my brain .

`` it was you , was n't it ?

you got him to give my mom a settlement . ''

he runs a hand through his hair .

`` well , after talking with my mom , and hearing what happened to her in their divorce , i was worried he would n't be fair in dealing with your mom either .

so , i , um , told him that if he ever wanted to see me again , he 'd have to give your mom some money in the divorce .
