kristi winked .

`` yeah , just keep telling yourself that , honey . ''

chapter eight as pesh exited one of the exam rooms , he saw megan sitting on a stool at the counter , working on a chart .

when the door shut behind him , she jerked her head up and caught him staring .

he cleared his throat and walked over to her .

`` hello , '' he said , pleasantly .

`` hi . ''

`` so , are you settling in ? ''

she nodded .

`` everyone has been so nice and helpful . ''

`` good .

i 'm glad to hear that .

we usually have very good success rates with our clinical candidates . ''

megan smiled before her head dipped back down to work on the chart .

nervously , he scratched the back of his neck .

things were rolling along with them now that he knew he should n't try to rock the boat .

after all , he had promised her he would keep his distance .

but he could n't help himself .

in the two months since their first encounter , he had n't stopped thinking about her .

now that she had shown back up in his life so out of the blue , he could n't help feeling that it was fated .

ask her to dinner , his mind shouted .

he bit down on his lip to keep the question he was burning to ask from escaping his mouth .

finally , it rushed forth before he could stop himself .

`` why do n't you let me buy you dinner after work ? ''

megan 's scribbling pen stilled on the chart .

she glanced up and cocked her head at him .

`` dinner implies a date , and i thought we were clear on that . ''

he gave her a nervous smile .

`` well , i was only offering some less palatable cafeteria food .

i hardly think that constitutes a date . ''

`` in my realm of dating consciousness , any time you sit down at a table while eating and drinking together , it is a date . ''

crossing his arms over his chest , he countered , `` if that were true , it would mean you were dating your father and brother every time you sat down together .

i know your family is close , but i do n't believe they 're that close . ''

megan 's brows rose .

`` oh , is the good doctor cracking jokes now ? ''

`` perhaps . ''

the corners of megan 's lips turned up .

`` then what exactly would you consider a date ? ''

pesh leaned back against the wall , surmising her teasing smile .

`` a mutually agreed upon event . ''

`` you 're so proper , '' megan teased .

he rolled his eyes at her , something he rarely did until he began spending more and more time in her presence .

`` and you 're avoiding the initial question . ''

megan put down the pen and chart and crossed her arms over her chest .

`` so , if you could take me on a date , where would we go ? ''

pesh rubbed his jaw in thought .

`` well , if would have to be something you would want to do , but i would begin with dinner . ''

when she started to protest , he held up his hand .

`` somewhere that was romantic with candlelight and soft music-perhaps a place where we could dance in between courses . ''

staring at him in surprise , megan replied , `` you 're serious ? ''

`` of course . ''

she slowly shook her head back and forth .

`` okay , go on . ''

`` once we finished wine and dessert , i would then want to take you somewhere you 've never been- '' `` like your bedroom ? ''

megan interjected with a smirk .

`` i do believe you 've already been there before . ''

the teasing faded from megan 's expression , and a flush entered her cheeks .

`` may i continue ? ''

`` yeah , '' she murmured .

`` i would want to be with you to experience something you never have before-an art gallery , an opera , a musical .

anything that would bring wonderment and excitement to your face . ''

he gave her a small smile .

`` and it would mean all the more that i was getting to share it with you . ''

he watched with almost mild amusement as she processed his words .

most likely she had never had a man speak to her the way he was , and it was certainly affecting her .

feeling like it was time to go in for the kill , he asked once again , `` so , will you have dinner with me ? ''

pesh leaned forward expectantly as megan opened her mouth .

they were interrupted by the sound of emma 's voice .

`` oh thank god .

i 'm so glad you two are on . ''

her anxious tone was the only thing that could have torn pesh 's attention away from megan .

he glanced from emma to aidan , who was grimacing and rubbing his head .

`` what happened ? ''

emma replied , `` he fell and hit his head , '' at the same time aidan grunted , `` nothing . ''

megan stepped forward and went over to aidan .

she gasped as she surveyed him .

`` ankle , your pupils are huge ! ''

pesh took his penlight out of his coat pocket and went to aidan .
