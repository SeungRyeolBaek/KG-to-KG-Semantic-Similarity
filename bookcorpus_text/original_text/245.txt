the sudden proximity of him sets me to trembling .

i ca n't be strong enough for both of us .

i need his help .

`` please , emerson , '' i say , blinking away the tears that blur my vision .

`` could you just ... hold me ?

just for a second . ''

he stares at me , his blue eyes frozen over .

but as the first tear rolls down my cheek , i watch the ice crack .

the fight goes out of him , making way for the despair he 's been trying to cover up with aggression .

`` come here , '' he murmurs , opening his arms to me .

i rush to him , throwing myself into his embrace .

he enfolds me in a fierce hug as the tears come hard and fast .

he kisses the top of my head , pulling me tightly against him .

`` you ca n't disappear on me like that , '' i cry , burying my face in the front of his suit .

`` i ca n't get through this without you , emerson . ''

`` i know .

i 'm sorry , '' he says , his voice rasping .

`` this is just ... it 's so hard , abby .

what am i supposed to do without you in my life ?

the way i want you to be , i mean ... ? ''

`` i 'll let you know when i figure it out , '' i say miserably .

we hold each other , each unwilling to be the first to break the embrace .

as the sky begins to lighten , we finally trudge upstairs , entirely spent .

i walk ahead of emerson , my body tired and aching .

the prospect of sleeping alone tonight is too much to bear .

it 's hard to believe that it was just last night that i fell asleep next to emerson , my cheek resting against his bare chest .

it feels like years ago that our bodies met , collided , moved as one .

it was , without question , the best night of my life .

and would you look at that ?

it 's being followed up by the worst .

emerson and i reach the top of the stairs and pause , each glancing at our bedrooms at opposite ends of the hall .

turning away from each other now seems like the final step , the last nail in the coffin sealing up our barely-formed relationship .

after the wrenching , brutal escapade that was our parents ' wedding ceremony this afternoon , i do n't know if i can take it .

`` you know , '' i say softly .

`` today was sort of like a nightmare . ''

`` that 's for fucking sure , '' he murmurs , glancing my way .

`` and after a nightmare ... is n't is usually ok for a little sister to crawl into her big brother 's bed ? ''

i ask tearfully .

a slow , sad smile spreads across his gorgeous face .

`` nice justification , weirdo , '' he teases softly , offering me his hand .

i lace my fingers through his .

silently , we walk down the hallway toward his room .

we do n't even have the energy to change out of our clothes .

with vodka-clouded heads and heavy hearts , we collapse onto his bed .

emerson wraps his arms around me , pulling me close .

there 's no question of things going any further between us now , but this simple comforting embrace is a balm for my battered soul .

in an instant we 've fallen into a deep , mercifully dreamless sleep .

i 'm jerked out of slumber the next morning by the sound of screaming voices .

prying open my eyes , i notice two things straightaway .

first , i am massively hungover , having eaten next to nothing yesterday and had half a bottle of vodka to drink .

second , i 'm still lying beside the sleeping emerson , despite the fact that it 's monday morning and school is set to start in a mere twenty minutes .

but before i can worry about my attendance record , the crash of shattering glass catches my ear from downstairs .

two hysterical voices rage at each other as other objects go hurtling around the ground floor .

emerson 's eyes fly open at the sound of the unfolding chaos , and we turn to look at each other , at a loss .

i recognize dad and deb 's voices at once , but i 've never heard either of them so irate .

`` funneling my money to that lowlife junkie ! ''

my dad bellows , as something heavy topples over .

`` your money ? ''

deb cries shrilly , `` you mean your parents ' money , do n't you ? ''

`` do n't start with that class warfare bullshit- '' `` i do n't have to !

they already did .

you think i did n't see how they looked at me yesterday ?

you 'd think i was wearing a g-string and pasties- '' `` well , you were n't wearing much else ! ''

something else smashes into a thousand pieces , and i grab for emerson 's hand , panicked .

`` do n't try and change the goddamn subject , '' my dad snarls .

`` you 've been stealing from me for your scumbag ex and your loser drug baby ! ''

emerson 's fingers tighten around mine , his body rippling with fury .

`` my son is not a loser ! ''

deb weeps , charging up the stairs , `` and he 's not staying here in this house for another second ! ''
