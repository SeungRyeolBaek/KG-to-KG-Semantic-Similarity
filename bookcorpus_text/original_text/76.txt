`` okay , i think i can do that . ''

tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously .

`` why did you think i would need to be feeling my best for that ? ''

`` it wo n't just be my sister and her husband .

all of my family will be there , including my parents . ''

megan 's eyes widened .

`` you want to introduce me to your parents ? ''

`` yes , i would . ''

she nibbled on her bottom lip as she was prone to do when she was nervous .

`` but that would mean we 're pretty serious , right ? ''

`` yes , '' he replied , with utter certainty .

scooting to the edge of the bed , she gripped her gaping robe as best she could .

she stared up at him .

`` you 're not the least bit worried what they 're going to say about you dating me ? ''

`` no , i 'm not . ''

the corners of her lips tugged up in a smile .

`` then i 'll go , '' she said softly .

`` really ? ''

when she bobbed her head , he rushed forward to wrap her in his arms .

`` thank you , my love .

you 've made me very happy . ''

`` you make me happy every day .

it 's the least i can do . ''

with her head buried in pesh 's chest , she was finally able to let the smile she had plastered on fade into a frown .

while she should have been elated that pesh wanted to introduce her to his family , she could n't help feeling overwhelmed .

what if they hated her ?

what if their dislike caused pesh to not want to see her anymore ?

she did n't want to think about what it would be like not having him in her life .

at the same time , it was hard processing all the emotions that pesh 's devotion made her feel .

davis had never wanted to introduce her to his parents .

she met them by accident after one of his games .

now she had a man who wanted nothing more than to share all aspects of his life with her .

it was hard to process .

in the end , she could only hope that everything went well .

chapter nineteen the following day at work when pesh found a lull in patients , he stepped into the nurses ' station .

while he said hello to some of the other men and women of the nursing staff , he had a singular focus of getting to megan .

when he joined her at the counter where she was doing paperwork , she jumped like he had tasered her .

`` go away , '' megan hissed .

he chuckled .

`` you know , i think i can be seen back here in the nurses ' station without arising any suspicion .

after all , i could be discussing a patient with you . ''

`` then you better start talking in patient codes very soon . ''

`` i wanted to know if it would be all right to pick you up at seven on friday evening ? ''

when megan jerked her gaze off the chart she was working on , her blue eyes bulged in horror at him .

in a low voice , she said , `` i can not believe you are talking about a date here at work .

do you care anything about my reputation ? ''

he held his hands up defensively .

`` i 'm sorry .

i do n't know what i was thinking besides the fact that i missed you and wanted to talk to you . ''

megan 's expression softened .

`` i 'm sorry , but we ca n't be that way here . ''

pesh opened his mouth to protest when a voice behind them cut him off .

`` do n't you two look cozy , '' kara mused .

pesh whirled around to find kara staring at them with venom burning in her eyes .

`` excuse me , but i need to get another chart off the carousel , '' megan said , with her head tucked to her chest .

she turned to go , but kara reached out and grabbed her arm .

`` if you do n't mind , exam room three needs a clean-up . ''

`` kristi is the only one authorized to give me orders around here , '' megan replied .

kara pursed her ruby red lips .

`` insubordination and sleeping with a doctor-you really have a career death wish , do n't you ? ''

megan started to protest , but pesh stopped her .

glaring at kara , he said , `` i want to talk to you .

alone . ''

after shooting megan a triumphant look , kara let pesh lead her out of the nurses ' station and down the hall .

`` what in the hell do you think you 're doing ? ''

he demanded .

`` saving you from making a huge mistake .

you do n't need a girl like that-you need a woman to take care of you . ''

when her hands started to snake up around his neck , pesh grabbed them .

`` do n't touch me ! ''

he snarled .

a sultry smile spread across her face .

`` you liked when i touched you before . ''

`` that was one time-a drunken mistake that i regret daily , and i never intend on making again . ''

she narrowed her eyes at him .

`` so you 're throwing me aside for a young bimbo ? ''
