it 's just-be good to her .

be better to her than i ever was . ''

`` i intend to be , '' emerson says , training his eyes on my dad .

`` whatever she decides that means to her . ''

my dad smiles , faintly but resolutely , gives me a final wave , and sees himself out .

emerson and i stare after him as the door closes quietly in his wake .

for a moment , the only movement in the room comes from roxie 's exuberant tail-wagging .

when emerson finally swings his gaze my way , his eyes are full of cautious hope .

`` so ... '' he begins , `` did your dad have any good advice ? ''

`` you know what ? ''

i laugh softly , `` he really did . ''

`` did that advice involve getting as far away from me as humanly possible ? ''

emerson asks , taking a step forward .

`` not at all , '' i tell him , countering his step , `` in fact , it was just the opposite . ''

`` huh , '' emerson replies , as we slowly move toward each other in a dance of barely-contained desire .

`` does that mean ... you 've come to some kind of decision ?

about what you want to do happen next ? ''

`` it means that i 'm ready to ask for what i 've wanted for the last ten years , '' i reply , as we meet in the center of the loft .

i take his hands , take a breath , and take that final leap .

`` i want to be with you , emerson .

now and always .

i know that what we have is unconventional , and that it 's not going to be an easy journey .

but there 's no one else i 'd rather be on my journey with .

so if you 'll still have me , i 'd like to stay here .

with you . ''

`` if i 'll still have you ? ''

emerson breathes , taking me into his arms , `` i 'd give up everything to still have you in my life .

not that i 'm suggesting that as a game plan , but ... '' `` we 're really going to do this ? ''

i ask , wrapping my arms around his shoulders .

`` we are , '' he replies , circling my waist , `` no one can stop us , abby .

not like before .

there 's no one we need to apologize to , nothing we have to explain .

we 're free . ''

i press myself to him , bringing my lips to his .

our kiss is searing , binding , full of promise and hope .

roxie runs circles around us as our mouths move together , making up for lost time .

i grin as i kiss him , happy tears running down my cheeks .

as we finally break apart , emerson brushes a lock of hair behind my ear , gazing at me with great purpose .

`` there 's just one last thing we have to figure out , then , '' he says , his voice rasping with emotion as he takes my right hand in his .

`` what 's that ? ''

i ask , wiping the tears away .

he looks down at my hand , rubbing his thumb over the single pearl glimmering on my finger .

i feel my breath catch in my throat as i guess his meaning .

`` would you rather be wearing this ... on the other hand ? ''

he asks , his blue eyes gleaming as they drink me in .

`` are you ... do you mean ... ? ''

i stammer , all my composure going right out the window .

emerson 's face breaks into a gorgeous grin as he slowly lowers himself onto one knee before me .

i laugh with confounded elation as he slips the pearl ring off my right hand .

`` what do you say ? ''

he asks , holding the ring up to me .

`` i say ... let 's jump , '' i breathe , staring down at him .

his smile grows impossibly wide as he slides the band onto my left ring finger .

turns out that i chose my engagement ring when i was just seventeen years old .

and you know what ?

i chose the person i wanted to share my life with when i was seventeen , too .

it just took us both a while to realize it .

emerson stands and scoops me up into his arms as we both burst into ecstatic laughter .

this has to be the least conventional relationship anyone 's ever heard of , but it 's ours .

no one can take us away from each other , no one else gets the final say .

but there is one last thing i have to ask him , now .

`` are you going to take me to bed now or what ? ''

i grin , running my hands along his impeccably cut chest .

he slips an arm under my knees , and carries me toward the bedroom like a bride on her wedding night .

we 're getting a bit ahead of ourselves , maybe .

but we 've always done things out of order , emerson and i .

only now are we catching up to where we left off at eighteen .

but if there 's one thing i 'm sure of now , after all these years , is that what we have has always-always-been worth the wait .

epilogue one year later ...
