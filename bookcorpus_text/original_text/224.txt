make it a good one , too . ''

`` all right , '' he says , his voice hoarse and low , `` i have n't stopped thinking about you for two weeks straight .

since the night of the party .

i got to see a side of you that night i 'd never seen before .

in the closet , during that stupid game ... you were so direct .

so ready .

and so fucking sexy .

if the cops had n't shown up , i do n't know what would have happened .

but i damn well know what i wanted to happen . ''

`` what ? ''

i breathe , so close to him that i can feel his warm breath against my skin .

`` what did you want to happen ? ''

his eyes glint with something that looks like longing .

lust .

can this seriously be happening right now ?

is someone about to leap out from behind a houseplant and tell me i 've been punk 'd or what ?

`` it would probably be better for me to show you than tell you , '' he growls .

`` is that ok ? ''

unable to formulate a single word , i simply nod my assent .

with a fiery intensity i 've never seen in him before , emerson catches my face in his broad hands .

i can feel my heart barreling against my ribcage as he takes one long , steady look at me .

before i can take another breath , he 's brought his lips to mine in a searing , earnest kiss .

the entire world shrinks down to our two bodies as i feel myself subsumed by the sensation .

his lips are unbelievably soft , his mouth so strong as it works against mine .

i open myself to him , closing my eyes in rapturous bliss as his tongue glances against my own .

the taste of him electrifies my senses .

in this moment , there is nothing but him .

i gasp softly as emerson pulls me onto his lap .

i straddle him , wrapping my arms around his shoulders as his tongue probes deeper and deeper .

pressing myself flush against him , i let a low groan escape from between my lips .

i can feel through his signature blue jeans that he 's hard for me .

the full , stiffening length of him presses against my sex , exactly where i 've been dreaming of feeling him for the better part of four years .

my body has never been this alive with want .

not with anybody .

moving with him feels intuitive in a way it never has with any other guy .

i grind my hips slowly , feeling him grow even harder beneath me .

his hands slide down over my ass , running along the firm rise in my jeans .

he pulls me tighter , letting me feel just how much he wants me .

in a moment of daring , i close my teeth around his bottom lip , tugging gently .

he looks up at me in wonder .

`` where the hell did you come from , abby ? ''

he breathes .

`` i 've been here all along , '' i smile , running my hands through his chestnut hair .

`` you just have n't noticed until now . ''

`` please , '' he chuckles , wrapping his arms around the small of my back , `` you honestly think i never noticed you before ? ''

`` well ... you never said a word to me before our parents met , '' i point out , bringing my lips to his scruffy throat and kissing deeply .

`` why would i ?

you were way out of my league , '' he replies , running his down my sides .

`` i did n't want to risk making an ass of myself . ''

i start laughing so hard that i nearly topple off of him .

`` now that is hilarious , '' i crow , steadying myself .

`` me ?

out of your league ? ''

`` of course , '' he says , `` can you seriously not see that ? ''

`` all i can see right now is you , mr. drop dead gorgeous lacrosse star , '' i smile , feeling emboldened by his words .

`` and since we 're being honest , here ... i 've been carrying quite the torch for you these past four years .

i 've sort of been crushing on you from afar since ... oh ... the minute i saw you in school for the first time . ''

`` no shit ? ''

he grins .

`` no shit , '' i assure him .

`` how messed up is it that we only figured this out because our parents started boning ? ''

he laughs .

`` ughh , '' i groan , rolling off of him onto the couch , `` please do n't talk about our parents having sex right now .

or ever , for that matter . ''

`` fine by me , '' he says , shifting his body my way .

without another word , he lays me out on the sofa , lowering his muscled body onto mine .

he runs his index finger along my jaw , tipping my chin up toward his face .

`` i do n't want to talk right now anyway . ''

he kisses me again , his hands roving all over my body .

my back arches as he cups my breasts through my thin cotton tee shirt , letting his thumbs brush over my hard nipples .

as he kneads and caresses me , a low , pulsing pressure starts to build in my core .
