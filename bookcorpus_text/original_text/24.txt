as he flashed the light into aidan 's eyes , he grimaced .

`` yeah , they are .

what exactly happened ? ''

he made sure to direct his question to emma since she appeared to be the only one being honest .

`` we were at my ob 's for our first ultrasound . ''

pesh 's eyes widened .

`` ultrasound ... you 're pregnant ? ''

`` again ? ''

megan questioned by his side .

the concern for aidan on emma 's face washed away and was replaced with a beaming smile .

`` yes , i 'm eight weeks . ''

`` why did n't you say something at dinner sunday ? ''

megan asked .

`` well , i only found out two weeks ago , and we wanted to wait to tell everyone until we had the first ultrasound . ''

megan 's blonde brows creased .

`` so what does the ultrasound have to do with ankle hitting his head ? ''

emma pursed her lips and cut her gaze over to aidan .

`` would you like to tell them ? ''

when he shook his head and then winced , emma sighed .

`` when they hooked me up to the fetal monitor , they thought they heard two heartbeats .

at the word 'twins ' , aidan passed out and hit his head on the counter and the floor . ''

while pesh quickly turned a laugh into a cough , megan was n't so tactful .

she burst out laughing .

`` you seriously passed out during the ultrasound ? ''

aidan scowled at her .

`` in my defense , it was n't quite the ultrasound yet . ''

at megan 's continued laughter , he shrugged .

`` it was pretty mind-blowing news . ''

`` oh ankle , honestly . ''

aidan turned to pesh .

`` so am i going to stand around all day getting shit , or are you going to examine me ? ''

pesh nodded .

`` of course .

your pupils are definitely a matter of concern . ''

glancing at emma , aidan said , `` just wait for me here . ''

`` okay . ''

pesh motioned for aidan to go into the first examining room .

as soon as the door closed behind him , aidan lunged for him , grabbing the lapels of his white coat .

`` i need a vasectomy .

today . ''

pesh fought the urge to laugh at the absurdity of the situation as well as aidan 's desperation .

`` okay , let 's get you to sit down .

you 've obviously been through a lot of trauma in the last hour . ''

aidan plopped onto the examining table .

he buried his head in his hands and groaned .

`` what a f**king nightmare of a day . ''

`` does your head hurt ? ''

pesh asked .

`` a little . ''

`` any nausea ? ''

`` maybe . ''

pesh furrowed his brows .

`` what do you mean , maybe ? ''

aidan raised his head .

`` if you 're asking if i 'm nauseated now , the answer would be no .

i 'm not .

but on the other hand , if you 're asking if i get nauseous thinking about the fact that emma could have been pregnant with twins , and i would have had three kids under two and in diapers ... '' aidan shuddered .

`` then yeah , i get really f**king nauseous , and the room starts to spin a little . ''

easing down on his stool , he rolled over to aidan .

`` take a deep breath for me , okay ? ''

aidan 's chest expanded as he inhaled and exhaled .

`` again , '' pesh instructed .

after a few cleansing breaths , pesh cocked his head at aidan .

`` better ? ''

`` yeah , a little , '' aidan croaked .

he jerked his hand through his hair .

`` are you going to get me a referral for a vasectomy ? ''

pesh held up his hand .

`` i 'm confused .

if you know that emma is n't having twins , why do you want to have a vasectomy ? ''

`` because twins run on both sides of our families .

pop was a twin , and emma 's uncles are twins .

it 's like we have a genetic bull's-eye hovering over us .

we can barely be in the same room without conceiving , so it 's just inevitable that she 'll get pregnant again , and then i 'll have four kids ... maybe even five . ''

aidan swallowed hard as some of the color drained from his face .

`` i ca n't be a baby making machine . ''

`` actually , most recent studies still conclude that identical twins can happen to anyone , whereas , fraternal twins are the result of the mother producing two eggs in a single cycle .

this tendency to create multiple eggs is passed from mother to child .

given that emma does n't have a non-identical twin , you are fairly safe . ''

aidan tilted his head , his expression one of confusion .

`` so you 're saying i do n't have to worry about that ? ''

`` without knowing emma 's full genetic history , i could n't say , but it sounds like a no-at least for fraternal twins . ''

after processing pesh 's words , aidan shook his head .

`` like it really matters about the twins .

we 're still way too fertile together .

i need to stop this before it gets out of hand . ''

`` and what does emma think about all of this ? ''
