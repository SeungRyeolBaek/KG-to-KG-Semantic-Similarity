victoria grimaced inwardly .

put that way , it sounded nice .

perhaps she could cut back on some things and be able to afford the charges .

`` okay , i 'll look into it , '' she said , knowing she 'd spend several hours looking for the cheapest phone and payment plan .

`` you 'll do no such thing , '' he said .

`` i 'll have one delivered to you . ''

`` but i do n't know if i 'll be able to afford ... '' she started to say .

`` you will not worry about money , '' he interrupted .

`` it will be taken care of . ''

victoria did n't like the sound of that .

`` but , i 'm not sure that 's such a good idea . ''

she considered that if she could n't pay for it , there was n't any need for her to enjoy the luxury .

she liked living within her means and presents were meant to be small items like a scarf or gloves , not a cell phone .

`` victoria , accept this as something that will put my mind at ease .

i do n't like thinking of you walking alone at night .

are you free this weekend ? ''

he asked , changing the subject as if the discussion was over .

victoria wanted to argue with him but she allowed him to change the subject since it was more interesting anyway .

`` this weekend ?

i think i 'm only studying .

i do n't have any plans that i know of at this point . ''

`` good .

i 'll pick you up friday night for dinner , '' he said .

with a small , hard kiss , he turned and left , leaving victoria smiling at the way he ordered her around .

he was used to getting his own way but , as she let herself into the suite , she was n't going to ignore her upbringing simply because he told her to .

the next two months were the most exciting of victoria 's life .

dharr showed her all over london , bringing her to restaurants she 'd never even heard of but were the trendy spots to see all the exciting people of london .

there were only two moments to mar her happiness , both times , she gave in to him , afraid of his anger if she did n't .

she knew that he would n't hurt her in any way .

but she did n't want him to be angry .

she wanted to please him .

it was a silly need that bubbled up in her each time he made a request of her .

the first time was the day following their picnic .

she was in her suite studying when the doorbell rang .

instantly , she rushed over to it , expecting scott as he was coming to study with her and help her with her art history class which she was struggling in .

he 'd convinced her to sign up for the class as her one elective and now she was barely scraping by with a b when she 'd previously received only as in her other classes .

but instead of her gangly friend , a bulky , dark and angry looking man stood in her doorway .

`` compliments of ashir , '' he said mysteriously , handing her a medium sized box and left .

a moment later , victoria was still standing in the doorway when scott walked up .

`` what 's that ? ''

he asked , pushing past her and dumping his books on her sofa .

`` i do n't know , '' she said warily .

`` what 's all this ? ''

he asked , looking at the open phone book and the notes filled with figures on her notebook .

victoria looked up from the box she was trying to open and saw what he was reviewing .

`` oh , that , '' she said and dumped the box on the table , walking over to sit next to him on the sofa .

`` dharr asked me to get a mobile so i was researching prices .

but i really do n't know what i 'm doing , '' she said , putting her hand against her forehead in frustration .

`` there are so many types and conveniences , i 'm not sure what i need .

i mean , if all he needs is a way to connect with me , then why do n't i just get a very basic phone ? ''

scott nodded .

`` i agree with you .

i ca n't see you text messaging someone , eh ? ''

he laughed .

`` anyway , i found a really good deal via the mail recently .

i 'll bring it over next time and you can compare that rate with the other ones you have here , '' he said , indicating the air time minutes and costs she 'd scribbled all over the paper .

`` i think mine is a little better than these rates . ''

victoria was relieved .

she could understand and read people but when it came to technology , she just got lost in the masses of possibilities .

`` great .

i ca n't imagine getting hooked on it like you and marcus are , '' she sighed .

`` i hate talking on phones in the best of times . ''

`` that 's why there are computers , dearie ! ''

he laughed , knowing that it was easier to send her an electronic message since she was writing her reports all the time now until the end of the semester .
