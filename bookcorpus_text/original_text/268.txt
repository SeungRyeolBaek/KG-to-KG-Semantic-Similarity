`` here we are , '' emerson says , drawing to a stop on a gorgeous block lined with cozy cafes and classy boutiques .

he leads me up a set of stone steps and unlocks a door there .

`` this is where you live ? ''

i breathe , glancing over my shoulder at the cosmopolitan block .

`` sure is , '' he says , holding the door for me .

i expect to walk into the lobby of an apartment building , a ground floor leading off to a bunch of different units .

but as emerson nudges open a second door and steps through , i feel my jaw drop .

the entire space inside is an open , spacious loft .

this entire building is his .

i 've watched enough house-hunting reality tv to know that this is easily a multi-million dollar property-and this is n't even his only place !

the impossibly high ceilings vault above a perfectly-arranged interior .

there 's a huge , sparkling kitchen , a sunken living room , and an enclosed bedroom off the main space .

huge , towering windows take up the entire wall opposite us , and lead off onto a private terrace .

the design is mostly minimal-white walls and hardwood floors-with purposeful touches of natural materials like wood and stone .

the appliances and decor are an artful mix of new and vintage .

emerson 's home is utterly perfect .

it could have been ripped right off my `` dream home '' pinterest page .

amazing how our tastes are so aligned , even though we come from totally different backgrounds and have led completely different lives .

i 'd call that a good sign .

i gasp as a throw pillow comes barreling my way , only to realize in the next moment that the galloping bundle of white fluff is actually an adorable little west highland terrier .

the tiny dog collides with my legs , tail wagging a million miles an hour .

`` you must be roxie , '' i laugh , reaching down to scratch her ears .

`` yep .

that 's the lady of the house , '' emerson smiles .

`` house ? ''

i shoot back , kneeling down to get a better look at the friendly westie .

`` more like palace . ''

`` pick your jaw up off the floor and tell me what kind of wine you like , '' he laughs , setting the groceries down on the kitchen island .

`` something red , '' i say , staring in wonder at the impeccable space .

`` coming right up , '' he replies , opening a concealed miniature wine cellar nestled into the island .

`` how does a nice rioja sound ? ''

`` it sounds ... nice , '' i tell him , settling down at one of the wooden stools before the counter .

roxie follows me over into the kitchen and sits at my feet , staring up at me with amiable , adorable curiosity .

`` she likes you , '' emerson observes , pausing to give roxie a good nuzzling .

`` well .

she has wonderful taste , '' i kid , flipping my blonde hair theatrically .

he produces a couple of wine glasses and pours generously .

`` to our 26th years , '' he smiles , clinking my glass .

`` to you not doing too shabbily for yourself , '' i reply , taking a sip of the delicious wine .

`` i mean , you told me how well you 've made out with this app development gig , but holy crap .

this loft , emerson ... '' `` i 'm glad you like it , '' he says , gathering and prepping his ingredients .

`` i actually prefer it to my place in london , to tell you the truth .

but that 's where cooper decided he needs me most , so . ''

it takes a second for emerson 's words to click .

of course .

he 's not even based here at the new york offices of bastian .

he runs the show in europe .

that means , of course , that he 's probably due back there soon .

like , the end of the week soon .

why did n't i think of that before ?

`` you ok ? ''

he asks , heating up some olive oil in a cast iron skillet .

`` oh .

yeah , '' i say , snapping back to attention .

`` i just ... kind of forgot that this is a temporary situation .

you being in new york . ''

`` mmm , '' he mutters , noncommittally , `` it 's true , i did only swing by to train the new recruit at cooper 's request .

if i could have known that you were the new recruit , well ... '' `` well what ? ''

i ask , leaning my elbows on the island .

he glances over his shoulder at me , smiling .

`` maybe i would n't have bought a return ticket , in the end . ''

i 'm torn between elation and trepidation .

best not force the issue of what 's going to happen between us once my training is complete and focus on the moment at hand .

i watch as emerson grills two delectable salmon fillets , blanches some broccoli rabe , and prepares a small batch of pesto pasta .

the food smells amazing , the wine is fantastic , and i 'm here with one of my favorite people on earth .

today may have been a little bit rough , but it sure is shaping up nicely .

if i try real hard , i can pretend that this is what my life is like every day , and forget that this is just a fleeting anomaly .
