`` welcome back , rachel . ''

he took her hand and pulled her up the steps and into the house .

rachel had been inside often over the years , but normally she entered through the kitchen door or the garage .

the main house was intimidating when coming in through the front , which was exactly his intent with most of his guests .

`` why are you doing this ? ''

she asked when he brought her into the dining room where lucy already had a light lunch set out along with a whole tray of wine glasses ready for the wine tasting .

`` we 'll do the opening , '' he said to george who was preparing the first bottle for the tasting .

george nodded and bowed himself out of the dining room , even closing the doors as he left .

rachel saw that they were now alone and her shaking increased .

`` please do n't do this , rais , '' she begged , her fingers knotting the napkin on her lap .

`` do n't do what ? ''

he asked as he poured a small amount from the first bottle of wine .

`` do n't do ... .this , '' she said , waving her hand between the two of them .

he looked down at her and stilled for a long moment .

`` help me understand why i should n't try and make love to the woman i 've wanted for so long i ca n't remember a time when i did n't want you in my bed . ''

that was a startling declaration but she focused on his first request .

`` i 'm not in your league , rais .

i do n't play by the same rules that you do .

when i have sex , it will mean something . ''

that declaration infuriated him for some reason .

`` so all of your old lovers meant so much to you that you 're still with them ?

its ' just me that you do n't want in your bed , is that it ? ''

she sighed and bowed her head .

`` you keep referring to my old lovers , but that assumption is n't accurate , rais . ''

`` how many ? ''

he demanded and placed her glass in front of her .

`` taste this one .

it 's an excellent red . ''

she ignored the glass and stared at her fingers instead .

`` none , '' she whispered .

it was time to be honest with him .

maybe if he understood , he would stop his pursuit of her and let her just be content with the way her life was moving .

he did n't move .

did n't even breathe for a long moment .

`` would you repeat that please ? ''

he said softly , firmly .

she did n't want to repeat it .

she wanted to run out of the house and hide from him again .

being here , seeing him again as the memories of those hands on her breasts saturday filtered into her mind , she had trouble focusing on anything other than that .

and what might have happened if she 'd stayed , if her fears had n't come up and overwhelmed her .

he was n't leaving her any choice though .

he stood there looking down at her , waiting .

her chin lifted just so he did n't think she was weak or embarrassed , which she was in this case but he did n't have to know that .

`` i have n't been with any other man . ''

he sat down heavily in the chair next to her , downed the small amount of wine he 'd poured in his glass , then poured himself another .

`` explain please . ''

she stood up and took her glass of water , draining the glass as she looked out the window .

`` do you remember that afternoon a long time ago when i came home from school and saw devlin and dalia ? ''

they were two of the horses that were still on the farm , still producing excellent offspring .

he remembered it vividly .

and he remembered how horrified she 'd been that afternoon crying out her fear for the mare who , in rachel 's eight year old mind , was being brutally raped when in fact , the mare was just putting on a show for the stallion .

`` i remember .

you were n't supposed to see those things .

your father was pretty angry with himself that day . ''

she smiled , remembering her father 's white face when he 'd gotten home that evening .

`` he tried to talk to me about it , but i was still too shocked . ''

she 'd also cried that afternoon in rais ' arms , begging him to stop devlin from hurting the poor mare .

she 'd buried her face on his shoulder , sobbing out the pain for the female horse .

`` and ? ''

he prompted .

`` well , '' she took a deep breath , `` i know , theoretically , that it is n't as brutal with humans .

but the truth is , i have n't really wanted to find out .

i 'm too scared to test the activity .

i 'm pretty sure i wo n't like having sex rais .

so i 've pretty much avoided it . ''

he was quiet , absorbing what she was telling him .

when he finally spoke he was right behind her , his chest mere inches from her back .

`` let me get this straight .

you have n't ever had sex with another man because you thought that sex with a man would be like mating was with devlin and dalia ? ''
