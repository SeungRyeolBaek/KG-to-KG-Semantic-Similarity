`` you did not , '' i retort , before i can think .

he looks up at me and raises his eyebrows , his gaze unreadable beneath them .

pierce laughs .

`` it 's true . ''

`` my dad says working is the only way to build character , '' nate reports quietly .

`` oh , '' i say , blushing as i push my way through the swinging door into the kitchen .

i place the china carefully next to the sink and lean onto the counter .

god , i feel like i ca n't say anything right around nate .

my mind freezes up while my body is set on fire .

`` so , are you dating anyone at school , brynn ? ''

pierce asks .

damn him .

`` not right now , '' i reply , sitting back down .

`` who were you dating ?

maybe i know him , '' nate says , his dark eyes picking up the candlelight in the table 's elaborate centerpiece .

my mom spent all afternoon on it .

`` probably not , '' i say evasively , pasting a polite smile on my face .

he really knows how to get under my skin .

the truth is , i 've never really dated anyone , much as my mom pushes me , and as much as i 'm embarrassed by the fact .

`` who wants dessert ? ''

i manage to sidestep any more questioning by bringing out the last course , though now i 'm starting to think about the fact that nate and dana are probably going to want to go off somewhere after this and have sex .

i hope it 's not in nate 's room .

what if i can hear them through the wall ?

my mom insists on clearing the dessert plates , and nate and dana stand up .

pierce and nate start talking quietly , and dana comes over to me .

`` you are so gorgeous . ''

she offers .

`` i have to ask : what do you use on your skin ? ''

`` i-what ?

um , soap ? ''

oh man , she really makes it difficult to hate her .

`` soap ?

just ... soap ?

oh my god , i have this whole routine , '' she says , laughing at herself .

`` well , thanks .

i guess i 'll be seeing you around often ? ''

i ask , but she looks surprised .

`` because you and nate are dating . ''

`` we 're not really dating , '' she confides to me .

`` he 's not the type , and i gave up hope years ago .

but just look at him-can you blame me for coming back ? ''

she says with a grin , then her eyes widen .

`` oh my gosh-sorry !

i forgot for a second that he 's your brother ! ''

`` step-brother , '' i correct her .

`` well , i 'm gon na head upstairs .

it was really nice to meet you , dana . ''

`` you , too , '' she replies , stepping away to join pierce and nate 's conversation .

i head into the foyer but at the last second decide not to go upstairs .

i need some air .

i find myself heading down the hallway and to the french doors in the wood-paneled study .

they open onto the patio and i step outside with relief , closing the door behind me .

the firm breeze from the river calls me forward and i head down toward it .

i circle around the swimming pool on the first level of the backyard , and then down to a grassy lawn with a lacrosse goal set up on one end .

the wooden stairs down to the rocky beach are set on the right side , and it takes me a minute to find them in the dark .

as i head down the steps , i see the potomac spread out in front of me .

the water rushes hungrily by , lit only by the sparsely set houses on the cliffs surrounding it .

as i step onto the shore , i can feel the rocks pressing up through my sandals , and boulders casting long , dark shadows on either side of me .

this is no white-sand beach .

the river runs dangerously fast after rains , and there are even white-water rapids along parts of it .

i look back at the steps behind me and then back out at the river .

i feel so out of place here .

even though our old house did n't really feel like home either , i wish i were there now , stretched out on the ratty old couch , with my mom in her chair , watching something on our small tv .

i do n't know if i 'll ever be able to feel like i belong here .

i 'll always feel like a guest in pierce 's house .

i walk down closer to the water until i can feel the pebbles getting smaller underneath my feet .

i do n't want my shoes to get wet .

i jump as a bird breaks out of a tree above me .

i can just see it as it flies off , its body a moving ink blot against the dark sky .

i wish i could follow it .

i turn and walk back toward the steps , feeling as lonely as i 've ever felt .

i shake my head at myself as i climb the wooden stairs .

my mom is happy , and i 'm fortunate to live in a place like this .
