`` here we go , '' emerson says proudly , plating our food and nodding toward the terrace .

`` shall we ? ''

i follow him out onto the secluded patio with roxie right on my heels .

we settle down at a little table beneath a canopy of string lights and overgrown ivy .

i know i should n't get attached to this place , this feeling , but i ca n't help it .

this is all so ... perfect .

and that 's even before i taste the food .

`` oh my god ... '' i murmur , taking my first bite of perfectly grilled salmon .

`` better than my risotto , even ? ''

emerson asks , helping himself to his meal .

`` i never would have thought it possible but , yes , '' i exclaim , savoring the taste .

`` i kept up with the hobby , '' he says modestly , `` spending a bit of time in france certainly whipped my cooking skills into shape . ''

`` you lived in france ? ''

i ask , wide-eyed .

`` oh yeah , '' he nods , `` france , england , spain , even finland for a while . ''

`` damn , '' i whistle , `` i 've been in the same apartment since i was eighteen . ''

`` nothing wrong with having roots , '' he replies .

`` yeah ... '' i murmur , thinking of my grandparents ' threat to tear those roots right out from under me .

we savor our incredible meal , the fine wine , each other 's company-and of course the delightful presence of roxie .

it 's shaping up to be a pretty good first day at the new job after all , even if this is strictly extra-curricular .

the evening wears on , a couple more glasses of wine are poured , and emerson even manages to find a record we can both agree on-iron and wine , an old favorite of ours .

we retire back into the loft , and i meander about the space at my leisure , taking in all the little details that make his house a home .

`` i 'd offer you a grand tour , '' emerson says , watching me from the center of the room , `` but this is pretty much it . ''

`` what about in there ? ''

i ask , nodding toward the bedroom door .

`` you trying to get a peek at my bedroom , rowan ? ''

he asks , grinning .

`` maybe i am , sawyer , '' i shrug , `` unless you 're afraid of me finding your playboy stash or something . ''

`` this from the girl who kept a vibrator within arm 's length through her entire adolescence , '' he laughs , walking toward his room .

`` i have needs , ok ? ''

i exclaim , feigning defensiveness .

`` is that so ? ''

he replies , his voice going raspy around the edges as he pauses in the doorway of his bedroom .

the delicious wine has lowered both of our inhibitions , and my body comes alive as i feel us transitioning into the more ... sensual part of the evening .

we have n't mentioned our steamy kiss from this weekend , yet , but we seem to be coming back around to right where we left off .

emerson 's blue eyes flash with desire as i step up to him , resting a hand on the firm panes of his chest .

`` you know about my needs better than anyone , '' i say softly , trailing my fingers down his cut , defined torso .

`` mmm .

we 'll just have to see what we can do about them , then , '' he murmurs , catching my wrist .

my eyes go wide as he draws my hand to his full lips and takes the tip of my finger into his mouth .

i feel his tongue brush against my fingertip , remember what it felt like to feel his mouth other places ... and break off into his room , chest pounding .

it 's a small , simple space with high ceilings and a huge king bed front and center .

a sleek dresser and wide window round out the space , and a few well-placed keepsakes make it feel like a sacred space .

i trail my fingers along the dresser , setting down my drained glass of wine .

i 'm just on the far edge of tipsy , and my cares are swirling away by the second .

there are a few framed pictures on the dresser , and my stomach turns to see an old wedding photo .

it is n't of our parents ' ridiculous ceremony , of course , but i do recognize a much-younger deb .

this must be from her first wedding to emerson 's father , a man who looks remarkably like the one standing next to me now .

deb looks so happy .

healthy , even .

it breaks my heart to think of what her life has become .

i tear my eyes away from the old picture and notice that a second frame holds not a photograph , but a drawing .

it only takes a split second for me to recognize it , and as soon as i do , i feel my hand fly to my lips .

there , on emerson 's dresser , is the sketch of him i drew when we were kids , the one i gave to him on his eighteenth birthday .

the drawing features him in half-profile , looking serious and sure .

i worked on this piece for hours-days , even-before giving it to him in that seaside motel room .
