grandpa shouts , slamming his fist down on the kitchen counter .

`` your father told us all about finding you two in bed together the morning after the wedding .

it 's absolutely disgusting , abby .

you have no business fraternizing with someone of his kind-to say nothing of the fact that he was your stepbrother ! ''

`` you need to stop right there , '' i say firmly , yanking my arm out of my grandmother 's grasp .

`` you do n't know the first thing about emerson , or what happened between us when we were kids .

there was nothing disgusting about our relationship then , and there 's nothing wrong with us spending time together now !

he 's a wonderful man .

a smart , successful , funny man who i care very deeply about .

why ca n't you respect that ? ''

`` his trashy mother ruined your father 's life , '' grandma spits , `` she and her jailbird husband were sucking him dry that whole time .

and just look at him now !

he 's an absolute wreck .

he never recovered from what that woman did to him . ''

`` dad ruined his own life , '' i tell them , `` deb did a terrible thing , taking advantage of him like that .

but he 's a grown man .

no one forced him to relapse .

no one made him refuse to go to rehab and get his life together .

he let himself go to pieces .

and even if deb and her husband did set him off , that has nothing to do with emerson !

he and i were just kids when dad and deb got together .

we were innocent bystanders to that whole train wreck . ''

`` i do n't accept that , '' grandpa sniffs , crossing his arms , `` you ca n't possibly think that the son of two lowlifes could be anything but a piece of garbage himself .

the apple never falls far from the tree , dear . ''

`` no ? ''

i shoot back , `` well then what does that say about you , with everything dad 's been through ?

what does it say about me , when he 's such a wreck ?

terrible things can happen to good people , you know . ''

`` you 'd seriously have us believe that this emerson is a good person ? ''

grandma scoffs .

`` i would , '' i tell her , `` if you 'd just try and get to know him , you 'd see- '' `` this is ridiculous , '' grandpa mutters , shaking his head , `` i wo n't hear another second of it .

jillian , do n't bother taking off your coat .

we 're not staying . ''

`` what ? ''

i say , `` i thought we were going to spend some time together ?

get something to eat , and- '' `` i 'm afraid i 've lost my appetite , '' grandpa says grimly .

`` just seeing that boy , being reminded of everything this family has gone through ... it 's too much .

i wo n't be subjected to this kind of nonsense .

especially not in an apartment i own myself ! ''

`` you must n't see that person again , abby , '' grandma says sternly .

i actually let out a laugh at this .

`` i must n't see him ? ''

i reply , cackling at the absurdity of what she 's said , `` well , that 's not really an option , seeing as we work together , now . ''

`` what ? ! ''

my grandparents gasp in unison .

`` i 've just been hired by the creative agency emerson works for , '' i inform them , `` i was going to tell you the good news over dinner , but .

well . ''

`` for christ 's sake , '' grandpa mutters , `` what are you giving him in return for getting you this job ?

do i even want to know ? ''

i stare at my grandfather , gobsmacked .

`` you think i got the job by ... what ?

sleeping with emerson ? ''

i ask quietly .

`` you think that little of me ?

of my abilities ?

i ... i do n't even know what to say , grandpa . ''

`` say that you wo n't get involved with that man outside of work , '' grandma pleads , `` especially not here , under our roof . ''

`` if you 're so concerned with emerson not being under your roof , maybe i 'd better move , '' i say , exasperated .

`` if that 's what you want , '' grandpa says coldly , `` you can carry on with that man all you like , but you 'd best not expect to have anything to do with us if you choose to do so .

if you keep on with your disgraceful little relationship with him , i 'm afraid we wo n't be able to continue being a part of your life , abby .

you 'll have to leave this apartment , of course .

and be content with never seeing us again .

if you can live with all that , go ahead . ''

`` you 'd cut me out of your lives ? ''

i ask quietly , `` just for being with emerson ? ''

`` we would , '' my grandfather assures me .

`` we 'd have no other choice , '' my grandmother agrees with him .

there 's a hint of sadness in her voice , but she 's always gone along with what grandpa decides .
