she snapped at him , her hands on her hips , not appreciating any of his amusement when her children were about to harm each other .

he shook his head and approached her slowly .

`` how am i to blame ? ''

`` you 're the one who taught them all their moves .

and gave them the confidence to believe they could actually fight to the death !

do n't even try that innocent look with me .

you know exactly what you 've done . ''

malik turned back to his children , keeping a stern expression on his face .

`` i do n't ever want to hear any of you joking about fighting to the death with each other .

your combat skills are only for emergency and protective situations . ''

`` we were n't really going to fight to the death , dad , '' jacob said as he stood up .

`` we only wanted to teach them a lesson . ''

`` i 'm the only one who can teach this .

now go back to your studies and do n't let me find you in here again without supervision . ''

all four children stood at attention and bowed , appreciating that they were supposed to respect their black belt master before exiting any room .

siri had to smother her own smile as she watched their efforts , knowing that jacob and samuel would never hurt their sisters .

they were overly protective of them as it is , but she 'd panicked when she heard the message and was only now realizing how silly her fears had been .

even danika and lila would n't do anything to hurt their brothers , thinking the boys walked on water .

as she watched , jacob elbowed danika , whispering that she 'd done a good job .

and samuel was holding lila 's hand as he led her out of the gym .

all was well with her growing family and she sent up a silent prayer of gratitude for all of the wonderful gifts she 'd received .

malik walked over and put his hand on siri 's growing stomach , waiting to see if he could feel his next child move for him .

`` how are you feeling ? ''

he asked gently .

she chuckled and moved to one of the benches to sit down , accepting malik 's assistance as she carefully lowered her pregnant bulk down .

`` i 'd feel a whole lot better if my children were n't so competitive . ''

he laughed softly and sat down beside her , leaning against the wall as he released the tension that had accumulated after he 'd received the message that his children were fighting each other .

`` you 're beautiful , you know , '' he said and took her hand in his .

`` you 're pretty handsome yourself , '' she came back .

`` i love you . ''

he chuckled and moved closer , putting his arm around her protectively .

`` you can say that after what we just witnessed ? ''

`` you 've given me so much , including those little hellions , '' she sighed and pressed her cheek against his chest as he pulled her close .

`` i love you for all the little things you 've done for me . ''

`` i 'd like to give you more jewelry , '' he commented , noting that she was n't wearing any gold or diamonds with her blue dress that draped over her beautifully pregnant figure .

`` you 've given me something better than jewels , '' she came back .

`` you 've given me treasures beyond measure . ''

he looked down at the woman he 'd loved for so many years and smiled .

`` you 've given me a great deal as well . ''

chapter 1 `` dad , i just do n't think ... '' rachel stuart started to say .

her father gently interrupted her before she could come up with an excuse .

`` do n't say you do n't have the time .

i guarantee you wo n't regret this . ''

rachel bit her lip , wondering how she could say no to her father .

she knew he was lonely , but ... `` he 's not here , honey . ''

john stuart said the words softly , but her heart ached that her father knew .

she closed her eyes and took a deep , cleansing breath as the pain of her last visit to the farm swept through her .

she slowly let the air out of her lungs and straightened her shoulders , not willing to reveal too much even to her father .

`` i do n't care if he 's there or not dad .

this has nothing to ... '' `` rach ' , do n't even try it . ''

he softly interrupted her comment , knowing where this conversation would go if he allowed it .

`` your old dad knows what 's going on and i feel for you .

rais is n't scheduled to arrive until late tomorrow afternoon .

so if you do n't come out tonight , then you 're not going to be able to see these beauties for another month and i know you 're gon na love these guys . ''

'beauties ' ?

did that mean that new horses had arrived on the farm ?

he knew he 'd piqued her interest with that comment and she hesitated only briefly because if there was one thing in this world she loved besides her father it was horses .

and she was relieved that the man in question was n't scheduled to arrive until the following day .

`` what is it ? ''
