`` i 'm built because i go to the gym to work off stress .

but if you put me on the field , i 'd be a serious disappointment . ''

she shook her head .

`` that does n't turn me off at all .

i 've had my fill of jocks . ''

`` oh ? ''

he questioned .

although he was trying to be nonchalant about it , she knew he wanted to hear the full story .

`` dating jocks for me is poison , and when i did date one , i made sure to date the ones at the top of their game .

my first athlete 's influence caused me to ruin my chances at medical school . ''

`` that 's horrible . ''

`` yes , it is .

but what 's worse is i did n't learn anything from my mistakes because i fell for another one . ''

with a rueful smile , she added , `` at least i got mason out of that one . ''

pesh laced his fingers together .

`` mason 's father is a professional athlete ? ''

`` yes , he plays football for the falcons . ''

`` you know i 'm friends with the team 's sports medicine doctor .

i could probably arrange something for him .

maybe a little icy hot in his cup ? ''

at the mischievous twinkle in pesh 's eyes , megan burst out laughing .

`` i can not believe , you of all people , suggested such a thing . ''

with a shrug , pesh replied , `` it 's a harmless prank . ''

`` i realize that .

it 's just i ca n't imagine someone like you would even think of doing something like that . ''

when he started to open his mouth to argue , she held up her hand .

`` i know , i know .

do n't pigeon hole you . ''

`` exactly . ''

their main course arrived , and megan could n't help digging into the wonderful aromatic food .

as they ate , the conversation came easily .

that was one of the things she liked most about pesh-he was so easy to talk to .

because he was older , refined , and a doctor , she could have felt intimidated by him .

but he never made her feel that way .

he always seemed fascinated by every single thing she had to say , which was quite a change from most of the guys she dated .

they were usually half listening to her while glancing over her shoulder at the tv to get the latest score .

after they finished , the waiter took their plates .

`` dessert ? ''

megan asked , as she downed the last of her wine .

pesh nodded his head toward the small dance floor .

`` how about a dance instead ? ''

she wrinkled her nose .

`` i 'm really not much of a dancer . ''

he arched his brows at her as if he knew she was lying .

`` okay , fine , i used to dance all the time back in high school and college . ''

`` then dance with me . ''

`` i 'm not good at slow dancing .

you 'll probably regret asking me the moment we get out there . ''

pesh stuffed a wad of bills into the bill envelope .

`` as shakespeare would say , the lady do protesth too much .

and i think i know the reason . ''

`` oh , you do ? ''

he nodded .

`` slow dancing is intimate , and you do n't want to want to let yourself be intimate with me . ''

`` you went down on me in a supply closet .

i think that 's pretty intimate , '' she challenged .

`` that was not intimacy .

sexual acts are of the mind where our pleasure center is .

intimacy is of the heart . ''

he held her gaze .

`` we both know you 'll let me into your body but not your heart . ''

knowing he was right , she crossed her arms over her chest and scowled at him .

she did n't know why she just could n't get up and go dance like he had asked .

she 'd slow danced a thousand times at parties .

what was the difference here ?

somewhere deep down , she knew the answer to that question .

`` if you do n't want to dance , then let 's go and see the city . ''

not wanting to let him get the best of her , she rose out of her chair .

`` fine .

i 'll dance with you . ''

he chuckled .

`` do n't sound so thrilled . ''

after he stood up , he took her hand and led her over to the dance floor .

she started to wrap her arms around his neck like she was accustomed to , but he put one of her hands on his shoulder and then he took the other hand in his .

his other hand slid around to rest at her lower back .

the band finished the jazzier beats of a song and then switched over to another .

a lone piano pounded out the opening chords .

the lead singer 's sultry voice filled the air , `` like a flower waiting to bloom . ''

megan immediately recognized the song as norah jones ' turn me on .

the electricity between them shifted , and as megan stared up into pesh 's eyes , she saw desire and lust flaring in them .

her gaze dropped down to his full lips , and she could n't help wanting him to kiss her .
