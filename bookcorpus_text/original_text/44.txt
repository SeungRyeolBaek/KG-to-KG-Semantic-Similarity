he licked his lips and took a step toward her .

`` just a second where you could imagine your life with me in it ? ''

megan stared at him , her expression contemplative .

for a brief moment , pesh thought by her hesitation that she had changed her mind about him .

but then she shook her head .

`` how many times are you going to make me hurt you with this ?

you 're too good for me , pesh .

we both know that .

i 'll remind you again of some of the reasons i 'm not the one for you .

i 'm twenty-five , and you 're thirty-seven .

you want a wife , and i 'm not ready to be married . ''

her words cut into his chest the same as if she had taken a sharp blade to him .

she may have had to repeat herself this time , but he realized the finality of her words .

and then an idea hit him so hard that he shuddered-a true light bulb moment and epiphany .

there was only one way he was going to get to have his sweet megan , and that was if he gave in to her .

he would have to become someone else for her , even if it was just for a little while .

he could distract her with sex that she both desired and demanded , but at the same time , he would make her fall in love with him .

it could work .

it had to .

cocking his head at her , he questioned , `` so let me get this straight once and for all .

you would let me ... '' he paused , fighting the conflict within himself to say what he needed to .

he drew in a ragged breath .

`` you would let me f**k you but not love you ? ''

her eyes widened at his word choice .

`` what 's gotten into you ? ''

he shrugged nonchalantly , feeling slightly empowered in the dr. jekyll and mr. hyde moment .

`` i merely asked a simple question . ''

she snorted exasperatedly .

`` yeah , about ... '' she swallowed hard .

`` fucking , of all things . ''

`` yes . ''

megan shook her head wildly back and forth .

`` i can barely acknowledge hearing you say the word , least of all you doing that . ''

`` you ca n't imagine me- '' she held up her hand .

`` you 're not the type of man to f**k , '' she countered .

crossing his arms over his chest , he countered , `` oh really ?

i 'm too nice of a guy ? ''

`` something like that . ''

`` i am a man , megan .

we all have needs .

is n't f**king one of them ? ''

her body trembled slightly at his words .

she licked her lips before replying , `` s-stop saying that word-it is n't you . ''

`` so , f**king is n't me ?

do n't tell me you think i 'm totally asexual-that you ca n't imagine me f**king a woman ... fucking you . ''

he eased in closer to her .

`` we both know for a fact that you wanted nothing more than to f**k me the night of noah 's baptism .

given the chance right now , you 'd let me strip off your scrubs and f**k you up against the medicine cabinet . ''

as her chest heaved up and down , she took a step back from him , bumping against the counter .

`` but you do n't say things like that .

you 're refined .

you 're a gentleman , '' she whispered .

`` it may have been a while , but even a gentleman like me enjoys f**king . ''

he closed the gap between them .

`` what are you doing ? ''

she whispered .

`` i 'm giving you what you want . ''

`` you 're giving in ? ''

`` yeah , why not ? ''

as he dipped his head , his mouth hovered over hers .

`` if you really want me to take you , then kiss me . ''

without a moment 's hesitation , megan crashed her lips against his .

the kiss was hard and desperately seeking more .

as his tongue thrust into her mouth , his hand came to her breast .

tenderly , he cupped the flesh , feeling the weight fill his hand .

unsatisfied with the lack of contact , he pulled his hand away and slid it underneath megan 's top .

over her bra , he kneaded her breast again , feeling her nipple harden under his touch .

he felt his erection grow at the sound of her whimper .

he wanted nothing more than to strip off all her clothes and kiss every inch of her body .

megan 's mouth popped off of his , and she stared up at him with hooded eyes .

`` what about someone finding us ? ''

`` i 'll lock the door , '' he replied .

reluctantly , he pulled away from her to walk back over to the door .

after he turned the lock , he made sure to push a box in front of it as well .

they would have enough warning if someone were to try to use their card to come in .

with his hands on her shoulders , he steered her behind one of the floor-to-ceiling shelves , concealing them even further from potential prying eyes .

`` now where were we ? ''

he asked , with a smile .

she grinned and wrapped her arms around his neck .
