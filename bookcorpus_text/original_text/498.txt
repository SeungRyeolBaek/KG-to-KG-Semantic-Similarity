`` and they were angry with me for that .

they were angry with me for not fully committing to this relationship with you and they were acting out of loyalty .

they risked their employment and their futures because they love and respect you .

because they know what a good ruler you are and were angry with me for not seeing it as well . ''

`` you are my wife ! ''

he snapped , holding her upper arms .

`` they disrespected you as well . ''

she could n't disagree with that .

and they 'd made her life a living hell for several weeks .

`` yes , they did .

but they were only looking out for you .

and if they have that kind of fearless courage to withstand your wrath , i want each of them to be here , to convey that loyalty to max and help him grow up .

i do n't want any of them terminated over what they 've done to me . ''

`` i ca n't let this go , '' he argued .

`` i wo n't allow them near you again . ''

she bit her lip and tried to come up with a compromise .

`` i love you , '' she whispered .

`` will you trust me ? ''

he pulled her against him , hugging her gently .

`` what are you going to do ? ''

he asked .

`` serve them all coffee ? ''

he 'd just noticed the tray with coffee and cups on the conference table .

he squeezed her once again .

`` i ca n't believe that you were going to serve your staff coffee after all that they 've put you through . ''

she shrugged her shoulder .

`` they did n't look very happy when they were parading in here .

although i did n't know why and did n't expect you to be firing them .

or accusing them of treason . ''

`` you 're my queen , ella .

it is treason what they did to you . ''

she laughed and shook her head .

`` i do n't feel like a queen . ''

he pulled her closer .

`` what do you want me to do ? ''

she rested her cheek against his chest , running through different possibilities in her mind .

`` will you let me handle this ? ''

she asked .

he looked down at her , searching her face for a clue as to what she might do .

`` yes , '' he finally said .

`` as long as i 'm still in the loop and can beat anyone who disrespects you again . ''

she smiled at his threat .

`` i know you would n't physically hurt anyone , '' she said but missed the look that said 'you have no idea ' because she turned back to the crowd , leaning slightly against zayn since he wrapped his arm around her waist .

`` each one of you may keep your jobs . ''

she waited just long enough to hear the sighs of relief travel through the room .

`` today , '' she went on sternly .

`` each of you will have your job each day but if there 's so much as a single infraction , your employment will be terminated by the end of that day .

you will be stripped of your clearance and ability to work in the government and will be escorted out of the palace by the guards . ''

her eyes traveled around the room , looking at each person to ensure that they understood her resolve .

`` i not only approve of , but applaud , your loyalty to my husband and my son .

but i guarantee that he and i will have our differences .

sometimes that will result in a fight between the two of us .

but not a single person will relay anything they hear to another human being .

is that clear ? ''

she waited for them to nod their head .

`` that means that , if you hear me snap at him in the dining room , no one in the bedrooms will hear about it .

and if a reporter every gets wind of anything happening in the private lives of me , my husband or my children , every single person on staff will be terminated .

so it is up to each of you to ensure that every other person on the staff respects our privacy .

and i mean , if i get pregnant , there will be no slips to the press until we make the official announcement .

if i decide to wear a purple gown to dinner one night , there will be zero knowledge of that outside of official pictures . ''

she looked around , each of them starting to straighten up , pull back their shoulders , as they realized that , not only were they going to be able to keep their jobs , but they would have an awesome responsibility to maintain an almost impossible level of privacy .

she felt zayn 's arm tighten and took that as a signal of his support and approval .

but she kept her shoulders squared off and her head held high as she continued .

`` i do n't care how tempting it is to sell secrets and gossip to the media .

each and every one of you will be summarily fired if anything leaks to the press about the private lives of my family . ''

she thought quickly , trying to come up with additional ways to protect herself and her family which now included zayn although how he 'd snuck into her heart , she 'd never understand .
