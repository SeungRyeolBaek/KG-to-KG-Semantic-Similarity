`` do they swim ? ''

he asked softly , watching siri pick at her salad .

she nodded and put her fork down , too tense to eat anything with him leaning close and almost whispering in her ear .

`` i 've had them in lessons last winter so they are familiar with water .

they are n't afraid of anything that i know of yet . ''

he laughed softly and leaned closer .

`` unlike you , right ? ''

she pulled away and looked up at him .

`` i 'm not afraid of the water , '' she replied .

`` no , but you 're afraid of me , are n't you ? ''

`` no !

why would you say that ? ''

she demanded and pushed her hair behind her ear , picking up her fork and forcing herself to take a bite despite the fact that her stomach was fluttering wildly .

`` or maybe you 're afraid of what i make you feel .

interesting question either way , in my opinion . ''

she shifted away from him slightly , wishing she could stop blushing .

`` you think too much of yourself , malik . ''

`` do i ?

so if i were to do this , '' he said and let his hand drop to her back , his fingers sliding against the muscles lightly , `` it would n't bother you ? ''

he asked .

his fingers touched a spot on her back that he knew always drove her crazy .

it was like an erogenous zone outside of the norm and she hated that he remembered how much she loved to be caressed on her back .

`` do n't do that ! ''

she snapped and sat up straight again .

`` why ? ''

`` because we 're not doing that ! ''

`` ah , but we are , siri .

we 're going to be doing this , and so much more ! ''

siri 's stomach coiled into knots with his promise and she shuddered at the images that immediately popped into her mind .

she did n't want to feel like this !

she wanted to be immune to him , to be able to keep her distance but her whole body wanted to lean into his touch , to move her chair closer to his body and find warmth and comfort , as well as the excitement he always provided whenever he touched her .

damn him !

she wanted her old life back before he re-entered her world and turned it upside down !

the evening progressed much easier after that .

the only awkward moment was after she 'd tucked the boys into bed , she was alone with malik in the dimly lit hallway .

`` thank you for dinner , '' she said nervously and moved back into her family room , turning on as many lights as possible to break the intimate feeling of the now quiet house .

`` you 're welcome , '' he replied and pulled her into his arms .

he kissed her thoroughly , but just when she was shivering with need , he stepped back and released her .

`` can you take the day off again tomorrow ?

we need to look at some things together . ''

she nodded her head , her hand shaking as she lifted it to her tingling mouth , trying to subtly wipe away the effect he had on her system when he kissed her .

`` fine .

yes .

tomorrow , '' she said , hoping this meant he was leaving .

he walked to the door and laid his hand on the doorknob .

`` we 're not finished , siri .

this is just the beginning . ''

she was shaking her head , trying to deny it but he was already out the door before she could say anything to contradict his words as she sat alone in her little family room , she sank down into the sofa and curled up , staring at nothing as her mind frantically tried to figure out what to do about this whole situation .

but the emotional stress of the last few days finally caught up with her .

she tried , but failed to keep her eyes open and work out a solution .

as midnight approached , she was fast asleep on her sofa , still curled up and her dreams taking her to the place where she would n't allow herself to go while awake ; directly into malik 's arms and making love to him until they were both too tired to move .

chapter 8 `` okay , so where are we going ?

what was the big surprise today that we could n't talk about around the boys ? ''

siri asked as she walked out of the preschool area .

she hid her eyes behind sunglasses , worried that he might see something she did n't want him to know .

he was too perceptive of her moods lately .

he stood less than a foot from her and looked down into her face , knowing that she was concerned about what was going to happen to her happy little family life .

he would n't do it if it were n't so important .

but the next step had to be done .

`` i have several houses lined up for us to walk through . ''

`` why would we look at houses ? ''

`` we discussed this a few nights ago , but you did n't want to accept it .

but siri , you have to understand that samuel and jacob can never be just normal boys .

i need them to be in a secure environment .

i ca n't let anything happen to them . ''
