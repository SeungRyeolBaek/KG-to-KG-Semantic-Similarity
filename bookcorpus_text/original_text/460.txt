zayn grinned .

`` we 'd bribe him with other stuff , just so he would n't chase us away until we had cookies . ''

this was news to ella .

`` what did you bribe him with ? ''

she asked , fascinated by this new revelation .

zayn shrugged one shoulder .

`` whatever he needed .

one time , he just needed a lawn mower engine .

so we got it for him .

another time , dominic knew that his son was sick .

it was pretty easy to get him the amoxicillin he could n't afford . ''

ella 's mouth dropped open with that confession .

`` where did you get the medicine ? ''

she asked , leaning forward so her elbows were resting on the table , eager to hear more about this secret conspiracy .

`` we stole it , of course .

we did n't have any money back then . ''

her eyes widened .

`` you stole it ? ''

she gasped .

`` from whom ? ''

zayn shook his head .

`` oh no .

i 've told you enough of our secret , past life .

that 's all gone now .

and everyone turned out happy . ''

she could n't let it drop .

`` but you , dominic and angelo stole things ?

i looked up to you !

i thought the three of you were heroes !

always showing up with whatever someone needed whenever they needed it .

you stole the pain killers for mr. miller too , did n't you ?

so he could get his hip surgery ? ''

zayn leaned back and layered his hands on his lap .

`` mr. miller helped dominic with a history test once .

we owed him . ''

`` we ? ''

she asked , but knew that those three were inseparable .

`` of course .

dominic was smart , but he hated history .

mr. miller helped him , well , all three of us actually , to understand why history was important . ''

`` so you stole pain medicine for him so he could get through his surgery more easily . ''

she shook her head , her admiration for him growing tenfold .

`` i ca n't believe you were a thief .

but a good one , i guess .

and for good reasons . ''

`` it was more of a reciprocal system , '' he said .

`` the guys who stole for money , they got caught . ''

`` but since you three did n't steal for money ... . ? ''

`` oh , we stole things for money as well .

we needed cash sometimes .

especially when we could n't steal the things we needed . ''

he gave her a half smile .

`` do n't put us on a pedestal , ella .

we were n't heroes .

just guys on the street trying to survive . ''

again , that dismissive shrug .

`` officer melton turned a blind eye on several occasions .

as did several of the other shopkeepers .

they knew that we 'd help them out if they 'd just look the other way when we took something off of their trucks .

we only did that to the shopkeepers who had insurance though , or the ones who were receiving stolen property themselves .

or who we could give them something else they needed . ''

she considered his words .

`` so it was like a bartering system , more than theft . ''

he chuckled at her soft-hearted attempt to color his actions as noble .

`` if that makes you feel better about what we did , then you can call it a bartering system . ''

she could n't believe he was being so casual about his start in life .

`` what happened to you all those years ago ? ''

she asked , deciding a change in subject was better than pursuing the previous one .

`` why did you disappear so suddenly ? ''

she suspected that zayn would continue to picture his own actions as evil while the rest of the neighborhood considered him someone much more chivalrous .

she preferred to think of zayn as the robin hood type of man versus the mischief maker zayn sees in his past .

`` i 'll tell you , but you have to give me what i asked for first .

if you could do anything as a career , what would you do ? ''

he asked .

he thought she was sweetly naive , but with a hard shell of wisdom and cynicism .

ella bit her lower lip , her eyes glancing up at the ceiling to consider his question .

`` you 're asking something that is n't very easy to answer .

i do n't have a dream job so much as things i would like to do more often . ''

`` such as ? ''

`` well , now that you brought it up , i loved making cookies and other baked goods .

although i do n't know if i 'd be very good at it since my mother was the one who had all the skill and recipes . ''

his eyes widened .

`` please tell me that you know what she put into her chocolate chip cookies , '' he growled .

ella laughed at his stern expression .

`` yes .

i know what her secret ingredient was . ''

he waited for a long moment , looking at her and then grinned .

`` but you 're not going to tell me , are you ? ''

he asked .

she looked back at him aghast , her hand delicately covering her neck .

`` absolutely not !
