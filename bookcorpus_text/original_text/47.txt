`` i 'm sorry , '' he said .

`` it 's okay .

it was worth it to see your o face . ''

she smiled dreamily at him .

`` god , you were beautiful . ''

since he 'd never had a woman tell him that , he could n't help flushing .

he pulled away from her to search for something to clean her up with .

finally , he found a roll of paper towels .

when he returned to her , he gently wiped himself off her skin .

after he finished , he helped her down off the counter .

`` i 'll go out first .

i need to clean up .

and so do you . ''

he gave a brief nod .

he was having trouble processing all the emotions swirling through his mind .

`` so when it is ? ''

she asked .

`` when is what ? ''

he asked dumbly .

he was still far too obliterated by a simple hand job to be processing coherent thoughts .

`` our date . ''

he had almost forgotten what he asked of her .

out of the heat of the moment , he felt guilty for what he had done .

he shook his head .

`` no , i was n't being fair .

you do n't owe me a date . ''

`` yes , i do .

i always keep my promises . ''

`` you 're really going to go out with me ? ''

she grinned .

`` of course i am . ''

his heartbeat sped up .

`` are you off this saturday ? ''

`` yes . ''

`` you do n't have plans ? ''

`` no , i do n't . ''

`` and you can get someone to watch your son ? ''

`` yessss , '' she replied , with a smile .

`` okay , then let 's do it saturday . ''

`` do what exactly ? ''

`` the date . ''

she laughed .

`` yes , but what are we doing ? ''

`` it 's a surprise . ''

tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously .

`` i 'm not sure i like the sound of that . ''

`` i promise you 'll like it . ''

`` what should i wear for this surprise date ? ''

already the wheels had been turning in his head .

since it might be his only chance , he knew he wanted to make the date as special as he could .

`` wear something dressy .

we might be going somewhere that requires more formal wear than jeans . ''

`` okay , i think i can do that . ''

at the sound of his pager , he grimaced .

`` guess i 'll be the one leaving first . ''

without hesitating , he bowed his head to kiss her .

just like before , the feel of her mouth against his lit him on fire .

reluctantly , he pulled away .

`` go wash up first . ''

her breath warmed his cheek before she glanced up into his eyes .

`` i can taste myself on you . ''

he closed his eyes as a shudder went through his body .

`` you 're trying to kill me . ''

she flashed him a wicked grin .

`` sorry .

it 's the truth . ''

`` behave yourself , '' he replied , before he headed to the door .

chapter fourteen with less than ten minutes before pesh was set to arrive for their date , megan found herself a neurotic mess still holed in the bathroom .

she 'd changed outfits at least three times before deciding on a black and white lace dress that came just to her knees .

it had actually come out of the back of her closet-one of the tamer remnants of her wilder days .

pesh had told her to wear something dressy , and it did fall into the dressy category , although it was probably a little sexier than she would have liked .

while she 'd pulled her long hair back into a loose knot at the back of her neck , she was now rethinking her strategy .

if she 'd left her hair down , it would cover more of the exposed skin that the spaghetti straps and neck of the dress showed .

glancing at her phone one more time , she cringed .

`` fuck it , '' she muttered , before spritzing on some perfume .

after the fragrant cloud faded , she headed out of the bathroom .

she grabbed her purse and headed upstairs .

when she came into the kitchen , a loud , cat-calling whistle pierced her ear .

she scowled at sean .

`` seriously ? ''

he shrugged .

`` you look hot , sis . ''

gavin , who stood beside sean at the counter , nodded .

`` we never see you in anything but scrubs . ''

megan could n't help smiling at her brothers .

`` thank you . ''

wagging his brows , gavin asked , `` got a hot date , huh ? ''

`` not exactly , '' she replied , as she went to grab her purse .

`` yeah right , '' he mumbled under his breath .

after slinging her purse on her shoulder , she whirled around to pin him with her stare .

`` and what 's that supposed to mean ? ''

`` it means that chicks do n't get dressed up like that for nothing .

you obviously want to impress this guy .

so , it 's obviously a hot date . ''

`` since when did you become the love guru ? ''
