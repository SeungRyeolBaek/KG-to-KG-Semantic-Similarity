`` do not speak that way about megan ever again .

do you hear me ? ''

`` and do you really feel that she thinks you 're worth throwing her career away for ? ''

pesh closed the gap between them .

looming over kara , his entire body shuddered in anger .

`` listen to me when i say that if you threaten to expose megan one more time , i will make life a living hell for you .

as the supervising physician over the er , i can have you shipped off to some hellhole far from here . ''

he glared down at her .

`` do you understand me ? ''

she slowly nodded her head as the realization that there was nothing between them finally dawned on her .

`` if you 'll excuse me , i need to go clean my exam room . ''

as she hurried past him , pesh exhaled a breath of relief .

he never used that tone of voice with women , or men for that matter , unless he was absolutely pushed to do so .

but kara 's previous behavior and the way she 'd acted today had forced him to become what he was n't .

at the feel of a hand on his back , he whirled around .

megan gave him a beaming smile .

`` my hero ! ''

he laughed at her expression and words .

`` you do n't have to worry about her harassing you or me for that matter .

i took care of things . ''

`` i heard you . ''

he grimaced .

`` you did ? ''

she nodded .

`` it was amazing . ''

`` i 'm glad you thought so . ''

`` i 've never had a man take up for me like that before . ''

pesh shook his head .

`` that 's a shame . ''

`` if we were n't in the middle of the er 's hallway , i 'd kiss you to show my gratitude . ''

he smiled .

`` i 'll gladly take a rain check . ''

`` oh you will ?

that 's good to know . ''

lowering his voice , he said , `` i 'll expect that kiss later tonight when we 're alone .

and i do n't just want it on the lips . ''

his brows rose .

`` i want it on several places on my body . ''

megan grinned .

`` i think that can be arranged . ''

`` i 'll be looking forward to it . ''

`` dr .

nadeen ? ''

a nurse called from the top of the hall .

`` yes ? ''

`` you 're needed in rxam room four . ''

`` as soon as i finish this patient consultation , i 'll be there , '' he replied .

at his blatant lie , megan covered her mouth to hide her giggling .

`` i have to go .

but can i come over tonight ? ''

`` yep .

let me get mason fed and bathed , and then i 'm yours . ''

`` see you later . ''

he winked at her before he turned and started down the hall .

a few nights later pesh found himself speeding along the quiet streets of megan 's neighborhood .

his phone dinged once again .

slowing down , he took a peek to make sure it was n't the hospital .

he was n't too surprised to find it was another text from megan .

he could tell from the way she had been frantically texting him that afternoon and evening that she was nervous , which was totally surprising to him .

she was so strong and fearless that it was hard for him to imagine her ever feeling nervous .

but he supposed that in megan 's mind she had good cause to be nervous as tonight he was introducing her to his family .

after he picked her up , they were going to his sister , shveta 's , house for dinner .

his parents , along with at least one of his brothers , would be there .

although he had spent a lot of time with her family , it had n't quite meant the same thing as her spending time with his .

he did n't know if her nerves stemmed from simply meeting his family or if they were from the fear of how far their relationship had progressed in the last few months .

he turned into the driveway at ten after seven .

he did n't even get up the front porch steps before the door flew open , and megan rushed out .

her diminutive figure wobbled a little on the black high heels she was sporting .

she wore black pants , and a dressy red top that had a lot of beading .

it reminded him of the kurta , a style that women from his culture wore .

he wondered if she had chosen it for that reason .

`` you look beautiful , '' pesh murmured , leaning in to kiss her tenderly .

when she did n't warm to his touch , he gazed down at her .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

rolling her eyes , she snapped .

`` duh , i 'm really nervous . ''

`` you 're really that worried about my family 's opinion of you ? ''

she threw up her hands .

`` of course , i am .

your family is very important to you .

i do n't want ... '' she tore her gaze from his .

`` you do n't want what ? ''

he pressed .

`` i do n't want to bring shame to you . ''
