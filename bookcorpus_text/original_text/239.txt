we do n't talk about that too much , either .

there 's a little town center with shops and cafes down the shore a little ways , and emerson lets me take my time window shopping .

i 'm not much for designers or labels , but i love vintage and handmade things .

there 's one store in particular that i go nuts for-a local artist 's shop that 's chock full of gorgeous , eclectic jewelry and handicrafts .

i fall in love with one piece especially-a slender silver ring the bears a single pearl .

it 's so elegant , so simple ... and unfortunately out of my price range .

but still , a girl can dream .

we spend the day wandering around the sleepy beach town , grabbing ice cream and coffee later on , sitting on the sand together , daring to dunk our toes in the still-icy water .

i field a few texts from riley , who claims `` i told you so '' right when i let her in on the real nature of my and emerson 's beach escape .

`` remember protection , '' she texts me , `` and call immediately after this is not a drill . ''

`` i promise to call you the second i get off , '' i reply , `` maybe even during , if you 're lucky . ''

`` do not play with my emotions , lady , '' riley warns me .

though i 'm more than excited for the night to finally arrive , i do feel a slight nervousness starting to trip me up .

i have n't really been with a guy since what happened with tucker all those years ago .

even though my memories of that night with him are hazy , i start to worry about flashbacks , or even just bad vibes .

obviously , emerson is nothing like tucker , and tonight will be nothing like the night of my assault .

but still , i ca n't help but be a tiny bit anxious .

tonight 's dinner is even more delectable than the last .

emerson takes me to a little italian place in town with the best pesto i 've tasted ... maybe ever .

after we 've polished off the last bites of birthday tiramisu , it 's time at last to head back to our room .

as if sensing the hush of anticipation , emerson cranks up the tunes on the way to the motel .

the postal service serenades us all the way back , and i hurry to throw on some iron and wine from my laptop the second we 're back in the room .

awkward silences are n't so terrible when sam beam croons over them , it turns out .

emerson and i both shuck off our outer layers , and he moves to open up a second bottle of champagne .

`` thanks , '' i tell him , accepting a cup of champagne and taking a generous swig .

`` just let me freshen up a little , i 'll be right out . ''

`` take your time , '' he tells me , his eyes lingering on his face .

he can tell something is a little off , but is nice enough not to say anything outright .

i duck into the bathroom , drinking down the rest of my champagne and studying myself in the mirror .

`` you can do this , '' i whisper , coaching myself through my nerves , `` you 've wanted this for years .

since before anything even happened with tucker .

emerson is amazing , and he cares about you , and ... and ... '' `` everything ok in there ? ''

emerson asks at the door .

`` yep ! ''

i reply , my voice an octave higher than it usually is , `` totally fine ! ''

`` abby , '' he says , in a voice that tells me he knows the truth , `` do you want to talk ? ''

sighing , i turn and gently pull open the bathroom door .

`` come on in , '' i say , trying to play off my embarrassment as i turn and sit on the edge of the tub .

`` so .

what 's going on up there ? ''

he asks , glancing up at my head .

`` tell me . ''

`` i 'm just ... it 's ... ''

i stammer , blushing as i try to string the words together .

`` we 've been talking about this all week .

you know .

the thing we decided to do today ... '' `` oh , i know all about the thing , '' emerson smiles .

`` and i still really want ... the thing to happen , '' i stumble ahead , `` but i 'm sort of out of practice .

i 've only ever done this once before , and that was n't such a great experience .

and i know it wo n't always be like that , but you actually know what you 're doing , and- '' `` hey , hey , '' emerson says , wrapping an arm around me .

`` it 's ok , abby .

i understand completely .

you do n't have to keep anything from me , you know that . ''

`` i guess i do , '' i say quietly .

`` look , '' emerson says , taking my face in his hand , `` i 'm crazy about you , abby .

and i always will be .

now , because this world is a shitty , unfair place , we do n't have always .

because tomorrow , our parents are swooping in to fuck everything up .
