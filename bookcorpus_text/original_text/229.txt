so , yes .

this is me telling you that i want you , abby .

i want to be with you .

i want us to have each other , if only once in our lives .

i 'm suggesting that we give ourselves that before it 's too late .

you can tell me i 'm nuts , or to go fuck myself , or whatever you like .

but i have to at least tell you ... that that 's what i want . ''

`` well , emerson , '' i say , struggling to take a deep breath , `` that 's convenient .

because i ... want that ... too . ''

we stare at each other for a long moment before bursting into uproarious laughter .

gut-bursting , tension-relieving , hysterical laughter that almost sends us both toppling off the platform at once .

i throw my arms around emerson 's shoulders as we both roar at the insane , absurd hilarity of this whole situation .

a wave of relief crashes through me as laugher wracks my body .

god , it feels good to let some of this pressure release .

`` that might be the most awkward thing i 've ever said in my life ! ''

i crow , wiping tears from my eyes .

`` this may be the most awkward conversation that 's ever occurred between two people , '' emerson replies , `` 'hey , i know you 're about to be my sister , but i really want to do you . ' ''

that sets us off again .

we collapse into each other until we end up lying on our backs , chests heaving , staring up at the stars .

our hands are clasped , our smiles wide .

despite the crapiness of the whole situation , here we are together .

on the same page .

`` promise me it will happen , '' i say to him .

`` promise me that on my birthday , we 'll get to be together .

the way we want to be . ''

`` i promise , '' emerson says , giving me a sweet , chaste kiss on the forehead .

`` but .

um .

i hope you do n't mind if i ask another sort of awkward question , '' emerson goes on , his fingers tightening ever-so-slightly .

`` shoot , '' i tell him , turning my head his way .

`` well .

you know , i 'm no novice , when it comes to sex , '' he begins , delightfully blunt as ever .

`` i 've been with a few girls in my time .

but in your case ... i guess what i mean is ... have you ever ... ? ''

my smiles fades at once as i jerk my face away from his .

he senses my entire body tense up in the wake of his question .

`` shit , '' he groans , `` that was so stupid of me- '' `` no , '' i cut him off , steeling myself for what i have to say , now .

`` no , it was n't stupid .

it 's just ... not an easy question for me to answer .

that does n't mean i 'm not going to , it 's just ... bear with me . ''

he squeezes my hand , but does n't say a word .

i take a breath and go on .

`` i was going to tell you this earlier .

when we were trading secrets .

i wanted to explain what happened at the diner tonight , but i was afraid that you ... anyway .

the short answer to your question is , yes , i 've had sex before .

the slightly longer answer is that i did n't really want to .

did n't want to at all , actually . ''

`` oh , abby ... '' emerson says , his voice as soft as i 've ever heard it .

`` do you mean- ? ''

`` it was back in freshman year , '' i go on , plowing ahead before i lose my nerve .

`` i was sort of a late bloomer , so i was really only beginning to get attention from some guys at our school .

there was one in particular that i 'd had a crush on since about kindergarten .

he and i were at the other middle school , not yours .

anyway , he teased me pretty mercilessly through eighth grade-for being smart , for always having my nose in a sketchbook , all that .

but come high school , that teasing gave way to flirting .

and we started , uh , hanging out .

right when my mom died , he was still sort of in the picture .

we were n't dating or anything , but we were spending time together .

i went over to his place one night when my dad was wasted , just to get out of the house for a minute .

his parents were away , so it was just us .

he 'd broken into his dad 's liquor cabinet and offered me something to drink .

said it would make me feel better .

i had some booze , he gave me more .

he over-poured my drinks .

i got drunk .

then he started touching me , pushing me further than we 'd been before .

by then , we 'd only really kissed .

but he was feeling me up , trying to undress me .

i told him to stop , i was too wasted to enjoy it , to want it .

but he kept on me .

said that would make me feel better , too .
