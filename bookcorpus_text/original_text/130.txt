all the way in the car i sat away from her while she kept shooting me furtive looks .

i kept my face straight ahead and my fists clenched as they hung between my thighs .

if i did anything else i 'm afraid i might strangle her ass .

as soon as we got through the doors of home i grabbed her arm and headed for the bedroom and straight to where i kept the belt i used to wail her ass .

`` stop trace you ca n't . ''

she tried to pulling away from me which only enraged me more .

i grabbed the belt and was about to bring it down over her ass , not even waiting to get her undressed i was so pissed .

`` i 'm pregnant . ''

well f**k , that sure stopped me in my tracks .

`` what did you say ? ''

`` you ca n't spank me , i 'm pregnant . ''

i dropped the belt and stared down at her .

there was something strange going on with my heart .

it was beating yes , but the rhythm was off somehow .

i felt a buzzing in my ears and i thin i lost sight there for a second .

`` you 're pregnant ? ''

i pulled her around to stand in front of me .

she nodded and looked down at her feet .

`` why did n't you tell me ? ''

`` i just found out , i was going to tell you , then i asked you that question this morning and you blew me off . ''

the memory seemed to renew her anger and she glared at me .

`` i was n't about to try to trap you with a baby , i do n't want to marry someone who does n't really want me for me , i 've had one ass**le in my life already . ''

i grabbed her neck and lifted her off her feet .

`` i told you never to throw that f**ker in my face .

just because you 're carrying my child do not think for one minute that i wo n't heat your little ass up .

`` what the f**k ever gave you the idea that i did n't want to marry you ? ''

`` you said ... '' she raised her voice and started to yell .

`` watch your f**king tone , you 're skating on thin f**king ice .

what the f**k ever gave you the idea that i 'm the kinda man who needs his woman to propose to him ?

that 's my place , not f**king yours no matter what some feminist new age f**k says . ''

`` well it did n't look like you were gon na ask , now if you do , i 'll always know it was only because of your precious child . ''

i dragged her into the closet and over to the safe i kept hidden there .

it took me a few tries to get the combination i was that f**king pissed .

opening the safe i retrieved the little velvet box i 'd kept there for months .

`` i bought this two days after we met .

i was waiting for you to be finished with this before giving it to you .

`` trace i ... '' `` save it , i told you once i wo n't pay for what that ass**le did to you .

not that that 's clear let 's talk about that shit you pulled tonight . ''

`` i thought you did n't want me , i thought ... '' `` so you thought to get back at me by doing something that was sure to piss me off .

just a warning for the future babe , you do not ever want to piss me off .

i 'll be lenient with you when it comes to certain things , but outright disobedience will not be acceptable , not now not ever .

`` you want me to leave your ass you pull a stunt like this again .

if i say no it means f**king no do you hear me ? ''

`` yes . ''

she mumbled .

`` i 'm sorry . ''

`` you 're too f**king spoilt for your own good .

i 'm not sure if i should let this slide , but i do n't want the news of my child 's conception to be marred by this f**kery , and since you 've spoiled my proposal you can live with that shit . ''

i took the box from her hand and put the five-carat diamond on her finger .

this was not how i 'd wanted this to go .

i 'd had everything planned out .

i was going to take her to paris since that was her favorite place and propose to her there in one of their over priced swanky restaurants .

that 's not my style but it 's hers so i was willing to do it to make the night special .

i did n't make love to her that night .

not because of any punishment or anything like that , i think i was just overwhelmed a little if you wan na know the truth .

i 'd gone from extremely pissed and ready to heat up her ass , to learning that i was going to be a daddy or a dad .

instead i helped her get ready for bed and held her as she gave into the fatigue of the long day and night .

once again i recalled my childhood , the always wanting , never having and never any hope of having .

and the hunger , humiliation , all the things you can expect from a young boy whose parents neglected him .
