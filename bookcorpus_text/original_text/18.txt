`` i texted my mother to tell her i was staying the night at emma 's . ''

before he could say anything , she quickly added , `` thank you for putting my purse in the bathroom .

that was very thoughtful of you . ''

`` you 're welcome , '' he replied .

then he thought of her text .

`` so you 're staying at aidan and emma 's ? ''

after all , the last thing he needed was to have her here-a reminder of what he could n't have .

it would be enough to drive any man crazy .

megan shook her head .

`` do you mind if i stayed here instead ? ''

when he started to open his mouth , she shook her head .

`` i promise no funny business .

i just do n't want to go home yet .

if you do n't want to me to stay , you can take me to emma 's . ''

`` of course you can stay . ''

`` i can sleep on the couch or in the guest room . ''

he shook his head .

`` you 'll sleep right here . ''

he walked over to his massive king-sized bed .

he turned down the covers before glancing back at her .

`` come on .

getting some rest will make you feel better . ''

she eyed him hesitantly .

`` i really ca n't take your bed .

that would be imposing . ''

`` i do n't mind .

i promise . ''

`` only if you 're sure ? ''

`` i 'm sure . ''

tentatively , she started walking over to him , her eyes never leaving his .

she eased down onto the mattress before sliding beneath the sheets .

when she appeared comfortable , he covered her up .

as he started to go , she reached out to grab his arm .

`` no , please do n't go .

do n't leave me alone . ''

his brows shot up in surprise .

`` you want me to stay with you ? ''

`` yes , please . ''

`` in this bed ... with you ? ''

when she nodded , he exhaled a ragged breath .

`` megan , i do n't think that 's a good idea . ''

`` do n't overthink it ; just stay with me . ''

although his brain was raging war at him to make the sane and responsible decision , he replied , `` give me a few minutes . ''

`` okay , '' she replied softly .

turning , he strode into the bathroom .

he did n't bother glancing in the mirror because he was pretty sure he would n't like what he saw .

instead , he stripped off his suit and tie .

although he probably should have thrown on more clothes , he left his boxers on and grabbed a white shirt off the hamper .

after pulling it over his head , he went back out into the bedroom .

megan lay on her side in the bed , her face turned toward the bathroom .

her eyes were closed , but they popped open the moment he entered the bedroom .

without a word to her , he walked around the other side of the bed and climbed inside .

lying on his back , he propped one arm over his head .

his other hand rested on his chest .

he twisted his fingers into the fabric of his shirt over his heart .

somehow he wanted to still the erratic beating .

just when he thought he might be comfortable , megan turned over to face him .

`` you 're so far away , '' she whispered .

`` i thought it was for the best . ''

the corners of her mouth momentarily turned down in a pout .

then she inched closer to him .

he sucked in a breath and tried not to hiss when he felt her head nuzzle against his chest .

before he could stop her , she had thrown an arm around him .

thankfully , she did n't try anything else .

and within a few minutes , her labored breathing signaled she had fallen asleep .

pesh stared up at the ceiling and willed himself to be able to go to sleep as easily .

surprisingly , as megan 's soft snores echoed against his side , his eyes grew heavy .

for the first time in two years , he fell asleep with someone in his arms .

chapter six sunlight streamed across megan 's face , causing her to squint her eyes tighter closed against the bright invasion .

she was warm and comfortable , and she did n't want to wake up .

but the tranquility of her morning was shattered when a soft snore came from behind her .

it was far too deep to be one of mason 's .

panic prickled its way up her skin .

where am i ?

her eyes frantically scanned the room .

overcome by both masculine decor and smells , she realized she was in a man 's bedroom , or more importantly a man 's bed .

she had n't woken up this dazed and confused since she got hammered for the first time .

she could n't even remember what day it was .

this was bad .

very , very bad .

she had to get out of there and get home to mason .

what kind of mother was she to wake up in a strange man 's bed ?

as she tried to roll over , she found herself entrapped by a strong arm wrapped around her waist .

her gaze flicked down to the tan , muscled arm .
