`` thank you , '' she said .

`` what happened , mary ? ''

victoria asked , forgetting about dharr 's presence for the moment .

`` i 'm just silly , '' she sniffed .

`` today is my father 's bowling night and ... . '' she broke down in tears but struggled valiantly .

eventually , victoria just held her again , letting the little girl cry out her grief .

after another five minutes , mary sniffed and took a tissue out of her pocket .

`` thank you , ms. mason .

i 'll be fine now , '' she said and dried her eyes .

`` come on back if you need to , '' victoria said , getting down on her knees so she was more at mary 's level .

`` just do n't keep it inside , okay ? ''

mary nodded and left , all without seeing or even sensing dharr standing in the corner of the office looking on .

`` what happened to her ? ''

he asked .

victoria snapped out of it and turned to face dharr , the tears still in her eyes .

`` her father died recently .

she 's having a hard time of it . ''

victoria was n't angry anymore now that mary had come in to diffuse the situation .

she 'd reminded victoria of what was important .

dharr was n't on that list .

not anymore .

there was a time she would have turned her life upside down to please him .

she had in fact .

but not anymore .

`` what do you want , your highness , '' she asked again , taking up right where they 'd been interrupted .

`` how did you find out ? ''

he asked .

her eyes widened .

`` that you 're the bloody king of ashir and not some lowly oil lease negotiator ? ''

she demanded , getting angry about his deception even after five years .

dharr ignored the 'bloody ' and nodded his head .

`` yes , that would be the question . ''

`` what 's the difference ? ''

she asked .

`` why do n't you just tell me what you want and then leave ? ''

`` i need your help , '' he stated .

victoria wanted to laugh but looking at him , she knew that would n't be a good idea .

`` no . ''

`` you do n't even know what i need , '' he said firmly .

`` should n't you wait to find out before you turn me down ? ''

`` no .

if i remember correctly , you did n't need me five years ago , so why should you need me now ? ''

dharr lifted a large envelope and pulled out two pictures .

`` okay , if you wo n't help me , will you help them ? ''

he asked , tossing the pictures down onto the desk in front of her .

victoria picked up the first one , noting the bright , sunny face and the twinkle in the little girl 's face .

she looked mischievous , victoria thought .

she flipped the page and a boy looked out at her from the paper .

he was too serious , she thought .

it was as if the weight of the world were on his tiny shoulders already .

`` they 're cute , '' she said , pushing the pictures back at him .

`` they 're in trouble , '' he replied .

that got her attention .

`` why ?

the boy maybe but the girl seems happy . ''

`` those pictures were taken six months ago .

their parents died a week after those pictures were taken .

since then , they 've become more and more withdrawn .

i 'm worried about them . ''

`` who is their closest relative ?

they should take care of them . ''

`` i 'm their uncle . ''

he stepped around the desk , skirting a precarious pile of papers .

`` why do n't you hire someone to file ? ''

he asked absently ?

`` they are n't real papers .

the untidiness makes the children feel more comfortable .

i think they are all old test papers from about a decade ago . ''

dharr nodded his head .

`` that only confirms my instincts that i need you . ''

`` go hire an expert . ''

`` i intend to .

when can you start ? ''

`` i 'm not an expert in grief counseling . ''

`` you understand children .

and mary just revealed that you are an expert in grief counseling .

she seems like she 's adjusting quite well . ''

he looked at his watch and stood up .

`` i have to leave for germany in an hour .

i can be back here to pick you up in three days .

will that be enough time ?

the children will be out of school by then so there should n't be any problem . ''

victoria stuttered out her outrage .

`` no problems ? ''

she countered .

`` how about my life ?

how about my plans for the future ?

as of this morning , you and your problems did n't factor into them at all . ''

`` of course there will be compensation , '' he said and bent over her desk .

he wrote down a number on a piece of paper .

`` if the children are n't any enticement , '' he said , `` this should do the trick , '' he said .

`` there are other pictures in the envelope .

i 'll be in touch , '' he said and left the tiny office without another word .
