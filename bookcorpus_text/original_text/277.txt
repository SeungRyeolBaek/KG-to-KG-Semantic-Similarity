`` for starters , '' he says , brushing a lock of hair out of my face , `` i 'm going to open another bottle of wine .

helps me think . ''

he offers me his hand and pulls me off the couch , towing me back to the kitchen island .

`` have you talked to your grandparents yet ? ''

he asks me , selecting a bottle of merlot to start with .

`` no , '' i say faintly , burying my face in my hands .

`` i do n't know what the hell i 'd even say to them . ''

`` say they 're a couple of assholes who should fuck right off , '' emerson shrugs , fetching a wine opener .

`` i do n't want them to fuck off , '' i exclaim , `` they 're my family , emerson .

why ca n't you understand that that 's important to me ? ''

`` maybe because i know just how badly family can mess you up , '' he replies , popping out the cork .

`` you think i do n't know that ? ''

i ask .

`` if you do , you seem to have forgotten , '' he remarks , taking two wine glasses down from the cupboard .

`` maybe i 'm just not ready to give up on my family so easily , '' i say without thinking .

emerson pauses with his back to me , his shoulders going stiff .

`` what is that supposed to mean , abby ? ''

he asks , his voice deathly quiet .

`` just that i 've never been the type of person who cuts and runs on the people who care about her , '' i say , wavering in my stance .

`` and i am ? ''

he asks , irate as he turns to face me .

`` i was my mother 's nurse for years while my father was away .

i 'd probably still be taking care of her if she 'd ever gotten well enough for outpatient treatment again . ''

`` i know , emerson , '' i say , edging away from his rage .

after the flare of anger i saw go through him at the office today , i do n't want to provoke him any further .

`` for fuck 's sake , i had to raise my mother , rather than have her raise me , '' emerson fumes , clutching the edge of the counter .

his knuckles go white with the force of his grip .

`` i did n't mean to upset you , '' i tell him , trying to keep my voice calm , `` i know how much you sacrificed for your mom .

but you know better than anyone how painful it is , having your family not be there for you .

cutting my grandparents out of my life should be easy , but it 's not for me . ''

`` it 's not like they 're giving you much of a choice , '' emerson says .

`` i just have to figure out a way to get through to them , '' i say shaking my head , `` without this job , i 'm going to need a place to stay , at least for a little while . ''

`` you have a place to stay , '' emerson replies quizzically , `` right here . ''

`` i know you 're letting me stay here tonight , '' i tell him , `` but i mean long term , emerson . ''

`` maybe i mean long term too , abby , '' he shoots back , his anger fading to determination .

`` what are you talking about ? ''

i ask him , `` you 're not even staying here long term .

you 're going back to london at the end of the week . ''

`` only if i decide to keep my job at bastian , '' he says .

i stare at him , jaw hanging out .

`` you 're not seriously considering quitting ? ''

i ask , `` that job is once-in-a-lifetime .

bastian is the best in the field .

you ca n't walk away from that . ''

`` sure i can , '' he challenges me , stepping around the island toward me , `` after the way cooper disrespected us this morning ?

why would i want to stay ? ''

`` no , '' i say , `` no , emerson .

you ca n't leave that agency on my account . ''

`` and why not ? ''

he demands , placing his hands on my hips .

`` because , '' i splutter , staring up at him , `` i ca n't ... that 's too much pressure !

i ca n't be responsible for you losing your job . ''

`` i 'm responsible for you losing yours , '' he points out .

`` yeah .

but , '' i stammer , resting my hands on his firm chest .

`` i was doing perfectly well before bastian hired me , '' emerson says , `` i can do perfectly well without them now . ''

`` but what if you start resenting me ?

you know ... for making you leave ? ''

i ask , unable to meet his gaze .

`` that would never happen , '' he says , turning my face toward his .

`` you do n't know that , '' i insist .

`` yes i do , '' he says , his eyes flashing angrily .

`` i know myself , abby .

i know what i care about .

and what i care about above all is you .
