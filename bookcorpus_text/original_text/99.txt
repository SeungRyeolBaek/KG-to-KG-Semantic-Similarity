we 've got a big party for you there . ''

mason 's face lit up .

`` ice cweam ?

`` oh yes , there 's lots of ice cream just for you . ''

`` yay ! ''

he cried .

when they drove up at patrick 's , megan did a double take at the sight of an inflatable bouncy castle out on the lawn .

john , percy , and georgie were already making good use of it .

`` emma , the party planning monster has struck again , '' she mused .

pesh chuckled as he got out of the car .

he went to get mason while she started into the house .

balloons and flowers filled the foyer and living room .

over the dining room archway , there was a giant congratulations mason sign .

when she got to the kitchen , she sucked in a breath at the sight of all the catering pans .

`` emma fitzgerald , what have you done ? ''

she questioned .

at the sound of megan 's voice , emma jumped .

clutching her chest , she whirled around .

`` okay , so maybe i found a really excellent deal on the bouncy castle .

like ridiculously cheap . ''

megan crossed her arms over her chest .

`` the food ?

i thought mom and my aunts were cooking . ''

holding up one hand , emma replied , `` just williamson brothers bbq .

nothing fancy . ''

`` anything else i need to know about ?

live band or celebrity bursting out of a cake ? ''

emma giggled .

`` nope .

that 's it . ''

megan watched emma bustle around the kitchen , setting up the plates and cutlery .

`` um , is there anything i can do ?

i mean , i feel pretty shitty considering this is my son 's adoption party , '' megan said , with a smile .

pink tinged emma 's cheeks .

`` i 'm sorry . ''

megan threw her arms around emma and squeezed her tight .

`` do n't be sorry .

you 're amazing to do all of this for us . ''

emma smiled .

`` you 're more than welcome .

i 'm so happy for you and pesh and for mason . ''

`` thank you . ''

when megan pulled away , emma said , `` oh , there is something you can do .

go tell aidan we 're about to start .

he went to get caroline up from her nap . ''

`` sure .

i 'll be happy to . ''

as megan started down the familiar hallway , she stopped outside of aidan 's boyhood bedroom .

through the crack in the door , she could see him walking around the room , bouncing caroline in his arms .

at the sound of his singing , she had to stifle a laugh .

ankle was many things , but a singer was n't one of them .

`` sweet caroline , dum , dum , dum .

good times never seemed so good , '' he crooned off-key .

when megan pushed open the door , aidan jumped .

`` um , hey , '' he said , a flush entering his cheeks .

`` i never really pictured you as a neil diamond fan , '' she said , with a smile .

`` yeah , well , sweet caroline seems like the right thing to sing to her . ''

he cleared his throat .

`` what are you doing in here ? ''

`` emma wanted me to come get you . ''

`` oh , '' he said .

in his arms , caroline began to whimper , her little fists flailed .

`` shh , it 's okay , sweet pea .

where was i ? ''

`` i 've been inclined , '' megan answered him .

`` right , '' he said , over caroline 's cries .

when he picked back up with the song , megan said , `` that 's really unfair to torture her like that . ''

as aidan scowled at megan , caroline began to quiet .

aidan 's expression then turned triumphant .

`` see ?

she likes it when i sing to her . ''

`` but you ca n't sing , '' megan protested .

aidan shrugged .

`` it does n't matter to her . ''

megan laughed .

`` she has a mother with a killer voice , yet she likes to listen to you ? ''

flashing his signature cocky grin , aidan replied , `` what can i say ?

all women love me . ''

with a roll of her eyes , megan said , `` give me a break . ''

glancing down at caroline , aidan said in a sing-song voice , `` do n't you have the sweetest , handsomest , and most wonderful daddy in the whole wide world ? ''

caroline cooed at his question and kicked her legs .

`` she 's a smart girl because she knows how lucky she is . ''

`` you 're terrible , '' megan said , with a grin .

aidan looked from his daughter over to megan .

`` you want to hold my most perfect little princess ? ''

`` i would love to . ''

she held out her arms as aidan passed caroline to her .

outfitted in a frilly purple dress and purple bow , caroline looked like she could be modeling baby wear .

unlike noah 's strawberry blond hair , hers was a deep auburn .

she had also inherited her mother 's green eyes .

`` i have to agree that you 're a lucky girl because you look just like your mother , '' megan said .
