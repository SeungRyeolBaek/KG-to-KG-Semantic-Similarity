i am very thankful for the amazing man you have raised . ''

lavani 's dark eyes filled with tears , and she brought a handkerchief up to dab her eyes .

`` thank you , my dear . ''

shveta stepped into the bathroom , her face lit up in a broad smile .

`` alpesh is here . ''

gathering up the bottom of her skirt , megan walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom .

her heart stopped at the sight of him .

she had never seen him in kurta-pajama , as they were called .

basically , it was a long , tunic like shirt that came to his knees .

underneath he wore loose cotton-like pants .

but his top was made much like hers .

it was gold in color and encrusted in gems and beading .

she did n't want to begin to imagine how much it cost .

when she brought her gaze back to his , she shivered under his heated stare .

`` you are a vision of absolute and total perfection , '' he said .

doing a little turn , the fabric of her sari twirled around her .

`` so you like it ? ''

he smiled .

`` i love it . ''

she laughed .

`` i feel a little like a poser .

like 'you can put the irish girl in a sari , but you ca n't take the irish out of the girl ' kinda thing . ''

`` i would n't have you any other way , '' he said , with a serious , yet tender tone .

`` thank you . ''

megan eyed the two velvet boxes in his hand .

`` ooh , let me see the goodies . ''

with a bark of a laugh , pesh sat one of the boxes down on the table before he opened the other .

megan gasped as two enormous earrings glittered back at her .

while there was a thick base , the rest flowed down in flourishing designs that would probably touch her shoulders when she put them on .

they had a gold overlaying , but all the gems were diamonds and amethysts that would match her sari .

`` this is why your mother and shveta wanted me to pick a purple sari ? ''

she questioned .

pesh nodded .

`` they 're breathtaking , '' she murmured .

`` wait until you see the necklace , '' he replied , with a smile .

her shaky hands reached forward to take one of the earrings .

she quickly worked the clasp and fastened it to her lobe .

then she did the other .

while they were so heavy she felt like they might weigh her down , she glanced up at pesh and smiled .

`` thank you . ''

`` you 're welcome , my love . ''

he reached for the other box .

megan 's eyes widened as the diamonds and deep amethysts sparkled in the light .

he took the necklace out and unfastened the clasp .

he moved behind her and then lifted the necklace over her head .

she closed her eyes at the pleasurable sensation of feeling his closeness .

`` there .

now you 're ready . ''

whirling around to face him , she brought her lips to his .

`` i love you . ''

his thumb tenderly rubbed her cheek .

`` i love you , too . ''

from the doorway of the bedroom , lavani tsked disapprovingly at them .

`` alpesh , stop mauling her , or you 're going to mess up her makeup ! ''

pesh chuckled .

`` i hardly think i was mauling her . ''

she waved her hand dismissively .

`` come now .

it 's time we went downstairs . ''

after pesh held out his arm for her , megan slid hers through his .

`` do n't be nervous , '' he murmured into her ear .

`` i 'm not , '' she lied .

`` megan , i know you well enough by now that i know when you 're nervous .

you fidget and bite your lip . ''

`` sorry , '' she muttered , as they got onto the elevator .

considering it was packed with pesh 's family , megan kept her mouth shut about her nerves .

the last thing she wanted to do was to come off wrong in front of them .

when the doors opened , she drew in a couple of deep breaths to still her nerves .

there was a whole lot of pomp and circumstance that she did n't quite understand about how they were all supposed to enter .

she just tried not to mess up the part when she came in with her parents .

just like at a wedding reception , she and pesh sat at a table at the head of the room .

of course , she had n't quite prepared herself for the golden chairs that looked almost like thrones .

once everyone was assembled , pesh 's father got up to speak .

`` we are very grateful that you all could be with us this evening .

i know that with megan 's friends and family , as well as some of our son 's , there are a lot of you unacquainted with our culture .

i will try to explain to you what the proceedings are . ''

on the table in front of them were two flower wreaths that reminded her of the leis that you would see in hawaii .

they were in colors of white , gold , and purple .

the wreaths crisscrossed over the black ring boxes .

she knew from what pesh had told her that they would be giving each other rings tonight to symbolize their future union .
