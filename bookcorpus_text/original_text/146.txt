i 'd love to go with you sometime .

fashion is like , my side hobby , and you have a stylist 's dream body . ''

`` i do n't think i- '' i begin my canned response to a shopping invitation before i realize that maybe i can afford it .

and constance looks so perfectly chic in her patterned cardigan and statement necklace .

`` you know , that would be wonderful .

i really do n't know what to buy . ''

`` oh , i can help you with that .

but careful not to wear anything too tight around mr. thornhill , '' she adds , rolling her eyes .

`` what do you mean ? ''

i ask with a frown .

`` oh my god , who is that ? ''

constance asks , breaking away from our conversation to stand and peer over our cubicle wall .

i join her to see nate and pierce walking down the hallway together toward the elevator bank .

they must be having lunch together .

`` that 's his son , '' i reply , immediately sitting down again .

`` he looks like a polo model ! ''

constance exclaims , sitting back down .

`` um , what were you saying about pierce-mr. thornhill-just then ? ''

`` well , i 've never had an issue , but maybe he 's just not into asian girls , '' she says , throwing her black hair over her shoulder carelessly .

`` from what i 've heard , though , he has a certain reputation . ''

`` oh , no , '' i reply , worriedly tugging on my hair .

shit .

shit .

i knew he was too good to be true .

`` do n't worry .

from what i 've heard , he 's pretty harmless , he 's just from a different generation when it comes to women around the office-especially young women , '' she adds .

`` mmhm , '' i reply , my mind already spiraling into crisis mode .

`` you ok , brynn ? ''

`` maybe he 's changed , though .

i mean , he 's married now , '' i say , clinging to a speck of hope .

`` yeah , i heard he got married . ''

she shrugs .

`` could be .

i do n't think it 's something that 's been really recent or anything . ''

i nod , feeling slightly mollified .

we both spin back to our computers as we hear footsteps approaching our cubicle .

i glance up to see pierce and nate appear in the opening .

`` brynn , this is going to sound awful , '' pierce begins , and i brace myself .

`` but nate and i had plans to go to lunch , and we got down to the lobby before i realized how rude it was not to invite you along . ''

phew .

for a second i thought he overheard our conversation .

`` oh , that 's so nice , but i actually have lunch plans with my best friend from school , anyway . ''

`` oh i see ... well , enjoy !

there are some great restaurants around here .

we just wanted to let you know you were invited , '' pierce says kindly , though from nate 's frown i 'm guessing that it was more his idea than his son 's .

`` constance , right ? ''

he says , turning to her .

`` yes , that 's right , '' she squeaks .

`` alright , well , we better get going or we 'll be late for our reservation .

see you at home ! ''

pierce says with a wave , and walks off with nate in tow .

huh .

i notice that nate did n't say a single word to me .

i guess he does n't like being the one left wanting for once .

`` why will mr. thornhill see you at home ? ''

constance says , slowly turning her desk chair to face me , a weird expression on her face .

`` um , well , i 'm his stepdaughter .

he just married my mom . ''

constance gasps and buries her face in her hands .

`` oh my god , oh my god , i 'm so fired .

i 'm fired , right ? ''

`` what ?

no !

i do n't have that kind of authority , i 'm just an intern , like you . ''

`` you 're the boss 's daughter , and i was just gossiping about him ! ''

`` step-daughter , and i get it .

if i 'd heard rumors like that , i might want to warn other women i work with , too . ''

`` but i do n't even know if they 're true , i 'm so sorry , '' she says miserably .

`` really , it 's ok. and i 'm sorry that i did n't tell you earlier that i 'm his stepdaughter .

i just ... you know , did n't want it to seem like it was the only reason i got the internship .

i mean , i really do work very hard . ''

`` of course you do !

of course .

yes .

i should get back to work , '' constance says , turning to her computer and beginning to type rapidly .

`` ... and now i 'm worried she 's going to keep acting really weird around me , '' i confide to allison over a caesar salad at clyde 's on m street .

`` do you think it 's true ? ''

she whispers , leaning over the table between us .
