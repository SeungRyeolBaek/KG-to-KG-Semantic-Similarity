`` i need to be alone for a little while , '' she murmurs , her gaze on the floor , and walks unsteadily toward the stairs .

i watch her leave , wishing she had the strength to comfort me for even a moment .

`` she 's just in shock , '' nate says , reading my mind like always .

`` i know , '' i reply with a nod , struggling to keep myself together .

`` i should have believed you . ''

`` i had no reason to lie . ''

`` i know .

i just could n't believe he was capable of that kind of thing , or maybe i did n't want to believe . ''

`` you said some awful things to me today .

god , was that just today ? ''

i ask with a sad laugh , reaching up to rub my forehead .

`` i 'm so sorry , brynn .

i was angry ... sometimes my temper ... i did n't mean any of those things .

the time we 've spent together- '' he says , taking a step toward me .

`` no , no .

i 'm not ready for that .

i do n't know if we can go back ... '' i murmur , a tear slipping down my face .

`` brynn , please , i ca n't lose you . ''

`` you were so ready to turn on me , '' i whisper .

`` so ready to push me away and be done with me . ''

`` i was in shock at seeing her again .

i did n't actually mean it . ''

`` but you said it , did n't you ?

the way i care about you ... i would never treat you that way , would never want you to hurt .

but you wanted me to hurt .

you do n't feel the way about me that i feel about you .

you ca n't . ''

`` that 's not true !

you have no idea how much i care about- '' `` i love you . ''

there 's a long silence .

i stare up into his beautiful face , my heart shattering as he does n't reply .

he just looks back down at me , some unknowable emotion flickering across his eyes .

`` well , there you go .

there you go .

goodbye , nate , '' i say , turning my back to him .

he does n't move .

`` what are you going to do ? ''

he finally asks quietly .

`` um , well , '' i begin with a cold laugh .

`` i think i 'm going to eat this cold grilled cheese sandwich , and then i 'm going to start packing . ''

chapter twenty-seven i survey my mom 's old beat-up station wagon .

both the car and our old house were just on the verge of being sold , but my mom was able to back out .

luckily she was taking her time in the process because she did n't think she had to worry about money anymore .

the car is n't even full-the only things that belonged to us here were our clothes and some knick-knacks .

it only took me a few hours this morning to pack it up .

it 's both sad and comforting .

our old life is still waiting for us , almost as though this whole summer never happened .

but of course it did .

i wondered last night if i would take these last few months back if i could .

if i were given a magic wand that could make it so that my mom had never met pierce , that i 'd returned to our old house for the summer , that my relationship with nate had never gone beyond that encounter in the crew house , would i wave it ?

i do n't know if i 've ever felt so much pain as i have recently , but also never so much happiness .

i was held in such a tight little shell before , never really experiencing the depths or heights of anything , and i suppose you ca n't have one without the other .

to never have held nate in my arms ... no , i ca n't imagine it .

despite so many terrible things having happened , i would never want to erase the time i spent with him , even if it would take away the pain i 'm feeling right now .

the pain that i can feel even in my bones , causing a throbbing ache throughout my whole body .

it 's like i 'm detoxing from some powerful , addictive substance .

one that i know only hurts me in the end .

i catch a glimpse of my slightly swollen lip in the car window from where pierce hit me last night .

we have n't seen him today-he must be holed up at a friend 's house or a hotel .

i do n't even want to think of the divorce proceedings that my mom will be wrapped up in now .

i hear the front door shut behind me and turn-will it be nate coming to say goodbye ?

but it 's my mom , carrying one last small suitcase , her eyes covered in large , round sunglasses .

`` ready ? ''

she asks , without looking at me .

i nod , then remember one last thing i 've forgotten .

`` i 'll be right back , '' i say , and hurry in through the front door without explanation .

i walk straight up the staircase and down the hall into my bedroom .

it looks exactly the same as the first time i saw it .
