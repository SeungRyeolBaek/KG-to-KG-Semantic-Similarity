`` i kinda got carried away .

with me not working anymore , the old marketing and pr side of me let loose .

and with my connections , i was able to get everything ridiculously discounted . ''

megan smiled .

`` everything looks wonderful .

you waited so long to have a baby that it makes sense you might go a little overboard . ''

emma wrinkled her nose .

`` i never wanted to be one of those moms who threw the over-the-top parties . ''

while casey started to open her mouth , megan smacked her playfully .

`` it 's just catered in food , right ? ''

emma nodded .

`` they did the tables , too . ''

`` then i think you 're safe from being a momzilla party monster ... for now . ''

casey laughed .

`` i 'll anxiously be awaiting noah 's first birthday party . ''

with a scowl , emma mumbled , `` whatever . ''

realizing she did n't see mason , megan quickly excused herself and went outside .

she did n't like the idea of him being close to the pool .

even with everyone around , it was still too dangerous for her liking .

just as her chest started to tighten , she saw him on her papa 's lap .

the two of them sat at one of the tables underneath the shade of a massive umbrella .

several of her other younger cousins sat around them , playing on their psps and other hand-held devices .

`` everything okay ? ''

she asked .

`` we 're fine , honey , '' papa replied .

`` let me know if he gets to be too much . ''

cocking his head , papa demanded , `` are you trying to say i 'm old or something ? ''

`` no , not at all .

he 's a handful even for me . ''

he waved her away with a hand gnarled with age and time .

`` go on and enjoy yourself .

i 'll keep an eye on mason . ''

she smiled and leaned down to kiss his weathered cheek .

`` thanks , papa . ''

he returned her smile .

`` you know , while you 're enjoying yourself , you might go spend a little time with the godfather . ''

megan 's eyes widened .

was he trying to set her up with pesh like he had with emma ?

he gave her a knowing look .

`` be good for both of you . ''

`` um , okay .

whatever , papa , '' she murmured , before she turned away .

although she hated to admit it , she had been looking forward to talking to pesh again .

she had tried to kid herself that she had n't secretly been searching the crowd for him when she was taking in all of emma 's decorations .

when she did finally catch sight of him , her traitorous heart skipped a beat .

she did n't mind if her body gave a reaction , but it pissed her off that her heart was affected by him as well .

he 'd ditched his suit jacket along with his tie .

with the first button of his shirt undone , she could see a tuft of dark chest hair .

she bit her lip at the sight .

she was a sucker for chest hair .

her eyes dipped down to take in how the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to his elbows , giving just a glimpse of his defined biceps .

casey had been absolutely right-he was built like a brick shithouse .

megan wanted nothing more than to get better acquainted with his body , especially with fewer clothes on him .

at the sound of emma 's voice behind her , she jumped .

`` ready to eat ? ''

emma asked .

`` um , sure . ''

emma gave her a puzzled look before nodding in pesh 's direction .

`` why do n't you ask pesh to join you at aidan 's and my table ?

he does n't know a lot of people , and i would hate to have him end up with the kids . ''

megan quirked her brows in surprise .

`` are you sure ? ''

`` why would n't i be ? ''

with a shrug , megan replied , `` i do n't know .

maybe because you did n't like the idea of me getting to know him . ''

emma shook her head .

`` i never said i did n't want you two to get to know each other-i said i did n't want you using him for a fling . ''

megan could n't help rolling her eyes .

`` the day is n't over yet .

i could still turn on my powers of seduction and lure pesh into a night of seedy passion . ''

emma stared at her in shock before busting out laughing .

`` seedy passion ?

those words and pesh will never , ever go together in the same sentence . ''

`` are you saying that you and aidan have never had seedy passion ? ''

`` aidan and pesh are not in the same league of men .

i love aidan , but he 's not necessarily a gentleman .

pesh is . ''

`` yeah , but you 're a lady , '' megan protested .

`` maybe in the street , but she 's one hell of a freak in the bedroom , '' aidan said behind them .

emma squealed before whirling around to smack him .

`` people could hear you , '' she admonished .

as aidan chuckled , megan shook her head .
