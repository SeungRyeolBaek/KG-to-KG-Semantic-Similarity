eventually the crowd begins to thin out , and constance and i each take a cupcake back to our cubicle .

`` what 's that ?

vanilla ? ''

she asks .

i peer at the frosting .

`` i think so , though i heard there were some coconut- '' i break off as my desk phone rings .

i look at it in surprise for a second-no one ever calls me on it-then reach forward to pick it up .

`` brynn speaking . ''

`` brynn , it 's pierce .

could you come into my office for a moment ? ''

`` oh , sure , i 'll be right there . ''

i hang up and stand .

`` pierce , '' i explain to constance .

`` probably wants to see if i 'll be home for dinner tonight . ''

she nods , and i walk down the hallway to his corner office .

`` he asked me to- '' i explain to his secretary , gwen .

`` sure , go on in , '' she replies , waving me in .

i knock softly as i open the door .

he beckons me inside and indicates i should take a seat across from his desk .

`` brynn , thanks for coming in , '' he says , standing and walking around his desk as he takes his reading glasses off and places them on his desktop calendar .

i look at him curiously as he sits on the edge of his desk in front of me .

`` i know that i 'm just your stepfather , but i hope that you know that you can always come to me with any ... difficulties . ''

`` um , sure .

yes , thanks , '' i stumble , surprised by the direction of the conversation .

he stands and begins to pace behind my chair .

`` you 're a very beautiful young woman , and i hope that you can see me as a sort of protector . ''

i feel him come up and stand behind the chair .

i start as he brushes my hair to the side and i feel his fingers graze against my skin just above the fabric of my dress .

`` i could n't help but notice this , '' he says .

`` what ? ''

i ask , frowning .

`` this bruise , '' he explains , still holding my hair to the side .

`` oh . ''

my mind races .

shit .

i bet i got it last night when nate had me up against that bed post , and of course it 's not in the sort of position where i 'd see it .

`` um , it 's nothing .

it 's probably old , maybe from when i fell on that hike . ''

`` i doubt it .

i mean , how far does it extend ... '' i 'm horrified to feel him unzip the top of my dress , all the way down to my bra strap .

he spreads his fingers across my back and a sickening feeling spreads through my body with them .

`` brynn , you have such a beautiful body .

you should n't be with someone who treats you with less respect than you deserve . ''

his fingertips just touch the top of my bra strap .

`` pierce ! ''

i exclaim , and jump up .

`` i really do n't think this is appropriate , '' i admonish him with as much confidence as i can muster , while reaching behind myself to pull my zipper up .

`` brynn , i 'm just trying to look out for you .

you clearly need a father figure in your life . ''

`` i 'm just fine , thank you very much , '' i reply shortly , glaring at him as i manage to zip my dress .

i march to the door , taking a deep breath to compose myself as i walk through the door .

i walk right past my desk and into the bathroom , quickly locking myself inside a stall .

i lower the toilet seat and sit down , pressing my hands onto my burning cheeks .

i know pierce 's words were saying one thing , but his actions , his touch , were saying quite another .

it just felt wrong .

by the time i sit back down at my desk , i 'm already second-guessing myself .

maybe i misread his behavior ; maybe he was just trying to look out for me , but he 's never had a daughter , so he did n't realize he was making me uncomfortable .

`` you ok ? ''

constance asks over her shoulder .

`` i 'm fine , '' i reply , pushing my uneaten cupcake away .

i 'm not hungry anymore .

i manage to make it through the rest of the work day , though i know that i 'll just have to see pierce at home for dinner .

as i drive home , i wonder if i should say i 'm sick or something so i 'll be able to just be by myself in my room .

but as i walk in through the garage , my mom calls me into the kitchen .

i carefully spread my hair over my neck to hide the bruises , then walk in .

`` oh , brynn , honey , i 'm so glad you 're home .

come look , '' she gushes , pulling me into the dining room .

i see that she 's set it with fine china and crystal , and a massive vase of white lilies sits in the center .

`` i thought i 'd do something a little special tonight to celebrate .
