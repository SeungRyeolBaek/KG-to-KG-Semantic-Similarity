she asked , confirming that she had n't forgotten anything .

everything was supposed to be delivered to the farm so she could n't imagine anything coming here .

rachel told her she 'd be right there and hung up the phone .

picking up her notebook where she kept all the information on her events , she walked to the lobby , confused about what might have been delivered here accidentally .

when she reached the lobby , she saw the huge boxes with a giant ribbon on the front .

both boxes were long and flat with an exclusive department store label on the outside .

`` these look exciting ! ''

lenora was saying .

`` open them here so i can see , okay ? ''

rachel smiled slightly but shook her head .

`` i have no idea what these are but i 'd better get them out of here .

you know how derrick prefers his reception area to look nice and tidy . ''

lenora frowned , but knew that rachel was correct .

it was her job to get deliveries out of the reception area quickly so the white lines and punches of color were undisturbed by extraneous trash .

rachel carried the boxes back to her tiny office , ignoring the curious stares of her co-workers .

when she untied the ribbons and pulled off the top of the first box , her reaction was total stunned surprise .

`` goodness , '' she whispered in awe .

lifting up the material , she was shocked by the incredible dress that was wrapped in tissue paper .

it was a stunning emilio pucci evening gown done completely in black lace with an under dress of shimmering gold .

the dress would hug her figure from her shoulders to mid-thigh and then it flared out to her toes .

it was so beautiful she could n't believe that she was actually holding such a masterpiece .

she heard someone gasp from her doorway and looked up .

`` is that an emilio pucci ? ''

linda whispered with reverence ? ''

`` yes .

it was just delivered . ''

linda , one of the other junior coordinators that rachel occasionally had lunch with , stepped into her office and touched the black lace .

`` how can you afford something like this on our salary ?

it 's something like four thousand dollars ! ''

rachel 's eyes snapped up to her friend 's .

`` are you serious ? ''

she gasped .

linda only nodded , her eyes remaining on the gown .

`` positive .

i was looking at it just last weekend , drooling over the dress . ''

she glanced up with eagerness .

`` what 's in the other one ? ''

she asked , almost whispering .

rachel carefully tucked the black lace dress back into the box , gently covering it with the tissue paper before pulling the second box forward .

when she opened this one , she felt as if her eyes were going to pop out of her head .

the akris gown was almost too beautiful to touch .

it was a bodice cut made up in glowing pink silk that would hug her chest , skim along her hips and then flare out to the floor .

`` well , that one is n't four thousand , '' linda sighed , her fingers delicately touching the material .

`` thank goodness , '' rachel replied , almost afraid to pull it out of the box but linda 's reassurance had her taking it gently and holding it up to her .

`` i did n't even drool over that one .

it was in a glass case at the store .

i think it was closer to twelve thousand dollars , '' she explained .

`` that kind of dress is so out of my league i did n't dare get close to it . ''

rachel almost dropped the dress with the news that the one dress could cost so much money .

she was n't even sure she made half that much in a month !

`` who sent you these ? ''

linda asked , moving forward to peek into the box .

rachel did the same , spotting the card as she shuffled the tissue to pull it out of the box .

her fingers were shaking as she opened the envelope .

she had a suspicion on who sent these dresses and she was almost dreading having those suspicions confirmed .

but as soon as she read the note her heart sank with the confirmation that rais had sent both of them to her .

`` ca n't wait to see you in these , '' linda said , reading the note over rachel 's shoulder .

`` who is 'r ' ? ''

rachel was so furious that he thought it was okay to buy her things like this that she wanted to stomp her feet .

how dare he treat her like a mistress !

`` just a jerk , '' rachel replied angrily and shoved the envelope back into the box .

she wanted to do the same with the dresses , but the expense of both made her treat the dresses with more care .

`` they are definitely going back . ''

`` you 're kidding , right ? ''

linda asked , watching her friend with amazement .

`` i 'm not kidding at all , '' she said and closed the box .

`` i 'm not for sale ! ''

linda walked out of the office , shaking her head at rachel 's attitude .

`` if you do n't want the guy , let him know that i 'm definitely for sale for those kinds of gifts . ''

rachel barely heard her .
