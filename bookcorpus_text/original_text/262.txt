`` not just yet , '' he winks , and goes to join riley at the bar .

`` here we go , '' she says , passing out the three cocktails and raising her glass .

`` to old friends , all grown up and kicking ass . ''

`` i 'll drink to that ! ''

emerson laughs .

`` hell yeah , '' i smile , clinking my glass to theirs .

`` and to your birthday , of course ! ''

riley adds .

`` of course .

happy birthday , abby , '' emerson says warmly , taking a sip of his drink .

my body may still be reeling with having had a moment of contact with emerson , but the mere knowledge that things between us are back on track is enough to keep me giddy .

besides , i 'm here with my best friend and long-lost lover ... who i 've been carrying a torch for almost the entire past decade , despite our asshole parents ' one-day marriage .

happy birthday to me , indeed .

the three of us settle down in the living room , riley and emerson catching each other up on their lives and careers .

i ca n't help but be wildly proud of these two .

neither one of them had any idea what they wanted to do with their futures as high school seniors , but now that they 've followed their passions , they 've made incredible lives for themselves .

hell , if anyone 's slacking on the whole bright shiny future thing , it 's me .

but maybe now that i 've got my job at bastian , things will start to take off for me , too .

at least , i hope that 's the case .

`` i do n't suppose you keep in touch with anyone from high school , emerson ? ''

riley asks , whipping us up a second round .

`` no one except courtney haines , '' i tease , nudging him .

we 're cozied up on the couch next to each other , casual as can be .

amazing how comfortable it is to be near him .

`` i do n't keep in touch with courtney haines , '' emerson laughs , nudging me back , `` or anyone , for that matter .

i consider myself a bit of a hometown expat . ''

`` that make three of us , '' riley replies , furnishing us with fresh cocktails .

`` in fact , if i had n't run into you two again , i doubt i 'd ever have run into a familiar face from those glory days , '' emerson goes on .

`` not even family ? ''

riley asks without thinking .

i shoot her a look , and she realizes her mistake at once , but it 's too late now .

`` well , mom 's still more or less living in the rehab revolving door , '' emerson says , not meeting anyone 's gaze .

`` and my dad ... he actually passed away , a few years after i left connecticut with my mom . ''

this is news to me , and i ca n't help but wrap my arm supportively around emerson 's back .

as if he needed any more pain to carry around on those broad shoulders of his .

`` i 'm so sorry , '' i murmur , `` i know how hard that is , emerson . ''

`` i actually thought about calling you , when it happened , '' he laughs shortly , `` i knew you 'd gone through the same thing .

could n't think of anyone else i 'd want to talk to more . ''

`` you could have , you know , '' i say softly .

`` well , '' emerson sighs , shaking off the sadness of his father 's passing , `` you 're here now , right ?

guess we 've just got some more catching up to do .

all of us . ''

we all return to our drinks as the conversation resumes .

i have n't eaten a ton today , so my drinks are really doing a number on me already .

just as i start wondering whether we should order a huge pizza to soak up some of this vodka , i remember what tonight actually has in store for me .

`` shit .

what time is it ? ''

i exclaim , standing up suddenly from the couch .

`` just about seven , '' emerson says , glancing at his watch .

`` why , what- ? ''

`` oh god , '' riley groans , looking up at me , `` your grandparents . ''

`` i 'm not dressed .

i do n't have time .

they 're going to be here any second , '' i cry , setting down my empty martini glass and setting off toward my bedroom to get changed .

but the second i spin around on my heel , i hear the buzzer ring out .

frank and jillian rowan have arrived for the evening .

`` well , shit , '' emerson laughs darkly , `` it 's a family reunion !

this should be fun . ''

`` relax , abby , '' riley says , anticipating my panic .

`` you 're a grown woman .

it 's none of their business who you spend your time with . ''

`` try telling them that , '' i mutter , anxiously buzzing them up .

`` look , i 'm sure it will be fine , '' emerson sighs , starting to gather his things , `` if nothing else , they 've got that whole snobby , fake-polite thing going on .
