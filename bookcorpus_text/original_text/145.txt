`` you know what i think ? ''

he asks , stepping toward me .

i step away again , feeling one of the posts of my bed against my back .

`` i think you want me .

i think you can barely contain yourself . ''

`` that 's mighty arrogant of you , '' i comment .

i begin to tug the ends of my hair nervously .

`` why are you doing that ? ''

he asks , frowning .

`` it 's just a nervous habit , '' i say with a shrug , and drop my hand .

`` so i make you nervous ? ''

`` no , '' i reply quickly .

`` just you being in here ... '' `` i 'm only arrogant if i 'm wrong . ''

`` wrong about what ? ''

i feel the urge to pull my hair again but do n't want to give him the satisfaction .

`` wrong about you wanting me .

let 's give it a test- '' he narrows his eyebrows , studying me .

`` i 'm going to kiss you now , and all you have to do is tell me to stop . ''

`` what ?

that 's crazy .

not to mention you just fucked dana , and now you expect me to kiss you ? ''

i protest , but he steps toward me .

i try to pull backward but i 'm already pressed against my bedpost .

desire unfurls deep in my stomach as his eyes lock onto mine .

`` if it 's crazy , just tell me to stop , '' he whispers teasingly , and moves closer .

his musky scent fills my nose and my mind begins to swim .

i feel wetness trickling down my thigh as he curls his arms around me , grasping the bedpost with both hands behind my lower back .

he 's so close to me .

i can feel heat radiating off him .

his legs and chest sink against me and he moves his lips toward mine .

just a few inches between nate thornhill 's mouth and mine .

now an inch .

now two centimeters ... i can feel his warm breath against my partially open lips ...

`` stop . ''

i whisper .

he freezes but does n't pull away , as though he ca n't believe what he 's just heard .

though truthfully , i 'm marveling at my own restraint .

i can feel his erection against my thigh-i know he wants me , too .

now i can beat him at his own game .

i lean forward slightly , allowing my lips to brush against his as i speak , `` unless you do n't want to . ''

his eyes , which were focused on my lips , flick back up to meet mine .

i force myself to stay steady even as i 'm consumed by the lust in his gaze .

he stares at me for a moment , then pushes off the bedpost and steps back .

he opens his mouth , about to say something , but nothing comes out .

i remain pressed against the bedpost as he turns and moves toward the door .

without looking back , he shuts it behind him .

i stumble forward and take a deep breath .

it 's like he takes all the air out of the room and i ca n't breathe when he 's around .

i ca n't believe i just rejected him .

i 'm stunned , but i also feel like giving myself a standing ovation .

i just resisted the advances of nate thornhill , my fantasy of almost three years .

i should win a willpower award .

i knew that if i 'd let him kiss me , i would forever lose any kind of power in our relationship .

i 'd be just be another pathetic girl who fell for his charms .

of course , the downside is that i 'm more turned on than i 've ever been in my life , and i 'm alone with a book again .

i sigh and crawl back onto my bed .

i have a feeling that whatever is happening between me and my stepbrother , i have n't seen the end of it yet .

chapter seven `` i 'm so happy there 's another girl working here ! ''

constance says , swiveling around on her desk chair .

she 's my new cubicle mate , and one of only a handful of other interns at thornhill and co. `` ah , there .

my outlook is finally working , '' i announce , opening the email system on my desktop .

`` so they 'll want you to sign an nda and stuff , but after , want to go to lunch ? ''

she asks .

`` what 's an nda ? ''

i turn to face her .

`` non-disclosure agreement .

there are a ton of senators and big business types who come in here , and you ca n't tell anyone .

very important , '' she says in hushed tones .

she seems very pleased that she 's snagged this coveted internship , which is probably why i have n't told her that i 'm the boss 's stepdaughter .

i 've never benefited from nepotism before , and it feels strange and uncomfortable to me now .

`` oh .

well i 'd love to get lunch later this week , but i 'm having lunch with my friend allison today .

we go to uva together , and she 's got an internship at this urban planning place in georgetown , so i 'm going to meet up with her . ''

`` cool .

georgetown has really good shopping .
