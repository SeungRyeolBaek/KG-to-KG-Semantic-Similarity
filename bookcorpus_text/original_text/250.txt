calling the boss by his last name , huh ?

how unconventional .

another check in the plus column for this place .

i thank her and make my way toward the door .

before i can raise my hand to rap against the frosted glass pane , it swings open before me .

standing there is a man i recognize from the bastian website as owen cooper himself .

he 's super young for a ceo , in his late 30 's or so .

he 's dressed in jeans , a sweater , and a friendly smile .

`` abby ! ''

he says , as if we were old friends .

i guess being able to check out interviewees ' social media profiles makes everyone fast friends these days .

`` come on in .

coffee ? ''

`` sure , '' i reply , `` it 's nice to meet you mr.- '' `` just 'cooper ' is fine , '' he cuts me off , pulling a shot from a fancy espresso machine sitting on a table against the wall .

`` so , thanks for coming in .

even if this is a bit of a formality . ''

`` what 's that ? ''

i ask , happily accepting the rich cup of espresso .

`` your portfolio is excellent , '' he tells me , sitting down at his desk .

`` top notch .

i knew i wanted to hire you from the second i saw your work .

sorry ... did i forget to mention that in my last email to you ? ''

`` that you did , '' i say , sinking into a chair opposite him in mild disbelief .

`` are you saying ... i already have the job ? ''

`` you do if you want it ! ''

he smiles , `` you 'll have to forgive my absent-mindedness .

my brain is always hurrying onto the next task , so i sometimes skip over what 's right in front of me .

anyhow , yes !

the job is yours for the taking . ''

`` well , i absolutely want to take it , '' i grin , `` thanks mr ... er , cooper . ''

`` yeah ! ''

he says , clinking his coffee cup to mine .

`` and you 're in luck , too .

one of our managing editors from the european office is going to be lending me a hand here in new york for a while .

he 's much less of a scatterbrain than i am , so he 's going to be the one showing you the ropes .

i ca n't remember if i told him that ... '' `` that sounds great , '' i reply , sipping the fine espresso as i try to play it cool .

i ca n't believe i stressed out all week for an interview that was actually a job offer !

i guess with the fast-paced aspect of the tech world , hiring practices are a little quicker at places like this .

`` so , what else can i tell you ... '' mr. cooper continues , propping his sneakered feet up on his desk .

`` salary is 60k .

full benefits .

three weeks vacation ... '' i stare at him , practically salivating .

i try to never think that something is too good to be true , as a rule .

but this whole situation is testing me .

`` well , what do you say ? ''

he presses jovially , `` are you interested in the job , abby ? ''

`` i 'm ... very interested .

absolutely , '' i grin , `` this is my dream job , mr ... cooper .

i ca n't tell you how i excited i am- '' `` yes , yes .

very good , '' cooper says , standing abruptly .

`` well , like i said , our brilliant managing editor is back from europe this afternoon , and he 's going to be helping you get settled here at bastian .

you 'll trail him to meetings , sit in on brainstorming sessions , all that good stuff .

but for today , just go home and relax .

take the friday to yourself .

this is a fast-paced company , abby .

you 're going to need all your stores of youthful energy come monday . ''

`` sounds great to me , '' i say , standing as cooper opens the door for me .

we walk back out onto the main floor together , but i might as well be walking on a cloud .

this whole week , i 've been stressing out about an interview that was actually an offer !

what a screwy industry this is .

i think i 'm going to love it .

the other employees look up with interest as cooper leads me to the elevators .

it 'll be so nice to work with people my age at a company on the cutting edge of creative innovation .

and i did n't even have to get grilled to score my place here !

this day could not get any better .

though of course , that just means it could get much , much worse .

`` see you next week ! ''

cooper says , as the elevator dings to a stop at our floor .

`` thanks again for giving me this job , '' i tell him , giving his hand a quick shake .

`` i promise you , you wo n't be sorry . ''

beaming , i turn to the elevator as the doors swish open .

so blinded am i by my luminous good fortune that i stride into the elevator car without noticing the person trying to step out of it .
