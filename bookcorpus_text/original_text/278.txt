i do n't want to work for any company that does n't value you as much as i do . ''

`` then what are we supposed to do , huh ? ''

i ask , taking a step away from him .

`` anything we want ! ''

he exclaims , `` i have enough money saved up from my first few app sales to last us two lifetimes ! ''

`` and i 'm just supposed to be content , living off your money ? ''

i ask archly , crossing my arms .

`` remember how well that worked for my dad ?

and your mom ? ''

`` it 's not the same thing , '' he says sternly .

`` i do n't see any difference , '' i say , shaking my head .

`` my dad never had any pride in himself , because he just lived off his parents ' money his whole life .

i was already headed down that road with my grandparents , but bastian was finally going to get me on my own two feet .

i need to find another job , another way to be independent , not another meal ticket . ''

`` is that what i 'd be to you ? ''

emerson asks heatedly , `` a meal ticket ? ''

`` of course not ! ''

i cry , `` i love you , emerson .

i loved you when you were a penniless eighteen-year-old and i love you now ! ''

`` so what the fuck are we arguing about ? ''

he shouts , slamming his fist down on the island .

`` it 's just money , abby .

it does n't mean anything . ''

`` no , it- '' `` it means nothing , '' he insists , `` you sharing my life , my resources , would n't mean that you were bound to me , or that you owed me anything .

it would n't mean i had power over you , it would just mean ... that you we here .

with me .

that we were in this together . ''

`` emerson , i do n't ... '' i whisper , trying to wrap my head around what he 's suggesting .

`` i do n't know how to think of money as anything but a bargaining chip .

my family- '' `` your family is fucked up , pardon my saying , '' he cuts me off .

`` your grandparents use their money as a weapon .

but me ?

i 'd like to use mine as a gift .

a way out , for both of us .

why wo n't you let me do that for you ?

for us ? ''

`` i 'm just ... i 'm sorry ... '' i say , trying to blink back the tears that have sprung to my eyes .

`` i just need to think . ''

`` fine , '' emerson says , his jaw set .

he turns on his heel , storms across the loft , and grabs up a retractable leash from the side table .

`` i know i should just be some alpha man idiot and storm out into the wind or whatever the fuck , but roxie needs a walk . ''

the westie goes galloping over to emerson when he whistles .

emerson attaches the leash to her collar and looks up at me .

`` i 'll give you some time to think everything over .

have some wine if you like .

if you want to leave before i get back and find some other way ... i wo n't hold it against you .

just make up your mind , abby .

you know what i want . ''

before i can say another word , he wrenches open the front door and disappears with roxie on his heels .

i fall back against the kitchen island , letting the baffled tears stream down my face .

with shaking hands , i fish out a bottle of cabernet from the stockpile .

pouring myself a very tall glass , i let my warring thoughts pour out through my mind as well .

emerson is willing to leave his job and share everything he has with me .

i , on the other hand , have no choice but to abandon my job at bastian , have no place to live , and hardly any money to my name .

if he and i were to start a life together now , i 'd be bringing nothing to the table .

shudderingly , i remember how i felt about deb when she showed up on the scene .

i thought she was desperate , and manipulative , and a helpless dependent .

how would what emerson is proposing make me any different from her ?

as much as i hate to admit it , i 've been living off the generosity of my family for my whole life so far .

sure , i worked hard to get into a good college and paid most of my tuition with scholarships , but i have privilege coming out the wazoo .

and now , what-i 'm just going to marry rich and have that be that ?

how am i supposed to live with myself if i go down that path ?

i have to earn my own way through life .

it 's what i 've always wanted .

i take a huge gulp of wine and feel it go straight to my head via my empty stomach .

getting trashed is not the solution here , but i have no other brilliant ideas .

i wish that i had someone to talk about all of this .

riley 's probably furious with me for getting us evicted , and it 's not like i 'm going to call my grandparents up .
