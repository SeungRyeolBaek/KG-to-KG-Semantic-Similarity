he bit down on his lip to keep from laughing at her .

he could n't believe megan was so concerned with his family 's opinion .

his heartbeat accelerated at the thought .

it had to mean she really was falling in love with him .

he brushed a silky strand of blonde hair out of her face .

`` sweetheart , you 're not the first american girl i 've brought home with me . ''

`` yes , i 'm well aware of that .

i 'm also aware of the fact of how well your family loved and accepted jade .

it might not be the same way with me . ''

she stared up at him .

`` i 'm not like her , pesh .

i 'm not meek and good-hearted . ''

he shook his head .

`` that 's not true .

you are good-hearted .

i see that part of you each and every day . ''

cupping her chin with his fingers , he brought her gaze to his .

`` you saw my brother , dev .

through all of his missteps and antics , my parents still love him very much .

so i promise you there is nothing you can do to where they wo n't like you or where you 'll bring shame on me .

okay ? ''

she gave a reluctant nod .

`` okay . ''

taking her by the hand , he led her off the porch .

once he 'd gotten her in the car , he went around and slid into the driver 's seat .

when pesh cranked up the car , megan gasped in horror .

`` what ? ''

he asked .

she motioned to the clock on the dash .

`` oh my god , we 're going to be late .

can i make a worse first impression ? ''

pesh laughed .

`` maybe i should tell you a few things , etiquette wise , so tonight will go a little easier . ''

`` what does that have to do with us being late ? ''

`` because it 's considered good form to arrive thirty minutes late . ''

`` seriously ? ''

`` yes . ''

`` huh , i did n't know that . ''

`` well , how could you ? ''

`` i tried doing a little research .

i even watched monsoon wedding , '' she said .

pesh laughed .

`` did you now ? ''

`` yeah , it was pretty good .

i kinda hated there were n't more dance numbers and songs . ''

`` megan , i 'm pretty sure none of my family is going to break out into song like in a bollywood movie tonight , '' he said , with amusement ringing in his voice .

she rolled her eyes .

`` i did n't expect them to , smart-ass . ''

he tsked at her .

`` so testy tonight . ''

after exhaling a long breath , she gave him an apologetic smile .

`` i 'm sorry i 'm so bitchy . ''

`` you 're not bitchy . ''

`` and you 're lying . ''

`` regardless of your out-of-control emotions , i know that my family is going to love you just as much as i do . ''

the moment the words left his lips he grimaced .

there was the big l word .

they had n't actually exchanged it yet , and now he 'd managed to screw up and say it before he could find the right time .

`` oh god , did you have to say that now ?

like i 'm not nervous enough ! ''

`` i 'm sorry , '' he murmured .

burying her head in her hands , she groaned .

`` this is ... you are ... i ... ''

`` look , you don't- '' `` i love you , too ! ''

she shouted from behind her hands .

his hands jerked on the wheel , and he sent the car careening onto the emergency lane .

when he recovered and got the car back into the right lane , he dared himself to look over at her .

she peeked at him through her fingers .

`` i love you , pesh .

i really f**king do . ''

`` oh megan , '' he whispered .

pulling her hands away from her face , she gave him a genuine smile .

`` i love you more than any man i 've ever known . ''

`` i love you more- '' suddenly he found himself unable to continue .

did he love her more than he had jade ?

he had spent years with jade and had only months with megan .

if he did love megan more , what did that say about his relationship with jade ?

she reached over and took one of his hands in hers .

`` hey , you do n't have to say what i said .

our situations are completely different . ''

he clenched and unclenched his jaw .

`` no woman wants half a man 's heart , '' he argued .

`` but i know it is n't half your heart .

and i would n't want you to stop loving me just because i died , so why would i expect you to do the same with jade ? ''

`` it 's not fair to you , '' he croaked .

`` life 's not fair , baby .

you have to get used to that one . ''

she squeezed his hand .

`` besides , i know what i feel when i feel your love .

there 's no half about it .

you love me with all your heart and soul . ''
