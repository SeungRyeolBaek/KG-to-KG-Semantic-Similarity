pesh laughed .

`` i suppose i do if you consider that 's mia 's fiance . ''

`` that is so wild .

i love that band . ''

`` i 'll see if i can get you an autograph . ''

with a squeal , megan said , `` really ?

that would be amazing . ''

`` anything for the woman who is willing to risk her life for me . ''

megan laughed .

`` it was nothing . ''

`` what about your hand ? ''

`` i 'm not going to lie .

it hurts .

i kinda forgot what punching someone felt like . ''

pesh could n't help his brows from rising in surprise .

`` have you done a lot of fighting ? ''

she grinned .

`` not exactly mma material , am i ? ''

when he merely shook his head , she replied , `` i may have thrown a few punches in my early college partying days when a guy overstepped his bounds . ''

with a smile , pesh said , `` good for you . ''

`` yeah , my dad was really big on teaching me self-defense moves .

you know , with him being ex-military . ''

pesh could n't help liking megan 's strength and spunk .

he had n't known a lot of women like her .

in his world , women were bred to be demure and obedient .

even though jade was n't indian , she would 've never dreamed of throwing a punch to defend him against dev .

but megan , she was so refreshing with her ability to stand up for herself and others-to voice her mind whether it was good or bad .

`` you would have made your father very proud today . ''

`` thank you .

i 'm sure later on today when my knuckles are bruising , he 'll want to know why . ''

`` i 'm very sorry . ''

he took her hand in his before bringing it to his lips .

`` here 's a kiss to make any bruises go away . ''

she gave him a teasing smile .

`` is that the best medicine you can do , dr .

nadeen ? ''

his mind went wild with illicit images of all the `` medicine '' and `` healing '' he could give her .

a chaste kiss to alleviate her pain was all he could really offer .

his pager went off before he could reply .

`` i better go . ''

he hopped off the table and started for the door .

as his hand hovered over the doorknob , there were so many things he wanted to say to her .

but finally , he just said , `` thanks again for taking care of me . ''

`` you 're welcome . ''

`` and you should probably ice your hand during your break tonight . ''

`` yes sir , '' she replied , with a mock salute .

he shook his head at her with a smile before heading out the door .

chapter twelve days melted into weeks as megan immersed herself in her clinicals .

every day she found a new challenge to conquer .

she had n't imagined how hard it would be , or how exhausted she would be most nights when she crawled into bed .

but it was a thrilling exhaustion because she was doing what she felt like she was called to do .

each day , she spent more and more time with pesh .

she loved working beside him on cases .

he had the best bedside manner of all the residents and interns .

patients , both young and old , adored him .

and the more she was with him , the more megan began to adore him as well .

she had just left an examining room where he had charmed a little boy into finally letting them run the tests they needed when kristi beckoned her from down the hall .

after hustling to join kristi , megan was quickly ushered inside one of the trauma rooms .

immediately , her entire body switched gears as she prepared herself for what she might face .

`` female , thirty , car accident , '' the paramedic began before rattling off her vitals and other information .

after megan had absorbed the information , she turned to the patient .

`` hi , i 'm megan .

i 'm going to get your iv started . ''

the woman gave megan a weak smile .

`` i 'm mary . ''

`` i guess it would be wrong to say it 's nice to meet you , huh ? ''

megan said , trying to talk as normally as she could to put the patient at ease .

`` yeah , i guess so , '' mary replied .

when megan reached for mary 's arm to find a place for the needle , mary winced .

`` ouch . ''

as megan surveyed the forearm , she shook her head .

`` looks like you 've got a break there . ''

`` my arm is broken ? ''

mary asked in a panic .

`` we wo n't know until we get you into x-ray .

i 'm going to try this vein here in your wrist . ''

the needle slipped easily into the vein , and megan started the iv .

pesh appeared in the doorway then .

he smiled at mary on the gurney .

`` hello , mary , i 'm dr. nadeen .

i understand you had a little accident today ? ''

she nodded .

`` this car came out of nowhere and hit me head on . ''

`` i 'm so sorry .

why do n't we start by you telling me where it hurts ? ''
