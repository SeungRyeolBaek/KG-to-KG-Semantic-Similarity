`` just leave me alone .

we do n't have the same priorities in life .

i ca n't meet your needs and you ca n't meet mine . ''

`` you are everything i want in a woman ! ''

he countered fiercely .

`` sure i am .

i 'm so wonderful and so fulfilling that you needed another chickybabe on the side , right ? ''

`` she was coming after me , rachel .

i was not reciprocating . ''

`` is that why her lipstick was all over your mouth when i walked in ? ''

she wiped angrily at the tears that she could n't stop .

at the sight of her tears , and the red rimmed eyes , rais felt like someone had just punched him in the gut hard .

he hated seeing her like this , wanted to pull her into his arms and soothe the pain he knew she was feeling .

because he knew how he would feel if he ever saw her with another man like she 'd found him last night .

`` rachel , i know how it looks but you 're wrong .

i was n't coming onto her .

it was all on her side and if you had come in a few moments later , you would have seen me pushing her away .

if you 'd waited just a moment before entering , i would have told her that you are the woman i wanted . ''

`` for now . ''

`` not for now ! ''

he replied , softly , but with force .

`` i want you forever .

i want to wake up next to you every morning for the rest of my life .

i want to fall asleep with you curled up in my arms .

i want you at my table and bearing our children together .

i want you , rachel .

i 've loved you for so long i ca n't even remember when my feelings for you changed from friendship and brotherly affection , to something significantly deeper . ''

she wanted so desperately to believe him but how could she ?

`` then why all the women over the years ? ''

`` because i was trying to replace you , rachel , '' he came back .

his voice was n't yelling anymore .

it was soft , confident and forceful .

`` they all looked like you because you were either too young for what i felt for you , or you were avoiding me .

i did n't want to scare you when you were so young , but then you disappeared and would n't even come out to visit your father during the summers . ''

`` because i knew you 'd be there . ''

`` and you hated me for the women .

but they were rachel replacements . ''

she looked up at him , not sure if she liked the words he was telling her .

`` why would you do that ? ''

`` because i loved you .

i wanted you so badly and you were so timid , so scared and i 'd known you for so long , even i did n't know what i was feeling for you until a few years ago . ''

`` i do n't believe you , '' she said , but the words were filled with the pain of yesterday 's visions and not the heat of moments before .

`` i know you do n't , honey .

and there 's nothing i can do to convince you otherwise .

you 're just going to have to trust me . ''

she thought about that for a long moment , closing her eyes and squeezing them shut .

`` i do n't know if i can trust you , rais .

i 've seen you with women just like me too many times .

and it hurts . ''

he sighed , but would n't relent .

`` i know that .

but put yourself in my place .

i wanted you so badly for so long . ''

`` i am in your place .

and i did n't go out and find other men who looked like you .

i did n't sleep with a slew of men just to replace the one man i always wanted . ''

the surprise in his eyes and the smile that slowly grew on his face confused her .

`` that amuses you ? ''

she asked , walking around him so that she was on the opposite side of the room .

since the room was n't very big , there was maybe only one additional foot between them but anything was better than being trapped in the corner .

`` get out ! ''

she snapped at him .

the grin on his face increased and he shook his head .

`` i 'm not going anywhere , '' he said softly .

rachel instantly noticed that his voice had become husky , deeper somehow and she looked up at him worriedly .

`` i hate you , '' she whispered .

if he was n't going to leave , then she would .

she could n't stay here with him looking so arrogant .

she just wanted out .

she walked back by him , trying to stay out of his reach but her apartment was n't big enough .

she was just about to reach for her purse and keys when he stopped her with the expedient method of grabbing her instead .

`` let me go , '' she sobbed , her fists pounding against his massive chest but it did n't do anything to stop him .

`` why are you still here ? ''

`` because of what you just said . ''
