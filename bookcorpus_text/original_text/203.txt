and your tuition , well , i figured after what he put you through , that you deserved it . ''

`` i ca n't believe you did that . ''

`` actually , i was n't sure it would work .

i mean , i was n't sure if he wanted to see me again anyway . ''

`` i think , in his own twisted way , he does love you . ''

`` his very twisted way . ''

he steps forward and reaches for my hand , which is still entwined in my hair .

he pulls it down and laces his fingers through mine .

`` i ca n't promise you that i 'll know how to be in a normal relationship right away , but please , give me another chance .

i know how badly i fucked up , but i want to do better .

please .

i want to learn with you . ''

i pause , uncertain .

can i really put myself out there with him ?

risk my heart being broken again ?

i feel him begin to pull my hand gently behind his back so that i 'm forced to take a step in .

he leans forward , tucking my arm against the small of his back .

`` no fair , '' i whisper , as the heat of his body envelopes me .

he wraps his other arm around me .

`` i know , '' he says with a sly grin .

`` but can you blame me ?

i 'd do anything for another chance with you . ''

everything about him is so intoxicating .

i 'm dizzy with desire for him after not being near him for close to a month .

i turn my face up to his .

`` ok , ok , '' i relent .

`` one more chance . ''

the words have barely left my lips when he covers my mouth with his .

my legs almost give out as we touch-a mix of pleasure and relief overwhelming my body .

`` god , i 've missed you , '' he murmurs , breaking away for a moment .

i pull his head back down to mine and sink my tongue into his mouth .

`` get a room ! ''

we break away as a group of guys , probably freshmen , walk past us , hooting and hollering .

nate glares at them for a moment , then rolls his eyes .

`` come on , there 's something i 've wanted to do for a long time anyway . ''

he leads me by the hand back out of campus and across the street to the crew house .

i 'm wondering if he means something sexual , and worries he forgot his mom is visiting him .

we walk up the steps and i see her and the crew guys turn to us as we step onto the porch .

`` everyone , this is my girlfriend , brynn , '' he announces proudly .

chapter thirty eileen 's face breaks into a huge grin as i blush .

his teammates slap him on the back and needle him about his lack of previous relationships , then begin to introduce themselves to me .

i 'm quickly offered a beer and pulled into multiple conversations , but nate is there every few minutes with a hand on my back , making sure i 'm ok. as the night goes on , the porch fills up with more people , and , particularly , more women .

i 'm happily overwhelmed by all these new faces , but also glad to just lean on the railing for a minute to sip my beer .

`` brynn ? ''

i hear a woman 's voice call .

i turn to see cara walking up onto the porch .

`` hey ! ''

i say , and stand up to give her a hug .

`` how was your summer ? ''

`` um ... '' i murmur , unable to find the words to describe the last few months .

i look over her shoulder and watch a girl i do n't know place her hand on nate 's chest .

before i can even frown , though , he steps back and smiles politely , then makes his way over to me .

`` it was pretty crazy , '' is all i can come up with before nate 's arm snakes his way around my waist .

`` i just saw my mom yawning , so i think she 's about to go back to her hotel , '' he says .

`` oh , hey cara . ''

`` nate ... are you two ... ? ''

cara asks , her eyes darting back and forth between us .

`` we are , '' i confirm , as nate grins down at me .

it does feel good to say it out loud .

`` and you 've already met his parents ?

wow ! ''

`` yeah , we 've met , '' i reply a bit evasively , as nate bites his lip to keep from laughing .

i elbow him in the ribs .

`` we better go say goodbye to his mom . ''

sure enough , eileen is shouldering her purse and looking around as we walk over .

`` i hope i did n't take up too much of your time with nate tonight , '' i say as we walk up .

`` not at all .

i would n't be here at all if it were n't for you , '' she says , wrapping me up in a big hug .

`` will you join us for brunch tomorrow before i head back home ? ''

i glance at nate , who 's looking at me encouragingly .
