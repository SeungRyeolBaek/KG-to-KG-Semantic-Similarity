`` what do you mean ?

if you tell me that you 're engaged to another woman , so help me malik ... '' `` i 'm engaged to you , siri . ''

his voice was soft , but firm , not trying to tease her in any way because he finally understood why she had been so stressed while he was away .

those were n't the words she was expecting to hear so when he said them like that , just as a statement of fact as if it were a fait accompli , she could only stand there in front of him in stunned silence .

`` we 're engaged ? ''

she whispered , too afraid of believing him .

had she misunderstood ?

`` yes .

we 're engaged .

we 're getting married the day after we arrive in duban .

you 're going to ... . '' she interrupted him by raising her hand to stop him .

`` hold that thought , '' she said and quickly ran out of the room and into the powder room off the hallway .

she was so embarrassed when she slammed the door shut and then emptied the contents of her stomach into the toilet , heaving over and over again .

when she was finished , she felt a cold towel press against her forehead and she slid against the wall , grateful for the support .

`` thank you , '' she said quietly and closed her eyes , waiting for the wave of nausea to ease .

`` were you that worried about what was going on ? ''

he asked gently as he knelt down in front of her .

she thought about it for a few moments , and then nodded her head .

`` i was terrified to read the newspapers and i would n't even log onto the internet , afraid i might see something .

that 's how i found out about your first marriage . ''

he picked her up and carried her to the sofa in the living room , holding her there while she laid her head on his shoulder .

she was too weak from the bout of nausea to fight him .

and by now , she did n't want to .

the words , `` i 'm engaged to you , siri '' kept running through her mind , a dream that was too precious to believe in yet .

he nodded his head as well and pulled her close , his fingers tangling in her hair .

`` i know you have n't wanted to hear an explanation , but i think it 's time we finally talked about what happened so you can understand why i got married that weekend .

i want to assure you first off that it was n't my choice and if i could have done things differently , i would have .

i loved you back then , but i 'd been with you so much during the time we were together , i 'd become out of touch with what was happening at home .

i went home that weekend and was told about an uprising in the north of my country .

my father was furious that he was being cornered in that way and ordered me to marry the daughter of the tribal leader who had instigated the rebellion .

she and i met for the first time the same day we were married . ''

siri 's whole body tensed , but that brought back the nausea so she forced herself to relax back against his warm chest .

`` so you were n't engaged before then ? ''

`` i was never engaged to her .

ever !

i only wanted to marry you .

please believe me , siri .

you have been the only woman i 've ever loved and even my ex-wife knew that i was n't emotionally involved with the relationship .

it was n't the cause of the breakup , but it definitely did n't help . ''

`` why did n't you ? ''

he looked down at her pale face , confused by her question .

`` why did n't i what ?

love her ? ''

she did n't even bother to shake her head , afraid of the consequences to her stomach .

`` no .

why did n't you marry me four years ago ? ''

`` i was n't sure how you felt about me .

you were still in school , so smart and beautiful .

you had so many plans for what you wanted to do with your education and marrying me would take all of that away .

i wanted you to be happy more than i wanted to marry you . ''

`` why ? ''

she could n't look up at him , but she snuggled against him more , her nose pressed to his warm neck and smelling his wonderful scent .

`` honey , you ca n't have a career and be married to me .

i wish it were otherwise , but there are too many obligations .

especially in the business you 're in , there would be implications of favoritism . ''

`` you mean someone would try and buy my favors by going through my company to order their toys ? ''

`` exactly . ''

she thought about that for all of two seconds .

`` okay .

i 'll sell it off .

i know exactly who should have first chance at it too , '' she said , thinking of joe and his efficiency , his dedication .

malik looked down at her , trying to determine if he understood her correctly .

`` are you saying that you 're willing to give up all that you 've worked for to be my wife ? ''
