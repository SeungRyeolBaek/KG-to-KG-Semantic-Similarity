there 's a text on my screen that simply reads : hey abby , it 's emerson .

i grab up the phone and text back before i lose my nerve .

me : hey , i was just about to call you .

i want to talk .

him : so do i .

how do you feel about doing it in person ?

me : oh , i do n't think i have time to come all the way back downtown before my plans tonight .

him : you do n't have to come downtown .

me : no ?

i jump a foot in the air as my apartment buzzer rings .

another text arrives in its wake : him : nope .

`` are you expecting a package ? ''

riley calls from the living room .

`` no , ri , it 's him ! ''

i gasp , yanking open my bedroom door .

`` emerson is here ?

at our apartment ? ! ''

she breathes excitedly , `` well , what are you waiting for ?

buzz him up ! ''

`` but .

i .

what if- '' i stammer , biting my lip .

`` oh , for christ 's sake , '' riley groans .

she marches across the room and pushes the `` door '' button on the buzzer , granting emerson access to our building .

`` you 're welcome , '' she grins , marching toward her room , `` i 'll be in my boudoir .

call if you need any further intervention , yeah ? ''

`` thanks , '' i say weakly , paralyzed as i stare at the front door .

at least i made an effort to look presentable today .

i 've got my favorite pair of skinny jeans on , a slouchy white tee with a charcoal cardigan , and some eclectic pieces of jewelry i 've picked up at the brooklyn flea market .

my blonde hair hangs in loose , easy waves , and my favorite red matte lipstick finishes off the look .

still , even knowing that i look my millennial-chic best , my heart nearly bursts out of my chest as i hear a knock on the door .

he 's here .

`` answer it or i will ! ''

riley trills from the other room .

`` ugh .

fine , '' i mutter , going to the door .

`` quit crackin ' the whip , would you ? ''

`` what 's that about whips ? ''

emerson grins , as i swing the door open .

`` oh , '' i stammer , taken aback by his perfect appearance yet again .

he 's wearing a black v-neck and gray jeans , and the smattering of stubble on his jaw is as sexy as ever .

the glasses are nowhere to be seen , which means his vibrant blue eyes are on full , gorgeous display .

the tee shirt cuts off just above his bulging , perfect biceps .

i spot a few new tattoos on his arms , too .

guess there 's still a bad boy mixed in with that tech billionaire .

`` no literal whips on hand , sorry to disappoint you , '' i laugh , moving aside to let him in .

`` what a shame , '' he sighs , taking a look around the apartment .

i 'm suddenly self-conscious of the ornate , elegant decor .

i know emerson has money now and everything , but the decadence of my grandparents ' apartment still has me feeling very uncool .

`` i know , this place is a bit much , '' i say nervously , watching his blue eyes rove around the space .

`` but , you know , it 's my grandparents ' .

they 're not exactly hip to the whole minimalism , eco-friendly movement .

actually , they 're stopping by soon for a little birthday celebration . ''

`` frank and jillian ? ''

emerson asks , laying on a parody of his most proper , upper-class voice .

`` what a delight ! ''

`` yeah .

not my idea of a good time , but they 're family .

and they 've also been supporting me my entire life .

so i can handle a bit of waspy tension once in a while , '' i reply .

`` i 'll be sure to get out of here before they show up , '' emerson says , `` would n't want anyone to have a heart attack on your birthday . ''

`` i 'm sure they 'd be happy to see you , '' i offer .

we look at each other for a moment before busting out laughing .

emerson is the last person on the planet my grandparents would want to run into , billionaire or no .

`` i doubt they 'd be impressed by something as gauche as 'new money ' , '' emerson chortles , settling down on the couch .

`` yes , how dare you be successful in this economy , young man , '' i reply , doing my best frank rowan impression as i settle down beside emerson .

we sit next to each other and lapse into silence .

i guess this is the moment where we 're supposed to address what went down last night , but it 's always hard to start .

`` i hope you do n't mind my swinging by , '' emerson begins , `` i know it 's an uninvited visit , but i wanted to talk to you before we got back into the office on monday . ''

`` right , '' i laugh , `` yeah , that might have been awkward . ''

`` i also did n't want to let the day pass without wishing you a happy birthday , '' he goes on , training those gorgeous eyes on me .
