who the hell did that belong to ?

a whimper escaped her lips .

oh god , had she actually slept with a man she had no memory of ?

never in her life had she made such a mistake as that .

nausea overcame her , and she knew she needed to get out of bed and into the bathroom .

she shoved herself so hard away from the person that she ended up elbowing him in the ribs .

he groaned .

`` oh , i 'm sorry .

i did n't mean to hurt you , '' she quickly apologized .

`` it 's okay , megan , '' he murmured drowsily .

that voice .

it took only a second for her to register who she was in bed with .

and with that realization , everything from the night before came crashing down on her .

she had accidentally gotten drunk off her ass , pesh had taken her to his house to sober up , and then ... oh god , she had come on to him like a brazen floozy .

she buried her head in her hands and moaned .

`` hey , how do you feel this morning ? ''

he asked .

`` like i 've been run over by a truck . ''

`` want me to fix you a good hangover cure ? ''

she peeked at him through her fingers .

`` you actually know a hangover cure ? ''

he smiled .

`` you think someone like me has never been drunk ? ''

when she bobbed her head , he laughed .

`` i 'm sorry to disappoint you , but there have been many , many times i 've woken up just as you are now . ''

`` that 's hard to imagine . ''

she gazed down at the scrubs and t-shirt she was in .

although she doubted it , she could n't help but ask .

`` did we ... '' `` no , we did n't . ''

she arched her brows in surprise .

`` if we did n't sleep together , then why did you ... i mean , why are you in bed with me ? ''

`` because you begged me to stay . ''

she gasped in horror .

was n't it enough that she had thrown herself so wantonly at him , but now she 'd begged him to stay with her ?

`` i did ? ''

he nodded .

`` you said you did n't want to be alone . ''

vaguely she remembered pleading with him to lie close to her .

what a nightmare .

`` i 'm so sorry . ''

`` do n't apologize . ''

when she started to protest , he held up a hand .

`` i have to admit it was nice being in bed with someone again-feeling their warmth , the softness of their body as they lay beside you . ''

he swallowed hard .

`` i 've missed that more than i knew . ''

overcome with the emotions threatening to overtake her , megan did n't know what to say .

all she knew is she needed to get out of there .

`` i need to get home ... or to emma 's .

i ca n't let my parents think i stayed out all night with a man i just met . ''

`` i understand .

i would n't dream of compromising your reputation . ''

she stared at him for a moment .

sometimes the way he spoke made it seem like he was from a different world or time period .

`` i , uh , i need to use the bathroom . ''

`` go ahead . ''

tumbling out of the covers , she then streaked across the room .

once she closed the door behind her , she exhaled the breath she 'd been holding .

she made it to the toilet just in time to throw up again .

she wondered after doing the same thing the night before how there was anything left in her stomach to empty .

once she finished , she leaned over the sink , pooling water in her hand before bringing it to her mouth .

after gargling to rid herself of the nasty taste , she eventually dug under the counter for some mouthwash , and then brushed her teeth .

without a hairbrush or comb , she did her best to tame her out-of-control hair .

once she surmised that she looked presentable enough to face the firing squad , aka aidan and emma , she left the bathroom .

pesh had thrown on some clothes and stood in the middle of the room .

he raised his brows expectantly at her .

`` i 'm ready to go now . ''

`` of course . ''

when she started for the bedroom door , she abruptly stopped .

`` wait , my dress ? ''

`` i 'll send it out to be dry cleaned . ''

`` oh , '' she murmured .

`` thank you . ''

in silence , they made their way through the house .

megan tried not to be so obvious as she took in the high ceilings of the living room , the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked a large , spacious yard .

pesh had an amazing house-one that was far too big for just him .

it certainly was made for a family-the one he sadly did n't have .

as he started to open the door leading out to the garage for her , pesh stopped and turned around .

staring intently at her , he said , `` i 'd like to see you again . ''

megan could n't help the shocked gasp that escaped her lips .
