`` no , never . ''

`` do you have trouble maintaining an erection ? ''

`` i could once again point out that you had personal knowledge of how well i was able to maintain myself once aroused , but i 'll refrain .

instead , i 'll say no . ''

`` ha , ha , nice way to get your point in . ''

`` i had to try . ''

she cocked her head at him , giving him a teasing smile .

`` if a patient was trying to flirt as much as you are during my questioning , then i would have to remind him that i am a professional . ''

`` i see .

then forgive me for trying to undermine your professionalism . ''

`` you 're forgiven ... for now . ''

he took a long swig of his iced tea .

`` you did really well back there . ''

`` really ? ''

`` yes , you did .

for that to be your first case on your own , you managed to keep yourself together and to give the patient the best level of diagnosis and care you could . ''

she could n't help the warmth rushing to her cheeks that his compliments caused .

`` thank you .

i appreciate your confidence . ''

`` i think you 're going to make an amazing nurse .

i know that there will be many hospitals vying to hire you . ''

megan shook her head .

`` i do n't know about that . ''

`` do n't underestimate your talents . ''

`` you think they would want to hire me here ? ''

she asked .

his brows rose in surprise .

`` you would n't mind a permanent placement here ? ''

she shrugged .

`` it has n't been long , but i have been happy here .

i like the people i work with .

i guess i would n't want to go into the unknown when i know what i have here . ''

he swallowed a bite of his rice .

`` that 's understandable . ''

after wiping his mouth , he smiled at her .

`` i think they would be crazy not to make you an offer . ''

`` i hope so . ''

leaning in over his plate , he held her gaze .

the intensity in which he stared at her caused her to shudder .

she did n't like the effect he was having on her in the middle of the hospital cafeteria .

a mixture of emotions coursed through her-warmth , safety , lust , happiness .

she had n't experienced that range of feelings with a man in a long , long time .

finally , he spoke .

`` i know it would make me very happy to have you here , and i would do everything within my power to ensure you stayed . ''

before she could reply , a tray smacked down onto the table next to her .

one of the residents , a young male named dr. morris , grinned at the two of them .

`` so , i hear you two just handled a priapism case . ''

`` yeah , we did , '' megan replied .

she did n't dare look back at pesh to gage his expression on being interrupted .

dr. morris groaned .

`` oh come on .

give me the juicy details .

i have n't gotten to see one of those yet .

the best groin swelling i 've had is when some idiot tried to pierce his balls , and they got infected . ''

when megan wrinkled her nose , pesh 's laughter surprised her .

her gaze flew to him , and he winked .

`` i told you that the conversations we had over dinner were not exactly appetizing . ''

`` i 'm starting to believe you , '' she replied , with a smile .

somehow she managed to devour the rest of her salad while pesh told dr. morris the ins and outs of the case .

after she finished , she rose out of her chair .

`` i guess i better head back .

you know , with everything being so crazy . ''

surprisingly , pesh did n't get up nor did he offer to walk her back .

instead , she saw an acceptance on his face that told her he was letting her go so there would be no suspicion raised about the two of them .

`` thank you for dinner , '' she said .

`` you 're welcome , '' he replied , with a smile .

his smiles were starting to do something to her that she did n't like .

they were no longer igniting her panties on fire ; instead , they were making her long to spend time with him .

she quickly slung her purse over her shoulder and strode out of the cafeteria .

with the chaos surrounding her , she thankfully put pesh out of her mind for the rest of the evening .

chapter ten after two exhausting weeks in her clinicals , megan was ready for a little randr .

so she was thrilled when emma called her asking if she wanted to join her for a girl 's day .

she was even more stoked when emma said that aidan was willing to keep mason , so he and noah could play together .

even though she was sure her parents would have watched him , she hated imposing on them so much .

an hour after the call , she was pulling into aidan and emma 's driveway .

when she opened the backseat to get mason out , he was already bopping up and down in his car seat with excitement .
