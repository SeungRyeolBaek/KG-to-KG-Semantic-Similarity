`` yes fucking way , i assure you , '' i reply .

`` come on .

gim me one . ''

`` if you do n't mind my saying , '' he goes on , passing me his pack of camels and a lighter , `` smoking does n't really seem like your kind of thing . ''

`` there are lots of things you do n't know about me , emerson , '' i reply , plucking out a cigarette and lighting it up .

`` but if you 're real nice to me , i might just tell you a couple . ''

he stares at me for a long , silent moment .

the same look he trained on me the night of the party-in the closet when i handed him my panties , when he caught me in his arms after i fell-is there in his eyes again now .

i do my best to draw deep breaths , hoping he ca n't read my thoughts .

my desires .

but instead of giving me any sort of clue as to what he 's thinking , he just starts the car and drives off toward town .

we zoom along in silence , unsure of what to say .

or at least , i 'm unsure .

maybe he just does n't care to spare any words on me .

after a while , he flips on the car radio .

a song by the foo fighters comes on , and i sit up a little in my seat .

they 're one of my favorite bands-just heavy enough for my taste .

i start singing along , nodding my head with the beat .

emerson lets out a short , surprised laugh .

`` would have taken you for more of a taylor swift kind of girl , '' he says over the music .

`` but i 'm not supposed to make assumptions about you anymore , right ? ''

`` that 's right , '' i smile .

`` can i at least assume that you 'll want dinner at some point tonight ? ''

he asks .

i have to fight hard from letting a dopey , love-struck look escape across my features .

he just wants to grab food .

it 's not a date .

i just happen to be along for the ride .

but still .

`` yeah , i 'm starving , '' i tell him .

`` great .

me too .

let 's swing by the crystal dawn , '' he says , turning off onto a main road in town .

chapter three the crystal dawn is our local diner , frequented by just about everyone in our relatively small town .

high school kids , senior citizens , working class parents-no one can resist the crystal 's dawn 's greasy spoon appeal .

emerson rolls up to the silver diner and swings into a parking space , cutting off another car with a laugh .

`` do you just go out of your way to antagonize people ? ''

i ask , stepping onto the sidewalk .

`` i do n't mean to antagonize them .

most people just happen to be assholes .

i just treat them the way they deserve . ''

he shrugs , tossing his smoke into the gutter .

i follow suit , relishing my final drag .

it 's been over a year since i 've had a cigarette .

damn , do i miss them sometimes .

`` what a charming attitude , '' i say , rolling my eyes .

`` thanks sis , '' emerson winks , holding the door open for me like a real gentleman .

or so i think , until he lets it fall in my face at the last possible second .

yeah .

maybe all this lovey-dovey nonsense is just in my head after all .

we walk across the crowded dining car , over to a red vinyl booth in the back corner .

one of the regular waitresses , a woman in her forties with heavy blue eye shadow and a perm , plunks a couple of menus down onto the table .

we do n't even have to look at them , of course .

we 've both lived in this town long enough to know exactly what we want .

it 's said that you can tell a lot about a person by their usual crystal dawn order .

`` what 're you having ? ''

i ask emerson with a playfully grave tone .

he wiggles his eyebrows conspiratorially , perfectly aware of the weight of the question .

`` bacon burger .

medium rare .

chipotle mayo . ''

`` of course you 're a raging carnivore , '' i groan , shaking my head .

`` well , what are you getting ? ''

he shoots back .

`` broccoli and cheese soup in a bread bowl , '' i smile .

`` wait , '' he replies , laying his hands on the table .

`` you 're not ... a vegetarian , are you ? ''

`` i sure am , '' i reply with a chipper smile .

`` of fucking course , '' he grumbles , looking downright appalled .

`` you know factory farming is destroying our planet , right ? ''

i tease him , putting on my best goodie-two-shoes voice .

`` you know that tofu is a sin against humanity , right ? ''

he shoots back .

that one takes me by surprise , drawing a real laugh out of me for once .

`` to be perfectly honest , i did n't start being a vegetarian for the environment 's sake , '' i tell him .

`` i wish i was that noble .

but the real reason is way stupider . ''
