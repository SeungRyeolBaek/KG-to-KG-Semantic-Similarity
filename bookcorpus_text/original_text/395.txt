`` no way , '' she said adamantly .

`` dad , you cooked dinner so i 'll clean up .

it 's obvious that you and rais have lots to talk about so i 'll do the dishes , '' she countered , starting to take the dishes out of his hands but he just pulled them out of her reach and shook his head .

he could n't look at her as cleared the table , chuckling softly at her feeble attempt .

`` we 've been talking all through dinner .

you two go out there and catch up and i 'll just finish the dishes in here . ''

again ?

why was her father doing this to her ?

`` i 'd better be heading back to town , '' she said instead .

`` but you have n't even seen the beauties , '' her father countered , looking over his shoulder at her with a worried expression .

`` besides , i thought you were staying overnight .

did n't you bring your bag with a change of clothes ?

if not , you know there are plenty of clothes still here for you .

rais , how about if you take her out to the stables see them ?

they 're yours anyway . ''

he turned back to rachel with a huge grin on his face .

`` you 're going to love these guys , rachel .

i 've never seen anything quite like them in my life , and that 's saying a lot . ''

rachel knew he was discussing some new horses rais had recently purchased , but the very last thing she wanted to do was go out to the stables in the dark with rais .

`` that 's okay ... '' `` nonsense , '' rais argued , stepping in quickly as he suspected she was too nervous to be alone with him .

`` go change clothes .

you ca n't go into the stables like that . ''

rachel felt like her whole body was on fire when his eyes traveled down her figure , looking at the lavender straight skirt and cotton shirt she 'd donned this morning .

she was even wearing matching lavender shoes which had felt so special earlier in the day , but now she just felt dumpy knowing that the women he normally associated with could afford much better , more expensive clothes .

outfits that did n't droop by the end of the day as this one was doing .

rachel bit her lip in indecision .

she wanted to see what were obviously new horses , but she did n't want to be alone with rais .

she 'd seen him in action too many times over the years , spying on him from the loft in the stables or from the rose garden , from an empty stall or in various places where she could see him with his lady loves .

she 'd always admired the way he would move in closer , stealing a kiss that would eventually lead to more with his expert seduction .

sometimes much more .

`` i ... '' she was stumped .

`` it can wait . ''

he moved in closer , unwilling to give her a reprieve .

`` are you afraid to be alone with me ? ''

he asked gently , forcing her eyes to look into his and reading that fear , that anticipation .

she could n't speak for a long moment , too stunned to hear him ask such a blatant question .

she sputtered , trying to jump start her brain and give him a firm set down , or just a flip response .

unfortunately , nothing came to mind and her only defense was to step around him and shake her head in denial .

`` rais , i 'm really tired .

i think i 'll pass tonight . ''

he would n't take no for an answer .

`` if you wo n't change clothes , you 'll just have to go out like that , '' he said , ignoring her comment about passing on the sights and taking her hand in his , dragging her out into the darkness and closing the door behind them .

as the night air closed around them , he slowed down and pulled her closer , tucking her arm into his .

`` see ?

this is n't so bad , '' he said and smiled down into her nervous eyes .

rachel tried to pull her hand off of his arm , but he held it in place and kept on walking .

`` you look beautiful in that color , by the way , '' he commented .

rachel tried to ignore the coziness of the atmosphere , the intimacy of the darkness which made everything else fade into the background .

`` thank you , '' she said , clearing her throat and pretending to look around .

`` what are you going to show me ? ''

`` some new horses i think you 'll like . ''

rachel loved horses , loved riding and just being around the strong , gentle creatures .

`` why are they so special ? ''

she asked , becoming interested despite her nervousness and irritation with his commanding attitude .

he opened the heavy door to the stables and they were immediately enveloped into the warmer , more humid air that kept the horses comfortable during the colder autumn and winter months .

`` you 'll see , '' he said with a mysterious smile .

he led her down to the third stall and opened the top gate .

`` what do you think ? ''

he asked and stepped back , letting her peer inside .

rachel looked at his handsome face filled with excitement and had to smile herself .
