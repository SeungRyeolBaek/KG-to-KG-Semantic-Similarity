she smiled up at him .

`` i 've done the career part , malik . ''

she took a deep breath and forged on , determined to be brave and honest with him .

`` and i did n't like life without you . ''

`` i hated being married to that woman , siri .

you 're the only woman i ever wanted by my side . ''

`` why did you marry her then ? ''

`` my father ordered it .

and i did n't have time to figure out an alternative before the wedding .

i was cornered and it took me all this time to work a solution for the tribes in the northern area of the country to get along without the marriage .

my ex-wife and i both worked hard over the years to make sure that any kind of separation between us would n't impact the peace .

she 's a good woman , but not the one for me .

only you are that woman . ''

she ran her fingers over his arm , feeling the hair against his warm skin and loving him even more for all of his dedication .

`` i ca n't believe your ex-wife was willing to give you up . ''

he shrugged and looked down at her .

`` she was n't really into me , '' he explained diplomatically .

she thought about it for a moment , and came up with the right explanation .

`` she was a lesbian ? ''

`` yes . ''

`` so that 's why you did n't have any children with her ? ''

`` exactly . ''

`` she was an idiot , '' siri replied , leaning her head against his shoulder weakly .

he laughed softly and squeezed her shoulders .

`` she would have loved you ! ''

siri smacked his thigh , but there was no force behind her movement .

`` i 'm sorry you were so worried about what was happening , '' he finally said .

`` do you want to move anywhere ?

i 'm fine with you right here , just trying to figure out what 's going on with you lately . ''

siri smiled and shook her head .

`` no .

i 'm fine right here . ''

he nodded his head .

`` how long is this going to last ? ''

he asked .

siri thought about it for a moment and then tensed .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

he asked , feeling her body change and becoming alarmed .

`` malik , remember that first night we were together ? ''

`` yes . ''

`` did you happen to use a condom ? ''

he stilled as he thought back to that night .

`` yes .

hell , '' he cursed quietly .

`` it might have broken .

i was n't sure and completely forgot to mention it . ''

she laughed and put her hand on his chest .

`` how soon is the wedding ? ''

`` as soon as we get back to duban .

everything is arranged which is what took me so long to get back here .

i wanted everything ready so you could n't wiggle out of the ceremony . ''

`` would you mind terribly if we left maybe this afternoon ? ''

`` are you telling me ... ? ''

`` yes .

i think we 're going to have another little one running around whatever palace you 're going to make us live in . ''

malik picked her up and hugged her gently , careful not to upset her stomach again .

`` i love you , '' he said as he kissed her gently .

epilogue malik strode down the hallway , his steps eating up the distance between his office and the gymnasium .

his aide had just whispered in his ear and he was rushing to stop imminent catastrophe .

he heard their words before he reached the room , but he hurried even faster , wary of any of them demonstrating their skills .

`` stop ! ''

he commanded as soon as he entered the room .

four sets of eyes looked over at him , all of them wary and all wondering why he would be discouraging the use of their combat skills when he 'd taught them so well over the past several years .

`` danika , get off jacob immediately , '' he said , then turned to see his other two children .

`` samuel , you may not put your sister in a head lock ! ''

he ordered .

siri rushed into the room , already out of breath herself .

she 'd obviously received the same message and was here to stop her children from hurting each other as well .

`` good grief , '' she whispered as she noticed jacob glaring at his younger sister and samuel looking smug as lila brushed herself off .

`` what 's going on ? ''

malik turned so his back was facing his four children .

in this way , siri was the only one to see his amusement .

`` our children decided they were ready for real combat and thought they should fight to the death here . ''

siri glanced around , her mouth hanging open slightly in horror .

`` danika !

you 're three years old !

you can not fight to the death at three years old ! ''

danika humphed and looked at her sister who was a year older .

`` lila started it .

samuel said he knew more than she did so he said he could win . ''

malik 's shoulders shook and she glared back at him as well .

`` you 're actually to blame for this ! ''
