when she wavered on her feet like she was going to collapse , pesh tumbled off the couch , reaching out for her .

grabbing both of her shoulders , he steadied her .

she glanced down at her dress before gazing back at him .

pesh 's heart ached at the sight of tears pooling in her eyes .

`` are you all right ? ''

her chin trembled before big , fat tears slid down her cheeks .

`` oh god , '' she whispered .

`` please do n't cry . ''

`` t-this is s-so embarrassing , '' she hiccupped .

`` it 's okay .

you do n't have to be embarrassed . ''

moaning , she covered her face with her hands .

`` first , i made a fool out of myself coming on to you and now i 've puked in front of you like some sorority girl who ca n't handle her liquor . ''

`` stop beating yourself up .

come , let 's get you cleaned up . ''

he slid an arm around her waist to steady her on their way down the hall to the bedroom .

she continued to weep softly as they made their way into the bathroom .

using his free hand , he flicked on the light .

`` can you stand in the shower ? ''

with a weak nod , she replied , `` i think so . ''

`` if not , there 's a ledge you can sit on .

let me turn on the water for you , and i 'll get you a towel . ''

he propped her up against the counter before striding over to the shower .

once he felt the water was a good enough temperature , he then went over to the closet .

he pulled out a towel before returning to megan who had her head in her hands .

with his free hand , he took one of her hands and pulled it away from her face .

`` please stop beating yourself up .

i hate to see you so upset . ''

`` i ca n't help it .

i 'm such a fool . ''

`` no , if you 're a fool , then so am i .

we both wanted each other . ''

`` but i got drunk ... i never get drunk anymore . ''

`` it was an accident .

things like that happen . ''

he cupped her chin and forced her to look at him .

`` you are none of the negative things your mind is calling you right now . ''

`` really ? ''

her broken expression , coupled with her need for his reassurance , nearly crushed him .

he had to fight from taking her in his arms .

he knew if he did that , he would end up doing something he should n't with her .

finally , he nodded .

`` but you do smell , so go on and get in the shower . ''

the corners of her lips curved up in a half smile .

`` do you have something i can change into ?

and maybe a toothbrush ? ''

he nodded .

`` one second . ''

leaving her in the bathroom , he went back into the bedroom to his closet .

he took out a pair of scrubs he knew would be too big and too long for her and then coupled it with an emory university t-shirt .

when he got back to the bathroom , megan was struggling with the zipper at the back of her dress .

with a defeated expression , she dropped her hands .

`` could you please help me ? ''

`` of course . ''

he sat the clothes down on the counter .

he then reached up to tug down the zipper .

the back of the dress gaped open , exposing her cream colored skin and navy blue lace bra and panties .

he closed his eyes to try and block out the glaring images rocketing through his mind .

his lips on her skin , his tongue licking up her spine , his hands curving around her ribcage to cup her br**sts .

he forced himself to step back .

clearing his throat , he replied , `` done . ''

glancing at him over her shoulder , megan gave him a weak smile .

`` thank you . ''

he took out a spare toothbrush from underneath the counter and placed it next to the clothes he 'd brought her .

`` let me know if you need anything else . ''

`` okay . ''

whirling around , he strode out of the bathroom .

not wanting to go too far in case megan needed him , he began pacing around the bedroom .

he momentarily faltered when he heard the shower turn off .

he waited for her to appear , but she did n't .

just as he was about to knock on the door , the whirring hum of the hairdryer started .

he continued his pacing as she dried her hair .

next , he heard the sink water turn on as she brushed her teeth .

when it was quiet once again in the bathroom , his feet froze as he stared anxiously at the bathroom door .

when it opened , pesh 's breath caught .

appearing fresh-faced and clean , megan looked so beautiful as she tentatively stepped into the bedroom .

`` everything okay ? ''

he asked .

she jumped at his voice .

`` um , it 's fine .

thank you again for the clothes and for letting me shower . ''

`` you 're more than welcome .

and there 's no need to thank me . ''

chewing on her lip , she glanced from the bed to him .
