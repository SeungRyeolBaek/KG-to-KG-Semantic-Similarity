it 's not fancy , but it 's one of my favorite places in the world . ''

his face takes on a cast of sadness as he talks about his dad .

it occurs to me that i barely know anything about emerson 's father , or what happened to him .

i try to open up the conversation as delicately as possible .

`` does he still live around here , your dad ? ''

i ask carefully , reaching for another biscuit .

`` in a way , '' emerson laughs roughly .

`` i mean , he 's still in the state .

or should i say , in state . ''

`` your dad 's ... incarcerated ? ''

i ask , pausing in my one-woman biscuit-scarfing contest .

`` you do n't have to be so formal about it , '' emerson replies .

`` he 's locked up .

has been for most of my life . ''

`` wow ... '' i breathe , unsure of what to say .

`` that 's ... so rough .

i 'm sorry . ''

`` i 'm pretty used to the arrangement by now , '' he says .

`` but thanks . ''

`` do you mind if i ask ... i mean , you do n't have to go into it ... '' i fumble .

`` no , it 's ok , '' emerson replies , `` you 've told me so much about your past , it 's only fair that i be open with you too . ''

we pause our conversation long enough to place our orders with the young , friendly waitress .

once she 's taken our menus away and left us alone once more emerson takes a breath and begins .

`` my parents got married pretty young , '' he tells me , `` for a while , they really were happy .

they never had much in the way of money , but when you look at old pictures of them , it always looks like they 're having a blast .

it was n't until they started trying to start a family that things got sort of ... complicated . ''

`` complicated how ? ''

i ask .

`` complicated in that it did n't work for them at first , '' emerson goes on .

`` they kept trying to get pregnant without any luck .

their doctors told them that fertility treatments , ivf and all , might help things along .

the problem is , those treatments cost money , and my parents did n't have any .

but they were hell bent on having a kid , so my dad-peter-decided to get a little creative with the whole money-making thing . ''

`` and when you say creative ... '' i prompt him .

`` i mean he started selling drugs to make some extra money , '' emerson says bluntly .

`` nothing major .

just weed , mostly .

and it worked , too-they were able to rake in enough extra cash that ivf was suddenly on the table .

my mom was finally able to get pregnant with yours truly .

which was all well and good , until i was eight or so .

that 's when the dealing finally caught up with my dad .

he was n't just selling the drugs .

both my parents had already started having issues with substance abuse by then , and my dad got in a really nasty car accident while under the influence that brought everything out into the open .

he went away , my mom got worse , and i was left to take care of it all .

i did , too .

i have been since i was eight .

i mean , it 's because they wanted me so badly that they started down that road at all .

it only seems fair , you know ? ''

`` emerson , '' i say softly , reaching for his hands across the table , `` you know that none of that is your fault , right ? ''

`` oh , sure , '' emerson shrugs , `` i know that .

in theory .

but it 's hard not to feel kind of obligated to them now , no matter how badly they mess up . ''

`` i know what you mean , '' i nod , `` i feel the same way about my dad .

like , since he lost mom , i always have to be there for him , even if he barely gives me the time of day . ''

`` look at us , '' emerson laughs , `` a couple of bleeding hearts . ''

`` i guess so , '' i smile .

our bountiful plates of food arrive-crab cakes for emerson , vegetable pot pie for me-and we dig in eagerly , plowing through every bite of buttery , flavorful goodness .

we even go in for a couple slices of blueberry pie to top things off .

i 'm surprised we do n't roll out of the restaurant at the end of our meal .

by the time we make it back to the motel , we 're happy , sleepy , and more than a little handsy .

my every nerve sizzles with anticipation as emerson unlocks our motel room love nest and walks in before me .

he flops onto the soft queen bed , and i tentatively ease myself down next to him .

the whole being-alone thing is still so novel for us that i find myself feeling a little shy .

emerson can sense that i 'm still getting my bearings , so he just lets me curl against his side there on the bed .

his arms close around me as i press my back against his chest .
