`` what 's wrong ? ''

allison gasps .

the waiter walks over and is about to ask for our drink orders but they wave him away .

`` it 's ... it 's ... '' i grab a napkin to hide my face and try to take deep breaths .

`` is it a boy ? ''

miriam guesses .

i nod .

`` nate . ''

`` wait , wait ... not your stepbrother ? ''

she asks incredulously .

allison glances at me and i nod at her .

she turns to miriam .

`` they started , you know , seeing each other over the summer ... but i guess something happened , '' she fills miriam in .

`` long story short , '' i say , catching my breath .

`` pierce is a jerk , our parents got divorced , and we broke up . ''

`` wow , '' miriam breathes , her eyes wide .

`` you had quite the summer . ''

`` tell me about it , '' i say with a wry smile .

`` i could really use a drink . ''

allison flags down the waiter , and by the time our first round has arrived , my tears have stopped .

`` so , can i tell you guys my own secret ? ''

miriam asks , leaning over the table conspiratorially .

allison and i nod .

`` i had sex ! ''

`` oh , god , now i 'm the only virgin , '' allison moans .

`` how was it ? ''

`` honestly ... not that great the first time .

but the third time , i think i had an orgasm , '' miriam whispers .

`` you think ? ''

allison asks , cocking her head in confusion .

`` yeah , i think .

what about you , brynn ? ''

`` what ? ''

`` did you and nate ... '' she trails off suggestively .

`` um , yes . ''

`` and ? ''

allison leans forward .

my heartbeat quickens at the memory of his touch before sadness washes over me .

i shake my head .

`` i 'd rather not think about it . ''

i finish the rest of the dinner trying to engage in the conversation , but knowing that i 'm often forcing the smile on my face .

allison and miriam do their best to raise my spirits , and i try to act excited about classes starting on monday , but my mind , and my heart , are n't quite in it .

after i pay the bill , allison and miriam volunteer to walk me back to my room , but i demur , feeling like a walk by myself before bed .

after i hug them goodbye , i stroll along the edge of campus , watching all the action unfold as everyone enjoys the last weekend free of homework .

it 's not long before i realize my feet are leading me past the crew house .

just a quick look , i tell myself .

i begin to walk more slowly as i see it up the street .

the lights are on inside the house , and i can see some people hanging out on the front porch .

the late summer night has just darkened , and i stand under a street light peering up at the house .

i can see several of the crew guys up there , and a petite blonde leaning on the railing with her back toward me .

the front door swings open and i press my lips together as i see nate walk out with two bottles of beer in his hand .

he 's so close ... just across the street and up the hill , and yet i ca n't be with him , this person with whom i 've shared such intimate moments .

my heart stops as he smiles at the blonde .

it ca n't be ... he ca n't have moved on already .

but there he is , offering her one of the beers , and sitting down next to her on the railing and wrapping an arm around her shoulders .

a chill comes over me despite the warm air .

i really am a fool .

i jump as a bottle crashes on a campus path just behind me .

i glance up to see the denizens of the porch also looking at the source of the sound , and freeze for a moment as nate stares right at me .

fuck .

i turn around , cursing myself for walking this way .

i walk quickly down the street , turning right onto a path to take me into campus .

`` brynn ? ''

i hear him call out behind me , and the sound of footsteps coming down the steps .

i pick up my pace , hoping to lose him in the darkness .

i ca n't let our first meeting after breaking up be him finding me spying on his house .

`` brynn ! ''

i hear a woman 's voice yell behind me , and almost trip over my own feet in surprise .

`` brynn ! ''

she calls again , and i turn around .

`` eileen , '' i say in surprise as she emerges out of the darkness , slightly out of breath .

`` was ... was that you up there ?

with nate ? ''

she nods , a wide smile covering her face .

my eyes dart over his shoulder as i see nate stop by the entrance to the path .

`` i 'm down here visiting him for the weekend , '' she says happily .

`` oh , oh , '' i murmur , covering my face in embarrassment .
