`` oh , '' i breathe , very aware of the slender space between us .

`` thanks , emerson . ''

`` has it been a good one so far ? ''

he asks softly .

`` it just got a lot better , to tell you the truth , '' i reply , my voice low and quiet .

i feel that panicked resistance rising in me the more my want of him grows , but i force myself to get through it .

deal with it .

i wo n't let my own fears fuck this moment up .

`` i 'm glad to hear it , '' emerson smiles , `` and i hope this is n't too forward , but i also wanted to make sure to give you your birthday present before the day was out . ''

`` what ? ''

i laugh , turning to face him on the couch .

`` what do you mean , present ?

we only just ran into each other two days ago .

how did you already- ? ''

`` let 's just say i 've been holding onto it for a while , '' he says , reaching into the pocket of his jeans .

`` about eight years , as a matter of fact . ''

the world grinds to a halt around me as he produces a simple black ring box .

i stare at the tiny gift , my mind and heart making the obvious leap .

emerson watches my jaw hit the floor and rushes to assure me .

`` oh god .

do n't worry .

i would n't do that to you , '' he laughs .

`` right , '' i breathe , `` of course . ''

he goes to hand me the box , but at the last second holds it up over his head , out of my reach .

his favorite old joke from when we were kids .

and given that he 's got even more height on me now , the joke holds .

i give him a playful shove , and he finally hands the box to me .

my hands tremble as i force a placid smile onto my face and open the ring box .

am i relieved that he did n't just whip out an engagement ring , or was some ridiculous little corner of my mind hoping that he was going to ?

whatever the case may be , the question fades out of my mind as i lift the lid of the box and see what 's inside .

it 's a delicate silver ring , set with one gleaming freshwater pearl .

i know i 've seen this ring before .

but where ?

`` when we were at the beach for our birthdays , all those years ago , '' emerson says , watching me intently , `` we stopped at that one shop you liked so much in town , with all those handmade crafts and things .

you stared at this ring for a good five minutes , just admiring it .

you did n't say anything , of course , but i knew you loved it .

i waited until you were trying things on in the dressing room and bought it for you .

for your eighteenth birthday .

but with everything that actually ended up happening that day ... i never got a chance to give it to you .

well .

until now , that is . ''

`` you 've ... held onto this the whole time ? ''

i whisper , looking up at him in wonder , `` you 've had this ring for eight years , emerson ? ''

`` i guess some part of me always hoped i 'd have the chance to give it to you someday , '' he says softly .

`` and would you look at that ?

here you are . ''

`` here i am , '' i smile .

`` i never forgot about you , abby , '' he says , resting a hand on mine , `` not for a second .

through every other relationship , and date , and fling , i always had you at the back of my mind .

no one ever measured up to you .

i 'm not blaming you for my lack of committed relationships , of course .

it 's just ... i never wanted to settle down with anyone else .

because the person i really cared about was still out there .

only , i 'd already met and lost her . ''

`` you did n't lose me , '' i whisper , lacing my fingers through his .

`` we just ... misplaced each other for a while . ''

`` i 'll take that , '' he smiles , inching toward me .

i force myself to take a deep breath as we move closer , and closer .

the heat and nearness of him are making my head spin , and that 's not all .

i clench my thighs together , acutely aware of the throbbing need building between my legs .

just being close to him , alone in this room , is enough to turn me on .

it dawns on me , for the first time , that i do n't have say `` no '' in this moment .

nothing is stopping me from being with emerson the way i want to be .

`` god , i 've missed you , '' emerson murmurs fiercely , catching my face in hands .

`` well .

you know how i feel about showing and telling , sawyer , '' i whisper , my voice low and rasping with want .

`` that i do , '' he grins , those blue eyes mere inches from mine .
