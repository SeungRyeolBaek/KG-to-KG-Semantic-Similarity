`` yes and no , '' pesh replied .

`` what the hell does that mean ? ''

she asked , jerking her wild gaze to his .

he chuckled .

`` see the black knob there labeled 'throttle ' ? ''

`` yeah . ''

`` look at it this way .

you know when you 're in a car and you 're going downhill , you pick up speed ? ''

megan nodded .

`` it 's the same thing in a plane .

but if you pull on the throttle knob , it reduces the engine power so there wo n't be an increase in speed . ''

with her fingers grasping the black knob , megan asked , `` how hard do i need to pull on it ? ''

`` try pulling back half-way . ''

after pulling on the knob , megan eyed the speed .

`` we 're slowing down . ''

`` good . ''

`` are we at ninety knots ? ''

megan glanced down .

`` yeah . ''

`` okay , then lower the nose just a little bit .

that will give us a glide-path or a controlled descent . ''

megan eased on the steering wheel until the nose of the plane dipped below the horizon .

`` now put the landing gear in the down position , '' pesh instructed .

`` is that the button with the little tire on it ? ''

`` yep , that 's the one . ''

megan pressed it .

`` got it . ''

`` using the steering wheel , roll the wings a little to the right , so we 're lined back up with the runway . ''

megan turned the steering wheel to the right a little too abruptly .

`` oops , '' she replied .

`` it 's okay .

just level it out .

you always want your runway target spot to stay in the same fixed spot on the windshield . ''

as megan stared ahead , she realized how close they were getting to the runway , and in turn , the ground .

suddenly she was n't so sure if she could land the plane .

it was one thing taking off , but it seemed like there was so much more that could go wrong when landing .

`` u-uh , p-pesh , '' she stammered .

`` yeah ? ''

he asked casually .

`` i do n't think i can do this . ''

she cut her eyes over to him .

`` i ca n't land the plane .

it 's too scary . ''

`` yes , you can . ''

megan shook her head furiously back and forth .

`` no really .

you need to take back the controls .

i could cause us to crash . ''

`` but i have faith in you . ''

`` really ? ''

`` of course .

i would n't let you do this if i did n't think you could . ''

she stole a glance at him , taking in his earnest expression .

god , he really and truly believed in her .

and it was n't just about the fact they were banging each other every chance they got alone .

no , he saw through to the real her .

after taking a deep breath , she felt herself slowly calming down .

`` fine .

i 'll try , but i 'm not making any promises . ''

`` that 's my girl , '' pesh replied .

`` what should i do now ? ''

`` all right , now you need to pull the throttle all the way out as well as pulling back on the wheel to keep the nose from dipping . ''

clearing her throat that felt as dry as sandpaper , megan jerked on the throttle button before pulling on the steering wheel .

it was a little harder considering how sweaty her hands were .

`` keep it steady .

you 're doing great . ''

as they came closer and closer to the runway , megan fought the urge to close her eyes , but she realized that would not be the right thing to do .

instead , she braced herself for the impact .

the moment the wheels hit the asphalt she shrieked and clutched at the steering wheel .

`` do n't fight the bounce .

we 're fine .

you 're fine . ''

they skidded along the pavement .

`` okay , now ease up on the wheel and push on the tops of both pedals to apply the brakes . ''

without thinking , megan stomped her feet , causing the plane to screech .

`` easy , '' pesh said .

she let her feet off the brakes , and they began to coast .

`` now you 're going to bring it back into the hanger . ''

`` oh , hell no !

i would end up mowing out the side of the building or another plane ! ''

megan cried .

pesh 's amused chuckle died quickly at the death glare she shot him .

`` megan , you 'll do fine .

you just landed a plane .

i think you can handle pulling into a hanger . ''

she scowled at him .

`` fine .

but when you have to file a huge insurance claim , i 'm going to say 'i told you so . ' ''

`` we 'll see , '' he replied .

she could tell he was fighting back a smile the way he kept biting down on his lip .

`` all right , take a right here , '' he said , pointing to where the runaway split .

she turned the wheel to the right and began easing her foot down on the brake when she saw the hangers come into view .
