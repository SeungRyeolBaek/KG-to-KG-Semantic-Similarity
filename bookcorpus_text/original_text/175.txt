`` are you ok to get in by yourself ? ''

nate asks , rolling down the window .

`` oh , yeah , sorry , '' i reply , snapping back to attention .

i open the door and use my left leg to hop into the elevated seat .

`` everything alright ? ''

he asks .

`` yeah , it 's fine . ''

when we arrive back at the house , nate basket-carries me straight from the car into the kitchen , gently setting me down on a chair in the breakfast nook .

he kneels in front of me and unlaces my shoe , then slips it off and peels my sock off .

`` can you wiggle your toes ? ''

i move them back and forth .

`` and now really slowly move your whole foot around . ''

i wince as i circle it and pain shoots up through my leg .

`` i broke my ankle playing lacrosse my junior year , and i do n't think that 's what this is .

let 's ice and wrap it and see how it is tomorrow , or monday .

if it 's still bad , i 'll take you to the doctor . ''

`` you know how to wrap it ? ''

`` hey , when it 's not my own hand , i 'm pretty good at it . ''

i watch him take down that same first aid kit from the cabinet and set it down on the floor as he kneels in front of me again .

he carefully wraps athletic tape around my ankle and then around the middle of my foot , hooking it around and around until my ankle is firmly stabilized .

`` ok , let 's get you into the den so we can ice it . ''

i begin to stand but he bends over and scoops me up again , carrying me through the hallways to the cozy den .

he sets me down on the couch and then disappears .

i grab a pillow and set it behind my back as i stretch my legs out , marveling at the sudden appearance of nate 's caretaker instincts .

he reappears with a ziploc bag of crushed ice and a glass of water , setting the latter down on the table next to me before lowering the ice down onto my ankle .

i shiver as he places it down , and he pulls the throw down from the back of the couch .

he grabs one end and unfolds it , then sits on the edge of the couch next to me to lay it over me , tucking the corners in around my body .

i become very aware of my own breathing as he moves over me .

i watch his hands as they take the edge of the blanket and tuck it around my shoulders .

his right hand moves slowly from the blanket onto the exposed skin of my neck .

i hold my breath as he lightly runs his fingertips up onto my jaw , then over to my chin .

with his thumb and forefinger , he gently tilts my head up until i look at him .

he 's staring at my mouth , and only pauses for a moment before he bends down .

`` please do n't , '' i whisper as he 's just inches away from kissing me .

`` if you do n't want anything more , it 's just cruel . ''

`` what if i do want something more ? ''

he says , his dark blue eyes flicking up to mine .

`` more ... '' i repeat , rolling the word around my tongue .

`` what kind of more ? ''

`` i 've never felt about someone the way i feel about you .

i 've tried fighting that feeling , i 've tried reasoning with it , but it just keeps getting stronger .

i have to give in-i need to .

i ca n't tell you i know exactly what this will look like ... i 've never done anything like it .

but i promise you that when i 'm with you , i 'll be with only you .

and i want you to be with only me . ''

i stare up at him .

that 's still a lot of unknowns , but i sense that he 's giving me everything he can right now .

plus my heart is about to beat out of my chest , and my resistance is giving out .

`` only you , '' i nod , before reaching around his neck and pulling him toward me .

our lips meet in an open kiss , our tongues finding each other 's and mingling with desperate passion .

he presses me back against the cushion , his hands grasping my waist over the blanket and quickly moving up and over my breasts .

i arch my back into him , wanting to feel him against me ... feel him everywhere .

`` you guys home ? ''

nate jumps away as we hear my mom 's voice from the foyer .

he takes a deep breath and then runs his hand through his hair before responding .

`` we 're in the den ! ''

he calls back , then turns to me .

`` tonight , '' he murmurs , his eyes burning with promise .

chapter twenty `` are you ok , brynn ? ''

my mom asks me , frowning .

`` yeah , i 'm fine , '' i reply lightly as i use my napkin to try to clean the tomato sauce off my shirt where i 've just spilled it .

nate 's promise of an evening rendezvous has left me clumsy and distracted throughout dinner .
