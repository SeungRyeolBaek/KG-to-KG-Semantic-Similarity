she squeals , rushing out to join me on the couch .

she stops short at my glazed expression .

`` abby ?

is n't that great ? ''

`` sure , '' i tell her , `` the job is great .

it 's perfect , actually .

amazing company , good salary , nice benefits .

oh !

and emerson sawyer happens to work there , too .

so there 's that . ''

riley stares at me blankly .

i have n't uttered emerson 's name for years-well , not while sober , anyway .

`` are you shitting me ? ''

riley hisses .

`` you saw emerson today ?

at your new company ? ''

`` oh yeah .

he 's going to be showing me the ropes , '' i tell her .

`` or he would be , if i was going to take the job .

which i 'm obviously not . ''

`` excuse me ? ''

riley exclaims .

`` why the hell would you not take it ? ''

`` did you miss the part about emerson working there ? ''

i shoot back .

`` as in my one-time brother , long-lost lover , walked out of my life forever and broke my heart into a million little pieces emerson ? ''

`` no , i caught that loud and clear , '' riley replies , slinging an arm over my shoulder .

`` and there 's no way you 're passing up a dream job because he happens to be working at the same company .

if anything , his working there should be a perk ! ''

`` what , '' i say , narrowing my eyes .

`` now you can rekindle your romance at last ! ''

riley exclaims , `` it 's kismet ! ''

`` it 's a train wreck waiting to happen , '' i correct her .

`` in case you 're forgetting , we did n't exactly end on great footing , emerson and i . ''

`` so what ?

it was your parents who fucked everything up back then , '' riley presses , `` you could totally hit it off now that you 're adults . ''

`` god .

did you give him a pep talk too or something ? ''

i ask , shaking my head , `` he asked me out for a birthday drink about three seconds after we 'd run into each other . ''

`` what ? ! ''

riley shrieks , pulling me to my feet .

`` he asked you out ? !

for when ? ! ''

`` tomorrow , '' i tell her , wiggling out of her excited grasp .

`` but do n't get your hopes up , it 's not happening .

no way .

no how . ''

all at once , riley snaps from giddy girlfriend to drill sergeant mode .

stepping into my path , she plants her hands on her hips and levels a glare at me that could cut through diamond .

`` abigail cecily rowan , '' she begins .

`` for the past eight years , i have watched you pine away for this person , miss him beyond all comprehension , and refuse to get serious with anyone else because no one could ever take his place in your heart .

now , all of a sudden , fate has deposited him back into your lap , and you 're seriously thinking of bailing ?

that , my dear , just will not do .

i am not going to stand by while you flip off destiny and forever ruin your happily-ever-after chances because you 're afraid of getting hurt again .

you will take this job .

you will let emerson back into your life .

and you will start tomorrow with a drink on his birthday .

do i make myself clear ? ''

looking into riley 's furious face , i realize two things .

first , i 've been dying for someone to give me permission to see what happens from here with emerson .

i do n't know how to give it to myself , of course , so thank god she 's here .

second , even if i did n't want to see him ever again , she would make me anyway .

so , this is looking like a win-win .

`` will you at least help me pick out something to wear ? ''

i ask softly .

`` please , '' she scoffs , `` as if i 'd let you dress yourself for something this important . ''

and just like that , the matter is settled .

i let myself consider the possibility that maybe running into emerson today was n't a cruel joke from the universe , but a gift .

a super sexy , super loaded , super intelligent gift wrapped up in an incredible person that i 've loved since i was a kid , that is .

chapter thirteen after trying on twenty outfits , getting in at least three fights with riley , and nearly booking a plane ticket to canada rather than going through with this evening , i make it out the door to meet emerson .

he 's asked me to meet him back on the lower east side , just a stone 's throw from the bastian offices .

i arrive a few minutes after eight and linger on the corner .

the birthday boy is nowhere in sight .

riley dressed me up in a deep red dress with a low-cut back and tasteful scoop neckline .

my blonde hair is arranged in a loose chignon , and the warm spring night does n't even require me to wear a jacket .

my stomach is a little fluttery , and i 'm still halfway convinced that i dreamed up seeing emerson the other day , but i 'm willing to stand here for another five seconds or so before i flee .
