he loved aidan and emma 's house , and he especially loved playing with noah , even though they were eleven months apart .

she grabbed him and his diaper bag and then made her way up the front walk .

emma answered the door with noah on her hip .

`` hey , i 'm so excited you could make it . ''

megan grinned .

`` you should know by now i have no life except for mason and work . ''

`` i feel the same way sometimes , '' emma replied , as megan stepped through the doorway .

as she walked through the foyer and down the hall to the kitchen , mason squirmed to get down .

once she set him on his feet , he ran into the living room .

that 's where aidan was lounging on the couch with beau on the floor next to him .

`` beau ! ''

mason cried .

he leaned in to hug the massive lab .

megan never had to worry about beau and mason ; he was truly a gentle giant when it came to infants and kids .

beau thumped his tail heartily at the attention .

aidan glanced up from the tv and smiled .

`` hey , how are you ? ''

she grinned as she reached down to kiss his cheek .

`` good thanks .

and you ? ''

`` great .

looking forward to having a man 's day with the boys . ''

megan laughed .

`` yeah , with two kids under two , let 's see how much fun you 'll have . ''

aidan shrugged .

`` it 's good practice for me when the new baby gets here . ''

`` baby or babies ? ''

she teased .

with his eyes widening , he quickly replied , `` baby singular .

that was confirmed , thank god . ''

cocking her head , she teasingly asked , `` and when is the ultrasound to confirm the youngest fitzgerald granddaughter is on her way ? ''

aidan huffed exasperatedly .

`` not for a few more months , smart-ass . ''

she brought her hand to her chest in mock outrage .

`` it was just a question . ''

`` yeah and considering you 've had a kid yourself , i 'm sure you know all too well at what month the gender ultrasound is . ''

megan grinned .

`` i just think it 's cool that i 'll be the oldest granddaughter , and she 'll be the youngest . ''

with a pained expression , aidan groaned , `` whatever . ''

she ruffled his still unkempt bed hair playfully .

`` relax , ankle .

you 're going to be an amazing father to that little girl .

she 'll undoubtedly have you wrapped around her finger before she 's even out of the womb . ''

`` a man like me , or i guess i should say , a man like i used to be , does not want to bring forth daughters into the world . ''

`` payback is a bitch , '' she mused .

`` do n't i know it , '' he grumbled .

emma came into the living room then .

she handed noah to aidan along with a bottle .

`` you sure you 'll be all right today ? ''

`` i 'll be fine-we 'll be fine .

wo n't we mason ? ''

mason glanced up from lumbering around the room on beau 's back .

`` yeah ! ''

`` see .

stop worrying . ''

he gave emma a very pointed look before adding , `` a promise is a promise after all . ''

she flushed a little at his words , but then gave him a shy smile .

when he winked playfully at her , megan could n't help feeling her chest tighten at the exchange .

seeing her once man-whore uncle now a loving , devoted husband and father was always surprisingly unnerving .

but deep down , it was how much she truly wanted what aidan and emma had .

love , companionship , and devotion within marriage while having someone else to parent with you .

if you were n't so stubborn you could probably have something just like aidan and emma have with pesh !

but no , you have to keep believing that you 're too young to get married .

you 're probably throwing away happiness with both hands just because you 're afraid .

emma brought her out of her self-deprecating tirade .

`` so what should we do first ? ''

she asked , as they walked into the garage .

`` nails and toes ? ''

megan suggested .

`` mmm , that sounds good . ''

they both slid into emma 's suv .

as megan buckled up , emma turned to her .

`` i hope you do n't mind that casey is meeting us for lunch ? ''

`` of course not .

the more the merrier .

besides , casey is a hoot . ''

emma smiled and cranked up the car .

`` that she is . ''

before long , they were pulling into starbucks to grab some coffee for megan and tea for emma .

then they walked around the corner to the nail salon .

after relaxing manicures and pedicures , they drove about twenty minutes to meet casey at their favorite little local restaurant that was housed in an old train depot .

as they walked up , they saw casey sitting outside in the sunshine texting .

`` hey girl ! ''

emma called .

casey waved to them before rising off the bench .

`` hello , hello . ''

a round of hugs was exchanged between the three women .
