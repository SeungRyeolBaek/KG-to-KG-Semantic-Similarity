and before you can make it sound any seedier , it is n't against the hospital rules to date each other .

besides , we met each other long before i started working at wellstar . ''

`` is that right ? ''

dev replied .

`` yeah , it is . ''

a slow grin slunk across his face .

`` i like you , '' he said to megan .

`` you have an interesting way of showing it . ''

charlie chuckled at the head of the table .

`` my , my , alpesh , have n't you picked a feisty one ? ''

pesh glanced at megan , who had flushed the red color of her blouse .

she gave charlie a weak smile .

`` i apologize . ''

with a tsk , charlie replied , `` please do n't .

it 's been rather refreshing to see you putting dev into his well-deserved place .

i understand you punched him , too . ''

when his mother gasped in horror , megan fumbled under the table for pesh 's hand .

he squeezed it reassuringly as she ducked her head .

`` um , well , i 'm sorry to say that i did . ''

`` in megan 's defense , i totally deserved it .

i punched alpesh and said some really shitty things . ''

`` dev ! ''

lavani cried .

in true dev fashion , he rolled his eyes at his mother 's outrage .

`` we 're fine now .

everyone calm down . ''

he met pesh 's gaze .

`` i 'm happy for you , brother .

you 've made a good choice . ''

he cut his eyes over to megan .

`` i hope you both will be very happy together . ''

pesh was taken aback by the sincerity in both dev 's words and his expression .

`` thank you . ''

megan nodded .

`` yes , thank you . ''

dev leaned back in his chair , clasping his hands behind his head .

`` and now to ensure that my news overshadows any excitement brought on by the two of you , i 'd like to announce that i 'm getting married next month- '' lavani once again gasped in horror .

but dev was n't finished .

`` and i 'm going to be a father . ''

pesh 's mouth gaped open as the table erupted in absolute pandemonium .

he wondered if his mother was going to pass out .

turning to megan , he found her with her napkin over her mouth .

from the way her shoulders were moving up and down , he could tell she was laughing .

he leaned over to whisper in her ear .

`` guess we 're off the hook , huh ? ''

she grinned .

`` yeah , i think we 're good . ''

`` i love you . ''

`` i love you more . ''

chapter twenty now that he and megan were an official couple who had said the `` l '' word , pesh no longer had days off where he had to wonder how to pass the time .

he wanted to spend every waking minute with her and with mason , and she always made sure that they had time together .

today found him at patrick 's house , wedged on the couch between some of megan 's male family members .

just like at his parents , the women were all stationed in the kitchen , putting the finishing touches on sunday lunch .

as soon as becky came in the living room and announced it was time to sit down , there was a stampede to the dining room .

he followed slowly behind the others , searching for megan who he felt like was his lifeline in the crowd .

`` where 's aidan and emma ?

they 're never late , '' angie remarked , as she sat a giant platter on the table .

liz shrugged .

`` they have n't called .

we could go ahead and get started , and then they can start when they get here . ''

john pulled out a chair .

`` good .

i 'm starving . ''

becky rolled her eyes .

`` you 're always starving .

between you and percy , we 're going to be eaten out of house and home . ''

pesh hung back as the others started taking their seats at the massive mahogany table .

regardless of how welcoming the fitzgerald 's had been , he still could n't help feeling like an outsider .

megan came in carrying a plate of ham .

after she deposited it on the table , her gaze searched the room for him .

when she spotted him , she gave him the smile that always warmed his heart before crooking her finger at him .

as he started to join her , mason came running in .

`` get me , esh , '' he urged , holding his hands up .

pesh grinned as he stooped over to pick mason up .

`` are you hungry ? ''

pesh asked .

`` uh , huh . ''

`` are you going to sit with me or pesh ? ''

megan asked .

`` esh , '' he replied .

`` is that okay with you ? ''

megan asked .

`` we 'll be fine . ''

she motioned for him to have a seat .

just as they sat down , aidan appeared in the doorway of the dining room with noah in his arms .

`` sorry we 're late . ''

`` where 's emma ? ''

megan asked , as she took noah from aidan .

with a grimace , aidan said , `` she is n't feeling well .
