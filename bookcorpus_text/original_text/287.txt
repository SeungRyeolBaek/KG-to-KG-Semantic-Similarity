for some reason , this man 's closeness was overwhelming her .

`` i can do that , '' she said softly .

she wished her hands did n't shake as she reached out to take the cleaning supplies from him .

dharr put a hand on her wrist to lower it , and continued his tender ministrations .

`` explain to me why you would defend someone you do n't know , '' he demanded .

victoria smiled at his autocratic tone .

`` you are n't very good at asking , are you ? ''

she teased .

`` asking ? ''

dharr questioned .

`` asking what ? ''

victoria only laughed , her suspicions confirmed .

`` well , that answers my question , does n't it ? ''

`` explain , '' he said , enjoying the dimples that suddenly appeared in her cheeks .

they brought his attention to her soft , full lips .

lips that would look lovely begging him to kiss her , he thought .

his command to explain only caused another chuckle to burst from victoria .

`` i mean , you want to know why i would defend someone but instead of putting it to me as a query , you simply demand an answer .

i think you 're mother would be ashamed of your manners , mr .

qudama . ''

dharr stared in shock as the tiny woman actually tssked him .

he could n't help but smile in response .

`` i do n't think my mother would be offended , '' he replied .

her head tilted to the side and her sharp , green eyes turned curious .

`` why not ?

i think all mothers would want their children to be raised with manners . ''

dharr liked the way her soft , brown hair fell over her shoulder as she tilted her head .

it was lovely , he thought and again he had the impulse to bury his hands in the long tresses , pushing back the small , wispy curls that framed her face .

.

`` my mother is dead , '' he said without emotion .

victoria instantly felt awful .

putting a hand out , she touched his shoulder , sure that the stiffness in his manner was because of his recent loss .

`` i 'm so sorry , mr. qudama .

i apologize for bringing it up .

it must have been hard for you , '' she said .

tears welled in her eyes as she looked up into his hard , unyielding ones .

`` i can see that you miss her , '' she said .

dharr 's hand stopped , not because he was finished but because he could no longer move .

the emotion clogging her voice and the tears in her eyes melted a small part of his heart that had been frozen for so long he had n't even known it existed .

why was this woman , this beautiful stranger , crying for his mother that had passed away when he was in his teens ?

he was thirty years old and long past needing his mother 's comforting arms , which she 'd never offered to begin with .

`` thank you , '' was all he could say .

victoria took the gauze from his hand and finished the task , wincing several times when she hit a particularly painful spot but persevering despite the pain .

when she was done , she looked up at him , smiling brightly .

`` well , that was n't so bad , i suppose , '' she replied and slid down off the gurney .

`` promise me something ? ''

she asked , picking up the mess and tossing it into the appropriate bins .

`` anything , '' dharr promised .

`` anything ? ''

she asked , turning back to him with another bright smile on her face and mischief twinkling in her eyes .

`` what if i ask for a new car or a castle ?

should n't you hear what i 'm asking before you promise the moon ? ''

dharr felt like chuckling since he could indeed deliver on anything she asked .

possibly not the moon , but even that might be within the realm of possibility in a few years .

`` okay , anything within reason ? ''

he said .

victoria nodded but then turned serious .

`` please do n't do anything about the man who accidentally knocked me down , '' she said .

`` it really wo n't be too bad . ''

dharr walked closer to her and touched her skin where a bruise was already forming .

`` how old are you ? ''

he asked .

victoria had to concentrate since his touch had driven all thoughts out of her mind .

`` uh ... twenty , '' she said .

`` only twenty ? ''

he asked , thinking he felt much older than his thirty years of age .

victoria blinked at his response , wondering if he thought her a child .

he was obviously much older than she was but felt it was important to point out that she was n't too young .

too young for what , she did n't let her mind define .

`` i do n't feel 'only ' anything .

besides , twenty is n't too young , '' she asserted strongly .

`` it is n't too young for what ? ''

he asked , and was delighted when she blushed again .

she glanced away but only for a moment , looking back up at him through her long lashes .

`` you 're teasing me , but really , i 'm not that young .

i 'm only two years away from graduation which at times feels like eternity but will come eventually . ''
