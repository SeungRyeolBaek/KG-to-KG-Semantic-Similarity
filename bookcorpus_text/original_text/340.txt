`` why did you say those things to me ? ''

dharr sighed and sat up , pulling her with him but not letting her move away .

he tucked the pillows behind his back and looked down at her lovely , pain filled eyes .

`` because i was jealous . ''

`` jealous ?

of what ?

or who ? ''

`` of scott .

that morning , i arrived in london early .

i came to see you and found scott leaving your dorm room , happily enjoying a sandwich and looking like he 'd just fallen out of bed .

i naturally assumed it had been yours . ''

victoria 's mouth dropped open and she looked up into his face .

the laughter started slowly but the more she thought about it , the harder she laughed .

dharr obviously did n't appreciate the humor but he did n't pull away .

in fact , he only waited until her laughter died away before raising one eyebrow in inquiry .

`` would you care to share the joke ? ''

he asked .

victoria nodded and smiled again , controlling the laughter , but just barely .

`` scott 's gay . ''

she watched the emotions cross his face , running the gamut of disbelief to shock to horror .

`` gay ? ''

he asked in a strangled voice .

`` gay , '' she confirmed .

`` in fact , at the time , he was dating a very nice man named marcus . ''

dharr leaned his head back against the silk covered headboard and closed his eyes .

`` i 'm sorry , '' he said , pulling her closer .

`` i 'm so sorry , '' he said again and buried his face in her neck .

victoria felt all the awful feelings just melt away and she wrapped her arms around his neck , feeling her heart melt with his apology .

`` but why did you ... . '' she swallowed hard before she could continue , `` leave that nasty message this morning ? ''

`` i swear it was n't what you were thinking , '' he said , lifting his head and she could see the sincerity in his eyes .

`` it was a gift to show you how much last night meant to me .

i swear it was nothing more than that . ''

`` oh , dharr !

i 'm sorry , '' she said and pulled him close .

`` i knew i lo ... '' she stopped just in time .

just because he did n't think nasty , demeaning things , did n't mean he wanted her love .

the words were swallowed quickly and she looked up , trying to decide if she 'd goofed again .

his eyes sharpened on her shocked face and he moved closer , determined to find out what she had been about to say .

`` what were you going to say ? ''

he demanded .

`` that you love me ? ''

he asked .

victoria was going to deny it but she could tell that the dictator had come back .

she was n't going to get around it .

`` yes , '' she said sadly , looking up at the ceiling instead of his handsome face .

`` but i know you do n't want that right now . ''

she started to get out of bed , feeling foolish but he pulled her back , swinging her so she was laying flat against the now rumpled sheets , her hair flying out behind her and dharr towering over her .

`` say it , '' he demanded .

`` why , so you can laugh at me ? ''

she threw back at him .

his eyes softened and he shook his head gently .

`` no .

so i can tell you how much i love you .

how much i need you in my life and how i have suffered for five long years , thinking you were falling in love and marrying another man because i was too stupid to claim you for my own . ''

with each word , the pain surrounding victoria 's heart melted a little more .

`` you love me ? ''

she asked , her hands coming to touch his handsome face and her eyes filling up with hope .

`` yes .

now will you say it ? ''

he demanded again .

`` i love you ! ''

she cried out , throwing herself into his arms and bringing his face down to hers .

`` i love you , you arrogant man , '' she giggled .

`` and you 're going to marry me and give me lots of children and help me raise arina and bajan , '' he ordered , bending down to kiss her neck .

`` absolutely , '' she agreed .

epilogue dharr closed the file and nodded in the general direction of the men gathered around the table .

`` thank you for your input , gentlemen , '' he said , effectively ending the meeting .

dharr stood up and walked out .

as soon as he passed by his secretary 's desk , he raised an eyebrow in question .

`` in the kitchen your highness , '' the man said , bowing and closing his eyes although he wished he could look up and see the king 's expression .

it was almost comical to see his face when he realized his queen was doing something he disapproved of .

dharr sighed heavily and shook his head .

he walked down the now familiar hallway , reaching the kitchen in short time .

he stopped in the doorway , watching the scene in front of him .

the chefs were off to one side , busily preparing food for the evening meal .
