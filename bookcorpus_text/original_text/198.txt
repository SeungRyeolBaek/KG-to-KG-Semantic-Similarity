i pause for a moment , taking in the beauty of the furnishings for the last time , before walking over to my desk and opening the top drawer .

i reach my arm all the way to the back and fish out the small slip of paper i stashed there .

i walk out and down the hallway .

nate 's bedroom door is slightly open and i can tell from the silence that he 's not inside .

i push it open all the way and walk to his bed .

i run my hand over his bedspread and breathe in his smell .

i pull down the comforter and lay the piece of paper on top of his pillow , then pull the comforter back up over it .

i certainly do n't want pierce to find the scrap of paper where eileen wrote her phone number .

i 'm about to leave when something makes me cross over to his window overlooking the river .

my eye catches on a flash of white on the lower lawn : nate sitting on the top step of the stairs leading down to the rocky shore .

he sits completely still , his white t-shirt stretched across his broad back .

i resist the urge to wonder what he 'll do now-it 's really none of my business anymore .

i hurry back down to the car and see my mom sitting in the passenger seat .

i open the driver 's door and see that she 's placed the keys on the seat .

i get in without a word and turn the car on then pull away from the house .

i glance in the rearview mirror to get one last glimpse at it as i turn the corner out of the gate .

my mom is silent on our drive back to our old house , just staring out the window as we get on the highway that takes us further away from the city , back to our much less expensive neighborhood .

a seed of resentment that 's been building inside of me all summer , or perhaps longer , finally takes root as i glance sidelong at her impassive face .

`` you have n't even looked at me all day , '' i finally say , gripping the steering wheel with white-knuckled hands .

`` what do you mean ? ''

she asks faintly , still not turning to me .

`` you have n't looked at my face , '' i repeat .

`` brynn ... '' she sighs .

`` no , it 's true .

your husband slapped me last night and you never even came to check on me .

and now you wo n't look at the bruise . ''

`` brynn , i 've been very upset . ''

`` and i have n't ?

he feels me up , hits me , and you have n't asked me if i 'm ok. '' `` it 's not my fault that he did those things ! ''

she shouts , suddenly hysterical .

`` mom , i 'm not blaming you for his actions , alright ?

but you 're my mother .

you should have believed me-you should have taken care of me .

i 've been taking care of you for years , and this time , i needed you . ''

my mom sobs once , reaching up to cover her mouth with her hand .

`` i wanted to believe you , brynn , i really did , '' she finally gasps .

`` i just knew that if i did , everything would fall apart , and it all seemed so perfect . ''

`` but it was n't . ''

`` no , it was n't . ''

i feel her hand reach up tentatively to touch my face , and her fingers graze over the small cut in the corner of my mouth .

`` oh , i 'm so sorry , my darling .

does it hurt much ? ''

`` hardly at all , '' i reply , swallowing the tears that have sprung up at her touch .

`` i never guessed ... about you and nate , i mean , '' she whispers .

`` that 's over , too , '' i reply shortly as my emotions threaten to overwhelm me .

`` ah , '' is all she says .

`` well , i know that might not be the kind of thing you ever want to talk about with your mother , but i 'm here .

you cared about him a lot ? ''

`` yes , '' i answer , my voice raspy with held emotion .

`` so i guess you have to get a lawyer ? ''

i ask , changing the subject .

`` oh , god .

i suppose so , '' she replies .

`` i think i 'll be able to get my old job at the salon back , at least .

i talked to anita and she said the new girl they got is terrible . ''

`` did you sign a pre-nup ? ''

i ask , thinking of eileen .

i know i 'll have to fill my mom in on what i know about her soon , but it would just be too much for me right now .

`` yes , '' she sighs .

`` iron-clad . ''

chapter twenty-eight i close the door behind me and dump my newly-purchased textbooks on my thin mattress , then straighten up to survey my lawn room .

it 's not much to look at , with its sparse furnishings and lack of bathroom access , though it does have a framed list of every inhabitant that 's lived here , going back to uva 's very first class .
