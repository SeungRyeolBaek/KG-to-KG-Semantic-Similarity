`` you never told me who these kids were , '' he said .

he pulled the pictures out of the envelope and shook his head .

`` poor little sprite , '' he said .

`` what happened to her ? ''

he asked .

victoria was used to talking about her kids at the school but the envelope just hurt her too much .

`` just some kids , '' she said .

the image of the little boy had haunted her all day .

he looked too serious , she thought again .

`` the boy looks to be about five or six , right ? ''

scott asked .

`` something like that , '' she said .

victoria had n't taken the time to get the children 's ages from dharr but she supposed that scott 's guess was accurate .

he took out another picture and read the caption underneath .

`` but the girl is much younger .

about three ? ''

`` i suppose , '' she replied , zipping the zipper on her jeans shorts .

scott looked up at her as she pulled a shirt on over her head , not bothering with a bra because it was too hot .

his eyes narrowed as he looked at her , unused to seeing her this emotionally detached when it came to children .

`` okay , what 's the deal ?

you 're never like this about your kids .

spill it , '' he said .

scott was sitting at the top of her bed , leaning against the pillows that were stacked up against the headboard .

`` they are the niece and nephew to dharr , '' she finally said , her back to scott so he could n't see her face .

`` you 're kidding , '' scott replied , sitting up and moving to the end of the bed .

`` how did you get these pictures ? ''

he asked suspiciously , immediately knowing she was n't giving him the whole story because of the cagey look in her eyes .

and the fact that she would n't look directly at him .

sighing , victoria decided that she might as well spill the beans .

scott would eventually get her to tell it all and would n't stop pestering her until she did .

`` dharr was at the school this morning , '' she admitted reluctantly .

scott whistled out his surprise .

`` what happened to them ? ''

scott asked .

victoria took a deep breath , grateful that he was focusing on the children and not her reaction to dharr .

she was n't exactly sure herself what her reaction to him was so she could n't really describe it to scott even if she wanted to .

`` their parents died about five months ago .

apparently , the kids are having a very hard time right now . ''

`` so what are you going to do about it ? ''

scott asked in the silence that followed her revelation .

victoria bit her lower lip and stared out the window , unable to face scott .

he 'd see the pain in her eyes and she needed to be tough about this situation .

`` nothing , '' she said firmly .

her words obviously surprised scott since he did n't respond immediately .

then she felt his gentle hug as his arms wrapped around her shoulders .

`` nothing ? ''

`` nope , '' she said and stood up to leave her bedroom .

scott followed , watching as she pulled ingredients out for dinner .

victoria was the cook generally since scott 's only specialty was sandwiches .

`` that 's not like you . ''

`` it is now , '' she said , plopping spaghetti sauce down on the counter and vegetables for grilling .

`` so you 're not over him , right ? ''

scott asked , sitting down at the tiny table in the kitchen .

`` the past five years are finally making sense now .

that 's the reason you 've never caught a fancy to any of the men i 've introduced you to , eh ? ''

victoria spun around at his words , `` what do you mean ?

i got over him a long time ago . ''

he raised one eyebrow at her heated reply .

`` so what 's the problem with helping out his niece and nephew ? ''

victoria squared her shoulders .

scott could psychoanalyze her responses all he wanted .

she would n't change her mind .

`` i just wo n't do it .

he thinks he can buy anyone and anything .

he offered me an astronomical amount to help out the kids .

but i 'm not for sale . ''

`` so do n't take the money .

what do you have to lose ?

you do n't have plans for the summer except to model for me , '' he grinned cheekily .

`` you could spend the hours writing that book you 've been talking about but you could do that in ashir too without too much trouble . ''

he considered her for a moment .

`` nope , the only reason you wo n't go is because you 're afraid of him . ''

he stood up and walked out of the kitchen .

`` you 're afraid you might fall back into his arms again . ''

victoria followed him , her mouth trying to form words to deny scott 's assertion that she was easy where dharr was concerned but he interrupted her before she could figure out how to deny his statement forcefully enough .

`` by the way , i have a date , tonight so do n't bother making anything for me , '' he said and closed his bedroom door on her glare .
