she had a highlighter in one hand and was flipping the pages of her art history book , making notes in the margins with the pen and highlighting anything that might be pertinent in the text .

when the doorbell rang , her roommate , linda , jumped up and answered the door , dumping her calculus book onto the floor eagerly .

`` expecting someone ?

maybe an agitated , unemployed idiot perhaps ? ''

she joked , referring to gary .

siri had told her all about the meal as soon as she 'd gotten home last night , both of them laughing at some of gary 's comments .

`` not for me , '' siri said , focusing on the history of renaissance paintings .

in the back of her mind , siri heard linda answer the door , but the mumbled greetings did n't break her concentration .

`` uh , siri ? ''

linda called out .

`` tell them i 'm not here , '' she called back , knowing that whoever it was could hear her comments but still hoping they would be discouraged .

`` um ... i 'm not sure this guy is going to take no for an answer . ''

that got through to siri and she glanced up from her book .

when she saw the tall man in the dark suit standing in her kitchen , the only other area besides the den and the two bedrooms which were on opposite sides of the den , siri jumped up , dumping her books and notes all over the orange , shag carpet .

`` oh ! ''

she cried out and looked down at the papers , then back up at the gorgeous man who was looking at her with a blank expression on his face .

he looked scarier , more intimidating , in the bright afternoon sunshine .

and much , much taller !

she pulled the pen out of her hair , wishing she 'd pulled on something better than leggings and an old tee shirt which had definitely seen better days and only came down to her waist .

`` sorry , '' she said and grabbed linda 's boyfriend 's shirt which was draped over the back of the only other chair in the apartment .

`` i was n't expecting anyone today .

we were just studying . ''

`` i 'm sorry to interrupt , '' the man replied with a slight accent which siri could n't place immediately .

`` i thought perhaps we might be formally introduced since we had such an amusing evening last night . ''

siri had to laugh despite her nervousness at this extremely large man in her apartment .

`` it was n't so funny towards the end , but he did serve as a good amusement factor , did n't he ? ''

malik took a step forward , his eyes looking over her beautiful skin for signs of abuse .

`` he did n't hurt you , did he ?

i know that you confronted him at the end , and i apologize for not being there to stop him if things became physical . ''

she looked up at him curiously .

`` it was n't your responsibility to ensure my safety , but i appreciate the thought .

i can take care of myself , '' she claimed .

malik stopped his laughter , but only just in time .

this woman who barely reached his shoulder thought she could handle an angry man with his pride wounded in front of his future employer ?

`` i 'm glad to hear it . ''

he stepped back and smiled .

`` i would like to take you out to dinner myself , if you have the time . ''

siri was startled and not sure how to respond .

she looked to linda who was just as awestruck .

regrouping quickly so she did n't appear so ridiculous , she replied , `` i 'm flattered , but i really do n't think that i 'm i your league , '' she stated softly , wishing that she could be in his league .

this man was hunk material , but also terrifying for some reason .

linda really did n't like siri 's response and stepped forward .

`` she 'd be delighted , '' she contradicted .

`` what time and where should she meet you ? ''

she asked , already picking up a pen and notebook and writing something down on it .

malik glanced at the cute redhead who interceded on his behalf , appreciating her efforts .

`` eight o'clock , tomorrow night ?

i 'll pick you up here . ''

linda nodded , ignoring siri 's attempt to contradict her .

`` that sounds perfect , `` she said , nodding her head for emphasis .

`` here 's siri 's cell phone number in case anything comes up .

and she 'll be ready tomorrow at eight . ''

the tall , gorgeous man took the paper and bowed slightly , handing the paper to one of the large , bulky men behind him without even glancing at it .

`` i look forward to our evening .

and i will work hard to ensure that i do n't mistake my philosophers since you apparently are so well versed in their doctrines . ''

with that , he stepped out of the apartment and closed the door , leaving behind two stunned women who looked at each other as if they 'd just been invited to a royal ball .

`` who was that man ? ''

linda asked , when she remembered to close her mouth , her whole body showing her excitement for siri 's new man .

siri shrugged , still staring at the now closed door .
