i can only hope that time has treated me half as well .

`` i promise , i 'll shoot cooper an email this weekend and tell him i ca n't accept the job . ''

`` abby , i do n't want you to do that , '' emerson says , his brow furrowing slightly .

`` if you 'd just listen to me for a minute , i could tell you that i 'm not mad about your being here . ''

`` you 're not ? ''

i ask , surprised , `` but ... why not ? ''

`` because we 're not ten years old , and this is n't a 'no girls allowed ' clubhouse , for one , '' emerson laughs .

`` it 's ... wonderful to see you , abby .

seriously .

i ca n't quite believe that it 's happening , but ... '' `` yeah , '' i laugh nervously , `` i certainly was n't expecting to run into you , well ... ever . ''

`` how the hell have you been ? ''

he asks , laying a hand on my shoulder .

my skin sparks at his gentle , familiar touch .

`` you look amazing . ''

`` says you , '' i chortle inelegantly .

nice one , abby , i chide myself .

`` yeah , says me , '' emerson smiles .

we lapse into silence , staring at each other there on the sidewalk .

my heart is still hammering against my ribcage , my knees shake uncontrollably .

seeing emerson again is like a dream .

a very sexy dream .

but that said , i need to wake up , now .

the sooner the better .

`` i really should go , '' i insist , edging away , `` this is wild and everything , but i do n't think we should draw it out , you know ?

i 'll just leave you to your company , and find some other agencies to apply to , and- '' `` i just told you i do n't want you to turn down the job , '' emerson says , with just the slightest note of hardness .

`` yeah , well .

i do want to turn it down , '' i shoot back , a bit annoyed at his tone .

`` why 's that ? ''

he insists , crossing his arms .

`` gee .

i wonder , '' i reply , rolling my eyes .

`` working side-by-side with my estranged ex-stepbrother slash ... '' `` slash what ? ''

emerson asks , his eyes hard on my face .

`` i just think it would be a terrible idea , '' i say flatly , `` but , hey , maybe i 'll see you at a conference sometime , or- '' `` or over drinks , '' he cuts me off , the corner of his mouth twisting up into his signature , roguish grin .

`` drinks ? ''

i reply , raising an eyebrow .

`` what drinks are those ? ''

`` the drinks we 're going to have tomorrow night .

i know a great martini bar around here .

it 's not as good as champagne in a motel room ... '' my heart flips over as he immediately brings up our fated night as lovers .

christ , he knows how to go right for the jugular , does n't he ?

`` last time i checked , i had n't agreed to a drink , '' i remind him .

`` true .

but you know what tomorrow is , do n't you ? ''

he grins .

of course .

if saturday is my birthday , then tomorrow is his .

`` you want to spend your birthday ... with me ? ''

i ask .

`` i do , '' he replies .

`` do n't you have some leggy , blonde supermodel to entertain ? ''

i shoot back .

`` several , '' he says without missing a beat , `` but i 'd still rather hang out with you .

meet me at clinton and houston at eight .

wear something fancy . ''

i know that there 's no way he 's going to let me off the hook , here .

the best i can do is say yes now and blow him off tomorrow .

`` fine , '' i say crisply , extending my hand for him to shake , `` see you then . ''

i swallow a gasp as he scoops up my hand , draws it to his lips , and plants a kiss there .

someone turned into a gentlemen over the past eight years .

i wonder how the hell that happened ?

`` looking forward to it , '' he smiles , holding onto my hand for longer than is necessary .

`` and do n't you dare blow me off , ab .

it is my birthday , after all . ''

i turn on my heel and hurry away , feeling all the blood in my body rush to my head .

it 's a good thing i 'm familiar with this city by now , because i ca n't pay a lick of attention to anything all the way home .

in the blink of an eye i 'm staggering , dazedly , back into my apartment .

i drop my purse onto the floor and flop onto the couch , staring straight ahead of me , unseeing .

riley pokes her head out of her bedroom as she hears me enter .

`` hey !

how 'd it go ? ''

she asks .

`` i got the job , '' i tell her , my voice flat .

`` that 's great , abby ! ''
