he whirled around in surprise .

her heart clenched at the sight of the tears sparkling in his eyes .

even in the darkness , she could see a blood-red flush entering his cheeks .

his hands quickly came up to swipe away the moisture from his eyes .

`` hello , '' he finally replied in a hoarse whisper .

they stood in an awkward silence , staring each other down .

finally , megan took a step forward to close the gap between them .

`` how did you know i was up here ? ''

he asked .

`` kristi told me . ''

`` hmm . ''

unable to stop herself , she reached out to touch his arm .

`` i 'm so sorry , pesh . ''

`` it is n't necessary . ''

she shook her head .

`` yes , it is .

you 're in pain ... you 've been in pain .

i ca n't help but feel sorry for what you 're going through . ''

his usually warm eyes took on a cold look .

`` you were in that elevator , too .

you have every right to be emotional .

maybe you should be more concerned with why you are n't weeping . ''

`` do n't , '' she murmured .

`` do n't what ? ''

`` do n't try to mask your pain by being someone you 're not or by pointing fingers at others .

that is n't you , and you ca n't fool me . ''

with a ragged sigh , pesh jerked his hand through his dark , wavy hair .

`` i 'm sorry .

that was completely uncalled for . ''

`` it 's okay . ''

`` no , it's- '' she silenced him by bringing her hand up to cover his lips .

when she pulled her hand away , he sighed .

`` talk to me , '' megan pleaded .

the clouds above them opened up , causing a slight drizzle to fall .

`` the death of a patient is never easy .

any doctor of worth , or nurse for that matter , must possess compassion .

then it is inevitable that the same compassion you possess will come back to haunt you-it may even cripple you .

when death comes , you ca n't help feeling for the life that has been lost and for the family members left behind . ''

his voice choked off , and megan drew herself even closer to him .

she knew that his last statement held personal meaning for him .

`` what exactly happened to your wife ? ''

she questioned softly .

pesh 's eyes closed .

`` jade had an undiagnosed clotting condition .

she was adopted , so she did n't know anything really about her family history .

she 'd always been in perfect health-she rarely even went to the doctor with the sniffles .

and after we 'd been married for three years , we decided it was time to have a baby . ''

when pesh remained silent , megan tentatively asked , `` did she die in childbirth ? ''

he shook his head .

`` no , we never got that far .

we tried for over a year to get pregnant on our own , and it did n't happen .

so we were recommended to a fertility clinic .

once the iui process did n't work , we started ivf . ''

a ragged sigh came from deep in his chest .

`` the whole process was physically trying and then emotionally gutting for both of us , but especially for jade . ''

he met her gaze .

`` she blamed herself since the testing revealed that everything was fine with me .

although we were labeled as 'non-specific infertility , ' she felt that it was all her fault . ''

`` bless her heart , '' megan murmured , as her heart went out to a woman she 'd never met .

getting pregnant had been so easy for her .

although mason was n't necessarily expected , he had never been unwanted in her eyes .

but she knew what infertility did to a woman when she saw it ravage her father 's sister .

although her aunt was now the happy and doting mother of two adopted girls , she knew the emotional toil not getting pregnant had taken .

megan , herself , had once been the recipient of her aunt 's childless pain when she had announced her pregnancy with mason .

still without answers as to how jade had died , megan pressed pesh for more .

`` so what happened with the ivf ? ''

`` she got pregnant on the first transfer only to miscarry three weeks later .

we had just been through another transfer when she died . ''

pesh 's adam 's apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed hard .

megan could only imagine he was trying to keep his emotions in check .

finally , he spoke again .

`` she had an embolism most likely brought on by the fertility medication .

i was in the kitchen making breakfast when i heard a crash in the bedroom . ''

tears pooled in his eyes .

`` when i called her name and she did n't answer , i ran back to her .

she was crumpled on the bedroom floor .

after calling 911 , i did cpr over and over again , but i could never revive her . ''

`` oh pesh , '' megan murmured .

the weight of his pain was so heavy that even she found it hard to breathe .

without looking at her , he continued staring straight ahead .

`` from what the medical examiner said , i have some peace in knowing she did n't suffer-that she went quickly without any fear or pain .
