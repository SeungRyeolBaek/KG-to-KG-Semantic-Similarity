she grabbed the first member of pesh 's immediate family she saw , which unfortunately happened to be dev .

`` can you get these to your mother ?

i 've got to get to the hospital . ''

his dark eyes widened as he took the jewelry from her .

`` are you okay ? ''

`` i 'm fine .

a cousin 's baby was just born .

do n't let anything happen to that , okay ? ''

dev chuckled .

`` yeah , i 'll be unloading this pronto .

the last thing i need is for my ass to be the one to lose the family jewels . ''

with a wink , he added , `` they 'd be taking my family jewels . ''

megan laughed and then gave him a wave before running off .

when she got back outside , aidan and emma 's suv had just pulled around .

noah began to squirm in pesh 's arms .

`` guess where we 're going ? ''

pesh said , before he could start crying .

`` mama ? ''

pesh smiled .

`` yes , we 're taking you to your mama and daddy and new baby sister . ''

noah 's face lit up at the prospect , and he happily let them buckle him into his car seat .

following her mother 's car , they made the drive in almost a caravan of relatives .

when they got to the hospital , pesh pulled up to let her out .

`` i 'll go park and bring him in . ''

`` okay .

i 'll see you guys up there . ''

when she got up to the maternity floor , there was a quite a group waiting for her , including emma 's best friend , connor .

`` did casey not feel like coming tonight ? ''

megan asked , as she hugged him .

casey was just a few weeks shy of her own due date with a little girl .

he chuckled .

`` oh , she 's here all right .

she 's just in labor herself .

it seems like caroline and olivia are going to be true best friends by being born almost the same day . ''

megan grinned .

`` that 's wonderful news . ''

connor wrinkled his nose .

`` i think casey will be appreciating it a little more when her epidural kicks in .

she was n't too happy the last time i went back to see her . ''

`` oh yes , i remember that feeling well . ''

megan 's phone dinged , and she quickly read the text .

`` aidan says we can come back now , '' she said to her aunts .

the group made their way through the double doors and down the hall .

when they reached emma 's room , angie knocked on the door .

within a few seconds , aidan appeared .

`` hey guys , '' he said , with a beaming smile .

`` the nurse is actually checking on em , but give me a second . ''

he disappeared back behind the door only to reappear within a few moments .

this time he held a tiny bundle wrapped in a pink blanket .

`` here she is .

miss caroline elizabeth fitzgerald . ''

collective oohs and aahs went up over the group as aidan held caroline out for them to see .

she did n't seem too interested or impressed by them .

she yawned and closed her eyes .

`` she 's absolutely beautiful , '' megan said .

`` she 's something all right , '' aidan murmured .

`` there it is !

i see a tear , '' becky teased .

aidan rolled his eyes at his sister .

`` let me guess .

you had some kind of bet going about whether i cried or not ? ''

liz patted his back .

`` something like that . ''

pesh appeared then .

the moment noah saw his father he kicked to get down .

once he got his feet on the floor , he ran to aidan , wrapping his arms around aidan 's leg .

`` hey buddy .

you want to meet your sister ? ''

squatting down , aidan held caroline to where noah could get a good look at her .

`` mama 's tummy baby ? ''

he questioned .

aidan laughed .

`` yeah , this is your baby sister , caroline . ''

noah eyed his sister with a slight frown , as if he was trying to figure her out .

megan could only imagine what was going on in his head at the moment .

he 'd spent the last sixteen months being the center of his parents ' world , and now there was someone else to share the attention .

when caroline scrunched up her face and whimpered , noah patted her arm .

`` no cwy , baby . ''

`` aw , he 's going to be a good big brother , '' angie remarked .

aidan chuckled .

`` yeah , he 'll be fine until caroline needs emma .

then he 's going to be ready to sell her to the gypsies . ''

a nurse exited emma 's room .

`` you can go in now . ''

as she gazed around the crowd , she shook her head .

`` well , some of you can go in . ''

rising up off the floor , aidan took noah 's hand .

`` come on , buddy .

mama wants to see you . ''

noah did n't bother waiting on aidan .

he barreled through the door .

`` mama !

mama ! ''

he cried .

megan smiled as she watched him climb up on emma 's bed .
