he rarely bothered to call her anymore .

`` okay , well that settles , it , '' she said .

`` now teach me about this modern art stuff because i just do n't get it , '' she exclaimed , seriously doubting he could reveal the significance of the art to her .

they just looked like blobs on a paper , or sometimes streaks .

but she did n't understand why they told a story or showed the emotions of the artist .

an hour later , they were still going over the pictures as scott pointed out characteristics to her when the box started ringing .

both of them looked up at the same time , looking over at the ringing brown box .

then , as if in a comedy , they turned to face each other , their mouths open in a round o , both wondering what the phone was going to do .

`` do you think it 's a bomb ? ''

scott asked , warily .

victoria scoffed .

`` why in the world would you say something like that ? ''

she asked , but the memory of dharr 's guards flashed into her mind .

she looked back at the box as it rang again .

getting up , she picked up the box and found an edge to the paper .

tearing it open , she found a sophisticated mobile phone ringing over and over again .

`` how do i turn it on ? ''

she asked , understanding that dharr had sent it to her despite her claim that she would handle it herself .

`` i do n't know , '' he said , standing up and coming over to her .

the phone did n't stop ringing for several minutes .

they both breathed a sigh of relief but a moment later , it started up again .

finally , scott found the right button and handed it to her .

`` hello ? ''

she said into the phone .

`` victoria ?

why did it take you so long to answer ? ''

he demanded .

victoria 's eyes widened at his angry tone .

`` i 'm sorry .

i did n't open the box when it arrived so it was difficult to get into initially .

then i did n't know how to operate it . ''

she saw scott 's reaction to her instantaneous apology and turned away , not liking the concern she saw revealed in his eyes .

`` let me get this straight , '' dharr was saying , `` you received a box but did n't open it to find out what was inside ?

do you get gifts so often that they are nothing to you ? ''

he demanded .

she was surprised and a little hurt by his interpretation of the situation .

`` no , it was n't like that at all .

i was just waiting for someone and got distracted .

it 's art history , you know .

i told you how difficult it was for me last night .

i 'm trying to figure it out .

i do n't usually get packages , i promise . ''

even victoria felt odd apologizing like this .

had she lost her spine ?

she 'd done nothing wrong .

and why was she hiding the fact that the person who had come over was male ?

because she knew dharr would be furious .

she did n't have any proof , but she sensed that deep down , he was a very possessive male and knowing that he was from ashir , she suspected he was very jealous and old fashioned .

studying with a man , even a gay man , would be forbidden .

`` good , '' he snapped , apparently satisfied by her response .

`` how are you ? ''

victoria shook her head .

all the anger was gone from his voice .

`` i 'm fine .

how are your meetings ? ''

she asked .

`` fine .

i wanted to make sure you liked your new phone .

is it okay ?

did they program it appropriately ? '

victoria walked into her small , galley style kitchen and bit her lip .

`` dharr , i thought i mentioned that i would get my own phone , '' she said , looking out the window but not really seeing anything as she concentrated on making dharr understand her position on the mobile phone .

`` you 'll have to accept this from me , '' he countered .

`` i want to know you are safe .

this phone has an emergency alarm on it if you get into trouble , '' he explained .

`` and it has my phone number already programmed in .

feel free to call me whenever you like , '' he said softly .

`` i have to go now .

i 'll see you friday night , '' he said and rung off .

victoria pressed the button to turn it off and turned back to find scott sitting on the sofa again , looking at her with interest .

`` i 'm guessing that 's your new love ? ''

he asked , one eyebrow raised in question .

`` yes .

that was dharr , '' she replied .

`` and should i also assume you 've no need for the calling plan i mentioned earlier ? ''

victoria hesitated .

a part of her wanted to assert herself to dharr .

but another part of her knew that she only had a small amount of time with him and did n't want to spend it arguing about something so nonsensical as a phone .

`` i guess not , '' she finally replied .

scott looked at her for another long moment .
