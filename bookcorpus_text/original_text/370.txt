`` but why are they here ? ''

he tried to be reassuring , but firm .

having his children guarded was a non-negotiable issue .

and he would n't allow her to be in danger either .

she was going to be his wife , she just did n't know it yet .

`` yes .

it 's necessary .

the boys ca n't be without body guards ever again .

nor can you , actually . ''

she stood there , staring at him for a long moment .

`` what do you mean ? ''

she really did n't like where her thoughts were leading her at his statement .

he raised an eyebrow .

`` one of them will be my heir , siri .

you had to know that this would happen . ''

she was shaking her head and backing up .

`` no , '' she whispered .

`` you ca n't do that to them ! ''

`` it 's the natural order of things , '' he said , trying to calm her down .

she backed up , forgetting about the cell phone in her hands when he was telling her that one of her sons would be his heir while the other would be left behind , superfluous unless the first born died .

the possibility was horrible and divisive to her children .

they were great friends and raising them in this way would tear that bond apart .

`` then stop the order !

change it ! ''

she did n't even want them being rulers , much less one of them being malik 's heir .

she 'd known it was a possibility , but now with the reality of the future being shoved down her throat , she did n't like it one little bit .

`` i ca n't .

they 're my sons .

they 'll need to come back to duban and learn to rule the country .

my people will demand it . ''

`` then tell them no !

they are n't going anywhere . ''

she stepped back , refusing the reassurance of his arms .

`` if you 're in charge , then make them find someone else to rule when you 're ... . '' she could n't say 'dead ' or 'gone ' or anything else that might force her to face this man 's mortality .

he sighed and bowed his head , then raised it once again to look directly at her .

`` we 'll also have to marry . ''

she gasped and stepped backwards .

`` marry ?

you ? ''

`` of course .

you 're the mother of my children .

we have to marry . ''

he said it like the marriage was a foregone conclusion .

in her mind , it was far from her future .

not even a remote possibility !

`` you married some other woman ! ''

she looked him up and down with disgust and frustration .

`` not only that , you married her days after ... ..sleeping with me !

i wo n't marry you now . ''

he shook his head .

`` you 're tired from last night and probably not thinking clearly .

i should n't have kept you up talking so long but let 's just put this issue aside until we can think more clearly about this .

okay ? ''

siri pulled herself together .

`` you can talk all you want .

but you 're not taking my sons from me . ''

`` they 're my sons as well , '' he countered .

`` and you apparently have their whole future planned out for them .

well , one at least .

the other we can toss to the side , '' she said angrily and stormed into her kitchen , pressing the button to make the coffee .

`` oh , no ! ''

she interjected after a moment 's pause .

`` we ca n't toss him out , can we ?

an heir and a spare , is n't that the phrase ? ''

`` do n't be ridiculous .

i do n't consider either of them in that way and you know it . ''

`` momma , what 's a spare ? ''

sam asked as he climbed up into his chair , looking at malik as if he were an esteemed stranger .

he 'd helped with his frogs so in sam 's opinion , the tall man could n't be all bad , the toddler surmised .

jacob was right behind him and both looked up at her with curiosity , waiting for a response .

siri sighed and shook her head .

`` we were just arguing about politics , honey .

are you hungry ? ''

she asked and took the large , expensive looking bag that malik had brought in with him and set it on the counter while they calmed down from their argument .

the smells emanating from the bag were actually making her mouth water and she realized she was incredibly hungry .

she refused to attribute her hunger to having sex with malik the night before though .

she would n't give him credit for anything !

except turning her life upside down again !

malik turned back to the boys , his eyes hungrily watching each of them and siri instantly knew what he was trying to do .

`` this is jacob , '' she explained , pointing to her little guy on the right .

`` you can tell him by the little freckles here on his ear , '' she said and tickled jacob behind his ear , smiling when he giggled and tried to stop her by lifting his shoulder .

`` and this is samuel , '' she said , moving to the other side of the table .
