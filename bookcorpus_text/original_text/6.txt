he immediately met pesh 's anxious gaze .

when his lips curved into a wide smile , pesh exhaled the nervous breath he 'd been holding .

`` well , there you are , '' aidan said , as he strode up .

he bypassed throwing out his hand , and instead , he pulled pesh to him for a bear hug .

`` emma was worried about you . ''

`` she was ? ''

`` yeah , she asked me to come out and see if i could find you . ''

`` i 'm sorry .

i was n't sure where to go , and no one was out here . ''

`` do n't worry about it . ''

aidan pulled away .

`` so how the hell are you ? ''

pesh could n't help laughing at aidan 's choice of words , especially in a church .

`` i 'm good , thank you . ''

he cocked his head at aidan .

`` and what about you ?

is fatherhood agreeing with you ? ''

a beaming smile lit aidan 's face .

`` i 'm absolutely fantastic .

i never could have imagined that being a father would be this ... amazing . ''

pesh nodded .

`` i want you to know what an honor it is for me to be noah 's godfather . ''

`` we 're glad to have you . ''

aidan patted pesh 's back .

`` and i do mean that . ''

`` i hope you do .

i have had my concerns ... '' aidan shook his head .

`` well , do n't .

i 'll admit i was n't too thrilled with the prospect at first , but em was able to make me see the light .

you were there for us when we really needed you .

i mean , besides my wedding day , i would 've missed the most important days of my life-my son 's birth .

i can never thank you enough .

so when it comes down to it , i do n't think i could ask for a better godfather for my son . ''

aidan 's words touched pesh .

`` thank you .

that means a lot .

you have my word that i will always do what is right by noah . ''

after giving him a hearty thump on the shoulder , aidan said , `` come on back with me .

i want to introduce you to everyone . ''

`` do they ... '' pesh was n't sure how to ask if aidan 's family knew the story of how he and emma truly knew each other .

aidan chuckled .

`` let 's just say that pop 's the only one who knows the truth .

the others just think you met us when pop had his heart attack . ''

pesh could n't help the relieved breath that whooshed out of him .

it would have been a nightmare to have most of aidan 's family hating him for trying to steal emma away .

`` i see . ''

he followed aidan back into a large room filled with chattering people .

as he craned his neck , he saw emma in the corner with noah in her arms .

she looked radiant as ever in an emerald suit .

noah , however , did n't seem too thrilled to be outfitted in the lacy gown that flowed over emma 's arms and stopped mid-thigh .

his tiny brows wrinkled as he waved his fists back and forth as if any moment he might let loose with a scream .

taking him by the elbow , aidan guided him over to a group of men and women .

aidan introduced him to his four sisters and their husbands .

pesh smiled , nodded , and shook their hands before being bombarded by a hoard of aidan 's nieces and nephews .

`` now i want you to meet my niece , megan .

she 's the godmother . ''

`` it would be my pleasure . ''

aidan surprised pesh by leaning in and whispering in his ear .

`` i 'm pretty sure over half of the people here are gunning for you two to get together .

you know , a real romantic story to tell future kids about how you two met being the godmother and godfather of this sweet and adorable kid . ''

pesh gulped .

why was everyone he knew hell-bent on setting him up ?

had emma harbored some secret , ulterior motive in asking him to be noah 's godfather ?

`` i 'm flattered , but i do n't know if that 's such a good idea . ''

pulling back , aidan surmised him before winking .

`` normally i would agree because she is , after all , my niece-my favorite one if i 'm being honest .

but as much as it pisses me off to admit it , you two would make a great couple . ''

`` we would ? ''

`` hell yeah . ''

aidan swept his hand over his chin .

`` megan needs someone strong and stable like you are , and then you need someone who is so full of life like she is .

i can guaran-damn-tee you that you 've never been out with a woman like her before .

emma is like , one tenths the sassiness that megan is . ''

pesh could n't help giving aidan a skeptical look .

`` just keep an open mind , okay ? ''

with a reluctant nod , pesh replied , `` i will . ''

`` megan , '' aidan called .

when the tiny blonde turned around , pesh fought to catch his breath .

everything about her from her sparkling blue eyes to her long blonde hair was just like jade 's .
