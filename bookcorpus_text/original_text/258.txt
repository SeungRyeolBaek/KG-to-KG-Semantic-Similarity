`` tried it once .

not a fan , '' he shrugs .

`` this is n't going to work , '' i tell him , shaking my head , `` we ca n't just pick up right where we left off after that night at the beach . ''

`` why not ? ''

he insists , taking my hands in his .

`` because you took a sledgehammer to my heart , you asshole ! ''

i say , tearing away from his grasp .

`` i 've loved you for the better part of a decade , but we 're not kids anymore , emerson .

we ca n't just throw caution to the wind , you live in europe , and- '' `` we 're twenty-five ! ''

he laughs , incredulously , `` we can do whatever we like . ''

`` you 're twenty-six , '' i remind him , `` and i 've spent the last eight years picking up the pieces of my life on my own .

i 'm not about to let you shatter them again . ''

`` is that what you think i 'd do , if you gave me another chance ? ''

he asks , his voice hard .

`` no , '' i reply , feeling my bottom lip begin to tremble , `` i know it 's what you 'd do . ''

his eyes flash with wounded sorrow as i barrel past him .

this time , he lets me go .

i charge away , back up to my haven on the upper west side , struggling to hold it together .

i manage to make it all the way home before my own grief spills over .

by the time i glance at my bedside clock , i see that it 's after midnight .

it 's officially my own twenty-sixth birthday .

and would you look at that ?

i 'm lying here alone , miserable as ever .

`` see , this is why i hate birthdays , '' i mutter to myself , surrendering to sleep at last .

chapter fourteen it seems that emerson has taken the hint .

there are n't a thousand voicemails and texts waiting on my phone in the morning , and he does n't appear out of thin air all day during my birthday .

riley , unable to contain herself , wakes me up with a wonderful breakfast spread to start the day off right .

one look at my face and she does n't press for details about the night before .

she 's a saint , that woman .

we take our time waking up , head out for a hot yoga class , and take a nice long walk along the hudson river together .

eventually , i fill her in on what went down at drinks last night .

she listens pensively as i give her the scoop .

`` you may not want to hear this , '' she begins , glancing at me as we stroll by the water .

`` that probably means i need to hear it though , right ? ''

i sigh , `` go ahead .

shoot . ''

`` it sounds like you 're scared by how much you still care about him , '' riley says , laying a hand on my shoulder .

`` and you 're terrified of history repeating itself . ''

`` i do still care about him , '' i admit , surprised by the knot in my throat .

`` i never stopped caring about him . ''

`` i know , '' riley smiles sadly , `` i 've been with you these last eight years since he disappeared from your life .

but abby ... you have to remember that there 's one huge difference between then and now . ''

`` his pecs ? ''

i offer .

`` you should see them , ri- '' `` not what i meant , '' she laughs .

`` i was going to say , you were kids when everything went wrong before .

you had to answer to your horrible , selfish parents .

now , you have no one to answer to but yourselves . ''

`` maybe that 's what 's freaking me out , '' i say softly , `` there 's no one to blame if things go wrong again .

if we mess it up this time ... it 's because we 're not actually right for each other . ''

`` being a grownup sucks , do n't it ? ''

riley laughs , shaking her head .

`` but you know what else sucks ?

squandering a wonderful relationship with someone you 're nuts about , just because you 're scared . ''

`` how can you always know the right thing to say ? ''

i ask her , amazed .

`` i 'm just a genius , '' she sighs , as we turn toward home , `` nbd . ''

my grandparents are swinging by the apartment to check up on the place and have drinks before we go out to dinner , but that wo n't be until early this evening .

i have the whole lazy late afternoon to myself .

which would be fine and dandy if i could do anything but lay around thinking about emerson .

i need to check in with him about last night and explain my freak out .

but every time i reach for my cell , something stops me .

`` come on , miss 26-year-old , '' i mutter sternly , staring down at my phone , `` put on your big girl panties and give him a- '' i let out a very undignified yelp as the phone begins to vibrate in my hands .

dropping the device onto my bed in surprise , i peer down at it and feel my stomach flip .
