he wanted her to be happy about this occurrence .

this was a good thing for everyone if she could just release her anxiety and look at the situation logically .

`` of course you have n't , '' he said and pulled her closer , sighing when he realized that she was trembling so violently .

`` you 're my wife .

i know you do n't realize it now , but you 're a very powerful woman . ''

she snorted , completely disbelieving his words .

he shrugged his shoulder .

`` you do n't understand now , but you will .

as my wife , you have powers you ca n't even imagine . ''

`` what kind of power ? ''

she asked , pulling her hand out of his and standing up .

she did n't like being next to him , feeling his strong thigh against hers .

it shocked her imagination , giving her ideas she did n't want to have .

he leaned back against the sofa , stretching his arms out wide .

`` well , it gives you the right to me . ''

she crossed her arms over her chest .

`` i do n't want rights over you . ''

he chuckled when her cheeks turned that pretty shade of pink , proving her a liar .

`` why not ?

women have been clamoring , tricking , conniving and doing desperate things to be in your shoes . ''

ella resisted the urge to glance down at her drugstore brand shoes .

`` i just want my old life back . ''

he shook his head slowly .

`` that 's not possible . ''

`` why not ? ''

she huffed with irritation that everything seemed so black and white to him .

`` first of all , because i wo n't allow you to work in a menial job now .

you 're my wife , so serving others is a thing of the past . ''

`` it was a good enough job for me yesterday .

why not today ? ''

`` because today , you hold the title of queen ella .

there 's a significant difference in everything you do now . ''

ella gasped and shook her head .

`` i 'm not ! ''

he smiled slightly .

`` you are . ''

she stumbled backwards and , in a flash , zayn was there , his arm wrapped around her waist , holding her steady .

holding her against him .

she plastered her hands against his chest , her mind getting all fuzzy again with his closeness .

`` do n't call me that .

and do n't touch me . ''

he chuckled softly .

`` anything you desire , your highness , '' he teased but he did n't release her .

`` except it 's going to be very hard to get you pregnant with our next child if i do n't touch you . ''

he bent his head and nibbled on her earlobe while his hands once again slipped underneath her tee-shirt .

she could n't believe he would suggest something so outrageous .

surely she had n't heard him correctly !

`` i 'm not going to get pregnant ! ''

she gasped .

her hands had wrapped around his wrists , initially in an attempt to pull his hands away , but he was too strong .

and as he shifted against her , his legs moving subtly between hers , those delicious shivers started up again .

`` do n't do that , '' she whispered , unaware that she was tilting her head so that he had better access to her neck .

`` why would i stop ? ''

he nibbled on her ear , her neck .

`` i want you . ''

`` no you do n't , '' she gasped , pulling back when the feelings became too much .

`` you disappeared .

twice . ''

he slid his hand up higher , his fingers resting just underneath her breasts .

`` i only disappeared once on my own .

the first time , my uncle found me and took me to tusain .

i did n't have a choice when i was eighteen .

now i choose you . ''

she grabbed his hands , afraid they might slip higher and she 'd be lost then .

`` zayn , you disappeared that last time .

the time when it counted .

i had no right to expect anything when you were eighteen .

i was a little girl , still in elementary school .

but you still disappeared then without a word .

i worried about you for a long time , especially when no one could find out anything about where you 'd gone .

but the second time , i had a right to not be abandoned . ''

she looked up at him , trying to convey the hurt she 'd felt when she woke up after their one night together and he 'd already left .

`` i did n't hear from you for a long time . ''

`` would you believe that i 've been searching for you for the past six years ?

you 're a very hard woman to find . ''

`` no , '' she shook her head .

`` i do n't believe you tried very hard .

i was right here .

raising our son . ''

he smiled slightly , still amazed that he had a son .

`` he 's real , is n't he ? ''

he asked , his eyes moving towards the doorway through which he 'd gone to play .

`` what was it like when he was born ?

do you have pictures ? ''

she tried to step out of his arms , but he was n't allowing that yet .
