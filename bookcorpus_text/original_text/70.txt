most days , it was harder than megan could have ever imagined not to burst out in a smile whenever she saw him or to resist the urge not to wrap her arms around him .

but somehow they made it work .

in the end , the pent up emotions that were suppressed during the day made for a lot of heated fireworks in the evenings .

megan 's thoughts were interrupted at the buzzing of her phone .

when she glanced down at it , she grinned .

it was pesh .

it killed me not to be able to kiss you a moment ago .

i know .

me too .

dinner at my place tonight ?

u cooking ?

she questioned .

yeah .

indian food .

mmm , sounds good .

what time ? ''

7 .

does mason like indian food ?

megan eyed his text thoughtfully .

the last three times she had been with pesh , mason had been with them as well .

pesh never seemed to mind , but megan wanted a night with just him .

a true date night .

not sure .

will get my parents or papa to babysit .

you do n't have to do that .

i know .

i want to .

okay .

see you at 7 .

bye .

she had just slipped her phone back in her pocket when she was ambushed by kara .

since the day she 'd seen kara grope pesh in the hallway , megan had loathed the sight of her .

she had managed to keep her distance from her at work , but lately , she noticed that kara had been creeping around , staring at her .

`` can i do something for you ? ''

megan asked politely .

`` yeah , for starters , you can drop the sugar sweet act .

i know how you feel about me . ''

megan fought the urge to roll her eyes .

instead , she crossed her arms over her chest .

`` fine .

what do you need kara ? ''

kara glanced around them before she spoke .

`` i want you to back off of pesh . ''

`` excuse me ? ''

narrowing her eyes , kara said , `` i know you 're into him .

i can see it in the way you look at him ... it 's in the way he looks at you , too .

and i do n't like it . ''

`` well , i 'm terribly sorry that you do n't , but frankly , i do n't see how any of that is any of your business . ''

`` oh , he is very much my business considering we 've been together . ''

`` um , okay .

whatever , '' megan replied , feeling slightly shattered by kara 's proclamation .

in the rational side of her mind , she knew there was no way pesh could be involved with kara .

but at the moment , it was the irrational side that seemed to be winning out over whether pesh was truly hers .

kara jerked her chin in the air .

`` besides the fact of what pesh and i are to each other , i 'm sure it would be very interesting business to your professor .

last time i checked , a nursing candidate was n't supposed to get involved with a doctor .

bad for one 's reputation . ''

`` are you threatening me ? ''

after a casual shrug of her shoulders , kara replied , `` just stating facts .

you do n't impress me as one of those bimbo girls who likes to be used by a man for sex , which i 'm afraid that 's exactly what pesh is doing with you .

but more than not wanting to be a sex toy , i imagine you would n't want to do anything to harm your future career . ''

`` i 'm not discussing this any further , '' megan muttered , as she started past her .

`` i wo n't be either as long as you stay away from pesh . ''

without giving kara a final glance , megan continued walking down the hallway .

she did n't know where she was going , but she knew she wanted to put as much distance as she could between herself and kara .

the rest of the day she felt haunted by kara 's words .

more than anything , she could n't wait until she could be alone with pesh to talk to him about it .

pesh jerked his head up at the loud bang behind him .

the garage door leading into the kitchen was thrown open with such a force that it rattled on its hinges .

megan stalked into the room , her mouth turned down in a determined frown .

she threw her purse down onto the floor beside one of the bar stools .

with a frustrated breath , she blew back a few errant strands of blonde hair that had escaped the loose knot at the back of her neck .

`` bad day ? ''

he asked , with thinly veiled amusement .

she glared at him .

`` yes , as a matter of fact it was . ''

`` what happened ? ''

`` well , where do i start ?

when i went to drop mason off at papa 's house , there was a woman there with him . ''

pesh 's brows rose in surprise .

`` patrick is dating ? ''

`` he claims she's- '' megan paused to make air quotes with her fingers , `` just a friend .

but i do n't buy it . ''

as he stirred the rice , he glanced at her over his shoulder .
