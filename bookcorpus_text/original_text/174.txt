`` brynn , be careful !

and i do n't think that 's poison ivy , anyway . ''

`` no , really !

see , it 's red- '' i break off as i feel the ground beneath me give way .

what i thought was solid earth was just an overhang of vegetation .

my stomach flies into my throat as i begin to fall , the horizon instantly becoming a blur .

i gasp and turn , frantically grabbing onto the dirt and branches nearby .

`` brynn ! ''

nate yells , and dives into the brush after me .

i feel him grab my hand as i struggle to find a foothold on the steep hill beneath me .

my feet frantically search for support and i begin to panic .

`` it 's ok , it 's ok , i 've got you , '' nate says .

the steadiness in his voice causes me to look up at him .

he 's looking back down at me , his eyes sure and calm .

i take a deep breath and reach my other hand up .

he grabs it and begins to pull me up .

`` under your right foot , there 's a rock , '' he says , peering over the edge .

`` do n't look down , just feel for it .

just an inch to your left .

keep looking at me . ''

the expression in his eyes arrests me , and i still for a moment , then slowly begin to move my foot to the left .

there .

i feel my sneaker knock against it , and move my foot up and onto it .

`` ok , now just push off and i 'll pull you up .

one , two , three ! ''

i shove my foot down and he kneels and pulls me up and back onto him .

i land squarely on top of him , shaking with fear and adrenaline .

i feel his arms reach around me and squeeze , almost pressing the last of the air out of me .

`` fuck , brynn , '' he whispers in my ear .

`` are you ok ? ''

i reply , realizing he 's landed on his back .

`` am i ok ?

are you ? ''

he says , sounding shocked .

`` um , i think so , though it 's hard to tell right now . ''

`` oh , sorry .

here , stand up , '' he says , and i lean to the side of him .

he jumps up then offers me both hands .

i take them and stand , wincing as i put weight on my right foot .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

`` my ankle , i think . ''

`` let 's get back on the trail where i can look at it . ''

he takes my arm and wraps it around his shoulder .

i feel his arm around my waist and i 'm practically lifted off my feet as he walks me back onto the trail .

he guides me down to a seated position and i lean back on my hands as he gently picks up my right foot .

`` it 's a little swollen , '' he observes , `` but i do n't think it 's broken-probably a bad sprain .

think you 're ok to walk back if i help you ? ''

`` yeah , i 'll be fine , '' i assure him .

he helps me stand up and puts my arm around his shoulders .

i take a deep breath as we take our awkward first steps back toward the boathouse , and i realize i 'm in for a full hour of being pressed up against him .

`` you 're really sweaty , you know that ? ''

i say with a smile .

`` hey , you better be careful or i might lose my grip , '' he replies .

`` how high up was i ? ''

`` probably best not to think about it . ''

`` that 's pretty high . ''

`` well , i 'm glad you 're alright ... mostly . ''

i do n't know if it 's the scare from almost falling , or if we 're both just tired , but the slow walk back takes place in almost silence .

i wish i could think of something to say to break the tension , but having his shirtless body pressed up against me is too much .

i can feel our sweat mingling together and our breath syncing along with the rhythm of our footsteps .

as we finally sight the parking lot , he stops and moves in front of me , then bends over , looking back at me expectantly .

i laugh and lift my bad leg up onto him , and then jump up as he hoists me the rest of the way .

he walks with me on his back until we reach the car , then deposits me right next to the passenger side door .

as he jogs around to the driver 's side , i turn to look around the parking lot .

there are still only a few cars here , and in the corner is a blue sedan with a woman wearing sunglasses behind the wheel .

i stare at her for a moment , because with her blonde hair , i thought for a moment that she was my mom .

as we make eye contact she quickly looks away , and i hear the car start after a moment .

maybe she was just staring at nate like the other women we encountered today .

or maybe she 's a reporter ... pierce warned the family that there could still be a few hanging around .
