she was n't sure she could survive another blow from him .

not right now anyway .

maybe once she 'd recovered from the tender care he 'd just shown her , she would be able to handle it .

`` i just need a little time to find my balance , '' she finally said , knowing that he was waiting for her to say something else .

`` you do n't really leave much room for anything , do you ? ''

`` i try not to .

would you have it any other way ? ''

he asked .

victoria inhaled sharply as his hand moved from her waist to her thigh , then back up again .

she wiggled in his arms and blushed when he chuckled .

`` oh no ! ''

she said and pushed against his shoulders .

she knew it was a useless endeavor unless he permitted it .

but since he did , she rolled him onto his back , her hair cascading around his face as she looked down at him this time .

`` you 're not going to do that to me again , '' she said , smiling in excitement .

`` oh , yes , victoria .

i 'm going to do it again and again , '' he countered and since his hands were no longer needed to hold his weight off her , they were free to skim across her back .

`` oh ! ''

she gasped .

`` i love the way your body responds to my touch , '' he growled , running his hands over her shoulders and arms , then back down her back .

`` does yours ? ''

she asked .

`` no , '' he responded but he smiled at the interest in her eyes .

`` are you sure ? ''

she asked , her tongue touching his skin , tasting the salt and enjoying his indrawn breath .

`` i think it is my turn , '' she said and bent to touch her mouth to his male nipple , loving the way his hands held her still .

but she had too much exploring to do and her head moved around .

her hands felt his muscles , touching him while her mouth continued its exploration .

as her mouth moved lower , she could feel his body tense .

feeling powerful and feminine , she moved lower , her mouth hovering over his manhood for a long moment before finally closing over him .

the harsh intake of breath she heard from him excited her and she continued , tentatively exploring and tasting , loving the velvet hardness of him .

long before she was satisfied , he pulled her up , bringing her mouth to his and kissing her while his hands settled her over him , having her straddle his hips .

`` you want power ? ''

victoria could only nod her head , feeling heady and so turned on she could barely think much less talk .

`` then take control , '' he said .

with a hand on each side of her hips , he slid inside her , watching her face as the surprise filtered in .

victoria moved her hips , then gasped in delight as feelings of intense pleasure seared through her body .

`` what do i do ? ''

she asked , moving again and loving the way it felt .

she continued to move in ways that caused pleasure , closing her eyes and letting the feelings course through her body .

`` anything , '' he rasped , lifting his hands to touch her breasts , then tangle in her hair , pulling her down to kiss her again .

`` anything you want , '' he said again .

victoria needed no further encouragement .

she moved , letting him slide in and out , enjoying the expression on his face as she did so .

after several minutes , he took her hips and controlled the pace , and within minutes , she was shivering , collapsing on top of his chest as her third orgasm ripped through her , leaving her helpless and languorous .

she had no idea that he 'd also found his release , just knowing that her body could n't move any more .

`` victoria ? ''

he asked , lifting her hair up so he could see her face .

victoria just put her hand over his mouth , moving her head so she could see him .

`` do n't speak , '' she said .

`` why not ? ''

he asked .

turning away so he could n't see her tears , she shook her head .

`` because each time we get to this point , you say something or do something nasty and then i 'll have to hate you again . ''

dharr was absolutely still for a moment .

`` and if i do n't say or do something nasty ?

how will you feel about me then ? ''

victoria started shivering .

it was the moment of truth and she was n't sure if she was up to it .

`` i do n't know .

i 'm still waiting to start hating you again . ''

dharr laughed softly .

`` would it help if you knew that i do n't want to make you hate me ? ''

he said .

pulling her hair off to one side , he let his fingers feel the softness .

`` in fact , i do n't think i 've been able to actually live without you for the past five years , '' he admitted .

victoria could feel his heart beat accelerate and turned to look at him .

`` why did you leave me like that ? ''

she asked , wishing she could stop the hurt in her voice but it was still too raw , especially after last night .
