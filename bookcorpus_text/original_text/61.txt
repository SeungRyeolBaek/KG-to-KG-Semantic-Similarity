he made it easy to open up to and speak of both the good and the bad in her life .

he was such a good listener that she never felt like she was just rattling on and boring him .

he truly seemed interested in everything she said .

it was an amazing feeling .

`` still doing okay over there ? ''

pesh asked , bringing her out of her thoughts .

she grinned .

`` fine . ''

`` i wish you could see your face , '' he mused .

`` do i have some dopey expression ? ''

she asked .

`` it is n't dopey .

it 's wide-eyed wonderment like a kid on christmas morning . ''

`` oh , i would totally believe it since this certainly feels like a very big and very dangerous toy . ''

`` it 's a wonderful sight to see .

i 'm so glad i get to share this with you . ''

he took one of her hands from the yoke and brought it to his mouth .

as his lips kissed over her knuckles , she tensed .

`` i need my hand back .

i do n't feel like i have a good grip on the steering wheel like you said i should , '' she protested .

pesh sighed and released her hand .

`` how i regret telling you that tip now , '' he lamented .

she smiled .

`` that 's not fair to try and distract me .

i need to focus , so we do n't crash . ''

`` all right .

i 'll keep my hands to myself ... for now . ''

a shudder went through her at his words .

at that moment if there was any way possible to actually fly the plane and bang him , she would have tried .

shaking her head , she tried ridding herself of her inappropriate thoughts .

`` what 's that ? ''

she asked , pointing at a dark blip far down on the horizon .

pesh leaned forward in his seat , peering out the windshield .

`` looks like a storm cloud moving in . ''

`` we should head back then . ''

he chuckled .

`` i do n't think it 's going to affect us . ''

`` yeah , well , i do n't like the thought of trying to fly in a storm . ''

`` then we 'll head back . ''

`` which way should i turn the plane ? ''

`` let 's take a right , '' pesh replied .

megan bobbed her head and then turned the yoke at the same time she pressed on the right rudder pedal with her foot .

`` good .

keep it coming .

we 're almost turned around . ''

once they were facing the opposite direction , pesh said , `` now let 's bring up the speed . ''

she did as she was told and waited for him to give her any further instructions .

`` we 're good to go now .

when we 're about ten minutes out from mccollum , you need to let the atc know we 're coming in . ''

`` okay .

i can do that . ''

`` do you have plans for this evening ? ''

`` not that i know of . ''

`` would you like to have dinner with me ? ''

she nibbled on her bottom lip to keep from laughing at his formalness .

`` i suppose so .

do i get dessert afterwards ? ''

his body tensed beside her .

`` are you implying that i 'm dessert , or that after we finish dinner i should get you dessert ? ''

megan laughed .

`` no , i want you for dessert . ''

`` then you can have me .

always . ''

glancing over at him , she said , `` i might have to ask for a to-go box since i 'm assuming we 'll have mason with us . ''

`` i do n't mind .

i enjoy spending time with him . ''

megan could n't keep the smile off her face at pesh 's words .

`` he really likes being with you , too .

i 've never seen him warm up to a stranger as much as he has to you . ''

`` i 'm a likeable guy , '' he teased .

`` yeah , you are , '' she murmured , trying not to let the out-of-control fluttering of her heart make her think more than she should about him .

pesh interrupted her thoughts by motioning to the controls .

`` go ahead and start doing your landing checks . ''

megan vaguely remembered what knobs and meters she had looked at before they took off .

once she got through the landing checks with pesh 's help , they were getting closer to mccollum .

`` now radio atc . ''

`` um , okay , '' megan replied , nibbling on her lip .

after clearing his throat , megan glanced over at pesh .

he motioned to the yoke .

`` oh , duh , '' she replied .

with her thumb , she pressed the push-to-talk button .

`` this is cessna 172 coming in for landing . ''

before she could ask pesh if she had done it right , he relayed a different message over his push-to-talk .

the atc 's response crackled over her headset .

`` cessna 172 , this is ground control confirming you are clear to land . ''

`` now push on the yoke to start the descent , '' pesh instructed .

after she did what she was told , her eyes locked on the speedometer .

`` should we be picking up this much speed ? ''
