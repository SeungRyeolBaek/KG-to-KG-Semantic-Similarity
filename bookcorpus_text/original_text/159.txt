`` several years ago , '' she replies .

`` long before he ever met you , '' i point out .

`` so , what ?

this woman 's going on tv ? ''

my mom nods .

`` one of those investigation shows is doing a piece about sexual harassment in politics , and she 's going to be interviewed . ''

`` what are you going to do ? ''

`` well , we 'll have to batten down the hatches .

we 'll probably have to stay in the house for a few days , though luckily tomorrow 's saturday anyway . ''

`` no , that 's not what i meant .

i mean , if pierce sexually harassed a- '' `` i do n't want to think about it . ''

`` mom , you have to , '' i sigh .

she 's always been like the child in our relationship .

i 'm tired of the dynamic , but i do n't know how to break the pattern without our entire relationship falling apart .

`` if pierce did that , then maybe you have to- '' `` do n't say it .

pierce and i are staying together .

that 's not a question .

and even if he did do it , i 'm sure it was a momentary weakness .

it was just something that happened a long time ago , and he 's changed . ''

i shrug , feeling helpless .

`` i want that to be true , mom , i really do .

not for his sake , but for yours .

i did hear a rumor at work , though , '' i say hesitatingly .

`` what do you mean ?

what kind of rumor ? ''

`` that ... pierce has a certain reputation . ''

`` why did n't you tell me ? ''

i want to tell her that it 's because she 's so fragile , but instead i just reply , `` because it was just a rumor that i heard from one person .

i had no way of knowing if it were true . ''

`` well , until there 's some evidence or something , i 'm going to believe pierce .

he said she was a woman at work who was denied a promotion she wanted , and now she 's starting a jewelry line , and thought she might as well put her bitterness to good use and drum up some publicity . ''

`` i guess that could be it , '' i say without conviction .

my mom nods .

`` i think i just want to be alone for a while .

do you think you could go back to the party , and sort of act like the hostess for me ?

you know , make sure everyone 's having a good time and all that ?

just say i have a headache if anyone asks after me . ''

`` um , alright , '' i reply , not knowing what else to say .

`` thanks , honey , '' my mom says , settling back onto the pillow .

i stand and head for the door .

`` i just ca n't believe it , '' i hear her murmur as i close the bedroom door behind me .

i wish i did n't believe it either , but there 's a telltale knot in the pit of my stomach that 's telling me i do .

i head back down to the party , taking the stairs slowly .

i 'd rather be doing pretty much anything else right now than plastering a smile on my face and pretending everything 's fine .

but i know my mom 's right-it will look odd if both of us disappear during the party .

i reemerge out back and take a deep breath as i cross back over to greg and allison .

`` sorry about that .

my mom has a headache , i just wanted to check on her , '' i relay dutifully .

greg and allison murmur sympathetically .

i finish the rest of my food quickly , and with only one ear on their conversation , before standing up with my drink .

i excuse myself and begin to mingle , trying to circulate and play the part of the hostess like my mom asked .

i watch the fading light impatiently ; willing the sun to set as fast as possible so that this party can finally be over .

the chipper event organizer i met earlier appears quietly at my side as i force a laugh at a partygoer 's joke .

`` have you seen mrs .

thornhill ? ''

it still throws me to hear my mom referred to like that .

`` she 's not feeling well .

can i help you with something ? ''

`` would you like the lanterns to be lit now , or should we wait ? ''

i glance around at the dimming light .

`` now would be fine , thanks . ''

she hurries away and i spot nate across the party , frowning at me .

i avert my gaze quickly .

if his dad has n't told him what 's going on yet , i do n't want the task to fall on me .

i see him making his way over , and excuse myself from my current conversation to disappear into a large group of people around the pool .

just another hour or so and the fireworks will be done , and everyone will leave .

the caterers move throughout the party , lighting candles on the tables and mini chinese lanterns strung in the trees .

i take a moment to admire the scene : the beautiful white lights , the well-heeled crowd , the murmur of easy conversation .
