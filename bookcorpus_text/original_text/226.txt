`` bob and i are going to get married , sweetie ! ''

deb goes on , her smile wavering .

`` we did n't want to upstage your eighteenth birthdays , though , so we 're going to wait until the weekend after . ''

`` how thoughtful of you , '' emerson snarls , his face turning bright red .

`` remind me to make sure and nominate you for mother of the year . ''

`` stop it , '' deb says , her eyes filling with angry tears .

`` you do n't get to ruin this moment for me .

you 're going to be happy for me , emerson .

for once in your goddamn life . ''

`` yeah .

i do n't really see that happening , '' emerson scoffs , his walls and defenses springing back into place .

`` at least tell your mother that you 're happy for her , emerson , '' my dad says harshly .

my eyes go wide at his tone .

he never reprimands emerson for anything .

`` already playing at being my old man , bob ? ''

emerson says , with a cold smile that does n't reach his eyes .

`` hate to break it to you , but that ship sailed a long time ago .

thanks for at least waiting until i 'm a legal adult to pull this crap .

that way i can bail on this shit show with no strings attached . ''

`` emerson , please , '' deb says plaintively , but it 's no use .

he 's already turned his back and marched out the door once again .

we hear his chevy start up and peel out of driveway .

i blink back devastated tears , looking longingly after him .

he could have at least taken me with him .

after everything we shared this evening , everything we did ... he said i could trust him .

was that just another lie to get in my pants ?

no .

of course not .

he 's just hurt by our parents ' carelessness .

hurt by what it means for us .

`` are you going to say congratulations at least ? ''

my dad asks me flatly , placing a comforting hand on deb 's back .

`` i ... i do n't ... '' i stammer , looking back and forth between them .

`` i do n't know what you want from me , dad . ''

`` that ... is very disappointing , '' he replies , looking as hurt as i 've ever seen him .

but how the hell am i supposed to congratulate them on what is clearly nothing more than an impulsive , terrible decision ?

they barely even know each other .

they 're still in the early stages of recovery .

what the hell are they thinking ?

`` so ungrateful , both of them , '' deb mutters , marching up the stairs .

dad heaves a sigh as she slams their bedroom door .

an eerie silence falls over the house , punctuated only by deb 's muffled sobs from upstairs .

my dad and i look at each other across the wide open space .

this is as alone as we 've been in months , ever since deb showed up on the scene .

i wish i could be honest with him right now , tell him how reckless he 's being , tell him how much it hurts me to see him pick up with the first woman he meets without actually giving a shit about her .

but i 've never been able to call my dad out on his bad behavior .

`` this is not how i saw tonight ending , '' he mutters , shaking his head .

`` i just wish you would have asked us if we were ok with this , '' i say , frustrated tears stinging my eyes .

`` excuse me , '' my dad replies , `` since when do parents ask their children for permission ? ''

`` i just ... you hardly know her !

she hardly knows you ! ''

i exclaim .

`` what is it you even love about her , dad ?

i mean , you do love her- ? ''

`` of course i do , '' he says gruffly .

`` i love how she looks .

how she carries herself .

her eyes .

her hair . ''

`` seriously ? ''

i ask , scoffing , `` you like the way she looks ?

that 's it ? ''

`` you and emerson will be adults soon , '' my dad says firmly .

`` before long , you 'll know what it feels like to want something-someone-so badly that you 're willing to do just about anything to be together .

i hope you 'll have the courage to make that leap when the time comes . ''

i almost laugh as he spews theses words of wisdom .

he practically just told me to go ahead and jump my soon-to-be-stepbrother 's bones .

but as absurd as this all is , i ca n't laugh at about it just yet .

the pain is far too raw .

there 's a good chance it always will be .

chapter five it 's three in the morning before i hear emerson 's car swing back into the driveway beneath my window .

in the four hours or so he 's been on the road blowing off steam , i have n't slept a wink .

have n't even come close .

my nerves have been on a hair-trigger , ready to snap clean in two , as i wait for him to return .

the second i hear his car door slam , i throw off my covers and roll out of bed .
