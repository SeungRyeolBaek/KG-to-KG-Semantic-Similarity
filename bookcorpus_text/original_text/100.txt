aidan laughed .

`` yeah , she is a little mini-emma , is n't she ? ''

`` she is .

boy , she 's going to give you hell when she 's a teenager , '' megan teased .

`` i know .

trust me , i know . ''

as caroline smiled up at her , megan could n't help sighing .

`` you 're a bad influence , missy .

you make me want to have another baby . ''

`` is that a bad thing ? ''

aidan asked .

`` no , it 's just ... '' `` just what ? ''

`` i asked pesh to give me a year of marriage before we start trying .

i know he 's ready right now , but i just want this time with him .

you know , just the two of us . ''

`` that 's understandable . ''

`` but holding her ... '' megan shook her head .

`` you 're just bad for business , miss caroline . ''

aidan laughed .

`` tell me about it .

whenever i hold her or noah , i think how much i 'm going to miss it when they 're not babies anymore .

it nags at me enough that i think i 'll be okay if we have more . ''

`` no vasectomy on the horizon ? ''

he grinned .

`` no yet .

still not ruling it out though .

and as far as you and more babies , you 'll know when the time is right .

and if anyone is patient and understanding , it 's pesh . ''

`` that 's true , '' megan murmured .

mason appeared in the doorway then .

`` 'mon , mommy .

want ice cweam ! ''

megan laughed .

`` okay , let me give your little bad influence back to you , '' she said , handing caroline to aidan .

she then took mason 's hand and started out of the bedroom .

`` daddy says i have ice cweam first . ''

`` did he ? ''

megan said , as she planned to strangle pesh .

`` uh huh .

'cause it 's my 'doption day . ''

when she met pesh 's eye , she raised her brows .

immediately , his face flushed .

`` spoiling him rotten already , are n't you ? ''

she questioned in a low voice .

`` i could n't help it .

it 's a special day . ''

`` mmm , hmm , and when this special day turns into an all nighter because he 's hyped on sugar , you 're going to deal with him . ''

pesh grinned .

`` i will .

i promise . ''

megan leaned up to kiss him .

`` you 're too sweet for your own good .

you 're always going to have me playing bad cop when it comes to discipline . ''

`` but you love me anyway , right ? ''

he murmured against her lips .

`` so much i was almost ready to reconsider our plan about when we 're starting a family . ''

his eyes bulged at her response .

it took him a few moments to speak .

`` that means a lot that you would do that , but deep down i know how you really feel .

so , i 'm going to be good and patiently wait ten more months before confiscating your birth control . ''

`` it 's a deal , '' she replied , before kissing him again .

epilogue as soon as he finished with his last patient , pesh practically sprinted from the exam room .

he hustled into the doctors ' lounge , trying hard to keep his head down and not call any attention to himself .

he wanted to be able to get out the door without anyone calling him back for a consult or to pull a longer shift .

once he had retrieved his things , he started for the parking lot .

`` dr .

nadeen ! ''

kristi called .

inwardly , he groaned .

`` yes ? ''

he questioned , as he turned around .

`` you were n't leaving , were you ? ''

she asked .

he exhaled a defeated breath .

`` i was planning on it .

does someone need me to cover for them ? ''

kristi winked at him .

`` thought you were screwed there for a minute , did n't you ? ''

a relieved laugh escaped his lips .

`` i did . ''

she smiled .

`` i have something for megan . ''

`` honestly kristi , you did n't need to do anything else for us . ''

waving her hand dismissively , she handed a pink gift bag to him .

`` i wanted to do this . ''

after peeking inside , pesh smiled before he leaned down to hug kristi .

`` thank you .

i 'm sure she 'll love it . ''

`` you tell her we miss her around here . ''

`` i will . ''

she patted his back .

`` now go on home to your girls . ''

he nodded and then hurried out the door .

today had been his first day back after taking both paternity leave and some of his many amassed sick days .

as he slid into the seat of his jaguar , he felt a rush of embarrassment at how he had actually gotten teary on the way to work that morning after leaving megan .

it had been the longest shift of his entire life .

he thought he would never be through so he could get home to her .

even now , the usual ten-minute drive home seemed to take an eternity .
