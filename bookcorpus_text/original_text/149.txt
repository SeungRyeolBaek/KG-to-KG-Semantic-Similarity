i gasp .

`` yeah , i just ca n't get this fucking tape to ... '' he struggles to wind a bandage around his palm .

`` let me , '' i say , spying a first aid kit on the counter by the window .

from the blood smeared on it , i can see nate 's already gone through it .

`` you do n't have to , '' he protests .

`` come over here .

the light 's better , '' i instruct him .

`` do you know what you 're doing ? ''

he asks , less than thrilled to accept my help .

`` more than you , '' i reply with a smile , nodding at the mess of tape around his palm .

i wash my hands in the sink and then open up the kit .

i take a pair of surgical scissors and cut off the tape that he 's already applied .

i glance up slightly , and for the first time it hits me that he 's shirtless , wearing only a pair of gym shorts and sneakers .

he 's covered in sweat .

`` how 'd this happen ? ''

`` i over-trained a little .

got dizzy , tripped on a rock and held out my hands to break my fall , '' he replies , eyes downcast as he watches me work .

`` over-training for what ?

lacrosse or crew ? ''

i ask as i pull out a piece of gauze and a bottle of hydrogen peroxide .

`` both .

either , '' he murmurs .

`` this is going to sting , '' i warn him , as i pat the gashes on his hands with the soaked gauze .

he hisses slightly as the liquid stings him , but does n't move .

i slide my other hand under his , to stabilize it as i cleanse the wound of dirt .

i 've never touched him this long before .

`` other hand . ''

he switches hands and i go to work cleaning the other one .

`` maybe you should take a little time off from training , '' i suggest quietly .

`` or i could just work out my leg muscles , '' he says , and i look up to see a wry grin on his face .

`` mmm , '' i murmur , smiling too .

`` you know , '' i go on , a bit more bravely , `` i heard that only one varsity athlete got a lawn room , because sports are such a time commitment , much less a two-sport athlete- '' `` do n't do that , '' he grunts .

`` i do n't want your pity . ''

`` it 's not pity , it 's facts . ''

`` i was born with everything , i have no excuse for not achieving my all of goals . ''

`` where did you hear that ?

it sounds like- '' i break off , feeling him stiffen under my touch .

i was going to say his father but i can tell he does n't want me to go there .

`` you 're just really hard on yourself , that 's all , '' i say instead .

i gently dab some neosporin onto the cuts .

`` i know what everyone sees when they look at me , '' he replies quietly .

`` entitled ... born with a silver spoon in my mouth ... i work as hard as i do so that no one can say i succeed because of my family 's wealth . ''

i frown .

that 's half of the equation i think , but it seems like he does n't see how hard his father pushes him .

`` i got a little bit of that at work the other day , '' i say , wondering if it 's ok to broach the topic of the internship he wanted .

i take a dry piece of gauze and cover his palm with it before picking up the tape and beginning to wrap it around his hand .

`` when they found out i was pierce 's stepdaughter , i mean .

feels weird . ''

`` your first experience of nepotism ? ''

`` yeah , '' i say with a smile .

`` actually , my mom once got me a part-time job as the receptionist at the salon where she used to work , so i guess that 's not true . ''

`` where does your dad work ? ''

`` no idea .

probably a repair shop somewhere .

he 's a mechanic , or he was .

last time we heard from him was several years ago .

he was in florida then , but he never stays in one place very long . ''

`` so you 're the first in your family to go to college , '' he observes , as i finish taping one hand and move to the other .

`` yep . ''

`` is that why you 're so serious ? ''

`` am i ? ''

i ask , my eyes moving up to his .

`` serious is n't the right word ... distant , maybe . ''

`` distant ?

that 's worse , '' i reply , feeling a little hurt .

`` i did n't mean to insult you .

i 'm just trying to figure you out .

we were really in class together ?

which one ? ''

`` there were three .

the first was this american history survey class freshman year . ''

`` professor michaels ? ''

`` yeah .

i always sat behind you , though .

i 'm not surprised you did n't see me , '' i say , pressing down slightly as i finish wrapping his hands .
