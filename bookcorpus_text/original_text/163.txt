his world is already falling apart around him , and i do n't want to make it happen faster .

i sigh .

i should probably go back to my room .

i turn over with a sigh and frown .

my sheets feel different , and the light coming in from the window is much too bright .

i blink my eyes open and then sit up with a gasp .

i 'm in nate 's room .

`` it 's ok. '' i glance up to see nate sitting at his desk with a glass of water , his tousled hair sticking out at odd angles .

`` they left early this morning for meetings .

your door is closed , so they thought you were still asleep in there . ''

`` oh , good , '' i reply .

i realize my nightgown is riding dangerously high on my thigh and pull up the sheet self-consciously .

`` coffee , '' nate says , pointing to the bedside table next to me .

i glance over and see he 's placed a steaming cup there .

`` cream and one sugar , right ? ''

`` yeah , thanks , '' i reply , reaching for it .

`` sorry about last night .

i do n't remember anything after i got home . ''

i smile even though i 'm disappointed that he does n't remember the kiss .

`` you were drunk , and just asked me to stay here for a bit .

i did n't mean to fall asleep . ''

i glance at the clock .

`` shit , it 's almost eleven ?

i never sleep that late . ''

`` i did n't get up 'til nine-that 's late for me . ''

my mind quickly returns to my concerns from last night .

`` i-i know you do n't like to talk about this , but your mom- '' `` what about her ? ''

he says , already sounding defensive .

i need to tread carefully .

`` i know that it 's painful to talk about , i just wanted to know : why did she leave ? ''

nate crosses his arms over his chest .

`` eileen left because she could n't handle being a mother . ''

`` what do you mean ?

how so ? ''

`` i was out of control when i was a kid , and she could n't handle it .

could n't handle me . ''

`` that 's what your dad told you . ''

`` that 's what happened , '' nate replies , frowning at me .

`` i still remember the night she left .

they went out for dinner , and i stayed home with a babysitter .

one of many , because i kept driving them away , and i misbehaved again .

i threw a tantrum , broke a glass ... i 'm pretty sure the babysitter quit as soon as my parents got home .

anyway , they got in this big fight-i could hear it even in my bedroom-and the next day she left . ''

`` and you 've never seen her again ? ''

`` in court a couple times .

but after that , she was n't really interested in seeing me .

she tries to call here sometimes , maybe she feels guilty .

she always tries to blame my dad for what went down , '' he adds bitterly .

`` did you think that if ... if you had been better , she would n't have left ? ''

he shrugs .

`` does n't matter now .

why are you asking about this stuff ?

did i talk about it when i was drunk or something ? ''

`` no , no . ''

i put my coffee down on the nightstand .

`` she called here last night . ''

`` eileen ?

you talked to her ? ''

`` well , yeah , she was really upset . ''

`` fuck , brynn , '' he swears , standing up .

`` why would you do that ?

this has nothing to do with you . ''

`` i was just trying to help ... '' `` i do n't need your help , '' he spits at me .

`` would you just listen for a second ? !

she called because she thought you might be willing to listen to her after what the woman said on the tv show- '' `` what are you talking about ? ''

he growls .

`` she said your dad was cheating on her , that 's why she left .

nothing to do with you . ''

`` get out , '' he says , raising his voice and pointing to the door .

`` nate , my dad left , too , ok ?

i know what it 's like .

but she sounded so lost , she 's desperate to talk to you .

i 'd kill for my dad to sound like that about me . ''

`` oh , so that 's what this is about , your daddy issues . ''

`` no !

that 's not what i meant , '' i plead , his words stinging to my core .

`` look , i 'm sorry that your dad is n't around , but your whole situation has nothing to do with mine ! ''

`` fine ! ''

i shout , feeling hurt .

i push off the sheets and stand up .

`` i promised her i 'd tell you , so i did .

i 'll never try to help you again . ''

`` that 's all i ask ! ''

he calls after me as i stomp out of his room .

i slam my bedroom door behind me , my fists balled in anger .
