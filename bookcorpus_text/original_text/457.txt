`` you 're a beautiful , responsive , normal female , '' he coaxed .

she wanted to just pull her hands out of his and move on , but he would n't let her go .

`` can we discuss something else ? ''

she pleaded .

he sighed , wishing he could do or say something to make her feel more comfortable .

but she was too skittish and he did n't think she would listen to him .

in all of his twenty-eight years , he had n't ever run into a woman who was as innocent , sweet and sensuous as ella but he was making a muck of the situation .

`` are you hungry ? ''

he asked instead , tucking her hand onto his arm and guiding her out the doorway .

he made sure she locked the doors before preceding her down the stairway , thinking the whole time that he was going to get her out of this place .

she was working too hard and pushing herself to make her way in the world , but he could do a lot to help her .

he did n't think she would accept his help , but he could figure something out to alleviate some of the financial stress she was under .

`` where are we going for dinner ? ''

she asked , trying to make conversation to alleviate her nervousness .

`` we 'll go to la tesata , '' he replied , holding the door to her building for her .

she stopped and stared up at him , unaware that her mouth had fallen open .

`` no ! ''

one eyebrow went up in surprise .

`` you do n't like italian ? ''

he inquired , but he specifically remembered how much she loved pasta .

it had been a major event when she and her mother were making spaghetti for the night .

as a young girl , she 'd practically danced down the street on those nights .

which was why he 'd told his assistant to get them a table at the very exclusive italian restaurant .

`` you know i love italian , '' she came back .

`` but i do n't think you could have gotten a reservation there .

the concierge at our hotel books tables there but he only gives them out to the very special hotel guests . ''

zayn almost laughed at her worried expression .

and he finally understood how his assistant had gotten the reservation so easily .

`` why do you think i 'm not one of those special guests ? ''

he asked softly , his finger touching her smooth , pale cheek gently .

ella gasped at the contact , looking up at him and blushing as those feelings from the previous night soared through her body once again .

and she was much more embarrassed by them tonight , now that she knew what could happen .

`` are you afraid of me , ella ? ''

he asked , amused by the idea , stepping closer and diminishing the distance again .

but he did n't want her to be afraid .

he wanted her to be proud of what they could make each other feel .

she bit her lower lip and tried to come up with a way to explain what he made her feel .

`` i think i 'm afraid of what you do to me .

i know that you would never intentionally hurt me , if that 's what you 're asking . ''

zayn smiled at her response .

`` let 's go , '' he said , knowing they needed to leave before he took her back into her apartment and forgot about dinner .

he pushed the door open and once again , ella stopped cold .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

ella was staring at the door to the limousine .

`` zayn , you borrowed your employer 's limousine ? ''

she asked , smiling sweetly up at him .

`` that 's very considerate , but not necessary .

i 'm already impressed with everything about you , '' she said , her green eyes lighting with happiness , all embarrassment gone with his thoughtful gesture .

zayn did n't miss his driver 's shocked expression when he heard ella mention a `` boss '' .

it was odd even to him .

`` ella , why is it so inconceivable that this might be my limousine ?

that this might be my driver ? ''

she hugged his arm slightly and zayn had to grit his teeth when he felt her full , soft breast press against his arm .

`` do n't worry about that , zayn .

i 'm not impressed by titles .

but la tesata is horribly expensive and i 've heard that their prices are n't worth the food .

let 's just go for a pizza .

one with lots of cheese and extra sausage .

okay ? ''

she suggested .

he almost laughed at her perception of him as a poor man .

`` i 'm taking you to la tesata , '' he answered her firmly .

`` if you want pizza , i 'll ensure that the chef makes you one with all the cheese and sausage you want .

deal ? ''

she was shaking her head , but he stopped her by simply handing her into the limousine .

`` i ca n't go there dressed like this , '' she answered , shocked by the very idea of appearing in the very elegant , very up-scale restaurant in a cheap , cotton sundress .

she sat primly on the buttery-soft leather seat next to him , worriedly looking up at him .

`` you can if i bring you there , '' he countered with absolute confidence .
