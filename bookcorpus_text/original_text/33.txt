`` i thought you two would never get here .

i 'm starving . ''

emma grinned .

`` sorry .

they were a little behind at the nail salon . ''

they pushed through the front door and were quickly seated by the hostess who knew them well .

once they eased into a familiar , comfortable booth , they took stock of the menus .

`` you have to order alcohol on our behalf since we 're both two knocked-up ladies now , '' casey insisted .

megan 's eyes widened .

`` i did n't know you were pregnant . ''

casey grinned .

`` yeah , nate finally wore me down . ''

she then shook her head .

`` sometimes i think he 's the chick in this relationship . ''

`` he must 've done some heavy convincing , '' megan said .

with a nod , casey replied , `` he comes from such a large immediate and extended family that he 's been itching to have a child .

we 've been married a year and together eight , so i guess it was just time .

and while i was n't thrilled with the idea of having a baby when his internship was so crazy , his hours will be better by the time the baby gets here . ''

`` when are you due ? ''

`` around the same time as emma . ''

that statement made emma beam .

`` our babies are going to be best friends , too .

i just know it . ''

casey grinned at the sentiment .

`` or boyfriend and girlfriend ... '' `` that 's a thought . ''

emma jerked her chin up .

`` i 'm not sure i want your son corrupting my little girl . ''

with her dark eyes widening , casey huffed , `` and what if it 's my daughter that your son is corrupting ? ''

emma giggled .

`` if my son takes after his father , then that would be the case .

but i think we also have to consider that if your daughter is anything like you , she 'll be the one doing the corrupting . ''

casey laughed .

`` that 's true . ''

`` guess i should keep mason clear of her too , huh ? ''

megan asked , with a smile .

`` probably , '' emma replied .

after the waitress appeared to take their drink and food orders , casey pinned megan with an intense stare .

`` so , '' she began , quirking her brow at megan .

`` i hear your doing your clinicals under dr. mcdreamy bollywood . ''

megan could n't help but laugh .

`` if you mean i 'm doing them under dr. nadeen , then the answer is yes . ''

emma nibbled on her bottom lip before speaking .

`` have things been awkward considering what happened the night of noah 's baptism ? ''

before megan could reply , casey 's eyes bulged .

`` whoa , whoa .

hold the phone .

something happened between you two ? ''

megan felt heat rising in her cheeks .

it was almost too mortifying to repeat , but finally , she filled casey in on each and every embarrassing detail that had happened .

`` man , he 's so freakin ' honorable , is n't he ? ''

casey mused .

`` yes , he is , '' megan replied , glumly .

emma shook her head .

`` there 's nothing wrong with his honor .

it 's what attracted me to him in the first place .

there are so few gentlemen left on the planet . ''

before she could stop herself , megan blurted , `` but i did n't want a gentleman .

i wanted to get laid . ''

casey grinned .

`` do n't we all ? ''

emma rolled her eyes .

`` just when i think your pregnancy hormones have n't made you even more sex crazed , you go and say something like that , '' she grumbled .

megan twirled the straw in her diet coke thoughtfully .

`` what 's bizarre is even though he should have been completely and totally turned off by what happened that night , he 's still interested in me .

i mean , the man is gorgeous and has half of the women in the hospital panting over him , and he still wants me . ''

`` then what 's the problem ? ''

emma asked .

`` he 's interested in dating , not sex . ''

emma 's brows furrowed .

`` but would n't you have sex eventually if you were dating ? ''

megan sighed .

`` we 're at a stalemate-i just want straight sex without dinner and a movie , and to quote him , he wants to show me a whole new world through a date . ''

`` how aladdin of him , '' casey quipped to which emma shot her an exasperated look .

with a shrug , megan replied , `` basically we 're going to stay forever in the friend zone because neither one of us is willing to give in . ''

`` would it really kill you to go out with the guy ? ''

casey asked .

megan widened her eyes in surprise .

`` you mean , you of all people are actually advocating me giving in to him ? ''

she jerked her thumb over at emma .

`` i 'd expect that out of her but not you . ''

casey dabbed the corners of her lips with her napkin .

`` it 's just a date .

i do n't think he 's going to drug you and drag you to a wedding chapel . ''
