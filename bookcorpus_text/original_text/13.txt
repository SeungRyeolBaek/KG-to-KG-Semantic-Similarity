she shrugged .

`` you just seemed a little too refined for beer . ''

he tilted his head at her .

`` what other preconceived notions do you have about me ? ''

`` none really , '' she lied .

in her mind , she could n't help thinking how she wanted to make him be dirty just for her .

she wondered what other surprises he might have up his sleeve .

`` for some reason , i do n't believe that . ''

he crossed his arms over his broad chest .

`` let me guess .

you think that i 'm a 'refined ' man who drinks wine , would never think of cussing or have inappropriate thoughts , organizes his underwear drawer , and who considers doing the crossword puzzle a fun friday night ? ''

megan could n't help snorting at his summation .

it was a good distraction not to focus on how he had mentioned inappropriate thoughts and his underwear drawer .

at the moment , she was having inappropriate thoughts about his underwear ... or hopefully lack thereof .

of course , she could n't help judging him as not being the commando type .

`` no , that 's not what i think of you . ''

`` i would hope not .

i know that since i 'm a little older than you- '' `` just a little ? ''

the corners of his lips turned up .

`` obviously you think i 'm an old man . ''

`` no , i do n't , '' she blurted .

`` how old do you think i am ?

just shy of adult diapers and a walker ? ''

she scowled at him .

`` i was not insinuating that at all .

i think you 're probably close to ankle 's age . ''

pesh 's brows furrowed in confusion .

`` ankle ? ''

she laughed before explaining where the nickname came from .

`` i see .

so just how old is ankle again ? ''

`` thirty-four . ''

`` hmm , '' pesh murmured .

`` are you younger than that ? ''

`` older actually .

i 'm thirty-seven . ''

damn , he was a lot older than her .

twelve years to be exact .

`` did i shock you ? ''

he asked , with a teasing lilt in his voice .

she shook her head .

`` i 'd hardly call thirty-seven old . ''

`` it 's considerably older than you are , right ? ''

`` i suppose , '' she lied .

he grinned at her as he leaned on the table with his elbows .

`` and just how old are you ? ''

`` twenty-five-i 'll be twenty-six in a few months . ''

`` twenty-five going on twenty-six . ''

`` yes . ''

`` i must be positively ancient to you . ''

he held out his hand and examined it .

`` i might have a liver spot or two . ''

she smacked his hand playfully .

`` shut up .

thirty-seven is not old . ''

`` see any grey hairs ? ''

he asked , bending over to where his delicious head of hair was in front of her face .

her fingers itched to run through the dark strands .

her mind ran straight to an illicit image of her fingers tugging on his hair as he went down on her , jerking too hard when he sucked and licked her until she came , and then stroking the damp hair back from his forehead as he rose up to cover her body with his .

she cleared her throat that had run dry .

`` no , of course not . ''

he jerked his head up to wink at her .

`` then there 's hope for me yet . ''

`` i would think so . ''

aidan appeared then , carrying all the drinks on a tray .

`` i expect a tip when you guys finish , '' he teased .

`` i 'll remember that , '' megan replied .

after jerking his chin toward the table next to him , aidan said , `` why do n't you guys come over here with us ? ''

she fought the urge to slap him .

she was enjoying having pesh to herself .

`` um , sure .

okay , '' she said , reluctantly rising out of her chair .

when they changed tables , she was glad to see pesh take the empty chair beside her , rather than across from her .

once she got settled in , she was n't lamenting her seat change too much .

between casey , and emma 's other best friend , connor , the table was kept in raucous laughter .

it was good being with a group of friends .

after she had gotten pregnant , she did n't have much in common with her sorority sisters anymore .

then when she became a mom , she rarely saw anyone from her old group .

her life moved in an entirely different orbit than theirs now .

the conversation and laughter flowed as easily as the drinks .

megan found herself halfway through her second margarita when she started feeling funny .

a flush filled her cheeks at the same time she felt clammy .

as aidan came back with another beer , she asked , `` did you put something different in this one ? ''

`` yeah , we ran out of the tequila i got for the party , so i gave my favorite niece a good dose of sierra silver . ''

`` what ? ''

megan demanded .

aidan 's brows furrowed behind his tipped back beer bottle .

once he swallowed , he asked , `` does it taste bad ? ''
