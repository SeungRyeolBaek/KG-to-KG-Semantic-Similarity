`` that 's what a sugar daddy will get you , '' bradley stage whispers .

delighted chuckles go up all around the table , and my embarrassment hardens into anger .

`` why do n't you focus on the task at hand instead of sniping like a little preteen , beardy ? ''

i snap back at him .

`` wow .

someone 's touchy , '' he says , raising his bushy eyebrows .

`` i thought hot sex was supposed to be relaxing . ''

`` hey , bradley '' emerson cuts in , whipping around the face the alternative douche bag .

`` why do n't you try shutting the fuck up . ''

the room goes quiet around us as bradley and his cohorts back down .

but instead of this being a relief , it only adds to my annoyance .

`` do n't fight my battles for me , '' i mutter to emerson , marching toward cooper 's door .

`` your battles ? ''

he shoots back , `` you 're in this alone now , are you ?

i could have sworn that it takes two to oversleep after tearing up the bed sheets all night . ''

`` no , i 'm just- '' i begin , but the frosted glass door swings open before i can finish .

`` ah .

you 're here , '' cooper says , appearing in the doorway .

his jolly demeanor has totally vanished , in its place is nothing but a cool , detached stare .

the transformation is total , and it takes me off guard .

but emerson 's not worried-or at least , he 's pretending not to be .

`` you wanted to see us ? ''

emerson asks , strolling into the office .

i hurry in after him , feeling a dozen judgmental stares boring into my back .

`` yes , '' cooper replies crisply , closing the door behind him and taking a seat at his desk .

`` have a seat , you two . ''

`` have a seat ? ''

emerson laughs .

`` feeling a bit formal today , coop ? ''

`` just sit down , emerson , '' cooper shoots back .

emerson and i sink down into the two chairs before cooper 's desk .

our boss looks back and forth between us , his expression unreadable .

emerson , for his part , looks cool as a cucumber .

i , on the other hand , probably look like i 'm going to be sick .

in fact , i just might be , depending on how this little meeting goes .

`` the last thing i want to do in my precious free time is intercept office gossip , '' cooper begins , crossing his arms over his sweater vest .

`` but the buzz about you two has been a bit impossible to ignore this morning . ''

`` people like to talk , '' emerson shrugs , leaning back in his chair .

i glance at him nervously .

his nonchalance could very easily read as disrespect .

`` be that as it may , '' cooper goes on , `` whatever it is that 's going on between you two is distracting the rest of your coworkers . ''

`` again , i do n't see how that 's news , '' emerson presses , `` they need to mind their own business and focus on their work . ''

`` that 's rather rich , coming from you , '' cooper says testily .

`` what are you talking about ? ''

emerson replies , `` i take my work for bastian very seriously , cooper .

you know that . ''

`` oh ? ''

cooper shoots back , `` is that why you missed our conference call with new zealand this morning ?

because you take this work so seriously ? ''

i watch as the color drains out of emerson 's face .

for the first time since we woke up this morning , he falters .

`` damn , '' emerson murmurs , sitting up in his chair , `` new zealand .

i forgot .

cooper , i 'm sorry .

i just- '' `` just what ? ''

cooper cuts him off .

`` overslept ?

blew it off ?

what explanation could you possibly have ?

you 're my right hand man in europe , sawyer , but that does n't mean you can just come and go as you please .

i thought you were committed to your position here . ''

`` i am , '' emerson insists , `` it was just a mistake .

look , abby and i have been having a pretty strange week- '' i wince as i 'm brought into the conversation .

cooper raises an eyebrow looking at me .

`` a strange week ? ''

he says flatly , `` miss rowan , has your first week here been so prohibitively strange that you 've just decided not to come into work at all ? ''

`` i. i 'm not , '' i stammer , `` it 's a really long story , mr .

cooper . ''

`` i 'm listening , '' he says , training his eyes on me .

i look over at emerson , who nods for me to go on .

i draw a deep breath and continue .

`` i probably should have mentioned this right after my interview , '' i begin , meeting cooper 's steady gaze , `` but emerson and i are n't exactly strangers .

we , uh , know each other from high school , actually .

and when i ran into him that first day , even after our interview went so well , i was going to turn down the job because of that .
