so it 's not like they 'll start anything with me .

rich people do n't do confrontation .

it 's not proper . ''

i 'm surprised to feel a twinge of annoyance at emerson 's generalizations .

my grandparents are n't perfect , but they 're the only family i have these days .

they 're the only people who have supported me through my life , even if that support has been more financial than emotional .

i 'm not ok with emerson slamming them .

`` are n't you a rich person now , too ? ''

i ask curtly , crossing my arms .

emerson raises an eyebrow , taken aback by my tone .

`` sure .

but i earned my money , '' he replies .

`` i have n't just been inheriting my advantages and coasting along . ''

`` like i 'm doing , you mean ? ''

i shoot back .

now i 'm really getting pissed off .

i thought that he , of all people , would n't be judgmental about something like money .

but i guess maybe i was wrong .

maybe having money has changed him .

`` you know i 'm not talking about you , '' he says , actually shocked by my reaction .

`` abby , you do n't coast .

you work your ass off , you 're great at what you do- '' `` well .

when you spend your whole life inheriting your advantages , you have a lot of time to devote to your interests , '' i say drily .

`` do n't put words in my mouth , '' emerson says sternly .

`` do n't spout orders at me , '' i return .

`` whoa , whoa , '' riley says , placing herself between us , `` back to your corners , you two . ''

`` he started it , '' i mutter , crossing my arms .

`` excuse me ? ''

emerson scoffs .

`` oh my god , '' riley groans , `` just because you 're in the same room again , does n't mean you get to revert back to your angst-ridden teenage selves . ''

before i can reply , the doorbell chimes .

my grandparents are right outside .

`` that 's my cue , '' emerson says , walking toward the door with me .

`` i 'm sorry for what i said .

i didn't- '' `` me too , '' i say quickly , pausing before the door .

riley is kind enough to go back into her room for the moment .

`` can i at least give you one last birthday kiss ? ''

emerson asks , catching my hand and placing the ring box onto my palm .

i nod , clutching the box to my chest .

emerson lowers his lips to mine , giving me a sweet , swift kiss goodnight .

i pocket the box , giddy and flushed , and pull open the front door .

my grandparents are revealed to us in all their finery .

i watch them go stock-still , forced smiles paralyzed in place , as they see emerson beside me .

it takes them a moment , but recognition floods in at last .

and the second it does , the goodwill drains from their eyes in an instant , replaced by sheer revulsion .

`` is that- ? ''

my grandmother breathes .

`` it is , '' emerson smiles , drawing himself up to his full , towering height .

`` good to see you again , jillian .

frank . ''

`` what the hell is he doing here ? ''

my grandfather says to me , refusing to look at emerson for another second .

`` he was just leaving , '' emerson replies , `` but you all have a good night .

happy birthday again , abby . ''

he leans over and gives me a kiss on the cheek , and i watch as my grandparents ' eyes bug out of their heads .

i 'm surprised they do n't keel over as he moves past them to the stairs and disappears from sight .

a long moment of silence unfolds as my grandparents stare at me , absolutely seething .

`` so ... do you guys want to come in , or- ? ''

i offer faintly .

`` abigail cecily rowan , '' my grandfather blusters , charging into the apartment with grandmother on his heels , `` how dare you subject us to that ? ''

`` excuse me ? ''

i reply , taken aback by his outrage .

i knew they would n't be happy to see deb 's son again after all these years , but they 're absolutely livid .

`` how could you blindside us like that ? ''

my grandmother asks , her nose wrinkled .

`` seeing that boy here , in our apartment- '' `` i thought this was my apartment , too , '' i cut in , `` i do live here , you know . ''

`` rent free , '' grandpa scoffs .

`` i 'm sorry , '' i reply tersely , `` i did n't realize that meant i could n't have a friend over to celebrate my birthday .

should i clear all my guests with you , or- ? ''

`` a friend ? ''

grandma hisses , grabbing onto my wrist with surprising force for such an old lady .

`` do you think we 're absolute idiots ? ''

`` of course not ! ''

i exclaim , `` i do n't understand why you 're so upset about this . ''

`` you do n't understand why we 're upset to see you hanging out with that piece of trash ? ''
