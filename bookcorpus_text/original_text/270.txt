it 's been preserved perfectly , lovingly , and for a spell i 'm too moved to speak .

two strong arms wrap around my waist from behind as i stare at the picture of teenage emerson , drawn by my very own hand .

i clasp his hands where they rest against my body , letting my head lean back against his chest .

`` you kept it , '' i whisper , turning my face toward his .

`` of course , '' he murmurs , resting his cheek against the top of my head .

`` that picture has traveled the world with me .

i 've kept it in every home i 've ever lived in , from my little apartment in philly to my flat in london .

every time i get to thinking that i do n't deserve my success , that i 'm just some punk kid who 's pulling one over on the rest of the world , i just look at this picture .

it 's always reminded me that there 's someone in the world who thinks i 'm strong , and worthy .

someone who loved me , once . ''

`` loves you , '' i whisper , turning to face him , `` not loved .

loves .

present tense . ''

`` i thought i was supposed to be the teacher this week , '' he murmurs , running his hands down the sides of my body .

`` what are you doing giving me a grammar lesson ? ''

`` oh , i think we both still have plenty to teach each other , emerson , '' i say , taking his scruffy , sculpted face in my hands .

`` you mean it , then ? ''

he asks , grabbing hold of my slender hips .

`` you ... you still ... ? ''

`` i love you , emerson , '' i whisper , letting those blue eyes swallow me whole .

`` i always have .

i always will . ''

`` thank god , '' he grins , pulling me to him , `` 'unrequited ' is n't a good shade on me . ''

`` you mean ... '' i breathe .

`` i love you too , abby , '' he says , `` but right now , i need you too much to waste another second talking about it . ''

`` fine by me , '' i murmur .

i throw my arms around emerson 's shoulders as he brings his lips to mine .

he scoops me up into his arms as his powerful jaw works my mouth wide open .

i clasp my ankles around his tapered waist , and he bears my weight as if it were nothing .

his tongue glides against mine , caressing it , as he spins me around in the air , laying me out flat across his king bed .

he lowers his staggering body to mine , encompassing me , subsuming me .

i can feel his every muscle ripple as we move together , a tangle of limbs and lust .

i bury my fingers in his hair , letting my tongue sweep against his as his hands roam down the length of my body .

he tastes exactly the same , beneath the fine red wine .

but while our bodies find the same easy syncopation we 've always known , there 's more sureness and grace in our motion .

emerson was all raw power at eighteen , but now ?

he 's totally comfortable in his body , assured and knowledgeable .

his every muscle is a tightly coiled spring of power and finesse .

i 've been craving his touch for eight years , but i never could have guessed how good it could possibly feel to have it again .

there 's no preciousness in our desire , now .

no need for things to be right or perfect .

we just need each other , in the rawest , most carnal way .

we tear at each other 's clothing , ripping off layers and tossing them across the room .

i rake my nails across the firm planes of his body-his rippling back , his impossibly cut torso-as he grabs hold of whatever part of me he can .

in a matter of minutes , our naked bodies are pressed together on his king bed , our skin flushed with want , our mouths insatiable .

`` i almost forgot this , '' i whisper , tracing the outline of his sparrow tattoo as he kneels above me .

his cock is rock hard , throbbing at its full , massive best .

i bring my hands eagerly to that pulsating length , shivering with delight as i wrap my fingers around his shaft .

his eyes close as i work my hands along the full stretch of him , my thumbs tracing along the ridge of his swollen head .

`` almost forgot this , too , '' i grin .

`` yeah ? ''

he growls , catching my wrists and pinning them over my head , `` well , let me remind you of a few other things , while we 're at it . ''

his eyes rake down along the length of my naked body .

my back arches as if his very gaze is caressing me .

i let my knees fall open as he brings his lips to the hollow of my throat , leaving searing kisses all along my skin .

he lowers himself to me as he moves his mouth over my body , letting me feel the tip of him brush against my wet slit .

`` you 're so ready for me , '' he growls , pressing his cock forward by just a hair as he kneads my tits with capable hands .
