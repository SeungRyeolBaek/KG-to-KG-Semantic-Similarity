a nervous silence falls over the car as we pull through the gates and onto the driveway .

he stops in front of the house and then turns to me .

`` why do n't i walk you to your door , '' he suggests .

`` sure . ''

a few butterflies begin to fly around in my stomach .

we undo our seat belts and hop out , meeting around the front of the car and walking up to the front door .

i glance at him out of the corner of my eye and wish there were something calming i could say to him , because he looks way more nervous than i do .

we reach the door and turn to each other .

`` well , goodnight , '' he says .

`` goodnight . ''

he pauses , looking into my eyes , and then begins to move forward .

i lean in , and close my eyes .

his lips touch mine and i frown slightly .

i mean , there 's nothing wrong with his lips or anything , but i thought i 'd feel ... more .

he keeps his mouth chastely pressed against mine for a few seconds and then pulls back and smiles at me .

`` goodnight , brynn , '' he says again .

`` goodnight , '' i reply , and turn to go inside .

i shut the door behind me , and lean back against it , disappointed .

greg and i get along well , and he 's such a nice guy-i 'd hoped i would eventually develop romantic feelings for him ... but that kiss ... was not so good .

i sigh and continue through the foyer and into the kitchen .

`` hey , '' nate greets me .

i stop as a buzz runs through me at just the sight of him .

that 's the feeling i ca n't manufacture when i 'm with greg .

`` hey .

you go for a run ? ''

i ask , taking in his sweaty appearance .

`` yeah , well , just on the treadmill .

too dark for a trail run .

did you ... did you have a nice time tonight ? ''

i glance over at him .

he gulps a long sip from a gatorade bottle and then puts it down on the counter .

`` um , yeah , it was good , '' i reply .

`` i was just going to watch a movie in the den if you 're interested . ''

`` fine , but i choose tonight , '' i reply with a smile .

we 've both committed to this whole being friends thing , though at times i feel like i 'm going through the motions .

i do n't know if i 'll ever be able to turn off the part of me that will always want more from him .

`` no romantic comedies , '' he says , as he walks to the door of the kitchen .

`` i 'm just going to hop in the shower really fast . ''

the phone on the counter rings and he steps toward it , but it only rings once .

we both look toward pierce 's study as raised voices emanate from that direction .

a moment later , we hear stomping coming our way and frown at each other in concern .

pierce storms in and walks to the fridge .

`` reporter ? ''

nate asks quietly .

`` your mother , '' pierce replies , equally quietly , though there 's a hint of venom in his voice .

my eyes flick over to nate .

i hope i have n't made the situation worse by taking her call that one time .

he meets my gaze and shakes his head quickly as though to warn me not to say anything .

`` i do n't know how she got this new number-it 's unlisted .

that bitch just wo n't give up . ''

my mouth drops open at pierce 's language .

i 've never even heard him swear before , and it 's so at odds with his genteel appearance that it sounds even more shocking coming out of his mouth .

`` we 're going to go watch a movie , '' i murmur , wanting to get away from him when he 's in this kind of mood .

i can feel the waves of anger coming off of him .

but pierce swings around to face nate , the gatorade bottle in his hand .

`` how many fucking times have i told you to clean up after yourself ? ''

he growls , and i shrink back .

`` i was n't done drinking- '' nate begins .

`` do n't interrupt me !

you think the rest of the world is just here to serve you ?

that everyone else exists to make your cushy life a little easier ?

you 've never had to work for anything in your life .

it 's pathetic , '' pierce spits at his son .

i remain frozen on the other side of the counter , feeling like a coward , and not knowing what i should say .

i see color rise in nate 's cheeks , but all he says is , `` yes , sir . ''

with that , pierce slams the bottle back on the counter and walks back toward his office without even looking at me .

nate remains motionless for a moment , then walks over to the bottle , drinks the rest of it , and tosses it into the recycling .

`` i 'm sorry , you did n't deserve- '' i start , feeling horrified by the scene i just witnessed .

`` you still want to watch that movie ? ''
