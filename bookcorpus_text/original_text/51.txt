he chuckled .

`` you 've gotten the more salacious side confused with what it actually is . ''

megan pursed her lips at him as her mind whirled with the possibilities .

after all , if tantric sex with pesh was anywhere as good as his efforts in going down on her , she was one very lucky lady .

`` i guess you 'll just have to educate me . ''

they were interrupted by an air traffic controller with a headset .

`` hey , dr. nadeen , how goes it ? ''

`` good .

thank you .

everything ready to go , lewis ? ''

pesh asked , as he pumped the man 's hand .

`` gassed up and checked out .

we just need your flight plan . ''

pesh 's gaze went to megan before he said , `` we 'll be flying into savannah/hilton head airport . ''

`` great .

thanks , '' lewis replied , before he started back inside the hanger .

`` you 're taking me to savannah ? ''

she asked .

`` for dinner and dancing .

i had originally intended on more , but we got a later start . ''

`` this is crazy .

you 're crazy . ''

he gave her a puzzled look .

`` you do n't like savannah ? ''

`` no , i love it .

i just meant taking me four hours away for dinner . ''

`` it 's not that long by plane . ''

crossing her arms over her chest , she tilted her head at him .

`` you could n't just take me somewhere fancy in atlanta ?

you have to fly me in your private plane to another city ? ''

he shrugged .

`` why not ? ''

although it was probably unattractive , she could n't help snorting with contempt .

`` i 'm probably going to sound a little like the line from pretty woman when she says she appreciates the seduction scene , but she 's a sure thing . ''

she patted her chest .

`` i am a sure thing .

you do n't have to go to all this trouble . ''

his dark eyes narrowed .

`` your way of thinking is precisely why i 'm doing what i am . ''

`` what do you mean ? ''

`` you 've only been with men who wanted a sure thing-men who did n't even bother trying to imagine a future with you past when they came at the end of the night . ''

she sucked in a breath at his words .

with his expression softening , he closed the gap between them .

`` while you may only want sex from me , i want far more from you .

i want your time , but i also want you to understand that you 're worthy of something special .

and if it takes planes and fancy meals to prove it to you , then i 'm going to do it . ''

after his argument , megan sat frozen in dumbfounded silence .

how was it possible that he knew so much about her ?

he was right in the fact that she settled for being the 'sure thing ' for the guys she dated in the past .

she knew she did n't want to make those mistakes again , so why should n't she let him try to wine and dine her ?

`` fine .

take me to savannah . ''

he opened the passenger side door .

`` here you go .

make sure you buckle your seat belt . ''

she nodded before she dipped inside the plane .

pesh waited for her to adjust her dress before he closed the door .

as he walked around the front of the plane , she got busy finding the seat belt and buckling up .

once he climbed inside , he handed her a headset .

`` this will help with the cabin noise . ''

`` it 's going to mess my hair up , '' she complained .

he laughed .

`` i never took you as the type of woman who worried about her hair . ''

she grinned as she eased the headset on .

`` now you know .

i worry about my hair , and you get your freak on in the bedroom . ''

he rolled his eyes at her and turned in his seat .

after placing his headset on , he started flipping switches and turning knobs .

the propeller on the front of the plane started whirling .

`` so what kind of plane is this ? ''

she asked over the noise .

holding up a finger , he spoke into the mic on the headset .

`` ground to tower , this is cessna 172 requesting to taxi for takeoff . ''

suddenly the sound of the tower came over her headset .

`` clearance for taxi and takeoff , cessna 172 . ''

`` roger that , '' pesh replied .

the plane lurched forward and then started taxing down the runaway .

`` hmm , i 'm guessing a cessna 172 ? ''

pesh smiled .

`` yes , it is . ''

`` it 's nice .

i like it . ''

`` i hope you 'll be saying that again in a minute . ''

megan knew what he meant when the plane started gaining speed down the runaway .

just like when she was on a commercial flight , it was on the ground one minute , and then in the air the next .

they soared into the blue sky while zipping through white , fluffy clouds .

once they had gained enough altitude , pesh eased off on the rudder and glanced over at her .
