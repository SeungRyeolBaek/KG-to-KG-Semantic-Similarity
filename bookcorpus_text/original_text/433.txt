i 'm not afraid of you . ''

that answer caused his eyes to widen .

`` i think you should be afraid , '' he cautioned .

she tried to yank her hands free , but he had a very good grip on her hands .

she thought quickly .

`` so are you going to condition my hair ?

since you 've already washed it , i mean . ''

he looked surprised by her apparent change of subject .

`` condition ? ''

he asked , stupefied by her request .

he glanced down at the second bottle sitting next to the shampoo .

`` is that it ? ''

he asked and glanced back up at her .

`` yes , '' she replied , trying very hard to look innocent .

he put both of her hands in one of his before he reached down for the conditioner .

he knew something was up , but he could n't figure it out .

he took the bottle and squeezed some into her hair .

when he realized what he needed to do , that he would need both hands , he spun her around easily , pressed her back against the tiles and pinned her in place .

`` you 're up to something , '' he said with his husky voice .

`` but for the life of me , i ca n't figure it out . ''

she continued to keep her face straight and all the amusement out of her eyes while he massaged her scalp with his hands once again .

he was completely missing the point of the conditioner , but to win this battle , she was more than willing to sacrifice today .

`` mmmmm ... that feels really good , '' she said , closing her eyes so he would n't see her intent .

`` and you know what 's best ? ''

she asked , rolling her head to the side .

`` what ? ''

he asked and she could hear the suspicion in his voice .

she opened her eyes and looked up at him with wide eyes , her smile growing slowly .

she waited until he knew she was up to something before she said , `` you 're hands are n't going to be able to hold me now , '' she said and slipped out of his grasp and spraying the water right at him .

unfortunately , she had severely underestimated her opponent .

his hands might not be able to stop her , but his arms were incredibly strong and he had years of military training on his side .

she only got away with the initial sting of success before he hand her flipped around and repined once again , using more of his legs than anything else .

to make it worse , she was laughing so hard she could n't put up a fight , or even hold him away from her as he held her in place and tickled her mercilessly , his fingers made more nimble by the conditioner that helped them slide over her skin .

`` i give up ! ''

she cried out , gasping for air .

`` i promise to behave ! ''

she begged .

he stopped and looked down at her , one eyebrow raised in challenge .

`` who says i want you to behave ? ''

her surprise was only for a moment before she started laughing once again , charmed by this side of him that she 'd missed so much .

`` so what do you want ? ''

she asked , not sure she actually wanted him to answer .

`` hmmm ... .that 's a loaded question .

i want you , naked , all weekend , in my bed without any interruptions . ''

her smile grew broader as he finished his description and her whole body tingled with excitement .

`` is that what will happen next weekend ? ''

he kissed her gently .

`` hopefully it will happen this weekend as soon as tonight 's event is finished . ''

`` i thought you had that embassy thing tomorrow .

is n't that why you bought me the second dress ? ''

he sighed and leaned his head back .

`` i hate those parties .

they are the most tedious few hours in existence . ''

he brought his head down and looked at her with an intensity that had her gasping for breath .

`` but you 'll be there tomorrow and i do n't have to let you out of bed after that , right ? ''

she could n't help but agree , nodding her head enthusiastically .

`` well , except for riding , '' she clarified .

`` okay , one ride . ''

`` and maybe dinner with my dad ? ''

she asked .

he sighed .

`` lunch ! ''

he contradicted .

`` deal . ''

`` and you 're naked the entire rest of the weekend , '' he commanded .

she sighed and tilted her head to the side as if considering his request .

before she could say anything , he grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up , twisting so he could rinse out her hair .

`` you act like this is up for debate , my beauty .

it is n't . ''

he lifted his arms and moved her hair around so the conditioner would rinse out .

`` so i 'm to be restrained if i do n't obey ? ''

she asked , lifting her eyebrows as he shut off the water .

he stilled , a wolfish grin spreading across his face .

`` i think you are a brilliant woman . ''

he lifted her once again , carrying her out of the shower stall and setting her down on the soft carpet .
