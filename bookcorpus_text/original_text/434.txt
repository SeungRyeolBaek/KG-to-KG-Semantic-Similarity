he grabbed a towel and gently dried her off .

`` i think i might have stumbled into something out of my league , '' she replied , putting her hand on his head to balance herself .

`` ah , but you wo n't know until i have you completely at my mercy . ''

he stood up and looked down at her with that special intensity that never failed to melt her bones .

she reached up her hand , touching him gently on the cheek with her fingertips .

`` does that mean you 'll be at my mercy ? ''

she asked softly , bending her knee slightly so she could lean against him , the towel hanging uselessly by his side .

she should feel cold with the cooler air from her apartment hitting her wet skin .

but with rais looking at her with that kind of promise in his eyes , she felt nothing but heat , feeling almost uncomfortably warm .

`` absolutely , '' he almost whispered , pulling her close and kissing her gently .

when he released her , she almost skipped into her bedroom to dress , feeling as if her world was perfect now that he had come back here early .

the whole 'love ' and 'end of relationship ' issues were not going to intrude for the next seventy-two hours , she told herself firmly .

she glanced at the clock as she pulled on her slacks and a silk blouse .

`` what are you doing today ? ''

she asked , her mind already going through her own schedule .

she had last minute inspections at his house and was going out to supervise all of the last minute setups .

everything needed to be finished and in place by five o'clock , she 'd told everyone so she could go to her father 's place and get herself ready .

`` i have meetings downtown , '' he commented , walking to her closet and pulling out a suit .

he winked at her as she blinked at his use of her space .

she was so surprised , and that silly , bubbly feeling in her stomach started up again as she thought of how domestic the two of them seemed to be right now .

waking up , showering , getting dressed ... it was nice , she thought .

`` coffee ? ''

she asked and added a bit of mascara to her lashes , then tossed all her makeup into a bag to take with her for the night .

`` please .

are you ready to go ? ''

he asked , coming out of her bedroom after her , straightening his tie which he 'd just knotted into a perfect knot .

she looked around , glancing at the boxes that she 'd set on the sofa earlier .

`` i think so , '' she replied warily .

`` what are you wearing ? ''

he asked , noting the boxes and her nervous glance back to him .

she bit her lip , trying to make up her mind .

`` i 'll wear the black lace tonight , '' she said softly and was rewarded by his triumphant grin .

`` does this mean i can send you other presents and you 'll accept them more easily ? ''

`` no ! ''

she replied firmly , shaking her head .

give him and inch and he would take a mile , she thought with exasperation .

`` why not ?

if it gives me pleasure , would you deny me that ? ''

she laughed as she poured him a cup of coffee into a travel mug .

`` i think you get too much pleasure as it is , '' she replied , refusing to give in on this issue .

he accepted the coffee but blocked her way .

`` you know , you 're going to have to give in on some of the things i give you . ''

she laughed and leaned back against her counter , holding her own coffee out to the side .

`` and why would i do that ?

i think i prefer keeping you on your toes . ''

he leaned forward , forcing her to lean back slightly .

`` i will win this one , rachel .

you will eventually be dressed only in the clothes i have bought for you and draped in jewels that i have given you .

and you will love every moment of it . ''

`` will i ? ''

she asked sarcastically .

`` i do n't think so .

i prefer being independent . ''

he looked down at her carefully , trying to calculate a way to get her to give in to his preferences .

`` and what if you were in a position in my government that would require you to be dressed in a certain way ? ''

she considered that carefully .

`` first of all , i would n't accept a position in your government , '' she replied .

`` that would n't be very ethical .

i 'm already having a problem because we 're lovers and you 're also a client .

my boss is concerned as well , '' she said as a side issue .

`` but regardless of that , i would n't feel comfortable accepting gifts from a man . ''

he grinned as if he had a secret .

`` you 're going to get over that pretty quickly . ''

he took her hand and lifted it to his mouth to kiss her knuckles .

`` your helicopter awaits , '' he said and pulled her out the door .

`` i heard that you were n't utilizing that this past week .

would you explain why ? ''
