`` yes .

do you like lemon ? ''

she asked tentatively .

they were her favorite kind of cookie but she knew some people did n't really like lemon or the sweetness of these kinds of cookies .

they were lemon cookies with a very sweet lemon frosting on them .

victoria knew she had a horrible sweet tooth and liked things extra sweet .

`` i do .

i just do n't think ... . '' he stopped , glanced at her and smiled before popping the cookie into his mouth .

his eyes widened in surprise and delight as he tasted the rich , sweet cookie .

`` this is delicious , '' he said and picked up another one .

victoria 's face brightened and she felt a warm glow spread through her system .

`` i 'm glad you like them , '' she said and pushed the bowl containing the rest closer to him .

she glanced off to the side nervously then busily prepared the roasted chicken on a plate for him along with potato salad and freshly sliced peaches .

when he popped three more into his mouth , she laughed .

`` you 're going to ruin your appetite for dinner , '' she admonished .

`` what else is there ? ''

he asked , sneaking one more cookie before taking the plate she offered .

victoria moved so she could check behind him , then glanced down .

`` i made garlic chicken and potato salad .

but i did n't put celery in the salad .

i hate celery .

i hope you do n't mind . ''

`` potato salad ? ''

he asked , moving his plastic fork around on the plate to investigate the white mass of potato salad she 'd just put there .

victoria stopped her search for his guards and blinked at him , her green eyes astonished as she watched him move the potato salad around , sniff it , then take a taste .

`` have you never had potato salad ? ''

she asked .

dharr shook his head .

`` i 've never had a homemade cookie , i suppose you could say .

this is a night of firsts for me . ''

that was too odd .

`` what do you mean ?

did n't your mother make cookies for holidays or company ? ''

dharr chuckled .

`` i do n't think my mother knew where the kitchen was , '' he said honestly .

`` she would simply tell her assistant who would be attending any given function and her assistant would tell the chef . ''

victoria swallowed with difficulty .

`` you had a chef ? ''

she asked .

`` and your mother had a personal assistant ? ''

she 'd known he was wealthy but that statement put him into a whole different realm .

and the idea of never making cookies with a parent made her feel sad .

`` i 'm sorry you did n't make cookies , '' she said , putting her plate down onto her lap , her eyes expressing her sympathy for a childhood devoid of a wonderful bonding experience with a parent .

`` did you ever wish you could ? ''

dharr 's black eyes looked up at hers and he almost laughed .

but the sincerity he saw there made him stop .

she really felt bad for him ?

he ran a finger gently down her un-bruised cheek and smiled .

`` i did n't know i was missing anything significant .

none of my friends ever had the experience either so do n't feel bad for me . ''

victoria could see the humor in his eyes and felt silly suddenly .

obviously he had a completely different upbringing than she did .

`` well , how about the potato salad .

do you like it ? ''

dharr took a bite skeptically .

but again , his eyes showed his surprise at the savory bite of potato in a creamy , garlic sauce .

`` it 's delicious .

where did you get it ? ''

`` i made it silly .

you ca n't really buy good potato salad .

besides , most places put celery in it and , as i said , i hate celery . ''

she took a bite and glanced behind her again .

dharr caught her nervous look and sighed .

placing the plate beside him , he took her hand in his .

`` victoria , i ca n't send them away .

but i promise you that they are well hidden and are looking outwards and definitely not looking at us . ''

victoria sighed and her shoulders drooped .

`` i 'm sorry .

we 're obviously from different worlds .

you have guards and chefs and personal assistants .

i have a messy kitchen and a suitemate with loud tastes in awful music . ''

`` ah , but you 're looking at the things that are different but consider the things that draw us together . ''

`` i ca n't really see many of those , '' she laughed .

`` i see you 're beautiful eyes , and a mouth i 've been wanting to kiss ever since we sat down .

i see you 're lovely ... '' he was about to say breasts but changed his mind , afraid she would n't appreciate his comment , `` hands that have made this delicious meal for me and i feel honored . ''

victoria smiled , suddenly glad she had gone to so much trouble .

she had heard the hesitation in his voice and a part of her wondered what he had been about to say , but then his lips touched hers and all her thoughts flew away .

she leaned forward , wanting to kiss him as well .
