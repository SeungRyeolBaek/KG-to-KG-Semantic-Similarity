`` you should know that victoria would n't be interested in the men you bring around , jasmine .

just look at them and then look at her .

all the men you introduce her to have body piercings .

does victoria really look like someone who would be interested in someone like that ? ''

jasmine looked at her sweet , innocent looking suitemate and sighed , knowing that scott had a point .

`` eh , you 've got to try them all on , you know , before you settle down with one of them . ''

scott took a sip of wine before responding to jasmine 's latest philosophy for her life .

`` that 's another thing , victoria does n't try them on .

she barely even tastes them . ''

victoria laughed , knowing how the discussion was heading since it had all been said before .

`` stop .

you both make me sound like a frigid old maid .

i 'm not quite on the shelf yet , you know . ''

scott eyed victoria in the dress .

`` we can only hope that this dharr person takes you down from the shelf , dearie .

i 'm telling you , you 're missing out on a lot of fun . ''

victoria shivered in excitement at the idea of dharr 'taking her off the shelf ' , so to speak .

`` well , i 'm glad you both wo n't be accompanying me tonight .

i shudder at the idea of what you would suggest during dinner . ''

`` as long as you 're shuddering , dear , that 's all we care about , '' scott said .

jasmine clinked glasses with him , chuckling at their turn of phrase .

victoria just rolled her eyes and picked up her books .

`` i 'm heading out .

i 'll see you later , '' she called out as she left the dorm .

she had only five more minutes before dharr was supposed to be picking her up at her dorm .

she 'd have to hurry to get back there in time .

she reached her dorm just as dharr was walking up the steps .

`` hello ! ''

she said , slightly breathless from rushing across campus in high heeled shoes and the two flights of stairs .

`` let me just drop my bag inside and grab my purse , '' she said .

`` you look lovely , '' he said and watched her rush across the room , enjoying again her refreshing innocence .

he questioned his instincts yet again .

his mind was telling him that she was pure but he could n't understand how someone with so lush a figure could not know a man 's body .

it was inconceivable to him .

but he was going to enjoy the illusion for a while .

`` thank you , '' she said and turned to face him , looking down as she picked up a small beaded purse .

the purse did n't really match the dress but it was the only evening bag she owned .

it would just have to do , she told herself .

`` i 'm ready , '' she claimed .

`` i hope so , '' he said and offered his arm .

victoria placed her hand on his arm and smiled shyly , his words echoing in her mind as she tried to translate them .

finally , she just enjoyed the delicious feeling of touching his arm , wondering what it would be like to kiss him , have him kiss her back .

dinner that night was incredible for victoria .

she was from a small village and , prior to dinner with dharr , attending university in london had been the most amazing thing to have happen to her .

but being in the expensive restaurant , surrounded by the movers and shakers of london society , victoria tried to hide her awe for fear of looking like a silly , country girl in front of dharr who seemed completely at home in the environment .

the menu was in french and , although she could speak it conversationally , with dharr sitting across from her , the menu might as well be in swahili .

`` would you like me to order for you ? ''

he suggested , noting her nervousness and assuming it was because she could n't read the words .

`` yes , that would be lovely , '' she said , laying her menu to the side and sighing with relief .

now she could hide her shaking hands under the table .

dharr ordered in perfect , fluent french , ordering a bottle of champagne that , if victoria had been more worldly , she 'd know cost over a thousand dollars a bottle .

she knew he ordered her a salad and himself a beef dish and she tried not to cringe .

she hated salad but thought it was what he expected her to prefer .

and since she had n't had the temerity to order for herself , she deserved what she got .

`` tell me about yourself , '' he commanded when the waiter was gone .

victoria took a breadstick and smiled .

`` what would you like to know ? ''

she asked .

`` everything . ''

`` everything ? ''

she teased .

`` is n't that a lot for a first date ? ''

`` absolutely .

so start talking , '' he commanded .

but she saw the humor in his eyes so she did n't take offense .

`` well , as i mentioned yesterday , i 'm twenty years old and am attending the university of london on scholarship .

i 'm studying psychology but considering making my focus children 's psychology . ''
