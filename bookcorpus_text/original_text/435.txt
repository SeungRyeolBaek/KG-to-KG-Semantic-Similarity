she grabbed her purse , her notes and the bag she 'd been packing all week in preparation for this weekend .

`` i need those boxes , '' she said , pulling against his hand .

he opened the door and took her bag off of her shoulder , handing it to a man who was already standing outside of her apartment door .

rachel glanced back , grabbing the bag because she thought it was falling off of her shoulder .

when she saw the strange man with the dark , bulky suit , she stumbled slightly , only catching herself when she quickly put her foot behind her .

the man looked vaguely familiar but she was late and had to grab the boxes .

`` gerard will get that , rachel , '' rais admonished patiently .

she glanced up at him , at the guard then back to rais .

`` i do n't ... '' `` come along , '' he said and took her hand once again .

the guard waited until they were out the door before entering the apartment to pick up the boxes .

a moment later , he had the boxes in his arms and was following both of them down the hallway .

the only uncomfortable moment was when she passed by her neighbor 's door just as the older woman was also leaving her own apartment .

the woman glared at rachel , then up to rais before sniffing and shaking her head .

rachel was mortified , completely understanding that the woman was irritated because of all the noise she and rais had made overnight .

the apartments were n't the best in the city and the walls were n't very thick .

she 'd suspected that their nocturnal activities had been overheard but having evidence of it so blatantly in front of her was unnerving and embarrassing .

`` what was all that about ? ''

rais asked when they were in the elevators alone .

`` that 's margaret .

she has two kids and shares a wall with me . ''

he immediately understood and almost laughed .

`` and i suppose she did n't get very much sleep last night either , eh ? ''

rachel wanted to punch his arm , but she refrained since his body guard was in front of the two of them .

`` i think her look explained that her rem sleep was deeply disturbed . ''

he led her outside into the sunshine and rachel blinked before she got her sunglasses in place .

when she did , she looked around , then stopped in her tracks .

the two men she 'd seen throughout the week were standing beside a long , black limousine .

she stopped and looked at the two of them , pulling on rais ' hand .

`` do n't get in the car , rais , '' she whispered and pulled him closer , stepping in front of him as if to guard her .

the two men looked at each other , then back to her .

rais was pulling her to his side , trying to understand .

`` what 's wrong , rachel ? ''

he asked softly .

since he was trying to pull her to his side , she plastered herself against him , terrified that these men were out to hurt him .

`` those men , '' she whispered , `` i 've seen them before . ''

he looked at the two men who heard her despite her whisper .

`` of course you 've seen them , '' he said gently .

`` they have been watching out for your safety while i 've been gone . ''

she blinked and looked up at him .

`` my safety ? ''

she squeaked .

`` yes .

they 're your personal body guards . ''

she looked back at them , surveying the bulges under their dark suits .

`` are they armed ? ''

she asked , terrified of what those bulges might mean .

`` of course they are , '' he laughed softly , his arm wrapping around her .

`` get in the car and let 's talk . ''

she sensed that he was both amused and irritated , but for the life of her , she could n't figure out why .

she was furious with him .

how could he have put some thugs on her , trailing her all over the city and countryside , without telling her !

she slipped into the back , still watching the two men warily .

she held her tongue until the door was closed but as soon as they were alone again , she let him have it .

`` what do you mean they have been assigned to me ?

i did n't consent to being guarded .

and do you have any idea how terrifying it is to be followed and not know why ?

those men were n't very subtle in their guardianship , or whatever it is that you call it . ''

an eyebrow went up with her diatribe and he leaned back .

`` i had no idea that you were aware of their protection .

they were supposed to be around , but as inconspicuous as possible . ''

she stared at him as if he 'd lost his mind .

`` you arranged for someone to follow me and did n't bother to mention anything to me ?

why would you do that ? ''

rais sighed and rubbed his hand over his face .

he knew that rachel was really upset about this and he was n't sure how to appease her without telling her of his plans for her .

`` i need to make sure you are safe , rachel .

and i 'm sorry for not telling you .
