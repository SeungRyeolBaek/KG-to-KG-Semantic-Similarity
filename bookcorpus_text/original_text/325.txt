because if she 'd realized he was a king at that time , she would have run the other way .

she had n't wanted him to be anything other than a normal man .

that meant that she was free to be with him .

each time she 'd started to think he might be more than what he was letting on , she 'd dismissed the idea as too far fetched .

but deep down , she had n't wanted to acknowledge that he was out of her league .

`` good afternoon , '' he said , putting down the report he had been reading .

`` are your rooms adequate ? ''

this formal man standing before her was unfamiliar .

`` yes .

they are very nice , '' she replied , just as formally .

why was he asking her this when she 'd been here for almost two weeks already ?

something was up .

she just could n't figure it out yet .

`` good .

how are the children ? ''

he asked .

this was familiar ground for her .

she relaxed slightly and considered all the issues she 'd unraveled today .

`` i think they are fine .

i just left them in the school room . ''

`` you do n't like ms. mattingly , do you ? ''

he questioned .

victoria hesitated for only a moment before replying , `` no .

i think she is part of the problem . ''

`` in what way ? ''

he asked , waving her into a seat .

victoria looked down and took one of the large , leather seats grouped around a coffee table .

`` would you like some coffee ? ''

he asked , lifting an elaborate silver coffee pot , prepared to pour her some .

`` no .

thank you . ''

she sat on the edge of her seat and looked around at the various paintings , the beautiful furniture , anywhere but at the handsome but completely intimidating man in front of her .

`` i think she is a perfectly adequate teacher for older students but for a three year old and a six year old , they need to be more active .

i 've never seen children that age sit still for so long . ''

his eyebrows came down into a straight line across his dark eyes , as if he disagreed with her on this point .

`` is n't that a good thing ? ''

he asked .

her eyes whipped back to his and she answered , `` of course not , '' without thinking of a more diplomatic reply .

he was surprised , but did n't take issue with her immediate contradiction as she had anticipated .

`` please explain . ''

she needed to choose her words carefully so he would understand .

arina and bajan needed her to be able to get through to dharr so they could be free of their strict , daily routines .

she started off slowly , `` children that age need activity .

their brains do n't work the same way an adult 's does .

they need to see , hear , feel , possibly taste the things they are learning .

the more ways a person absorbs the information , the better it will stay in their minds .

rote memorization is n't the best way to learn . ''

he smiled slowly .

`` you 're very passionate about your ideas , victoria .

i do n't remember you being this strong minded . ''

victoria flushed , thinking back at how pathetic she must have seemed , trying to please him at every turn .

`` i guess i 've grown up and developed opinions of my own .

i do n't care if you do n't like it , '' she said , her chin lifting a fraction of an inch as a challenge .

`` and what if i do ? ''

he asked softly .

that confused her .

the admiring glance also made her warm inside but she ignored that feeling , knowing that he was just trying to charm her .

`` i 'm not here to please you , dharr .

i know the rest of the world lives and breathes to please you but you wo n't get that from me , '' she said , her eyes turning angry at the idea .

`` ah , but victoria , you please me a great deal .

just your beauty alone is lovely to look upon , '' he replied .

her mouth dropped open and she had to look away from his sensuous expression .

his eyes were still hard , but they had a look that told her he was thinking about other ways she could please him .

his finger smoothed along his lower lip and victoria 's mind wondered what it would feel like to have that finger touching her lip , caressing her body .

stop it !

she told herself .

it was pointless to go down that path .

there was no way she was going back to him and besides , he had n't indicated that he was even interested in her in any way other than professionally .

`` as i said , flattery will get you no where , '' she said again and looked away .

her whole body was reacting to the thought of his touch , remembering the heat and the pleasure he could give her with only a simple touch .

`` anyway , if there is nothing else , i 'll get out of your way .

i 'm sure you have plenty of work to do . ''

she stood up and started to leave but his next words stopped her .

`` actually , there is one more thing , if you have a moment , '' he said , standing up with her .
