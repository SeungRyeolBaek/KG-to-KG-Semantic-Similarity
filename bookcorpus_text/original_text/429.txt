how do you think i started this business ? ''

rachel had no idea actually so he continued on .

`` i did all of my mother 's parties .

when her friends saw how nice everything looked , they asked me to do their parties .

so in effect , you 're doing almost exactly what i did .

go with it , flaunt it , honey ! ''

rachel still felt awkward .

`` i suppose , '' she said non-committally .

`` anyway , everything seems to be going well for friday 's party .

this one is bigger but everything seems to be in place . ''

`` and you 're using my caterer this time ? ''

he asked , his eyes admonishing her because he knew that she had n't used his personal preference for last week 's event .

she took a deep breath before replying , `` actually , i 'm going with the same caterer .

she 's a personal friend of mine from college and even rais complimented her on the food .

she has a very creative mind and you wo n't believe what she has planned for this weekend . ''

she handed him the menu and waited anxiously as he read through the details , her shoulders dropping with relief when his eyebrows shot up in surprise .

`` that sounds heavenly !

what 's her name ?

and can i use her for other parties ? ''

he asked .

rachel laughed with relief at his approval .

`` absolutely !

i 've already given her the dates for my current set of events so i have her booked , but i 'm sure she 'd love your business as well . ''

derrick smiled and nodded his head .

`` now ... .about these dresses that arrived today . ''

rachel 's shoulders went right back to tensing again , wary of where this conversation might go now .

`` yes ... .the dresses . ''

`` spill it , dear . ''

`` rais sent them , '' she admitted , relieved to have it out in the open , but still concerned about what the dresses might imply .

`` and why did he send dresses that cost so much ? ''

she bit her lip and looked across her desk warily .

`` because he thought i would look pretty in them and he did n't want me to be embarrassed by the others who would be attending . ''

derrick absorbed that explanation with narrowed eyes , nodding his head .

after several moments of silence he asked , `` is there anything i should be concerned about ? ''

he asked carefully .

rachel thought about how to answer that .

`` possibly , '' she admitted .

`` but i ca n't be sure . ''

in her mind , she knew she was treading on dangerous ground but she was n't sure how to explain to her boss that she was sleeping with a client .

it was n't against the rules , but in her mind , it did n't seem like it was a very ethical place to be either .

`` reading between the lines , i 'm guessing you mean that you 're in an intimate relationship with the man , correct ? ''

`` yes , '' she said honestly `` and you understand the tenuous position you 're in ? ''

`` more than you know . ''

he sighed and nodded his head several times , going over the issue in his mind .

finally , he looked up at her .

`` here 's how this will work .

if you continue this relationship and it does n't impact the business or your performance , then i know nothing about this issue . ''

rachel was astonished .

she was sure she 'd be fired about now .

`` why would you make an exception like this for me ? ''

she asked as he stood up and started to walk out of her office .

he turned around and looked down at her .

`` because you 're not like the others , dear .

if anyone else on my staff were sleeping with a client , it would most likely be because they were mercenary and trying to seal the deal on future business .

that 's just tacky , '' he explained with disdain .

`` it also means they are n't very good at their job because they needed to add incentives that are n't on our specialties list , shall we say ? ''

he took a moment to laugh at his own joke .

`` but in your case , if you 're sleeping with the guy , you 're in love with him so it 's not tacky , it 's very sweet and romantic .

and i sincerely hope that things go well for you . ''

he was almost out the door when he stopped and turned back to her .

`` just let me know as far in advance as possible if you 're going to leave the firm for any reason , okay ?

you 're a very good coordinator and it will be hard to replace you . ''

rachel stared at the door , completely dumbfounded by his words .

she had no idea how long she sat there staring at the empty doorway but her mind had a very hard time trying to wrap itself around the idea of being in love with rais .

was it possible ?

she dismissed it as ludicrous and turned to face her computer screen , but her eyes could n't focus on what was in front of her .

she was still mulling over the idea that she was in love with rais .

they 'd known each other for so long ... .but love ?
