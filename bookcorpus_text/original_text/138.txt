`` h-hi .

nate .

brynn .

i 'm brynn , '' i stammer as he glances over at me .

`` brynn , pleasure to meet you , '' he replies formally .

wait , does he not even remember meeting me last night ?

`` well , scooch over brynn , so nate can sit , '' mom says , waving me over with her hands .

`` right , sorry , '' i say , sliding over so that he can sit next to me .

i stare straight ahead as he sits .

i can feel my body betraying me already .

the heat from his leg under the table is giving me heart palpitations .

`` thought you were n't going to be able to make it , '' pierce says a little tensely to his son .

`` sorry , i was in the library studying .

i had my phone off . ''

`` well , you missed the big announcement .

we were just telling brynn that holly and i have gotten married . ''

i glance at nate out of the corner of my eye .

i see his eyes widen in surprise .

`` married ?

i thought you said you 'd never get married again . ''

`` well , things change .

when i met holly , i just knew .

you 'll see when you get to know her .

she 's a special woman . ''

i watch my mom glow like a 1000 watt bulb and ca n't help but smile .

it 's been a while since i 've seen her so happy .

`` yeah , i 'm ... i 'm just ... '' i watch him struggle for words just like i did .

`` surprised .

but happy .

i 'm looking forward to getting to know you better , holly . ''

wow , that was ... kind .

not what the guy i met last night would say .

`` oh , me too , nate , '' my mom replies , looking overjoyed .

`` and i 'm so excited for you and brynn to get to know each other ! ''

`` two only children ... '' pierce says meaningfully .

`` you 'll have to learn to share . ''

my mom laughs and i join in weakly .

`` you always wanted a sibling , brynn !

and now you have one !

well , a step-sibling , but still . ''

a step-sibling that i 've had literally dozens of dirty dreams about .

perfect .

`` so , you two have never met , then ? ''

my mom asks , glancing between us .

`` pierce and i were so excited when we realized both our kids were juniors here . ''

`` uva is my alma mater , '' pierce adds proudly .

`` no , we 've never met , '' i break in quickly .

i see nate eye me for a second before he nods .

`` nope , never met , unfortunately , '' he says .

`` we thought it best not to tell you guys about us until we knew it would really be forever .

i thought it would have just been so awkward for you two if we 'd broken up and then you have to keep seeing each other around campus , '' my mom explains .

`` yes , that would have been awkward , '' nate says drily , and i know he 's thinking that nothing could compare to my own awkwardness last night .

the waitress comes over with the bottle of champagne that pierce ordered .

dom perignon , i see as i look at the label .

whoa , he must be loaded .

my new stepdad must be loaded .

she expertly pops the cork and pours us each an elegant flute , placing the bottle into a wine cooler next to the table .

pierce takes his glass and raises it .

`` to a new family , '' he says , looking around the table .

we all raise our glasses and clink them together .

i manage to do so without making eye contact with nate .

the champagne tickles my throat on the way down .

i 've never wanted to drink a bottle of alcohol more in my entire life than at this moment , but i keep myself to a modest sip .

`` so , honey , you told me you had some news , too ? ''

my mom asks , as she puts down her glass .

`` oh , yes , though i do n't think i can follow that announcement , '' i hedge with a smile .

`` please !

you sounded excited on the phone , '' she encourages me .

`` well , i got a lawn room , '' i reveal .

my mom gasps in excitement , but i see pierce glance quickly at his son .

`` i thought you said that they had n't announced it yet , '' he says quietly .

`` i ... i knew you 'd be disappointed .

i was waitlisted .

it was difficult , juggling two varsity sports , a double major- '' nate replies .

i glance at my mom and then between the two men .

nate is looking down at the tablecloth .

`` i was selected for a lawn room , too , '' pierce says , interrupting him and turning to me .

`` it 's an important accomplishment . ''

`` thank you ... '' i say hesitantly .

nate looks so miserable .

`` being waitlisted is impressive , too . ''

he glances up at me sharply , his eyes flashing .

shit .

i heard it , too : pity .
