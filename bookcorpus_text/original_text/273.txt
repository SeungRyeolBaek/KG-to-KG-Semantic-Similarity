the bastian offices seem to have called my phone , more than a few times .

at first , i ca n't imagine why .

that is , until i see what time it is .

`` fuck ! ''

i cry out , tumbling off the couch .

`` huh ?

what ? ''

emerson mumbles , snapping out of his slumber and looking wildly around .

`` what 's the matter ? ''

`` it 's twelve thirty already ! ''

i tell him , scrambling to my feet in a panic .

`` we 're supposed to be at work !

how the hell did we oversleep ? ''

`` guess we wore each other out last night , huh ? ''

emerson smiles , reaching for me .

`` do n't , '' i snap , tearing off in search of my clothes .

`` we 're going to be an hour late to work , emerson .

and it 's only my second day . ''

`` relax , '' he says , following me into the bedroom , `` i 'll vouch for you . ''

`` oh , yeah .

that 'll look awesome , '' i shoot back .

`` me strolling in on my superior 's arm , getting special treatment because i happen to be fucking the right person . ''

`` whoa , slow down , '' he says , `` first of all , i did n't mean to offend you , i just do n't think this is as big a deal as you 're making it out to be .

cooper does n't even show up until noon , remember ?

and secondly , i did n't realize we were just 'fucking ' , here . ''

`` we 're not-i 'm just- '' i stammer , shoving my hands through my hair .

`` i 've been dreaming about a job like this for months .

years .

and now , when i finally get my foot in the door , i fuck it up immediately .

god , i do n't even have any fresh clothes to wear !

i 'm going to have to show up in the same thing i wore yesterday , and everyone 's going to know that we- '' `` here , '' emerson says , reaching into his wallet and withdrawing a credit card .

`` take this .

go to the shop downstairs and buy something new .

we 'll head right over to the office . ''

`` i ca n't take your card , '' i say , gaping at him .

`` it 's ... it 's yours . ''

`` why not ? ''

he shrugs , `` it 's partially my fault we overslept .

let me help fix it . ''

`` but- '' `` go , '' he insists , pressing the card into my palm , `` i 'll get dressed and meet you . ''

reeling , i gather my things and trundle out of emerson 's loft onto the soho street .

there 's a tiny boutique downstairs , chock full of incredible items .

the shop girl raises an eyebrow as i barrel in , but forgets her troubles when i hand her the surprisingly heavy credit card .

in no time flat , she has me styled in a combination of new and vintage pieces .

emerson appears as i 'm being rung up , impressed by my sleek black jeans , silky yellow blouse , and grungy studded jacket .

i nearly faint as i see what this outfit is going to cost , but emerson does n't even bat an eye as his card is charged .

i still ca n't get used to the idea that money is no issue for him .

and i definitely do n't know how to feel about using his money for myself .

but no time to debate the issue now , we 've got to book it .

we set off for our office , which is thankfully located in the same neighborhood as emerson 's apartment .

but still , by the time we step into the elevators , it 's one in the afternoon .

i bounce on the balls of my feet as the elevator lifts us up to the offices , feeling anxious and guilty .

`` take a breath , abby , '' emerson tells me , as we draw level with our floor .

`` i 'm sure no one 's even going to notice that we're- '' as the doors slide open , i feel the breath catch in my throat .

a dozen faces whip around in unison as the entire office turns to stare at us .

every face at the communal desk stares at me and emerson unabashedly as we step onto the floor side-by-side .

i can feel my cheeks burning as my co-workers ' gazes go from curious to smug .

i 'm sure they all spent the entire morning wondering if emerson and i were together , and now their suspicions have been confirmed .

`` cooper asked to see you both as soon as you got in today , '' says emily , one of the people who saw me and emerson at that bar together .

the corners of her mouth are turned up in a grin that 's starving for scandal .

`` thanks , '' emerson says curtly , drawing himself up to his full height .

he has no reason to be cowed by our co-workers ' scrutiny .

he has seniority .

and a billion-dollar bank account .

i , on the other hand , am absolutely leveled .

i ca n't believe i 've let myself become a joke within my first forty-eight hours here .

`` nice duds , '' mutters tyler , scoping out my outfit as emerson and i hurry past the desk toward cooper 's office .
