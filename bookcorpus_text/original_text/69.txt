raking her fingers through his dark hair , she shook her head .

`` i think we need to talk about our boundaries . ''

`` oh ? ''

she nodded .

`` you coming over here tonight made me realize something very important .

what we 've been doing has been fun , and i 've enjoyed every minute of it .

but now- '' pesh 's dark eyes snapped shut , and the expression on his face shifted as if he were in pain .

`` please .

you do n't have to say this .

i 'll just go . ''

`` but i do n't want you to go , '' she argued .

`` then what are you trying to say ? ''

`` that i need you in my life , and i want more . ''

his brows shot up .

`` more ?

as in more of us together ? ''

`` yes . ''

he sucked in a breath .

`` you want us to be an official couple ? ''

she smiled .

`` yes , i do .

well , everywhere except work . ''

`` i ca n't believe it , '' he murmured .

`` this is n't exactly the reaction i thought you would have , '' she teased .

`` oh , i 'm happy .

trust me .

i 'm just shocked , that 's all . ''

she brought her lips to his and gave him a tender kiss .

against his lips , she murmured , `` can you ever forgive me for being so stubborn and so stupid ? ''

`` i can try .

but i suppose you 're going to have to work very hard to make it up to me . ''

`` am i ? ''

he nodded .

`` yes , very hard . ''

`` why do i have the funny feeling that your idea of me making it up to you is entirely different than mine ? ''

`` no more orgasms for dates .

just dates . ''

`` i can handle that . ''

a wicked gleam flashed in pesh 's eyes .

`` the first date will be to the fox to see an opera . ''

she groaned .

`` you do n't play fair . ''

he ran his hands up her sides , causing her to shiver .

`` i would have to argue that you have n't been playing fair all along .

now it 's my turn . ''

`` are you going to punish me ? ''

she questioned in a whisper .

`` mmm , hmm , there will lots of dates and lots of time spent together . ''

he quirked a brow at her .

`` a true hell on earth . ''

she could n't help giggling .

`` i 'll be a good girl and take it . ''

`` i 'm glad to hear it . ''

as they lapsed into silence , megan 's fingers wound through the hair at the base of his neck .

`` do you want to stay the night with me ? ''

pesh 's brows furrowed as if silently questioning her proposal .

`` but you- '' `` no sex .

just sleeping . ''

`` you think that 's a good idea with mason ? ''

`` we 're a couple now .

he 's going to be seeing a lot of you . ''

pesh smiled .

`` yes , he is . ''

staring into his eyes , she asked , `` so you 'll stay ? ''

`` it would be a pleasure . ''

without another word , she rose off his lap .

after he got up off the sofa , she took him by the hand and led him to her bedroom .

as she sat on the edge of the mattress , she watched as pesh stripped down to his boxer shorts .

when he was finished , he walked slowly over to her .

`` i 'm sorry we ca n't do anything else . ''

he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheeks .

`` i do n't mind .

i 'm happy just to be with you . ''

in her heart , she was happy as well and not just about him staying the night .

but for how everything between them had worked out .

`` so am i , '' she murmured before lying back on the bed .

`` so am i . ''

chapter eighteen for megan , the next few weeks flew by .

she did n't know if it was because she was so busy at work , or it was because she was so happy being with pesh .

she liked to think it was the latter .

or maybe it was that she was busy being with pesh .

on her off days and his , they spent every second together .

most often , he came to her house .

they made dinner together or they went out .

although her parents did n't entirely approve , he slept over as well .

what they did n't know is that some nights nothing illicit even happened between them .

exhausted from the day 's events , they merely enjoyed lying in each other 's arms .

as she came out of a patient 's room , she glanced up to see pesh standing across the hall talking to another doctor .

for just a moment , his gaze met hers , and although no one else could have possibly noticed it , she saw the longing and the affection .

she gave him a brief nod before walking on to the nurses ' station .

since they had become a couple , their time at work had become almost a game of wills to pretend there was nothing going on between them .
