glancing down , she saw georgie peering up at her .

`` what are you doing , sweetie ? ''

she asked .

he glanced left and right before he spoke .

`` mommy told me not to tell anybody , but she needs you to come up to her hotel room . ''

`` okay .

what for ? ''

`` noah 's going crazy wanting aunt emma , and she thinks you 're the only one that might be able to get him to calm down . ''

`` ah , i see . ''

when she turned back to pesh , he smiled .

`` you do n't even need to apologize .

go see if you can help . ''

she leaned up and gave him a smacking kiss on the lips .

`` thank you for being so amazing each and every moment of the day . ''

his thumb brushed against her cheek .

`` you 're welcome , my love . ''

`` be back as soon as i can . ''

`` i 'm going to hold you to that . ''

taking georgie 's hand , she made her way off the dance floor and out of the ballroom .

after getting on one of the elevators , they rode to the sixth floor .

she let georgie lead the way .

he stopped halfway down the hall and knocked on the door .

by then , she did n't have to guess which room noah was in .

she could hear his screams all the way outside .

when becky flung open the door , she waved megan through with her hand .

`` the others did n't want me to interrupt you , but we 've been trying the last hour to get him to calm down , and he 's just not having it . ''

megan found the scene in hotel room somewhat comical .

her mother , along with her aunts julia and liz , stood in a circle around one of the beds .

outfitted in a fuzzy , blue footed sleeper , noah sat in the middle of the mattress , his cheeks streaked and soaked with tears and his face red from crying .

`` what is the matter ? ''

megan asked .

everyone whirled around to look at her .

`` nothing .

everything 's fine .

go back to your party , '' angie said , over noah 's wails .

`` um , i think it 's safe to say that it is n't fine .

or at least , he 's not fine . ''

liz fanned her face with her hand .

`` it 's like the moment emma left the hotel , he freaked out .

he woke up out of a dead sleep screaming for his mama .

the poor baby-sitter hung in as long as she could before she finally called us . ''

megan cocked her head at noah .

`` poor thing . ''

she bypassed her aunts to hold out her arms .

considering he 'd spent so much time with her , noah happily reached for her , and megan pulled him into her embrace .

`` hey buddy , you 've got to stop crying . ''

he was snubbing so hard his breath came in big hiccups as his chest heaved .

`` mama .

want mama , '' he pleaded pitifully .

megan hugged him tight to her chest .

`` i know , sweetie .

but she 's at the hospital having your baby sister . ''

her answer did n't satisfy him since he drew in a deep breath to start screaming again .

she smiled at him .

`` you wan na go downstairs to the party ? ''

he appeared thoughtful .

`` pesh is downstairs .

you wan na see him ? ''

`` esh ? ''

megan laughed .

`` yes , he 's down there . ''

`` see esh , '' he said , kicking his feet as if to tell her to start walking .

`` here .

i 'll take him , '' her mother suggested , reaching for noah .

he shrieked before wrapping his arms tighter around megan 's neck .

`` i think it 's safe to say he 's staying with me . ''

`` but it 's your engagement party , '' julia protested .

`` yes , and i 've been enjoying it the last four hours .

i do n't think watching him is going to take away anything for me . ''

as she started out the doorway , she asked , `` is mason okay ? ''

her mother nodded .

`` thank goodness he 's down the hall , or we 'd have two toddlers running around at eleven o'clock . ''

megan giggled as she walked down the hall .

her necklace and the beaded sari seemed to be holding noah 's interest .

`` pretty , huh ? ''

she asked , as they got on the elevator .

`` ooh , pwetty , '' he mimicked .

when she got back downstairs , pesh was seated at their table , talking to some of their colleagues .

the moment noah saw him , he reached out for pesh .

`` well hello , little one .

were you really crying because you wanted to come to our party ? ''

noah grinned at pesh behind his pacifier , which caused pesh to smile .

`` he looks so much like aidan when he does that , does n't he ? ''

`` yes , he does .

i 'm sure he 's going to use that cute little grin to his advantage when he gets older , just like his daddy did . ''

she eased into the chair beside them .

after spitting out his pacifier , noah asked , `` daddy ? ''
