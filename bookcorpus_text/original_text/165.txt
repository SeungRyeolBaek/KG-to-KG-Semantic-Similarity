`` speaking of being at the bottom , roderick called me steven yesterday , '' greg says , referencing pierce 's business partner .

i laugh .

`` no !

is there even a steven working there ? ''

`` nope !

that 's the worst part .

who knows who he was thinking of ... '' he shakes his head remorsefully .

`` how come pierce 's son is n't working at thornhill and co. ?

did n't want to work with his dad ? ''

`` um , the opposite , actually .

pierce is pretty hard on nate ... i feel kind of guilty about the whole thing because i think nate wanted the internship , and then pierce offered it to me to punish him .

i tried not to accept , but pierce insisted , and we 'd just met , you know ?

i did n't want to be rude .

not to mention , my mom and pierce have n't known each other for very long , so i was a little taken aback by how quickly they 'd gotten married ... '' i bite my lip .

`` sorry , wow .

i 'm rambling . ''

`` it 's ok , i get it .

my parents are divorced , too . ''

`` well , mine are n't actually divorced .

they were n't married in the first place , '' i clarify .

but greg is n't listening-he 's squinting at the entrance to the restaurant .

`` speaking of ... is n't that nate now ?

did you tell him we were coming here ? ''

`` no , what ?

it ca n't be him , '' i reply , turning around to look .

but sure enough , there he is , with a brunette stunner on his arm .

that asshole !

there 's no way this is a coincidence-he must have overheard me telling my mom that greg was taking me here .

`` brynn ! ''

nate says with a smile , leading his date over as the hostess trails them .

`` i did n't know you guys were coming here too !

greg , right ?

i 'm nate . ''

`` good to meet you , '' greg says , shaking his outstretched hand .

`` and this is sophie , '' nate adds , indicating his date .

`` hey , '' she says , glancing up for a moment from the cellphone in her hands .

`` did you all want to sit together ? ''

the hostess asks .

`` we could pull another table over . ''

i could kill her .

`` what do you think ? ''

nate asks greg , his grin at full-wattage .

`` um , yeah , sure , why not ? ''

greg complies .

i quickly stand and make my way over to greg as a waiter helps the hostess pull another small table over .

i 'm not going to sit next to nate and risk a repeat of that thigh-touching incident .

`` i 'll let you two sit next to each other , '' i explain with a saccharine smile as i take a seat next to greg .

`` we just ordered so you 're not too far behind , '' greg says as the hostess hands nate and sophie menus .

`` could we get a bottle of dom for the table ? ''

nate asks the waiter , who nods happily and scurries off .

`` oh , you do n't have to- '' greg begins .

`` no , i insist .

we 're interrupting your date here , '' nate replies magnanimously .

`` i love champagne , '' sophie pipes up , finally putting her phone away .

i narrow my eyes at nate and he studiously avoids my gaze .

`` so , what were you two lovebirds talking about before we got here ? ''

nate asks greg .

`` nothing , really , '' greg replies glancing at me .

`` you know , with your light hair , you two could almost be related .

cousins , maybe , '' nate observes , leaning back in his chair .

i swiftly kick his shin under the table .

i see his jaw tighten but he does n't even make a sound .

`` oh my god , totally ! ''

sophie agrees .

`` i made out with my cousin once , but i did n't know he was my cousin at the time .

but then it happened again ... '' i glare at nate as sophie launches into her story , and he smiles back at me .

it 's going to be a long night .

chapter sixteen i spin around in nate 's desk chair as he shuts his bedroom door behind him .

i 've been waiting here , fuming , ever since greg dropped me off twenty minutes ago .

`` jesus !

what are you , a bond villain ? ''

he asks , genuinely startled .

`` what were you thinking ? !

i know you did that on purpose to ruin my date , you fucker ! ''

nate shrugs .

`` come on , you really going to tell me you were having a great time before i got there ? ''

`` oh , so you were just helping me out , is that it ?

greg was completely weirded out by the whole thing . ''

`` sophie had a nice time . ''

`` sophie , please !

where 'd you find her ?

a high school dance ? ''

`` i like her , '' he says with a smug grin as he sits on his bed .

`` oh , really ?

so why are n't you with her right now ?
