`` i 'm lavani .

it 's nice to meet you . ''

`` nice meeting you , too , '' megan replied .

the room then fell into an awkward silence .

pesh glanced around , willing someone to say something .

his mother cleared her throat .

`` i 'll go and finish up dinner . ''

as she started into the kitchen , shveta followed her , along with arjan 's wife .

since it was customary for women to be in the kitchen , pesh found it to be only megan left with the men .

it did n't go without her notice either .

`` should i go and offer to help ? ''

she questioned , in a whisper .

`` sure .

that would be nice . ''

her expression told him that she really did n't want to leave his side , but she did anyway .

once she was out of earshot , pesh found everyone 's eyes on him .

`` what ? ''

charlie chuckled .

`` you even have to ask , my son ? ''

`` so ask your questions and get it over with before megan comes back in here , '' he replied , as he collapsed onto the couch .

he faced a barrage of questions about where they met , how long they had been seeing each other , and how serious was it .

he mustered as much patience as he could to answer them all .

when he was finished , the men sat back in surprised silence .

`` i never thought i would see the day , '' his father mused .

sanjay shook his head .

`` oh , i knew the day would come .

i saw that when he was out with emma . ''

charlie 's brows furrowed .

`` emma ? ''

pesh pinched his eyes shut and wished his brother-in-law did n't have such a good memory .

`` just a friend . ''

with a snort , sanjay replied , `` you certainly did n't look at her like she was a friend , even if she was pregnant . ''

`` you were with a pregnant woman ? ''

charlie asked .

`` alpesh how could you ? ''

his mother demanded from the doorway .

`` how could i what ? ''

pesh asked .

lavani 's expression was horror stricken .

`` get a woman ... in the family way . ''

pesh rocketed off the couch .

he glanced past his mother to where megan stood .

`` you 're ... ? ''

he could n't even form the words .

megan 's face flushed blood red .

`` no !

of course , i 'm not ! ''

lavani gave him a confused look .

`` not her , '' she replied , pointing at megan .

`` this emma that sanjay speaks of . ''

bringing his hand to his forehead , he rubbed furiously to try to ward off the ache that was starting to pound in his head .

everything was getting shot to hell so fast .

`` first of all , emma and i were never intimate .

she was pregnant by the man she is now married to .

yes , i took her to the opera with sanjay and shveta , but there was nothing really between us . ''

he shook his head and could n't help wondering if he would ever have to stop explaining what had happened between him and emma .

`` second of all , could everyone just back off for a second ?

i mean , you 're not exactly giving megan a very good impression of our family . ''

a nervous laugh erupted from megan 's lips .

she covered her mouth with her hand , trying to hide her giggling .

he winked at her , and she lowered her hand to smile at him .

`` fine , fine .

now that we 've cleared all that up , why do n't we eat ? ''

lavani suggested .

`` that sounds wonderful , '' charlie replied .

as they made their way into the dining room , pesh went to megan 's side .

`` you surviving okay ? ''

he whispered .

`` i 'm hanging in there .

i may need a drink when we leave . ''

`` just no silver tequila for you , '' he mused .

without the others catching her , megan smacked his arm .

`` ass , '' she hissed under her breath .

he chuckled as he held out the chair for megan .

`` thank you , '' she said before sitting down .

he then eased in beside her .

as the dishes began making their way around the table , he felt megan kick him .

when he glanced at her in surprise , she whispered , `` where is the silverware ? ''

`` we eat with our hands . ''

`` seriously ? ''

`` yes . ''

he leaned over to whisper in her ear .

`` but do n't use your left hand because it 's considered rude . ''

she jerked back to stare wide-eyed at him .

`` i 'm left handed , '' she protested .

he fought the urge to smile at her horror .

he could tell that she would rather die than do something to embarrass him in front of his family .

`` you 'll be fine .

they wo n't expect as much out of you since you 're american . ''

`` alpesh , whatever is it that you 're whispering about ? ''

lavani asked , narrowing her eyes at him .

`` i was just telling megan what a wonderful cook you are .

she loves indian food , so i 'm sure she 's in for a treat . ''
