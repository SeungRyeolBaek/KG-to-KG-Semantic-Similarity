for the last month , i 've just been sitting around our old house , doing my best to help my mom with getting her old job back and hiring a lawyer , but there really was n't much for me to do .

i felt both relief and fear when it was finally time to drive back down to charlottesville .

relief because i 'll have schoolwork to occupy my mind , and fear because i might run into nate on campus .

foolishly , i had hoped that he would try to get in touch with me after my mom and i moved out , but he did n't .

it really was stupid of me .

i told him that i loved him , and he did n't say it back .

simple as that .

even though he was angry , there must have been some truth to his words when he told me i was n't special to him .

i glance at the clock .

just after four-almost time for my dinner shift in the cafeteria to be starting .

i change into my work clothes and head over .

at least i know i wo n't run into nate there-the athletes all have a separate dining hall serving far tastier and more nutritious food .

i open my door to the lawn , smiling halfheartedly at another female student a few doors down as she exits her room at the same time .

i walk quickly , keeping my head down , not really wanting to interact with anyone i know .

i enter the dining hall and cross around to the side door , back into the kitchen .

`` oh , brynn ! ''

roberta , my manager , waves to me from a table by the front , where she 's doing some paperwork .

i wave back and head over .

`` there 's been some issue with your work-study , '' she tells me quietly as i reach her .

`` an issue ? ''

i ask frowning .

`` do you know what it is ? ''

`` something related to your scholarship-that 's all the dean 's office told me when they called . ''

i rub my forehead in frustration .

this is the last thing i need .

`` if you head over to monroe hall now , you might be able to talk to someone who knows more than i do . ''

i nod .

`` sorry , '' she adds , before continuing with her work .

i hurry out of the dining hall and follow roberta 's advice to see if i can get some more answers , though i fear i already know what happened .

my mom has been so frazzled lately , i bet she forgot to make a payment on the portion of the tuition that we still owe .

i explain the situation to a secretary at monroe , who points me toward the office in charge of the work-study program .

a man in his early thirties stands to greet me as i walk through the open door of his office .

`` francis delton , '' he introduces himself , shaking my hand .

`` how can i help you ? ''

`` well , i was told there 's some issue with my work-study program , or with my scholarship , or something , '' i reply , reaching to tug at my hair before realizing it 's pulled up in a ponytail .

`` ok , your name ? ''

he asks , sitting down and motioning me into the chair across from him .

`` brynn atwell , '' i respond , spelling it out for him .

he types my name into his computer and then clicks around for a moment .

`` ah , this is quite unusual , '' he says , raising his eyebrows at his screen .

`` ok ... '' i reply nervously .

`` you can no longer participate in the work-study program , because your tuition has been paid in full . ''

i stare at him .

`` you mean , for this semester ? ''

`` no , i mean all of your tuition . ''

i shake my head , unable to believe him .

`` for this year ?

or ... i mean , not all all ? ''

he smiles .

`` all all . ''

`` but that 's ... that 's impossible .

how ?

who ? ''

i stammer .

`` i have no idea .

i can only see that you 're ineligible for the program . ''

`` ok , ok , '' i reply , trying to gather my thoughts .

`` thank you .

thank you so much . ''

i wander out of his office and out onto the quad .

with pierce and my mom getting divorced , i knew i 'd have college tuition loans to deal with again , and i took it in stride .

i was used to the idea , anyway .

what the hell 's going on ?

i reach into my back pocket and dial my mom .

i have no idea if she 'll know either , but i can at least tell her the good news .

`` oh , brynn !

brynn , i was just going to call you ! ''

she says as she picks up .

`` let me guess , is it about my tuition ? ''

i ask , hearing excitement in her voice .

`` yes !

how did you know ? ''

`` well , i showed up for my shift at the dining hall , and was told that my tuition 's been taken care of .

what 's going on ? ''

`` i was literally just picking up the phone to tell you ... it all happened so quickly this afternoon .
