the mere thought of his broad , capable hands is enough to get me off almost at once .

swallowing a low moan , i come into that black lace g-string , with emerson 's face suspended in my mind 's eye all the while .

`` hopefully that wo n't make breakfast too awkward , '' i whisper to myself , savoring the relaxing wave that washes over me as i drift into a deep , satisfied sleep .

the silence that first fell between emerson and i after he saved me from breaking my neck persists for the better part of the next two weeks .

my handsome housemate may as well be a ghost , for all i see of him .

he leaves for school early in the morning , stays out late at night , and generally avoids me like the plague .

did i totally wig him out that night at the party ?

i could have sworn that he was sending me some flirtatious signals , but maybe i totally misread him .

maybe he just thinks i 'm an incest-loving freak show now .

i 've never been the best flirt , i guess .

riley almost dies when i give her all the juicy details a few days after the party .

turns out she let us get separated when the cops showed up , so that emerson and i could have an `` adventure '' all on our own .

`` so , he basically took off your panties and finger-banged you , '' she sums it up as we head off on a coffee run during our school lunch hour .

`` that is a very liberal translation , '' i say , blushing like crazy as i stare out the passenger side window .

`` he is so into you , '' riley grins .

`` i ca n't believe it , after all this time . ''

she catches my frown and backtracks .

`` i mean , i can totally believe why he 'd be into you , it 's just- '' `` i know that 's he a bit above my pay grade , ri , '' i tell her , leaning back against my seat .

`` i 'm not exactly up to par with the girls he usually hangs out with . ''

without preamble , riley swerves violently onto the shoulder of the main road , causing me to yelp in abject terror .

`` listen to me , '' she says firmly , taking my face in her hands .

`` you are every bit as sexy and bitchin ' as emerson sawyer .

he 'd be lucky to have you , abby . ''

`` you do n't have to do that , '' i insist .

`` he 's the badass , gorgeous lacrosse star , i 'm the weird , short , artsy girl .

if this were a teen movie , maybe we 'd stand a chance .

but i know my place on the food chain .

guys like emerson do n't go for girls like me . ''

`` oh please , '' riley moans , rolling her eyes , `` in a few months ' time , we 're all gon na be out in the real world .

you could take your high-waisted shorts and dark lipstick-wearing self to any major city and be an 'it girl ' in three second flat .

the rest of these assholes will have already peaked in high school , so count your blessings that you 're a weirdo now . ''

`` thanks ?

i think ? ''

i laugh , `` really , ri .

you always know how to cheer me up . ''

`` damn straight i do , '' she says , tossing her black curls over her shoulder .

`` that 's what best friends are for-assuring you that boning your maybe-someday-stepbrother is totally chill as long as your dad does n't put a ring on it first . ''

i shake my head as riley laughs , pulling back onto the road with the radio blasting .

i try my best to keep riley 's words of encouragement close to my heart as the silence between me and emerson continues on .

you 'd think we were locked in a nuclear arms race , for how cold things have become between us .

i catch glimpses of him at school , and have the unfortunate experience of watching courtney try to stick her tongue down his throat on more than one occasion .

but as the days until my eighteenth birthday tick away , the silent treatment goes on .

a few days before my grand entrance into adulthood , i arrive home from school irritated and disgruntled .

the stress of college applications and ap course work coupled with the ongoing radio silence between me and emerson has me way on edge .

so the very last thing i want to see when i walk in front door of my home is dad and deborah , making out like a couple of teenagers against the kitchen island .

`` jesus , '' i mutter , starting for my room , `` is everybody getting some action around here besides me ? ''

`` oh !

abby ! ''

deborah giggles from the kitchen , `` good .

you 're home . ''

`` hi dad .

hi deb , '' i mutter gloomily , standing at the foot of the stairs .

`` i 'm just gon na head up to my room and get some studying in- '' `` nooo , come on .

come chat with us first ! ''

deb insists , bustling out into the foyer to apprehend me .

though emerson and i are the same age , deborah is about ten years my dad 's junior .
