`` your mom looks really happy , '' allison observes as we sit .

i watch her for a moment , flitting between conversations , so beautiful and animated .

`` i think she is .

and she 's just really good at cocktail-type conversation , too .

like nate , though he says it does n't come to him naturally . ''

`` brynn ... '' allison says , raising an eyebrow at me .

`` no , i mean , i 'm just , you know ... '' i reply , trailing off .

definitely not the time to tell allison that nate and i kissed , though i do n't know if that time will ever come .

i love allison , but thinking in shades of grey is not her strong suit .

`` thought you two could use some drinks . ''

i look up to see greg , the cute intern with the strawberry-blonde hair , standing next to us , three martini glasses carefully balanced between his long fingers .

`` greg , hi !

i 'm so glad you could make it . ''

i indicate the chair next to us and help him place down the glasses so that they do n't spill their contents .

`` greg , this is my friend allison .

we go to college together . ''

`` nice to meet you , '' allison says .

`` you too .

hope these drinks are ok with you .

i forget what the bartender called them ... '' `` freedom martinis , '' i answer , rolling my eyes .

`` the name sucks , but they 're really good . ''

`` so where are you from originally , greg ? ''

allison asks .

`` raleigh , though i hope to move to dc after i graduate . ''

i tune out slightly as allison and greg talk across me .

i 've just seen nate cross between groups of people , seeming to make conversation effortlessly .

i look around to see if there 's a girl trailing him , but i do n't see one .

this might be the first time i 've seen him without a date at any kind of gathering .

the idea that it could be because of me comes to my mind , but i quickly quash it .

i ca n't let myself think like that .

nate does n't want that kind of relationship with me , probably even if i were n't his stepsister .

i bet his date just got a cold last-minute or something .

`` be right back , '' allison says .

`` i have to get a second helping ! ''

my attention snaps back to greg as she stands and leaves .

he scratches his cheek and clears his throat .

i smile as a blush sneaks onto his freckle-dotted skin .

`` you look ... um , that 's a nice dress , '' he finally says .

`` thanks . ''

i smile , careful not to linger on the subject , `` so , you think you 'll want to work in politics after school ends ? ''

`` well , in government , '' he says with a smile .

`` though i 'm learning that one does n't seem to exist without the other .

i guess i need to work on the whole ... you know ... '' he waves his hand vaguely .

`` kissing babies thing ? ''

`` exactly , '' he smiles .

`` so , ah , i was wondering ... '' my attention drifts from him again as i see my mom and pierce talking urgently by the house .

my mom covers her face with her hands and pierce turns back to the party , his frown turning into a smile as if by magic .

`` i 'm so sorry , greg , could you excuse me ?

i think my mom might need me . ''

`` oh , sure , '' he replies kindly as i rush toward the door into the study .

my mind runs through the possible scenarios as i hurry through the study and up the stairs .

as i climb the second set of stairs up to the master suite on the third floor , i decide it must be my father .

the last time i saw my mom look that upset , it was because my dad was back in town and pressuring her for money .

i knock softly on the closed double door of their bedroom .

`` mom ? ''

i whisper quietly as i let myself in .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

i gasp as i hurry in .

she 's curled up on top of the bedspread , like a broken doll .

`` it 's pierce , '' she murmurs without moving .

`` his lawyer just called him .

a woman has come forward accusing him of sexual harassment .

it 'll be on the news tomorrow . ''

chapter thirteen `` oh no , '' i whisper , sitting next to her on the bed .

`` i 'm so sorry , mom . ''

`` is it ... is it me ? ''

she asks , turning her head as a tear drops down her cheek .

`` what ?

what do you mean ? ''

`` maybe it 's me ... maybe it 's my fault .

it 's like i 'm a curse . ''

`` no , mom , no , '' i whisper , leaning down and pulling her hair out of her eyes .

`` this is n't happening because of you .

i mean , when did this even go on ?

the , you know , the ... '' i reply , unable to repeat those two ugly words : sexual harassment .
