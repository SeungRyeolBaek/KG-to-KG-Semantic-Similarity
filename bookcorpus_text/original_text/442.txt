she stopped trying to hurt him , mainly because her heart was n't really into it and besides , it was n't doing any good .

the man was just too big , too strong and she could n't break through that blasted confidence he carried around with him at all times .

`` why ? ''

she whispered , out of energy and anger .

all that was left was the pain of his betrayal .

`` you just said that you only wanted me . ''

she blinked and looked to the side , her whole body stiffening with the fear of what that accidental admission might mean to him .

`` so what ? ''

`` you 're the only woman i 've wanted , for years . ''

she snorted and rolled her eyes .

`` that does n't really hold up under the light of scrutiny , rais . ''

he laughed and pulled her even closer , ignoring the stiffness that told him that she wanted him to leave her alone .

he 'd done that enough over the years .

from now on , he was going to go with his feelings .

`` i love you . ''

those simple words stilled her movements and she held her breath .

`` do n't say things like that , '' she finally gasped out .

`` why not ?

it 's true .

i 've loved you for so long it 's been almost painful at times .

i 've wanted you as my wife since you were sixteen years old .

but you were too young and you needed to get out and enjoy your life , experience the world a bit . ''

she pulled back and looked up at him , startled by that admission .

`` you 've loved me for eight years ? ''

he shrugged .

`` probably longer than that .

when you turned sixteen is when i understood what i was feeling for you was too strong for just a friendship . ''

`` why did n't you say something ? ''

she demanded , her hands un-fisting and flattening against his chest .

`` why did you wait so long ? ''

she was crying again , but this was different .

it was n't necessarily happiness , but there was that , somewhere deep down underneath all the other emotions that were spiking through her mind at the moment .

`` because you were too young .

what i was feeling was n't appropriate . ''

`` that summer ... . '' she started to say , her mind focusing on her sixteenth birthday party with all of her friends around ... .he 'd let her use the ballroom in his house for the event and they 'd all been awestruck by the party .

he 'd been there , standing next to her dad ... . `` you were looking at me strangely that night , '' she said with a whisper .

he grimaced .

`` you were hanging onto that boy and it irritated the hell out of me . ''

she laughed and a tear slipped down again .

`` i saw you and thought you were the saddest man around .

i was also angry with you for showing up at my party . ''

one eyebrow went up with that comment .

`` angry ?

why ? ''

she looked down , her fingers playing with the buttons on the front of his shirt .

`` because you did n't ask me to dance . ''

his fingers clenched on her waist as he shook his head .

`` i could n't rachel .

it was n't right .

you were too young . ''

he sighed heavily as he continued , `` and then you disappeared .

going off to college was okay .

i wanted that for you and i was proud of all that you accomplished .

but you did n't come back during the summers .

why did you work on those other farms ? ''

she bit her lower lip , wishing she could avoid telling him this but he was admitting so much , it was now her turn .

`` because every time i saw you , you had another brunette on your arm and it hurt too much .

i hated you those summers because there were so many women .

it was horrible . ''

`` by the time you turned eighteen , i 'd had enough but you were gone .

i could n't get in touch with you and you apparently did n't want to have anything to do with me . ''

he groaned .

`` damn you were so beautiful whenever i caught a glimpse of you .

i imagined you in the arms of so many men and it drove me crazy . ''

`` there were n't any other men . ''

`` i know that now , '' he said with a half smile .

`` but the past six years have been pretty horrible . ''

`` i know how you feel , '' she said softly .

`` i hated you every time you brought another woman back to your house . ''

`` i never brought them back , rachel .

they followed me and it was my only defense against telling your father that i wanted to marry you and drag you away so you could be my wife . ''

`` why did n't you ? ''

she asked , her eyes showing him how much she would have wanted that .

`` because you were too young , '' he said , shaking her slightly .

`` you needed to experience life and find out what you wanted . ''

she was shaking her head .

`` i 've always wanted you .

that 's why i had to leave , because i loved you so much and you just kept bringing those other women around .
