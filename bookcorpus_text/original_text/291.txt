the happiness she encouraged and the sadness , she was able tease them out of .

she was the most beautiful woman inside he 'd ever had the pleasure of knowing .

and outside , she was an absolute knockout whose figure he used to display his designs to perfection .

`` do n't you worry about what to wear when i 'm around , '' he admonished .

`` and as for the other , you just be yourself and he 'll fall in love with you harder than you could ever imagine . ''

victoria smiled .

`` really ? ''

she asked , remembering saying that to dharr only a few minutes ago .

`` really .

now if that bulging book bag is any indication , then you probably have midterms tomorrow , eh ? ''

after she nodded , scott suggested , `` then come along darling and while you 're studying , i 'll dream up other lovely creations to cover those magnificent breasts with , '' he said , laughing when he received the expected blush .

`` you 're bad , scott , '' she admonished .

`` but i 'll take you up on your offer as long as rudy is n't here .

is he still visiting his parents in ireland ? ''

she asked , referring to scott 's boyfriend .

he was nice enough but liked to talk when victoria needed quiet time to study and worry about tonight .

`` he is so do n't worry .

plenty of quiet at my place , '' he assured her .

victoria spent the rest of the afternoon studying , forcing thoughts of dharr out of her mind until six o'clock when scott demanded that she stop and get ready .

`` i have to do your hair , dearie .

because if i know you , and i do , '' he teased , `` then you 're just going to brush it and leave it down , right ? ''

`` that was the plan , yes , '' she said , closing her book and tucking it into her book bag .

`` not going to work , '' he said .

`` not if you 're going to wear this , '' he said and pulled a creamy white , beaded dress out of the closet .

`` what do you think ? ''

he asked .

victoria gasped in delight .

`` scott !

it is wonderful , '' she said .

getting up , she walked over to the dress and touched the glittering sequins that danced all over the fabric in a creative design .

there were flat sequins as well as drop beads that created an almost flighty feeling .

the white would look perfect with her soft , brown hair and creamy skin .

`` when did you make this ? ''

she asked .

`` no time for flattery .

just hop into the shower and then come out here .

and just please tell me you are n't wearing your usual plain , white underwear . ''

victoria blushed .

`` of course ! ''

scott sighed .

`` do n't you have anything else ? ''

he demanded .

`` no !

besides , dharr is n't going to see my underwear tonight anyway , '' she claimed and slipped into the bathroom .

`` pity , '' scott said , noting her perfect derriere , which was the last thing he saw before the bathroom door closed .

while she 'd been in the shower , scott had called over to jasmine to explain the situation and ask that she bring over some makeup .

an hour and a half later , scott put the final touches on her hair .

he 'd demanded that she blow dry her hair , then he curled the ends so her hair floated around her shoulders like a soft , brown cloud .

the dress was the perfect foil for her figure , enhancing her tiny waist and pushing her breasts higher .

her cleavage was showing over the neckline , making her breasts look larger than they really were .

and since she was n't small breasted in the first place , they became quite obvious in the dress .

chapter 3 victoria stared at her reflection in the mirror and was astonished .

she 'd modeled many dresses for scott before , some more daring than this one .

but she 'd only been in front of a camera when she 'd worn them .

she 'd never before been about to embark on a date with a man so much more worldly than she was .

`` scott , are you sure about this dress ? ''

she asked , pulling up the top and trying to flatten out her breasts .

`` is n't it too ... .revealing ? ''

she finished .

`` absolutely , '' he said , smiling in the mirror .

`` it looks great , '' jasmine exclaimed .

`` i still think you should wear more makeup .

just a touch of liner to your eyes would make them look bigger , smokier .

very sexy , you know . ''

victoria shook her head .

`` that 's not really me , jasmine , '' she said , smiling to soften the rejection .

jasmine sighed and shook her head .

`` i know .

i 'd just like to meet this guy .

you 've never been excited about the men i 've set you up with .

what 's so great about this one ? ''

she asked , smiling and settling down with a glass of wine that scott handed her .

scott rolled his eyes and poured a glass for himself , not bothering to offer one to victoria although he thought she needed one just to calm herself down .
