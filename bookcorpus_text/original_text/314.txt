victoria stomped back to the kitchen and put the spaghetti sauce and vegetables back into the refrigerator and walked out of the kitchen , furious with him and with the situation .

she was n't hungry herself so if scott was going out , there was no need to cook .

left alone , she paced the room several times , trying to get her temper under control .

she flipped on the television but when nothing interested her , she flipped it off again .

a half hour later , scott swung out of his room , patted her head teasingly and blew her a kiss before opening the door to leave .

`` wow !

deja vu ! ''

scott said .

`` she 's in the family room , '' scott said and disappeared down the stairs .

the hairs on victoria 's neck started tingling and she swung around , terrified to see if her instincts were right .

and there he stood , in all his masculine glory .

dharr was here , in her apartment , making it seem way too small when his overwhelming size entered it .

he looked around disdainfully , noting the mismatched furniture and worn out carpet .

`` good evening , victoria , '' he said quietly and closed the door behind him .

`` what do you want ? ''

she asked , crossing her arms over her chest , painfully aware of the clothes she was wearing .

the tee-shirt she 'd pulled on was old and at least two sizes too small but she had n't been expecting company .

`` relaxing for the night ? ''

he asked , his eyes moving down to her breasts which were thrusting through the thin fabric .

`` i like your shirt , '' he said .

victoria could feel her nipples harden underneath his knowing gaze .

`` what do you want , dharr ? ''

she demanded , wishing she was n't blushing right now but not able to control it .

`` i thought i 'd already given you my answer earlier today .

besides , you mentioned you were flying to germany .

why are you still here in london ? ''

he walked into the room , looking around at the various pieces of furniture .

`` but it was n't the right answer , '' he countered .

`` when it is , then i 'll accept it .

and i did fly to germany today .

now i 'm back . ''

her hands were fists at her sides by the end of his announcement .

`` you are infuriating . ''

`` and you are as beautiful as i remember you being . ''

he turned to look into the tiny kitchen but it obviously did n't interest him overly much since he turned back to face her again quickly .

`` have you married him ?

i did n't notice a ring on your finger so i 'm guessing you have n't yet . ''

`` him ? ''

she asked , feeling caught off guard .

`` your boyfriend ? ''

`` boyfriend ? ''

dharr sighed and looked at her impatiently .

`` the man who just left . ''

`` scott ? ''

victoria questioned .

`` marry him ? ''

`` that is what some people do , '' he replied .

the whole scene was out of some sort of bizarre movie .

`` no .

we have n't married .

yet , '' she added .

if he thought she was going to marry scott then maybe she could have a little pride left .

he had n't left her with much last time .

dharr raised one eyebrow at her callous reply .

`` either you 're committed to him or you 're not , victoria .

after all these years , are you so fickle that you ca n't make up your mind ? ''

he definitely had a low opinion of her , did n't he ?

she walked away , intending to go into her room and put on a different shirt but he stopped her .

`` are you ? ''

he ground out , holding her wrist in a punishing grip .

she looked into his black eyes and wanted to slap him .

but she did n't dare .

`` yes .

i 'm fickle .

i just do n't want to settle down with one man , dharr .

i like variety and i like men .

so why settle for one man when i can have a whole banquet ? ''

dharr looked down at her beautiful , furious face and wanted to kiss her soft lips .

he wanted to pull off the tiny shirt she was wearing and feel the soft , perfect texture of her breasts .

it was as if the old feelings he had for her , the painful sexual frustration was back and more powerful than ever .

he had been with many other women since he 'd last seen victoria but none had been able to ease the frustration within him .

something inside him made him realize that nothing would until he had this one woman .

after so many years , he still wanted her with a painful desire .

so when his niece and nephew had started showing signs of problems , victoria had come to mind .

he would solve two problems at once , he thought .

no matter how much he detested her morals , he knew she could help the kids .

and he would make sure she helped him along the way too .

it was time for him to settle down but he could n't do that until he 'd exorcised the demons of his past .

or at least one demon - in the form of the delectable victoria .
