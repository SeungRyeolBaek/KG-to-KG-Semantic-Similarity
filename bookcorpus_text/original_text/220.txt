to my horror , i watch from the corner of my eye as emerson waves at the trio .

of course .

they 're his lacrosse teammates .

he has no idea why flagging them down is the worst thing he could possibly do to me right now .

against my silent prayers to any god that 's listening , the three boys stroll over to our table .

emerson swings his body around to greet them .

`` hey guys , '' he says to his three teammates .

`` hey tank , '' says one of the guys , a blonde junior named steve , using emerson 's lacrosse nickname .

`` what 's up ? ''

`` nothing .

as usual , '' emerson laughs , `` what 's happening tonight ? ''

`` some people will be over at my place , '' says roger , a lanky senior .

`` got a couple of dime bags , if you want in . ''

`` you know i do , '' emerson replies .

`` we interrupting you ? ''

steve asks .

i feel their three sets of eyes fall on my face like laser beams .

shit .

i was hoping i 'd get out of this without having to say a word to them .

`` just grabbing some food , '' emerson says , `` right abby ? ''

with great reluctance , i raise my eyes to the four boys before me .

i try to keep my gaze trained on emerson , or even steve and roger , but my eyes ca n't help themselves .

they flick masochistically up to the third boy standing next to our table .

he 's as tall as emerson , with jet black hair slicked away from his hard jaw , his full lips .

his own dark eyes skirt away from mine the second we make eye contact .

he has n't looked at me in years .

i like to believe it 's because he ca n't bear to , that the guilt and shame are too much for him to deal with .

but in reality , it 's probably just cold indifference that repels his gaze from me .

his name is tucker jacoby .

he very nearly derailed my entire life , back when we were fifteen .

and it 's abundantly clear that emerson has no idea .

`` yeah ... '' i finally manage to say , my voice barely audible .

`` just getting some food . ''

`` you guys know abby , right ? ''

emerson says to the trio .

i can feel my skin starting to crawl with every passing moment they ... he lingers beside me .

`` sure .

yeah , '' steve nods , `` you do all those cartoons in the school newspaper , right ? ''

`` right , '' i say shortly , my hands shaking violently under the table .

`` that 's me . ''

`` i liked the one with the duck , '' roger puts in , `` did n't really get the joke , but- '' `` i 'm starving , '' tucker cuts in .

the sound of his voice is like an ice pick to my composure .

`` let 's get a table .

see you , tank . ''

he turns away without acknowledging me , just as he 's done for the past couple of years .

emerson raises an eyebrow at his retreating back before glancing over at me .

he freezes as he catches a glimpse of my upset expression , taken off guard by the extremity of my discomfort .

`` see ya , tank , '' roger says , turning toward the table that tucker 's claimed for them .

`` think you 'll swing by my place tonight ? ''

`` yeah .

i 'll get back to you on that , '' emerson says , his eyes still fixed on my troubled face .

the sudden concern clouding his handsome face is enough to make my own eyes prickle with hot tears .

roger and steve trundle away after tucker , leaving emerson and i alone again at last .

our food has yet to arrive , but i 've lost any trace of my appetite .

the air in the crystal dawn feels poisonous now .

contaminated .

i 'm finding it harder to breathe with every shallow gulp of air i can manage to force down .

`` abby , are you ok ? ''

emerson asks , reaching for me across the table .

`` i. i need ... '' i gasp , struggling to form the simplest words .

`` can we go ?

please ? ''

`` of course we can , '' emerson says , his voice soft but firm .

he rises to his feet and offers me a hand as i stand , shakily .

i feel the comforting weight of his arm as he drapes it over my shoulders , holding me snugly against his muscled side .

usually , i 'd be all butterflies and giddiness to be this close to him .

but in the midst of my anxiety attack , all i can feel is icy panic .

i ca n't help but glance over at tucker as emerson leads me out of the diner .

i should be used to the uncaring expression he saves just for me by now .

i should n't let the mere sight of him unravel me like this .

but i 'm just not strong enough to not give a shit .

i never have been .

after what feels like a decade , i settle into the passenger seat of emerson 's chevy .

as he rounds the car , sinks into the driver 's seat , and slams the door shut behind him , the bubble of my fear and apprehension bursts .
