`` this land used to belong to a native american tribe called the- '' `` piscataway , '' i finish reflexively .

`` damn , i keep forgetting my stepsister is a nerd , '' he says , and i can hear from his voice that he 's grinning .

`` i wo n't even try to impress you with my passion for local history , then . ''

`` no , come on , impress me , '' i tease him .

`` i ca n't hold a candle , '' he feigns defeat .

`` you get better grades than me . ''

`` yeah , well , put me on two varsity teams and i think those grades might dip a little .

i do n't know how you do it .

my friends allison and miriam tell me i spend too much time at the library-i barely have enough time for them .

not to mention , i 'm not athletically gifted at all , '' i add , nodding to my ineffectual rowing .

`` so you 've got me there . ''

`` i met allison on the 4th , right ? ''

`` right . ''

`` but miriam ? ''

`` she 's back home in memphis for the summer .

she 's my other good friend ; she and allison room together . ''

`` why do n't you live with them ? ''

he asks , and i pause to listen to his oars dropping quietly into the water .

`` mm , i thought about it , but i like living alone .

my mom can be ... '' `` what ? ''

he prods me .

`` i 'm trying to think of a more flattering word for needy . ''

`` you can say needy if you want .

i wo n't tell . ''

`` ok , she 's really fucking needy , '' i reply , feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders .

i hardly ever talk about the more negative aspects of my relationship with my mom .

`` honestly , a lot less so since she 's met pierce , though .

sometimes i just feel like i'm- '' `` her mom , '' he finishes for me .

i turn to face him , raising my eyebrows .

`` is it obvious ? ''

i ask worriedly .

`` i do n't mean to sound resentful . ''

`` you 're allowed to feel however you want about her , '' he responds with a kind smile , and i turn back around .

`` at first i thought you were fragile , '' he says after a moment .

`` like if i dropped you , you 'd break .

i think that 's why ... that 's why i wanted to test you a little . ''

`` you mean when you felt me up at dinner with our parents sitting across from us ? ''

he laughs .

`` i ca n't believe i did that , and i do n't think i 've ever apologized . ''

`` no , you did n't , jerk . ''

`` i am sorry . ''

`` so , you do n't think i 'm fragile now ? ''

`` no .

i think you 're one of the toughest people i 've ever met .

look ! ''

he says suddenly .

i glance back toward him and follow where 's he 's pointing .

`` a great blue heron , '' he explains as i spot the huge bird with its wings spread , perched on a rock in the middle of the river .

`` that 's how they dry their feathers after they dive for fish . ''

he stops rowing for a while as we watch it .

suddenly it pulls its wings in , gathers itself like a coil , and launches into the air .

we watch it fly into the distant treetops before we begin paddling up the river again .

`` why are you interested in history ? ''

i ask him .

`` i like understanding why people behave the way they do , '' he explains quietly .

i resist the urge to ask how this relates to his own history , trying to respect the boundaries he 's put up .

`` how 's greg ? ''

he asks suddenly .

i turn around and narrow my eyes at him .

`` what ?

that 's a friendly question , '' he says with a devilish grin .

`` i ... i do n't want to talk about it , '' i reply , a little more huffily than i intend to .

`` ok ... so that either means really good or really bad . ''

`` it 's not really bad , '' i protest .

`` uh-oh . ''

i sigh .

`` it 's just , there 's no ... you know ... '' `` spark ? ''

`` exactly .

i have to tell him soon-i do n't want him to get hurt .

not that i think i 'm breaking his heart or anything- '' `` i saw the way he looks at you . ''

`` meaning ? ''

`` he 's falling fast .

i 'd tell him before he falls any further . ''

`` i think you 're exaggerating . ''

`` trust me . ''

we fall back into a comfortable silence as i think about his words .

the stillness of the river , broken only by a soft wind blowing through the trees , helps to ease my anxiety over the conversation i need to have with greg .

the concept of `` problems '' seems to fade out here , though perhaps it 's the unrelenting heat , which feels like it 's beginning to melt my body into the seat of the kayak .
