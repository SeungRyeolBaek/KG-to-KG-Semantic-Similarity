what followed was a three-year courtship and then engagement .

mia was accepted and loved by all of pesh 's family .

and then dev had gone and thrown it all away by cheating on mia .

in her heartbreak , mia had stayed close to pesh , and he wanted her to be happy more than anything else in the world .

pesh would have liked to have been surprised by his brother 's visit , but ever since he had been summoned to console mia a few days before , he had been anticipating it .

truthfully , he had been bracing himself for his brother 's wrath .

`` hello dev , '' he said , in a calm voice .

shaking his head furiously , dev said , `` i just got a f**king blow off text from mia .

when i tried calling her back to demand she explain herself , she could n't talk because she was in mexico .

with aj . ''

`` yes , i 'm aware of that . ''

dev 's dark eyes narrowed at pesh 's confirmation .

`` so it 's true that you went to talk to her ? ''

`` yes , it is . ''

`` i ca n't believe it . ''

he threw up his hands in frustration .

`` i did n't want to believe anything mia said , especially that it was you who helped her see that she should n't give me a second chance and take me back-that she should make things work with aj . ''

`` it 's all true .

you and i both know mia would never lie . ''

`` but how could you ? ''

dev demanded , in a strangled voice .

`` i 'm sorry , but i had to do what was best for mia . ''

dev 's brows shot up .

`` and what about me ?

i 'm your f**king blood . ''

with a sigh , pesh replied , `` i 'm sorry , my brother , but blood or not , i could n't stand by and let you hurt her again-she 's been through too much . ''

`` i love her ! ''

dev shouted , which caused several of the nurses to spin around in shock .

`` this is not the time nor the place to be having this discussion , '' pesh growled .

`` i 'm not going anywhere , so you better start explaining yourself before i really start a scene . ''

pesh shook his head .

`` fine .

you want the truth ?

here is it .

you only think you love mia .

you and i both know you can not be faithful to a woman . ''

`` i could have for mia . ''

`` you already failed her once .

she deserved better . ''

dev narrowed his eyes .

`` what , are you f**king her now ? ''

he grimaced at his brother 's choice of harsh words .

`` of course i 'm not .

there 's never been anything amorous between mia and myself .

thankfully , she 's back with the man she loves-the father of her unborn child . ''

`` but i need her , '' dev insisted , his voice taking on a plaintive tone .

`` i 'm sorry , but i think it 's best if you moved on .

most of all , baby brother , i think you need to do a lot of soul searching and maturing before you even think about getting in another relationship . ''

dev 's eyes widened .

`` you ... you f**king bastard ! ''

he shouted .

pesh was debating calling security to remove his unruly brother when he was knocked off his stool by dev 's right hook to his jaw .

he tumbled backward and crashed onto the floor .

before dev could do something like kick him when he was down , megan appeared and wedged herself between them .

`` i think you better leave before i call security , '' she demanded .

pesh struggled to his feet as megan came into dev 's line of fire .

he could n't bear if dev hurt her in his anger just because she had taken up for him .

dev stared down at megan with a smirk .

`` so my brother needs some pint-sized pu**y defending him now ?

word to the wise , sweetheart , do n't waste your time on him .

he 's only got a boner for his dead wife . ''

a deep growl erupted in pesh 's throat as he lunged for his brother .

but he never made it .

instead , megan 's fist cracked into dev 's jaw .

the impact did n't take him off his feet , but he did stagger backwards .

even as she flailed her wrist back and forth from the obvious pain , megan still managed to bellow , `` get the hell out of here .

now . ''

dev stared at her in shock as he rubbed his jaw .

`` crazy bitch , '' he muttered , before stalking off .

when megan turned to him , her glowering expression faded to one of concern .

`` you 're bleeding ! ''

she cried , rushing for him .

his hand came up to grip his cheek .

surprise flooded him when he felt wetness .

dev must 've hit him harder than he thought .

he slid his jaw back and forth , causing him to grimace at the popping sound .

`` come here , '' megan said , grabbing his hand .

she started leading him over to one of the examining rooms , but he jerked back .

`` i do n't need all this fuss . ''
