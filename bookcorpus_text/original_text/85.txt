when a smile lit up megan 's face , he shook his head .

`` but not formally yet .

not until i put a diamond on your hand . ''

`` but i do n't need that to know i 'm promised to you and that we 're getting married . ''

`` maybe you do n't , but i do . ''

she rolled her eyes .

`` fine , fine .

i 'll let you buy me a diamond .

a great big one , okay ? ''

he laughed .

`` i promise to spend a fortune . ''

`` you know i would be happy to wear your ring even if it was a little chip . ''

`` i know you would .

but i want to spoil my beautiful future wife . ''

she grinned .

`` okay , i wo n't argue with you . ''

pesh brought his mouth to hers .

as their lips moved against each other , he could n't believe how lucky he was .

megan was his-she was really going to be his for the rest of his life .

when she flicked her tongue against his , he groaned into her mouth .

considering they were at patrick 's with all of her family down the hall , he knew the last thing on his mind should 've been flipping her over onto her back and pounding into her .

but he did n't care .

he wanted inside her body .

he had finally made it into her heart , mind , and soul , and he once again wanted to be inside her perfection .

when megan pushed him onto his back , pesh raised his brows at her .

`` mmm , i think my future wife is getting ahead of herself .

usually the consummating comes after the wedding , not the engagement , '' he teased .

`` i think we 've consummated enough over the last few months where it does n't matter . ''

`` i suppose you 're right . ''

as she ground her core against his growing erection , she said , `` looks like i 'm not the only one with consummating on the mind . ''

`` you should know that has a mind of its own . ''

she grinned down at him .

`` well , right now i think we 're both of the same mind . ''

as she continued to grind against him , his hands swept to her br**sts .

he cupped and kneaded the flesh over her top .

at the sound of the door opening , pesh tried to pull away , but he did n't make it in time .

`` oh f**king hell ! ''

aidan 's voice boomed from the doorway .

megan quickly scrambled off pesh , and they both rose up , trying to straighten their clothes and hair .

with a pained expression , aidan said , `` seriously ?

this is my old bedroom ! ''

pesh chuckled .

`` i 'm sorry , but you of all people should understand that when the mood hits , you act on it . ''

megan smacked his arm playfully .

`` that is not exactly what happened . ''

holding up one of his hands , aidan said , `` frankly , i do n't really want to know what happened .

i just came back here to make sure megan was all right .

next time , i 'll make sure someone else comes , so i do n't need eye bleach to wipe that out of my memory. ``

`` ha , ha , very funny , '' megan grumbled , as she got off the bed .

`` we were only celebrating , '' pesh said .

aidan pinched his eyes shut .

`` i do n't think i even want to know what you were celebrating . ''

`` our engagement , pervert , '' megan replied .

aidan 's blue eyes widened .

`` holy shit , you two are engaged ? ''

pesh smiled as he rose off the bed and took megan 's hand .

`` yes , we are .

well , i mean , i need to go to her father and properly ask for her hand .

and there 's the fact she does n't have a ring . ''

shaking his head in disbelief , aidan said , `` that 's ... wow .

i 'm so happy for you two . ''

`` thank you .

and i do mean that .

if it were n't for you and emma , i never would have met megan , '' pesh said .

aidan grinned as he clapped pesh on the back .

`` you 're more than welcome , man .

i 'm just so glad you two finally realized how good you were for each other . ''

he turned back to the door before motioning them .

`` come on , let 's go tell the others .

i think this calls for a celebration , but just not the kind that you two were partaking in . ''

megan shook her head .

`` we were n't going to tell anybody yet . ''

pesh nodded .

`` she does n't even have a ring . ''

aidan snorted .

`` do you really think anyone out there is going to give two shits about whether or not you have a ring ? ''

`` we just want to do it the right way , '' pesh replied .

holding up his hands in surrender , aidan said , `` all right , i 'm not going to argue with you anymore .

but i will say that there is no right way .

hell , look at me and em .

in the end , you have to go with the flow and appreciate the moments that are bigger than you could ever imagine . ''
