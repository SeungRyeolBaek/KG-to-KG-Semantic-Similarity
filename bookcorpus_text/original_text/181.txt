i feel his hand press down against my forearms , his long fingers easily reaching completely around me , and pinning me to the pillow .

his other hand slides out of me and pulls my hips back toward him .

i begin to tremble with anticipation , but do n't have to wait very long .

i feel his cock at my slit , pushing into me as he holds me in place .

i cry out from pain and pleasure as he reawakens the soreness he created the first time , but unlike that time , the pleasure is also instant and intense .

i feel his mouth at my ear .

`` you like that ? ''

`` yes , oh god , yes , '' i moan .

he thrusts into me faster .

`` it 's so hard to hold back with you , '' he mutters , almost to himself .

`` you do n't have to , '' i reply .

i hear him grunt in response and slam into me harder .

suddenly i feel myself being picked up and turned over .

before i know it , i 'm on my hands and knees without nate and me ever losing contact .

i have to bite my lip to keep myself from screaming out in pleasure as he pulls out and drives back in .

he 's in so deep now , pressing directly against my g-spot with every thrust .

my body begins to shake with another orgasm and this time , i let myself go with it .

i feel nate 's hands pulling my hips back to meet his with every thrust as he comes with me .

my elbows collapse down with the final shudder of my orgasm , and nate lands on top of me , immediately kissing the back of my neck .

`` oh , brynn , i 'm sorry , '' he murmurs , as he pulls my hair out of my face .

`` sorry ?

why are you sorry ? ''

i ask , befuddled .

`` you 're crying ... i 'm so sorry .

i was too rough , i went too quickly , i- '' he rushes on , sounding horrified .

my brain tries to catch up with him .

`` no , no .

it did n't hurt .

i did n't even realize i was crying .

everything felt amazing . ''

his body relaxes against mine .

`` i was so scared for a second there .

i thought i hurt you . ''

`` no , honestly ... '' i reach up to touch my face , and he 's right-my cheeks are damp .

`` that 's so strange .

this does n't happen a lot ? ''

he pulls himself up so he can look at me with an ironic grin .

`` i do try not to make girls cry , brynn . ''

i laugh .

`` i 'm sorry , i just meant ... i wondered if this happens to other girls .

i suppose i do n't usually ... you know , let go of control like that .

maybe the emotional release ... '' `` maybe .

just as long as you 're ok. '' `` i 'm more than ok , '' i assure him .

`` sore ? ''

i nod .

`` a little . ''

`` i 'll get you some water , '' he says , kissing the back of my shoulder before gently pulling out of me .

he comes back from the bathroom with a glass for me , and sits up in bed with me as i drink it .

`` i wish you could sleep here , '' i murmur , resting my head on his shoulder .

i feel spent , relaxed ... and happy .

`` me too . ''

chapter twenty-two the next morning , i wake up reaching for nate , but he 's gone .

i turn over onto my back in frustration .

i thought that after we had sex my desire for him might fade a bit , become more manageable , but it 's even stronger now .

even though i can feel a little soreness and pain between my legs , i want him to take me again , and again , and again .

i glance at the clock and am shocked to see it 's almost noon .

well , i guess i did have a big day yesterday , between almost sliding down that cliff and losing my virginity .

i slide under the sheets to the side of the bed and sit up on the edge .

i roll my ankle and find that there 's barely any pain , though i guess i should leave the tape on for one more day just to be safe .

i stand and pull on a pair of yoga pants and a t-shirt and head downstairs to the kitchen and fix myself some breakfast .

my mom walks in just as i 'm sitting down at the breakfast table .

`` wow , that 's a lot of food , brynn , '' she comments , raising her eyebrows at the amount of eggs and toast on my plate .

`` starving , '' i reply , pausing only momentarily then continuing to shovel food into my mouth .

`` i can see that .

how 's your ankle ? ''

`` lot better . ''

i clear my throat .

i need to stop acting weird or my mom will know something 's up .

i put down my fork .

`` did you have a nice lunch with pierce yesterday ?

where 'd you go ? ''

`` the palm , '' she replies .

`` it was lovely .

pierce is a regular there and always gets the best table . ''
