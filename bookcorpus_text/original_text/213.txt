`` well , '' he starts , letting his blue eyes travel down the length of my body .

`` i can tell you what i 'd like to- '' a shrill scream rings out from somewhere within the massive house , a wave of frantic noise building from below .

the din rises , tearing my and emerson 's attention away from each other .

the pounding music cuts off abruptly , and through the cacophony ringing out beneath our feet , a new set of voices can be heard loud and clear .

`` police !

everybody out ! ''

`` break it up , break it up ! ''

`` anyone still here in five minutes is under arrest ! ''

`` fuck me , '' i mutter angrily , shoving a hand through my blonde hair .

`` certainly no time for that now , '' emerson laughs roughly , playing off our intense moment .

or maybe i was just imagining that intensity ?

i 'll never know now .

i squint as bright light floods the closet once more .

someone 's ripped open the door , revealing the chaos unfolding in the master bedroom suite .

courtney is bawling frantically as everyone else makes a beeline for the exits .

emerson shoves my panties into his pocket just in time , before riley darts into the closet to fetch us .

`` we have to go ! ''

she says firmly .

`` how are we going to make it past the cops ? ''

i ask worriedly .

running from the police is n't exactly my strong suit .

luckily , emerson is a bit more experienced on this front than i .

`` come on , '' he commands , a daredevil smile spreading across his face as he takes my wrist in his hand .

riley gives me a big wink as emerson carts me away into the frenzy of escaping partygoers .

we dive into the fray , the voices of police officers and drunken high schoolers commingling in a deafening clash .

as we run along the second story landing , i watch as one incautious classmate takes a swing at a cop , then finds himself in handcuffs a moment later .

i stay as close to emerson as i can as he barrels through the crowd , protecting me from the surge of moving bodies .

we careen into an empty bedroom and slam the door behind us , our chests heaving with exertion .

`` where did riley go ? ''

i ask , panicked .

`` no time to look for her , '' emerson says gruffly , striding toward the bedroom window , `` if i get arrested again , my mom 's gon na ship me off to the army or something . ''

he wrenches open the window and kicks the screen clear out of the frame .

`` is that really necessary ? ''

i hiss , as he peers out into the night .

`` jackpot , '' he says , ignoring my question , `` we can climb right down this trellis .

and your dad 's place-sorry , our place-is close enough to make a run for it . ''

`` how am i supposed to keep up with you , mr .

varsity athlete ? ''

i demand , planting my hands on my hips .

`` run fast , '' he winks , swinging a leg over the window sill .

i let out a frightening yelp as he disappears out the window , and rush forward to make sure he has n't fallen .

i look on as emerson dismounts gracefully onto the lush green grass below , looking up at me expectantly .

`` i ca n't do that , '' i call down to him .

`` you have to , '' he insists , `` do n't be such a little chicken shit , sis . ''

`` no .

i mean , i ca n't ... '' i trail off , blushing wildly , `` you still have my .

you know . ''

a wild , raucous laugh rips out of emerson 's throat as he remembers that my panties are still in his pocket .

i 'm totally commando .

and wearing a skirt .

not exactly the best trellis-climbing attire .

`` i promise i wo n't peek , '' emerson says , getting a hold of himself .

`` just come on . ''

`` no fucking way ! ''

i reply , crossing my arms .

`` look .

it 's either scamper down here , bare-assed , or get arrested .

your call , '' emerson shoots back .

`` i 'm pretty sure your precious colleges wo n't be thrilled with your having a criminal record . ''

i bite my lip , glancing over my shoulder as the din of the raid reaches its peak .

he 's right .

i 'm all out of options .

`` you have to close your eyes , '' i tell him .

`` i mean it , sawyer . ''

`` yeah , yeah , '' he says , screwing his eyes shut .

`` get a move on , weirdo . ''

a cool breeze brushes against my most intimate flesh as i scoot onto the window sill .

as far as strange sensations go , this has to be up near the top .

checking once more to make sure emerson 's eyes are really closed , i grab onto the vine-covered trellis beside the window .

with a deep breath , i swing out into the open air .

i 've never been very good with heights , so this is not exactly my idea of a good time .

`` oh , for fuck 's sake , '' i groan , as the breeze lifts up my skirt .
