`` what kinds of questions ? ''

victoria shrugged her shoulders slightly , smiling up at him as she said , `` oh , simple things , like your last name , what you do for a living , where you live .

you know , minor details . ''

`` i told you my last name yesterday . ''

victoria looked down at her hands which were clasped in front of her .

`` i know , but i could n't remember it .

so when my suitemate asked me today , i could n't answer and it was embarrassing .

and over dinner , i noticed that you did n't answer any questions .

besides , the men you have waiting downstairs for you are a little scary .

i do n't know if all those bulges are muscles and i do n't want to know , '' she said when he was about to answer her .

`` there are some things that are better left to the imagination . ''

he nodded although he was amused at her fear of his body guards and their weapons .

dharr faced reality head on , knowing that the world was not a nice place and anticipating issues .

victoria obviously preferred to see the world as much nicer than it really was .

`` fair enough .

and tomorrow , you can ask me anything you 'd like . ''

she looked up at him .

`` and will you answer me ? ''

dharr laughed .

`` if it is the right question . ''

she had to laugh back , amazed yet again at his arrogance .

`` fair enough . ''

`` goodnight , victoria , '' he said and touched her bruised cheek gently .

he took her key and unlocked the door for her before handing it back to her .

`` sweet dreams . ''

victoria watched him walk away for a moment .

`` one more thing , dharr , '' she called out .

he turned at the top of the stair well .

`` what 's that ? ''

victoria bit her lip , wondering if she could actually ask the question .

`` would you mind if you ... well , did n't wear a suit tomorrow ?

it might get a little dirty . ''

dharr grinned but nodded his head .

`` if that is your wish , '' he said .

chapter 4 victoria nervously slid her hands down the sides of her khaki slacks and white tee-shirt .

the picnic basket was by her feet and she had a blanket on top of it .

would dharr think this was a silly idea ?

she hoped not .

she did n't have a lot of money and a simple meal was the most elaborate thing she could think of .

she even knew of a wonderful place by the thames in a park only a few miles away .

they could just sit on the grass away from everyone else and simply enjoy the night descending .

thankfully , it was a little cooler tonight with the promise of fall scenting the air .

the leaves had n't started changing yet but they would in another few weeks .

she saw the limousine turn into the parking lot and her heart instantly sped up in anticipation of seeing dharr .

absently , she wondered how long this feeling of excitement would last .

she 'd felt it for a few other dates , until the end of the dates , that is when they tried kissing her by mashing their mouths against hers .

that 's when the feeling had ended .

so had the relationship .

the long , black car pulled up right next to her and victoria smiled and opened the back door just as a man was getting out of the front seat , possibly to open the car for her .

she simply waved to the man and picked up the basket and blanket , then disappeared into the back seat .

sitting down next to dharr , she noted the frown on his face .

`` good evening ! ''

she said .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

`` you should wait for the door to be opened for you , victoria , '' he admonished .

she looked at the now closed door and blinked .

`` why ? ''

she asked , turning back to face him .

`` because you are a lady .

a gentleman opens the door for her . ''

victoria knew he was serious but she could n't help laughing .

`` that 's silly when i 'm perfectly capable of opening the door for myself .

`` regardless , you will permit my guards to open the doors for you in the future , '' he ordered .

her smile disappeared and she nodded her head .

`` of course , if that 's what you want , '' she said quietly .

dharr instantly lightened .

`` thank you .

but this is what i want , '' he said and pulled her forward .

victoria had thought he wanted just a small kiss , like her father would give to her mother occasionally .

but dharr pulled her onto his lap and lowered his head to hers .

his mouth touched hers and within a moment , his hand was pulling her chin down , just as he had the previous night and his tongue dipped into her mouth .

victoria 's mind went blank and her whole body was reacting to instinctive feelings .

her body arched against his .

she heard a moan but did n't realize it was her as his mouth took over hers , his tongue exploring her mouth and making her dizzy with unexpected and unfamiliar feelings .

dharr pulled back slightly .
