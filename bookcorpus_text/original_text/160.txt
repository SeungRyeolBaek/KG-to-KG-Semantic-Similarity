my mom does know how to throw a good party .

i grab another drink as the twilight turns into night and people begin heading down to the lower lawn to get a better view of the fireworks .

with a sudden boom , the display begins .

there are a few exclamations of excitement and some clapping as the crowd gathers to stare downriver at the explosions of color .

i 'm making my way toward the rear of the crowd when i feel a hand on the small of my back .

i know before i even turn around that it 's nate .

`` what 's going on ? ''

he asks quietly , as i turn to face him .

`` it 's nothing .

my mom just is n't feeling well , '' i reply .

`` you 're pulling at your hair , '' he points out , and i drop my hand , feeling caught .

the crowd cheers as an especially colorful firework goes off above us .

`` so ? ''

`` i can read you like a book , brynn , '' he replies , leaning in .

i can feel his breath on my cheek and step back , feeling flustered .

`` i just think it 's something that your dad should tell you , '' i say , and turn back to the fireworks , but i feel his hand on my elbow .

`` would you just tell me ?

you and my dad are both acting strangely , and now your mom disappears ... i just want to know . ''

`` and here i thought i was covering well , '' i say , stalling for time .

`` maybe to other people , but not to me . ''

i stare at him for a moment as his features are illuminated by the light of one of my favorite , willow-shaped fireworks .

`` there 's a woman ... she 's going to go on the news tomorrow and say that your dad sexually harassed her . ''

`` that 's crazy , '' he hisses at me .

`` i 'm just the messenger-you insisted i tell you- '' i stammer , taken aback by his tone .

`` my dad , he 's a great man .

he 's a pillar of the community- '' `` a pillar of the community ? ''

`` what ?

he is ! ''

`` it 's just , sometimes the way you talk about him ... he 's not perfect , nate . ''

`` you do n't know anything about him .

when my mom abandoned us , he took care of me all by himself .

he 's always been there for me . ''

`` ok , i 'm just- '' but nate storms off back to the house .

i stand in shock for a moment .

i knew that conversation was n't going to be fun , but i did n't think he 'd turn on me like that , as though i were attacking pierce , or something .

i turn back toward the crowd just as the finale begins and the sky lights up .

i glance at the people around me , their faces upturned , their expressions joyous .

maybe it was silly of me to look forward to everyone leaving .

because now i realize that tomorrow , it will be back to the four of us alone in the house-and no buffer zone .

my eyes fall on pierce and i realize he 's staring at me .

he smiles quickly when he realizes that i 'm looking at him , and leads the applause as the last firework dies out .

chapter fourteen i was half-worried that the plan was for all four of us to watch the tv program together , but thankfully there 's no such expectation .

or at least , i have n't been told of it .

it 's the first time in a while my mom has n't insisted on a family dinner .

she 's been holed up in her room most of the day , while pierce fields calls from his attorneys in his study .

i decide to grab some leftover pasta from the fridge to eat in my room , and peer into nate 's room as i pass .

no sign of him .

i shut my door behind me and open my computer to check out some of the coverage online .

i feel nauseous as i read the woman 's claims , though slightly relieved that she is n't accusing pierce of any kind of violence .

she talks mostly about lingering touches , shoulder massages , and being stonewalled by management when she complained .

i finish eating and click around the internet for a while , feeling restless .

when i ca n't stand my boredom any longer , i take my plate and walk back down to the kitchen and put it in the dishwasher .

the phone on the counter rings as i 'm headed past it .

i pause for a moment , waiting to see if someone else is going to answer it .

what if it 's a reporter ?

do i just say 'no comment , ' like they do on tv ?

on the third ring , i decide to bite the bullet .

`` hello ? ''

`` hi , is nate there ? ''

a female voice asks breathlessly .

ah , another admirer .

`` sorry , i do n't think he is , '' i reply honestly .

`` can i take a message ? ''

there 's a slight pause .

`` is this holly ? ''

`` no , this is her daughter , brynn .

may i ask who 's calling ? ''
