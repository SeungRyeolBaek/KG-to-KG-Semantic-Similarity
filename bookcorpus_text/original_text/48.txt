she questioned .

sean grinned as he elbowed gavin .

`` she 's getting riled , man .

being irrational about little things usually means love . ''

megan opened her mouth to lay into her brothers , but then found herself speechless , so she closed it back up .

without another word to her brothers , she went into the living room .

she found her dad lounging in his chair with mason snuggled to his side .

when her dad looked up , he did a double take .

`` do n't you look beautiful , sweetheart , '' he said .

she bent down and kissed his cheek .

`` thanks , daddy . ''

mason tore his gaze away from the television to look at her .

`` mommy , bye-bye ? ''

this was one question she had n't anticipated explaining .

`` yes , mommy is going to go see a friend today , and you 're going to stay here with grammy and granddad . ''

his tiny brows furrowed .

`` mace no go ? ''

guilt rocketed through her .

how could she spend one of her few off days away from her son ?

the doorbell rang , and she was forced out of her self-loathing to answer the door .

taking a deep breath , she opened it .

her heart did a funny little flip-flop at the sight of pesh on the porch .

it was n't just how handsome he looked in his khaki pants , red button-down polo shirt , and black blazer .

it was also the fact he held a dozen red roses in his hand .

`` hi , '' she said shyly , after they had stared at each other for a few seconds .

he smiled .

`` hello . ''

`` would you like to come in ? ''

as he nodded , she stepped aside to give him room to come in the door .

he turned back to her and held out the roses .

`` these are for you . ''

after the words left his lips , he grimaced , as if what he had said offended him .

`` they 're beautiful .

thank you . ''

`` bye-bye kiss , mommy ! ''

mason called from the living room .

she smiled apologetically at pesh .

`` i 'm sorry .

i 'll just be one minute . ''

`` take your time . ''

she hurried across the foyer and into the living room .

she deposited the roses onto one of the tables .

`` i 'll be back tonight .

you be a good boy , okay ? ''

she said , when she got to her father 's chair .

she leaned over and kissed both of mason 's cheeks .

`` give mommy a kiss . ''

he gave her a smacking kiss on the cheek .

`` bye , my love , '' megan said , before turning and heading out of the room .

she 'd just reached pesh 's side when he glanced past her .

`` what ? ''

she asked .

`` i think we have a potential stowaway , '' he replied , with a smile .

she whirled around to see mason standing in the foyer .

`` what 's wrong , baby ? ''

`` no go , '' he whimpered .

she glanced up at pesh .

`` i 'm sorry .

he usually is fine about me leaving him . ''

she knelt down beside mason .

`` i wo n't be gone long , and you 'll have much more fun here with grammy and granddad .

pesh and i are doing boring , big people stuff . ''

`` no go ! ''

he cried , as big tears pooled in his eyes .

pesh knelt down beside her .

`` hey buddy , do n't cry .

i 'm not going to take your mommy away from you . ''

`` mace go ? ''

he asked hopefully .

megan shook her head .

`` no , sweetheart , i told you that we were going to do big people things today . ''

`` that 's true , '' pesh said .

then he smiled at mason .

`` but that does n't mean we ca n't take a little detour first . ''

megan 's widened her eyes in surprise .

`` what do you mean ? ''

`` why do n't we take mason to lunch at his favorite place ? ''

`` you do n't mean that , '' megan argued .

pesh cut his gaze over to her .

`` sure , i do .

i can adjust our reservations . ''

she could n't help staring at him in shock .

how was it possible he was so willing to change his plans simply because mason did n't want her to leave ?

she fought the urge to reach out and touch his shoulder to make sure he was real-he was far too good to be true at times .

`` is that okay with you ? ''

pesh asked her .

`` of course it 's all right with me .

i was worried about it not being okay with you . ''

`` i would n't have suggested it if i did n't mean it . ''

he reached out and ruffled mason 's hair .

`` all right , buddy , where do you want to go for lunch ? ''

`` cheese !

cheese ! ''

he cried , as he bobbed up and down .

megan groaned as pesh 's expression grew confused .

`` he wants to eat cheese ? ''

he asked .

`` no , he wants to go to chuck e. cheese-every parent 's worst nightmare . ''

pesh chuckled as he rose up from the floor .
