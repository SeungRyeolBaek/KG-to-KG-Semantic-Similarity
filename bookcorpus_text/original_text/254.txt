five ... i count down in my head .

four ... three ...

i feel a hand on the small of my back and spin around sharply to find emerson standing before me .

and of course , he looks utterly fantastic .

a gray blazer , light slacks , and trendy suede loafers have him looking right at home in this neighborhood .

and he 's lost the glasses , too-the better for me to ogle his twenty-five-year-old-or rather , twenty-six-year-old face .

`` you showed up , '' he grins , his eyes gleaming as he gives me a subtle once over .

`` yeah , well , '' i shrug , burning up under his gaze .

`` i ca n't resist a martini , so . ''

`` hey , i 'll take it , '' he replies .

`` come on .

the bar 's right over here . ''

i clutch onto my tiny black purse as emerson leads us over to an unremarkable doorway embedded in the busy line of shops .

he raps the door three times quickly , then twice at a slower pace .

i cock an eyebrow at his antics , but before i can say anything , the door swings open for us .

`` it 's sort of a speakeasy type place , '' he explains , nodding for me to follow him .

`` just a little bit exclusive . ''

and he 's not kidding , either .

as i step into the dimly lit bar after him , i feel my jaw drop .

the place is elegant , impeccable , and super swanky .

i almost laugh , remembering the little seafood shack we went to on his eighteenth birthday .

how far we 've come !

there are only a dozen or so people in here , all of them looking perfect .

this must be some elite , secret spot , known only to the rich and famous .

wait a minute ... is emerson rich and famous now himself ?

`` this is my favorite table , '' he tells me , sinking into a plush corner booth .

`` you have a favorite table here ? ''

i breathe , sinking down beside him .

`` sure , '' he grins , `` and a favorite drink too . ''

i gape as a martini appears on the table before emerson .

he winks at the server , who clearly knows emerson 's usual order .

the server , dressed in a finer suit than any of the men i 've dated , asks me for my order .

`` i 'll ... have what he 's having , '' i say faintly .

the man nods and hurries off to fix a drink for me .

i look around at the exquisite room , the beautiful patrons , and the specter from my past sitting across the table from me .

`` ok , '' i say at last , `` this , my friend , is officially bizarre . ''

`` i guess it sort of is , '' emerson laughs , more than happy to acknowledge the strangeness of our reunion .

`` but , what good thing in life is n't a little surreal ?

i say we run with it . ''

a perfect martini materializes before me .

i thank the server , pluck up the cocktail , and hold up my glass in a toast .

`` well , happy birthday , emerson , '' i say , `` i hope you enjoy your one night of being older than me as much as you did when we were kids . ''

`` oh , i think i will , '' he smiles , clinking his glass to mine .

i take a sip of my drink and freeze , savoring the mind-blowing deliciousness of it .

this is top-shelf vodka .

the kind that ought to be kept in a safe .

a drink like this must cost a fortune .

and this is emerson 's usual ?

`` so , i guess the past eight years have treated you well ? ''

i ask , stunned by the fineness of the liquor .

`` i 've done ok for myself , '' emerson nods .

`` well , since there 's no elegant segue to be found here , start from the beginning , '' i tell him , `` how 's your life been , tank ? ''

`` oof , '' he cringes , `` using my old lacrosse nickname ?

harsh . ''

`` yeah , well .

old age has hardened me , '' i say , trying to keep a straight face .

`` now spill ! ''

`` ok , ok , '' emerson says , taking a sip of his drink .

`` well , when we last saw each other , shit was going down in flames .

mom had just relapsed , obviously , and i had just ... well ... '' `` kicked the shit out of grade-a douchebag and gotten expelled , '' i finish his thought .

`` that would be correct , '' emerson nods .

`` mom and i picked up and left .

we landed at her sister 's place in pennsylvania for a minute .

we got mom into rehab , and i found a little apartment outside of philly .

nice town , you know .

i did n't do much for the next year except visit my mom , take odd jobs to pay rent , and tool around on the computer .

i do n't think you knew this about me in high school , but i 've always been kind of a tech nerd .

i became fascinated with programming , data , building things that other people could use .
