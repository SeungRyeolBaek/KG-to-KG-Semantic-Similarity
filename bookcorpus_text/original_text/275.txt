i was afraid things might be ... difficult . ''

`` so you know each other from when you were kids , '' cooper replies , `` why would that mean you had to turn down the job ? ''

`` we did n't just know each other , '' emerson cuts in , `` we were ... our parents were together , for a while .

they were even married , for a very short time . ''

cooper 's eyes cloud over as he looks back and forth between us .

`` but the talk in the office has been ... and you showed up here together this morning ... '' he blusters , looking more disturbed by the second , `` i was under the impression that there was some sort of romantic relationship happening between you ? ''

for once , even emerson is silent as we stare at cooper .

our boss shakes his head , unable or unwilling to put the pieces together .

`` but you ca n't be seeing each other , then .

not if your parents- '' `` it 's complicated , '' i say quietly , my fingernails digging into my palms .

`` that 's not the word i would have used , '' cooper scoffs .

`` hey , '' emerson jumps in , `` you do n't have all the details , cooper . ''

`` and believe me , i do n't want them , '' our boss says quickly , shoving a hand through his hair .

`` what i want is for you two to tell me what the hell i 'm supposed to do , here ? ''

`` what do you mean ? ''

emerson says , his jaw tensing angrily .

`` i mean , i have a new employee who ca n't seem to show up for work , a senior employee who 's more interested in carrying on some perverted relationship with his stepsister than pulling his weight , and an office full of people who ca n't talk about anything but the two of you ! ''

cooper rants furiously .

`` emerson ! ''

i cry out , as he lunges to his feet and towers over cooper 's desk .

in an instant , it 's like he 's eighteen again , facing off against his tormentors .

his entire body is alive with powerful rage , and i 'm truly afraid of what he might do next .

`` do n't you dare presume to judge me , '' emerson growls .

i watch as cooper 's eyes bug out of his head in alarm .

`` get out of my face , sawyer ! ''

our boss cries , shrinking back into his chair .

`` you do n't know the first thing about my life , '' emerson rages on , shaking , `` abby is the best thing that 's ever happened to me , and i 'm not going to let you shit on what we have . ''

`` fine ! ''

cooper shoots back , `` you two go off and live in whatever kind of sin you prefer , just do n't do it under my nose ! ''

`` are you trying to fire me , cooper ? ''

emerson growls .

`` i ca n't fire you .

you 're under contract .

and all of the partners need to agree before terminating someone , '' cooper says , exasperated .

`` but i 'd strongly suggest that you consider- '' `` i quit , '' emerson cuts him off , pushing roughly away from the desk .

`` great , '' cooper shouts , `` good idea , sawyer .

just walk away from the agency because you 're caught up on a piece of ass . ''

my vision flashes bright white as my boss 's words sink in .

before emerson can launch himself across the desk at cooper , i leap to my feet and block his path .

i stare down at cooper , the corners of my vision blurring with rage .

`` i am not some piece of ass , '' i say , my voice clear and strong , `` i was almost the best graphic designer you ever had .

but you blew it .

if emerson goes , i go too . ''

`` fine , '' cooper seethes , looking back and forth between us , `` just get out before i call security on both your asses . ''

`` no problem , '' emerson says , grabbing my hand .

we storm out the door together , our shoulders squared .

`` good luck , you two , '' cooper calls sarcastically after us as we march across the community work space .

`` enjoy your incestuous little cabal while you can . ''

our coworkers rubberneck to get a better view of us as we pass , but one withering look from emerson and they all pry their eyes away .

we charge down the stairs and back out into the light of day .

just a few days ago , i was walking into this office and landing my dream job .

emerson was one of the most important people in this agency .

and now here we are , out on our asses .

and all because we tried to make a go of being together .

`` well , '' emerson says through gritted teeth , `` guess i was wrong about oversleeping not being a big deal , huh ? ''

i open my mouth to answer , but the ringing of my cell phone interrupts me .

i snatch the device out of my purse and see that riley is calling .

after her dozens of texts and calls over the course of last night , i figure i 'd better at least answer once .
