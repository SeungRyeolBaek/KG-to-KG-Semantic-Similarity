truth be told , she looks even younger than her biological age .

her voluminous platinum blonde hair is always arranged in luscious curls , her makeup applied perfectly .

this stands to reason , given that she works as a freelance makeup artist , mostly doing weddings and the like .

she 's way taller than i am , especially given her penchant for wearing three-inch heels .

and , i have to admit , the lady 's got a killer rack .

between the tits and her habit of wearing loud neon colors , it 's no wonder that my dad took notice of her .

my question is , what does she see in him ?

i would n't say that my father is unattractive .

he 's just very ... unremarkable .

he was quite the looker as a younger man , but my mom sandy was the real beauty .

their wedding pictures look like something out of a movie .

i inherited my mom 's facial features , but missed out on her vibrant red hair and hourglass curves .

ca n't pick and choose what you inherit from your parents , i guess .

and you certainly do n't get to choose who your parents are in the first place .

`` it 's been ages since we 've had a good talk , '' deb gushes , plunking me down at the kitchen table .

`` tell me everything .

how 's school ?

any boyfriends ?

spill , girl ! ''

i glance over at my father , silently begging him not to make me engage in small talk with his girlfriend .

but he just grins at the two of us like we 're some big , happy family .

as grating as deb can be , i have n't seen my dad smile like this in years .

it 's the least i can do to muscle through some mindless chatter .

`` well , '' i begin , `` i dunno ... '' the sound of the front door opening is my saving grace .

i look over my shoulder and see emerson stride across the threshold , making a beeline for his room .

but deborah has other plans , and rushes out to greet him with a squeal .

`` not so fast ! ''

she cries , seizing her son by the arm .

`` it 's not every day that i can manage to snag you and abby for a chat .

come on !

we 're having family time ! ''

`` are you high or something ? ''

emerson grumbles .

i can tell by his inflection that it 's an honest question .

i wonder what it must have been like for him , growing up with a single mom who had substance abuse issues .

my dad 's drinking did n't get bad until mom passed away , and by then i was already fourteen .

but from what i understand , deb 's drinking has been going on for most of emerson 's life .

my heart twists painfully just thinking about what a rough go he must have had .

no wonder he 's got more defense strategies than the pentagon .

`` this is so wonderful , '' deb goes on , forcing emerson into a chair across the table from me .

we immediately avert our eyes , looking anywhere but at each other .

the uncomfortable silence between us is deafening in this enclosed space .

what i would n't give for a trap door or an ejection seat right now .

`` while we 've got you both here , '' my dad finally cuts in , wrapping an arm around deb 's waist .

`` we should talk about your birthdays this weekend . ''

`` birthdays ? ''

emerson asks , his brow furrowing .

`` as in plural ? ''

i add , looking up at my dad .

`` sure !

have n't you guys figured it out yet ? ''

dad laughs , `` your birthdays are only one day apart !

abby 's is may 4th , and emerson 's is may 3rd . ''

a satisfied grin spreads across emerson 's face as he leans back in his chair .

for the first time since that night at the party , he swings his gaze directly my way .

`` look at that , '' he says , keeping those blue eyes locked on mine .

`` i am your big brother after all . ''

`` oh , that 's so precious ! ''

deb swoons .

`` i 'm so glad you two are feeling more like family .

that makes me so , so happy .

what should we do to celebrate your eighteenth birthdays ?

bowling ?

the movies ? ''

`` i was gon na buy a shit load of porn , cigarettes , and scratch off lottery tickets and have myself a private party , '' emerson says bluntly .

`` you all are more than welcome to join in .

though things might get a little ... awkward . ''

i tear my eyes away from his at this last bit , feeling my cheeks burning hotly .

he 's baiting me .

i can tell .

`` honestly , emerson , '' deb says , her cheerful veneer cracking , `` do you have to shit all over every nice thing i try to do for you ? ''

`` do n't worry , deb .

he was just kidding , '' my dad coos , planting a kiss on his girlfriend 's forehead .

`` were n't you , emerson ? ''

`` whatever helps you sleep at night , sport , '' emerson replies shortly , slapping his palms against the table .

`` now , as fun as this has been , i 've got things to do . ''
