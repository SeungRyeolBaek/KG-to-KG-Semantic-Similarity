`` put your tongue in my mouth , '' he said .

`` do as i do . ''

his mouth came back to hers and she needed no prompting this time to open to him .

and when his tongue touched hers , she tentatively moved her tongue back , imitating his movements and the feelings that had been building only intensified as she learned to participate in the kiss and not just accept it .

absently , she felt his hands on her back but they did n't move even though her body was clamoring for him to touch hers .

she moved her hands from his shoulders , nervously touching his neck , desperate to touch his skin in some way .

when her fingertips touched his skin , she felt the heat of his body and they skittered away after just the simple touch , afraid he might get angry if she went any further .

she heard his chuckle deep in his throat and pulled back , her eyes questioning and worried that he 'd felt her touch and was laughing at her .

`` i 'm sorry , '' she said , wanting to move off his lap in embarrassment .

but he stopped her movement and rested his hands on the sides of her hips .

`` victoria , please touch me anywhere you 'd like , '' he said and pulled her right hand so it was touching his neck , her fingers tickling his hair .

she immediately pulled her hand away but he just laughed again and put it right back against his neck .

`` if you do n't touch me , victoria , i 'm going to die , '' he said and pulled her back against his body .

`` and believe me , i 'm going to touch you , '' he said a moment before his mouth bent to kiss her again .

but his hands did n't move anywhere other than her hips and waist while her hands felt free to explore his skin , his hair , touching him anywhere she could find his skin and reveled in the amazing feeling of him .

he was like rough velvet , if that was a possible description .

and his hair was soft and light to her touch .

she loved his hair , feeling so different from hers .

dharr enjoyed the painful feeling of wanting victoria , knowing he could do nothing about it .

if anything showed him that she really was a virgin , it was her tentative touching and inexperience with kissing .

finally he ended the kiss and pulled back , smiling down at her .

`` where are we going ? ''

he asked .

victoria sat up straight and looked out the windows , noting the buildings of london as they passed by .

`` where are we going ? ''

`` my driver has just been driving around aimlessly , waiting for direction from me .

or more specifically , you . ''

victoria slid off his lap , grateful that he did n't stop her this time .

`` you mean he ... .dharr please tell me he is n't suspecting that we 're back here kissing ! ''

she exclaimed , her hands covering her mouth and her face turning the becoming shade of red he was coming to expect now .

dharr did n't think she 'd appreciate the fact that his driver and the guards that were in the front seat , not to mention the ones that were following in the suv behind him , would assume that he was doing much more than kissing .

`` they are busy watching the road , i 'm sure , '' he replied .

that made her feel better .

`` well , in that case , can you ask them to drive us over to the park by the thames ?

there 's a nice little spot where i can ask you all sorts of questions without being interrupted . ''

dharr picked up the phone and spoke in a foreign language , then just as quickly hung up again .

when he was done , he turned back to her expectantly .

`` how were your exams today ? ''

he asked .

she was flattered that he remembered her telling him about her exams .

`` fine , i think .

i wo n't know for another week . ''

`` what happens in a week ? ''

`` i get my grades , '' she laughed .

`` ah .

my mistake .

i 'm sure you did well on them , '' he said .

`` i feel pretty good about them .

i think i 'll do okay . ''

she looked at him tentatively .

`` where did you go to university ? ''

`` oxford , '' he replied without hesitation .

victoria was impressed .

and since he 'd answered that one so quickly , she felt brave enough to ask more questions .

`` what do you do for a living ? ''

`` various things , '' he said honestly .

well that was a non-answer if she 'd ever heard one .

she smiled , hoping he would elaborate .

`` such as ? ''

dharr hesitated .

he was still enjoying the anonymity of her not knowing about his title or power .

he considered all the things he could tell her and settled on the least revealing without lying to her .

`` i 'm currently in london negotiating oil contracts . ''

`` ah !

that explains a lot . ''

`` what does it explain ? ''

`` your ... aura of power , '' she said .

`` i know that sounds silly but you just have a sense about you .

like you 're used to being in charge . ''
