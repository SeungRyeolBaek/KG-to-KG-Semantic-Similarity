i grab the sweating bottle of water from between my feet and take a long swig .

`` water ? ''

i ask nate , turning to offer it to him .

he takes it , brushing my fingers with his as he wraps his long fingers around it .

my insides clench ... speaking of a spark .

i spot a house very much like ours up on a hillside in the distance .

`` where 'd you live before the house now ? ''

`` townhouse in georgetown . ''

he says .

`` it was less of a behemoth .

had more character . ''

`` the mansion is n't your taste ? ''

`` it was always big for two people , and it still seems big , even for four .

but what i really do n't like is that it 's got all these fake historical touches about it , and none of them are genuine . ''

`` anathema to a history major . ''

`` exactly .

i always pictured myself in a smaller house , maybe a converted barn or something ... one that was actually built in the time period it looks like it was built in .

maybe somewhere quieter than dc ... it 's pretty elitist here ... i want my kids to grow up more modestly than i did . ''

`` you want kids ? ''

i ask , surprised .

`` you do n't ? ''

`` no , i do ... i 'm just surprised .

you know that having kids might necessitate being in a relationship with a woman for longer than you 're used to . ''

he laughs .

`` i honestly had n't thought of that .

i always just pictured myself with kids .

is that horrible ? ''

`` yes ! ''

i reply , quickly reaching down and flinging water back at him .

`` hey ! ''

he cries , and grabs the sides of the kayak , beginning to rock it back and forth .

`` i 'll tip this thing over , '' he warns me with a grin .

`` nate ! ''

i protest , grabbing on .

he relents , and keeps rowing after a moment .

`` i think your mom picked the hottest day of the year , '' he observes .

`` want to head back ? ''

i ask , hoping he 'll say no .

he pauses .

`` guess we should . ''

i nod , feeling disappointed , and dip my oar in the water to help him turn the kayak .

now that we 're going with the current , it takes us much less time to make the return trip back to the boat house .

`` how 's your shoulder ? ''

i ask .

`` it 's better , actually , '' he says happily , `` thanks for asking . ''

i feel a tightening in my throat as we pull into the shallower water .

nate steps onto the dock first , then offers me his hand to help me get out of the unsteady boat .

`` much shadier under the trees , '' he observes , nodding to a hiking trail that cuts through the trees behind the boat house .

i look at him questioningly .

`` short hike before we go back ? ''

i nod and smile , trying not to look too pleased .

chapter nineteen `` you 've got good stamina for someone who does n't do sports , '' nate observes as our `` short hike '' goes into its second hour .

`` i 've been swimming in the pool pretty frequently , maybe that 's it , '' i reply , though really i think it 's that the conversation has n't stopped .

we 're high over the potomac now , on a dirt trail that winds around large boulders .

he was right-it is cooler under the trees , but it 's still just as humid .

`` is that it ? ''

i ask , pointing to a three-leaved plant at the base of a tree .

after telling nate that i manage to get poison ivy every other year , he 's made it his mission to teach me how to identify the rash-causing the plant .

`` not red enough .

by this time of the summer , it 'll be more red and oily-looking .

and the edges of the leaves are too jagged , '' he says as he bends over to look at it .

a pair of female hikers approach us on the trail , headed the opposite direction .

i watch them drink in nate 's shirtless , sweaty appearance and giggle to each other .

as they pass , they smile flirtatiously at him , but he just politely smiles back before turning to me .

`` you 're good at so many things , but identifying plant species ... '' he intones in a mock-serious voice as he shakes his head .

`` hey , if that 's my weakness , i 'll take it , '' i reply with a grin .

`` yep , poison ivy , that 's your kryptonite , '' he teases me .

`` what 's yours ?

intimacy ? ''

`` intimacy ?

how dare you !

it 's commitment .

very different . ''

`` oh , duh , of course .

my apologies , '' i reply , glad we can joke about this kind of thing .

`` wait , there ! ''

i say , pointing to an ivy crawling up a tree trunk on the river side of the trail .

`` where ?

i do n't see it , '' nate replies , craning his neck .

`` there ! ''

i repeat , walking off the trail and into the underbrush .
