`` nope , '' emerson replies , `` but thanks for calling me gorgeous . ''

`` like you do n't know , '' i shoot back , `` so then , just the one girlfriend for you ? ''

`` i 'm afraid not , '' he says .

`` fiancee ? ''

i ask , with mounting dread , `` wife ? ''

`` well , there is roxie ... '' he says , `` she 's very important to me . ''

`` roxie ? ''

i ask , `` you 're with a woman named roxie ?

who the hell- ? ''

`` she 's my west highland terrier , '' he cuts me off with a smirk .

`` but good to see you 're still protective of me , ab . ''

`` i 'm not-i just- '' i sputter , `` i 'm just curious , is all . ''

`` that makes two of us , '' he replies , `` i 'm expecting a report on your love life , too . ''

`` or lack thereof , you mean ? ''

i ask drily .

`` i just finished grad school .

that means my most significant romantic relationship at the moment is with my pizza delivery man . ''

`` who is he ?

i 'll throttle him , '' emerson says , raising his fists like a cartoon leprechaun .

but the memory of the beat down he gave tucker all those years ago is too fresh for that particular joke to be funny .

for the first time these evening , the silence between us grows tense .

despite our relatively breezy reunion so far , there 's a lot of ugly , buried emotions hanging between us .

i 've spent a good part of the last eight years being furious with emerson for disappearing on me when i needed him .

i 've been hurt , angry , and more than anything , just terribly sad to have lost him .

all that feeling ca n't just evaporate because he 's resurfaced with a shit ton of money and nicer biceps than ever before .

`` tell me what you 're thinking , '' he says with quiet firmness , leaning toward me .

`` honestly ? ''

i reply , `` i 'm thinking about all the imaginary fights i 've had with you these past few years .

all the things i 'd dream of saying to you , if we ever ran into each other again . ''

`` like what ? ''

he asks intently .

`` you do n't want me to tell you , '' i mutter , `` your eyebrows might get singed off . ''

`` that bad , huh ? ''

he asks .

`` that bad , '' i assure him .

`` well , i had plenty of imaginary conversations with you , too , '' he tells me , moving closer by just an inch .

`` want to know how most of them went ? ''

`` i 'm not sure- '' `` usually , they revolved around me apologizing for vanishing into thin air on you , '' he cuts me off , `` and for leaving you to deal with the fallout on your own .

and hey , now that you 're actually sitting here with me , i can tell you-i 'm sorry . ''

`` i do n't think sorry can begin to fix it , '' i whisper , staring down at my drink .

`` you left , emerson .

left me alone in that house , with my dad , after the way he treated us .

he could have hurt me , if riley had n't shown up to get me .

did you even care ? ''

`` of course i cared , '' he said fiercely , `` but try to imagine being me in that moment .

having my mother bring the whole family crashing down all on her own ... it was humiliating .

i felt like absolute scum for being my parents ' kid .

i could n't even look at you , i was so ashamed of who i was .

and so furious that i could n't do anything to help or protect you . ''

`` is that why you nearly killed tucker ? ''

i ask softly .

`` i guess it is , '' emerson allows , shaking his head , `` i was n't really thinking about it much at the time .

to be honest , abby , i do n't lose much sleep over what i did to him .

in my mind , that 's what he had coming from the moment he ... anyway .

i had to disappear , ab .

i could n't stand the idea of you being as ashamed of me as i was . ''

`` i was never ashamed of you , '' i burst out , `` never once , emerson .

that was just some crazy idea you cooked up in your own damn mind .

i never gave a shit about our families ' money and standing .

you know that .

or at least you should have known . ''

`` you 're right , '' emerson murmurs , reaching for my hand , `` i should have .

and for that , again , i am truly sorry .

but do n't you think for a second that i would n't have come running back if you 'd ever needed me . ''

`` how would you have known if i did ? ''

i ask , exasperated .

`` i followed you , '' he says , `` online , i mean .

your social media presence was pretty remarkably unprotected when you were younger .
