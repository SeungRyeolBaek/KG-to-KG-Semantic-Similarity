`` yes , that 's right .

thank you so very much for bringing up that aspect of our break-up on today of all days . ''

casey gripped noah 's ankles and hoisted up his little butt to slide on the new diaper .

`` you 're welcome . ''

`` anyway , as you were saying , '' megan pressed .

`` right .

so it was when aidan and i were broken up that i met pesh .

i was with your papa fitzgerald the day of his heart attack at the vfw , and pesh was the doctor who treated him . ''

`` so ... you both struck up a friendship then ? ''

megan asked .

emma grimaced .

`` not exactly .

you see , patrick wanted to force aidan to really fight for me , and he felt the best way to do it would be for him to have some competition . ''

megan felt her eyes widening in surprise .

`` papa wanted pesh to date you ? ''

`` yeah . ''

`` did you ? ''

emma was momentarily distracted by casey blowing raspberries on noah 's stomach .

a smile spread across her face as noah kicked his legs and giggled at casey .

`` want me to get him in his dress ? ''

casey asked , as she glanced up .

`` if you do n't mind . ''

bringing her hand to her hip , megan huffed out an exasperated breath .

`` um , could you please focus for just a minute considering the bomb you just dropped on me ? ''

`` i 'm sorry .

i did n't want to tell you at all .

i mean , whatever was between us is all in the past .

neither one of us really cared for each other like we thought we did . ''

`` did you ... '' megan said .

at emma 's confused expression , she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively .

emma 's face flushed .

`` no , of course not ! ''

casey eyed emma as she took the baptism gown off the hanger .

`` you did make out with him though . ''

`` one time .

and he certainly did n't get to second base , '' emma argued .

with a wicked grin , casey added , `` pity .

wish you could inform us on what he has going on below the waist . ''

emma rolled her eyes .

`` you 're impossible . ''

she snatched the gown away from casey and then started wrestling noah into the yards of fabric .

`` it was n't like we were in a relationship .

we did n't really even go out together .

he came to the house once to bring me dinner and check on me when i was on bed rest , and then he took me to the opera .

that was it . ''

`` was there no chemistry between you two ? ''

megan asked .

without responding , emma pulled noah up into a sitting position and started fastening the row of buttons down the back of the gown .

`` em ? ''

megan pressed .

she gave a heavy sigh before picking noah up .

she stared into his face before she responded .

`` we had great chemistry together .

he was an amazing kisser who got all my senses up and running in all the right ways .

besides the physical part , he is smart , kind , and intelligent-any woman 's dream . ''

she shook her head .

`` but it did n't matter because he was n't aidan .

i could never , ever love another man like i do him . ''

giving noah a kiss on the cheek , she added , `` neither one of us were really in a good place-i was trying to make sure that aidan really was the one , and after being pressured by family and friends , he was trying to date for the first time after his wife 's death . ''

megan crossed her arms over her chest .

`` i get that he does n't need to be hurt , but who is to say that having a fling is going to hurt him ?

maybe it could give him the confidence he needs to go out and find the real woman of his dreams ? ''

casey snorted .

`` how could a man that looks like that have any self-confidence issues ? ''

megan shrugged .

`` you never know .

if he was married a long time before his wife died , he might find it hard to get back into the dating world .

especially if the last woman he cared about loved someone else . ''

emma shook her head .

`` trust me , he is n't the fling kind of guy .

he wants a wife and children . ''

although megan had a son , she was n't quite ready for marriage .

maybe in a few years but right now she just wanted to date and have fun .

she 'd willingly sacrificed so much to ensure that mason could have all of her attention since he was short a father .

after all , he was the greatest hurdle in her having a committed relationship .

she did n't want to open her son up to any hurt that might come from him getting attached to a man she dated only to have them disappear when they broke up .

`` ankle really wants to fix us up ? ''

megan questioned .

emma nodded .

`` regardless of what happened with pesh when we were broken up , aidan does respect and admire him .

he wants pesh to be happy . ''
