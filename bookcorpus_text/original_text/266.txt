of the dozen or so other employees , no one else seems to be around .

`` hello ? ''

i call , glancing around in search of my coworkers .

i check my phone and see that it is , indeed , 10 a.m .

the start of the workday .

what gives ?

for something to do , i head on over to the well-stocked bar and snack cart , where a fancy , gleaming espresso machine stands at the ready .

as i set to work crafting myself an excellent cup of coffee , i hear footsteps behind me .

spinning around , i find myself face-to-face with the man i 've been thinking of incessantly for the past two days .

`` oh abby , you should n't have ! ''

emerson teases , eyeing my espresso , `` it 's not your job to make me coffee in the morning . ''

`` how convenient ! ''

i chirp , playing along with his bit as i grab my mug , `` because this sucker is all mine . ''

`` i 'll just have to join you , then , '' emerson smiles , stepping around me to get at the espresso machine .

`` unless we 're still doing that not-talking thing that i hate so much . ''

`` not at all , '' i reply , my heart thumping wildly in my chest .

and not from the caffeine , either .

`` provided that you do n't hate me after saturday night . ''

`` please , '' emerson laughs , `` i 've long since stopped caring about what people think of me , abby .

and i certainly do n't make a habit of holding peoples ' families against them .

i 'm sorry that i said those shitty things about your grandparents .

it 's not my place to judge them , even if they have no problem at all judging me . ''

`` man .

how 's the weather up there on the high road ? ''

i laugh , sipping my coffee .

`` what can i say ?

that charming temper of mine is n't quite as hot as it was eight years ago , '' he replies , picking up his own mug of joe .

`` turns out that punching people is frowned upon in the tech industry .

who knew ?

so , what do you say ?

are we all right ? ''

`` we 're all right , '' i smile back .

`` i see you like your present , '' he observes , looking down at my right hand .

`` oh yeah , '' i reply , admiring the silver ring once again .

thank god i remembered to put it back on the right hand , rather than the left .

`` it 's beautiful , emerson . ''

`` i 'm glad you still think so , after all this time , '' he says , `` still the same old abby , huh ? ''

`` more or less , '' i shrug , `` though i seem to be more obnoxiously punctual these days .

where is everyone ? ''

`` oh , cooper does n't usually roll in until noon or so , and the rest of the office has taken to his schedule , '' emerson tells me .

`` jeez , '' i say , `` just when i was thinking this job could n't get any better ... '' `` it 's a pretty sweet gig , '' emerson agrees , `` we work hard , but on our own terms .

i 've never been happier with any other company i 've worked for .

i figured i 'd get here early to meet you today , show you the ropes before everyone gets here .

ready to start , protege ? ''

`` all set , '' i say , draining the rest of my coffee , `` teach me your ways , o ' wise one . ''

the rest of the day unfolds before us as emerson walks me through all the ins and outs of the agency .

my job will mostly consist of brainstorming new ideas for marketing and branding before passing them along to different clients .

i 'll get to execute my ideas using bastian 's top-of-the-line design suite , too .

i never thought that i 'd get to have a job that i actually like , especially not this early on in my career .

between the new gig at bastian and emerson happening back into my life , 26 is shaping up to be a fine year , indeed ... that is , as long as i do n't think of the whole grandparents-disowning-me-thing .

emerson and i are sitting together at one end of the communal desk as our coworkers begin to arrive a couple hours later .

everyone greets me in a cordial , if not chipper , way .

but hey , we 're all millennials , that 's how we roll .

i 'd rather they be real with me than overly enthusiastic .

i recognize a few people-bradley , tyler , and emily-from the other night at the bar .

they all smile politely at me as they settle down to work , but i can feel their eyes darting back and forth between emerson and me .

i 'm sure they 're wondering what we were doing at the bar together , what the nature of our relationship is , all that .

i almost laugh , thinking about how i 'd explain our relationship these days : `` oh , you know , we were step-siblings for a day , slept together once , have n't seen each other in ten years , but yeah-it 's totally chill ! ''
