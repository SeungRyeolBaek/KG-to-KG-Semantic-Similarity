`` ri , it 's really not a good time , '' i say into the phone , turning away from emerson .

`` yeah , tell me something i do n't know , '' she replies , sounding panicked .

`` where the hell are you , abby ? ''

`` i 'm at work , '' i tell her , `` or ... the place that was work for a second , at least .

what 's going on , riley ?

are you ok ? ''

`` i 've been trying to call you all night , '' she hurries on , `` abby , there were some papers delivered to the apartment last night from your grandparents ' lawyer .

they 're kicking us out of the apartment , effective immediately . ''

`` what ? ''

i ask , nearly voiceless with shock .

this ca n't be happening .

not right now .

`` apparently they were n't kidding when they said you had to choose between them and emerson , '' she goes on , `` they had n't heard from you , so they 're kicking us out .

unless you assure them that emerson wo n't be a part of your life , that is . ''

i 'm silent for a long moment , just watching as the other people on the sidewalk pass me by .

then , for lack of a rational response , i start to laugh .

wildly .

emerson looks at me as if i 've sprouted a second head , but his confusion only sets me off further .

this ca n't all be happening to me .

and yet , here it all is , landing in my lap in a heap .

`` have you totally lost it ? ''

riley asks me over the phone .

`` it 's possible , '' i cackle , gripping my sides , `` it 's very possible . ''

i should have known better than to feel sunny about my twenty-sixth year .

in a matter of hours , i 've managed to lose my new job , my apartment , and the only family i have left .

every stable thing i 've muscled into place has disappeared .

`` abby ? ''

emerson says , as i let the phone drop from my ear .

`` why do n't we head home now and talk all this out ? ''

`` home , '' i repeat , my voice going hollow on me , `` i do n't think i have one of those anymore , emerson . ''

`` what ? ''

he asks , his brow furrowing .

`` i 've been evicted .

by my grandparents , '' i tell him , wondering at the statement even as it leaves my lips .

`` i do n't understand .

why would they do something like that ? ''

he asks , outraged on my behalf .

`` you 're their granddaughter . ''

`` cooper is n't the only one who disapproves of us being together , '' i reply , `` my grandparents forbid me from seeing you after the other night .

they said i could either be a part of their lives , or a part of yours . ''

i watch the news sink into emerson 's mind .

his outrage softens as he understands what i 've sacrificed for him .

and why losing my job now is such a huge deal .

`` well .

you can borrow my home , then , '' he says , the hardness draining from his voice as he drapes an arm over my shoulder .

`` everything 's going to be ok. '' i let him guide me back through the lower east side .

i feel shell-shocked , blindsided .

like every bit of context organizing my life has fallen away all at once .

or at least , every bit of context besides emerson himself .

for now , just having him by my side is enough .

we can figure out the rest along the way .

chapter seventeen after i 've made sure that riley is n't going to be left out in the cold tonight , i settle in for a long , befuddled evening at emerson 's place .

the hours creep past as i try to process everything that 's happened , and what i 'm supposed to do now .

emerson and i are both out of a job , i 'm out of a home , and he 's bound for europe at the end of the week .

so much for that bright , shiny future i 'd been so optimistic about .

emerson spends about an hour on the phone with cooper and the other bastian partners when we get back to his loft .

they argue incessantly , trying to hammer out a truce .

no one at that company wants to see emerson leave , least of all emerson .

but with everything that went down between him and cooper this afternoon , i do n't see what other choice there is .

for my part , i spend the better part of the afternoon absentmindedly patting roxie 's head and trying to work up the nerve to call my grandparents .

surely , they 're just bluffing .

they do n't actually expect me to bend to their will and never see emerson again .

or do they ?

`` well , '' emerson sighs , emerging from his bedroom having hung up on the hour long conference call .

`` they 've backed off the whole firing-me front .

now it 's just a matter of whether or not i want to back off the i-quit front . ''

`` so ? ''

i ask , as he sits down beside me , `` what do you think you 're going to do ? ''
