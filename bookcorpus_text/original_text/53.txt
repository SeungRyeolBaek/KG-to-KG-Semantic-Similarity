`` very good , ma'am , '' the waiter replied .

`` i 'll have the same , '' pesh said , handing the waiter his menu .

when megan grinned at him , his brows rose .

`` what ? ''

`` i 'm just surprised to hear you eating something so southern as shrimp and grits . ''

he tsked at her .

`` when will you learn that you can never pigeonhole me as one thing or the other ? ''

she laughed .

`` actually , i like that you 're proving me wrong and being unexpected . ''

`` really ? ''

she nodded .

`` sometimes i feel like people try to do the same thing to me .

people have their own assumptions about girls or women who get knocked up .

i hope i constantly prove them wrong . ''

`` i 'm sure you do . ''

after taking a sip of his wine , he cocked his head at her .

`` prove me wrong on this one .

does a southern girl like you eat indian food ? ''

`` oh yes , i love it . ''

his dark eyes lit up .

`` what 's your favorite dish ? ''

`` hmm , i love butter chicken , but i 'm also a fan of pav bahaji . ''

`` i 'm impressed .

emma had never eaten any indian food , and i do n't think i made a good impression on her . ''

pesh 's chuckle died out , and he immediately grimaced at the mention of emma 's name .

knowing that they were dancing around the white elephant in the room , megan reached across the table and patted his hand .

`` it 's okay that you 're talking about emma . ''

`` speaking of old girlfriends or women you 've dated while you 're with another woman is never a good idea . ''

`` this is different .

emma is my family . ''

she swirled the wine around in her glass .

`` i 've heard her side of the story , but i do n't think i 've heard yours . ''

`` you heard a little when you were inebriated the night of noah 's baptism . ''

now it was megan 's turn to grimace .

`` i still would like to know . ''

pesh drew in a ragged breath .

when the waiter appeared with their salads , it appeared that he might dodge the question entirely .

but once they were alone together , he smiled .

`` emma came along at a time when i was facing extreme pressure from family and friends to move on from my grief and date again .

there was no escape to it-i faced it at the hospital , as well as when i was at home .

people seemed to think that once a year went by on the calendar that meant i was through with my mourning .

then one day , there she was in the er .

she was scared out of her mind about your grandfather .

somehow i just connected with her through her grief and pain . ''

he dabbed his mouth with his napkin .

`` she reminded me so much of jade that it was easy to try to imagine that what i was feeling for her was romantic .

i had n't been out in so long that i wanted to woo her , just like i wanted to you . ''

`` and aidan came between you ? ''

`` in a way , both he and jade did . ''

`` what do you mean ? ''

pesh laughed .

`` let 's just say , during a very heated moment together , she was with aidan , and i was with jade . ''

megan was surprised by his candor .

`` i see . ''

there was one item in the pesh and emma equation she had always wondered about .

`` you did n't mind that she was pregnant ? ''

shaking his head , pesh replied , `` it just made her even more beautiful to me .

i 'd been through so much death that i guess i was drawn to her because she had life growing within her . ''

`` that 's really beautiful , '' megan murmured .

he gave her a mirthless laugh .

`` one of my worst character faults is having a hero complex .

i guess it 's one of the reasons i became a doctor .

i saw emma , and i wanted to save her .

when she had to go on bed rest , i wanted to be her knight in shining armor . ''

`` being a hero is not exactly a bad character trait . ''

`` it is when you ca n't save someone , and you have to constantly live with the guilt . ''

megan 's heart ached at the pain on his face .

sensing she needed to lighten the mood , she teased , `` i 'm glad to hear you actually have a bad character trait .

i mean , you seemed a little too perfect to me . ''

a shadow of a smile played on his lips .

`` did i mention i 'm a terrible slob ? ''

`` you ?

never , '' she replied .

`` oh yes .

if i did n't have a housekeeper , i 'm pretty sure i might end up on world 's nastiest houses . ''

megan laughed .

`` i find that hard to believe . ''

`` it 's the truth .

i also have no athletic ability whatsoever . ''

after chewing thoughtfully on her bite of salad , megan said , `` but you 're built like a football player . ''
