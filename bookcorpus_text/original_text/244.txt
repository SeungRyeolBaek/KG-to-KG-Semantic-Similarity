emerson stands beside her , and i take my place next to dad .

the justice of the peace stands between them , and my grandparents move front and center , all but wrinkling their noses .

the wedding of the century , indeed .

i ca n't make myself focus as the justice of the peace starts rattling through the motions .

emerson and i stand facing each other , looking over our parents ' shoulders .

i 've never seen him look so miserable .

more than being upset for my own heartbreak , i hate our parents in this moment for causing emerson so much pain .

he 's been through so much already , and now this fiasco ?

it 's more than anyone should have to bear .

`` ok then , '' the justice of the peace goes on .

`` if we could have the rings ... '' emerson thrusts them into my dad 's hand .

our parents slip the gaudy trinkets onto each other 's hands , grinning like two teenagers .

the words of their vows and even their `` i do 's '' fade into white noise as emerson finally lifts his eyes to mine .

we stare at each other , laid bare in this anguished moment .

our gazes say what we never got a chance to : `` i care about you more than anything in this world .

i 'm so sorry you 're in pain . ''

and as our parents share their first kiss as man and wife , i try my best to tell emerson one more thing with my silent , pleading eyes : `` i love you . ''

and as i look on , my heart breaking , i could swear his blue eyes tell me , `` i love you too . ''

chapter ten by midnight the house is all but silent once more .

leftover food and cake clutters every surface of the kitchen , crushed petals stain the floors , and the plastic flowers on the rickety altar out back have started dropping off , one by one .

dad and deb have flown the coop , off on the first leg of their honeymoon in new york city .

grandma and grandpa beat a quick retreat after a bite of cake and three brandies each .

the house , my home , feels like a crypt now .

but i suppose that 's appropriate-i 'm certainly in mourning .

emerson and i , still dressed up in our wedding day best , sit side-by-side at the kitchen island .

there 's an open bottle of vodka and a gigantic round of wedding cake sitting between us , and we 're helping ourselves to an abundance of both .

neither of us can think of anything productive to say , but are loathe to be alone tonight .

we sit there in silence , being careful not to brush elbows or even look at each other for too long .

as of this afternoon , when the ink dried on our parents ' marriage license , our relationship can only be strictly platonic .

i have n't been this miserable since my mom passed away .

this feeling of running up against devastating injustice is something i 'm all too familiar with by now .

without a word , emerson refills our glasses of straight vodka .

he snatches up his glass and downs his booze in one swallow .

tearing off his necktie , he staggers to his feet .

i stare at him as he turns to leave .

`` where are you going ? ''

i murmur , the room spinning as i stand up after him .

`` bed , '' he growls , not looking at me .

`` that 's it ? ''

i ask around the sudden lump in my throat , `` it 's just gon na be one word answers from now on ? ''

`` what did you expect ? ''

he replies , keeping his back to me .

`` i expected you to ... to be ... '' `` your friend ? ''

he scoffs , shoving a hand through his hair .

`` that was never going to happen , abby .

you know that as well as i do . ''

`` we have to at least try , '' i say softly , reaching out to touch him .

at the slightest brush of my fingers , he rips his arm away from me , spinning around with fire in his eyes .

`` i ca n't do that , '' he rages .

`` no fucking way can i just be your friend . ''

`` do n't yell at me , '' i say , steadying myself against the counter .

`` you 're drunk .

you 're upset .

this is n't you talking- '' `` as if you know the first thing about me , '' he fires back , shaking his head .

`` one fuck , and you think we 're soul mates or something ? ''

`` stop it , '' i tell him fiercely .

`` i know what you 're doing .

you 're trying to hurt me .

trying to drive me away so that you do n't have to deal with what 's happening .

well too fucking bad .

i 'm not going anywhere , emerson .

you ca n't scare me away . ''

`` no ? ''

he demands , stepping toward me .

he plants one hand on either side of me , caging me in against the counter .

`` you really think so ? ''

`` yes .

i do , '' i whisper , keeping my hazel eyes trained on his face .

our lips are mere inches from each other , our bodies all but pressed together .
