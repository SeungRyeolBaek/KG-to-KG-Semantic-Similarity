my dad and i have never once understood each other .

he 's never even made the attempt to understand my experiences .

we do n't talk .

we especially do n't listen .

but here he is now , speaking to what i actually have been thinking and feeling .

what the hell am i supposed to do with that ?

`` dad ... '' i say slowly , `` are you telling me that i should stay with emerson ? ''

`` i think i am , '' he says , as if surprised by the conclusion .

`` but you hate emerson , '' i remind him , `` you two nearly killed each other that day- '' `` please , '' dad says , holding up his hands for me stop , `` let 's not go there . ''

`` sorry , '' i backtrack , `` i 'm just a little confused , here . ''

`` i never knew how to do right by you , abby , '' my dad says quietly , lifting his eyes to mind , `` but that 's not your fault .

it 's on me .

when you were growing up , i never gave your needs the same weight as mine .

never thought about how things would effect you .

i was totally blindsided by how much emerson came to mean to you back then .

i did n't even stop to consider how wonderful it was that you 'd found someone you could talk to , share things with .

god knows i was n't helping you on that front . ''

`` do n't say that , '' i reply , a knot forming in my throat .

`` i 've always loved you , dad .

you have to know that . ''

`` and i love you , '' he says , crossing the room tentatively toward me .

`` i 've just been pretty terrible at letting you know that . ''

with great care , dad takes my hands in his .

he looks at me intently , and for the first time in my life i feel like he 's actually seeing me .

`` abby , '' he says , `` do you love emerson as much as you did when you were a kid ? ''

`` no , '' i whisper hoarsely , `` i love him so much more , now . ''

`` then do n't run away , '' he says , squeezing my hands , `` stay and work through this with him .

do n't refuse him out of pride , or some idea of propriety .

it 's ok to let people help you .

especially the people who love you more than anything . ''

`` but what if something goes wrong ? ''

i ask earnestly , `` what if we start to resent each other , or feel tied down , or change our minds- '' `` then at least you 'll know for sure where you stand , '' my dad cuts me off .

`` i know you 've been in pain since you and emerson were forced apart .

it was my fault that happened .

mine and deb 's .

but can you honestly tell me you have n't spent the past decade wondering what would have happened between you and emerson 'if only ' ?

i ca n't let you spend the next ten years wondering .

hurting .

i need you to hear me now , abby . ''

`` i hear you , '' i tell him , and it 's true .

`` i know it 's scary , sweetheart , '' dad says , resting his hands on my shoulders , `` but you 've got to jump , now .

it 's time . ''

`` ok , '' i whisper , `` ok , dad . ''

`` ok , you 'll jump ? ''

he presses .

`` i 'll jump , '' i tell him , `` but i may fall , you know . ''

`` there 's always that chance , '' he says sadly , `` trust me , i know .

but you know what 'll happen if you do n't fall ?

you 'll fly . ''

he kisses my forehead and wraps his arms around me .

i hug him back , ferociously .

i think this might be the first honest moment we 've ever shared together .

and all i had to do was let my life get almost entirely derailed to bring it about .

life 's funny , is n't it ?

my dad and i both look up as the front door swings open and a small bundle of fur bounds into the loft .

roxie runs right up to me , whiny with delight to find me still here .

when emerson steps into the loft after her , the same look of relief floods his eyes .

he was worried i 'd be gone by now .

that relief gives way to surprise as he recognizes my dad standing next to me .

`` bob ? ''

emerson says , looking back and forth between us .

`` hi , emerson , '' my dad replies , going to shake emerson 's hand .

`` sorry to drop in unannounced , i just needed to have a word with my daughter . ''

`` oh .

sure , '' emerson says , giving my dad 's hand a firm shake .

`` you guys have a lot to talk about .

i 'll get out of your hair , '' dad says .

`` but , emerson ... i know i have no right to ask anything of you , given how i 've treated you in the past .
