`` you will all sign non-disclosure statements that will apply for your entire lifetime and the lifetime of my family .

never , under any circumstances , will any news of any of our foibles be leaked to the press or any other member of the staff unless we 've directed such information to be released through official channels .

i 'll work with the lawyers to ensure that the punishment for any violations of this contract will be severe .

is that understood ? ''

every single person nodded their heads , agreeing with her terms .

with a sigh of relief , she looked around and instinctively knew that she 'd earned everyone 's support and trust .

it would still take time to earn their respect , but she suddenly felt up to the challenge .

`` that will be all , '' she heard zayn say from behind her .

as a group , every person bowed low and walked out of the conference room .

ella watched with relief as they all left , their heads low as if they knew that they 'd done wrong and their hides had all been saved today .

once they were alone in the conference room , zayn turned her around so he could see her face .

`` did you mean what you said ? ''

she asked shyly , peeking up through her long lashes .

`` every word of it . ''

`` even about loving me ? ''

she whispered , his stern expression intimidating her slightly .

`` you do n't have to say things like that if they are n't true .

i know that we 're here because of max and you married me because you did n't want to lose him . ''

he chuckled softly , leaning against the conference room table so he was a bit lower and he could see her pale features more clearly .

`` i married you because , for the past six years , i had n't been able to get you out of my mind .

and when i saw you again , all i could think about was getting you back into my bed .

as well as never letting you leave it . ''

he laughed derisively as he said , `` i did n't know that i 'd be going through three weeks of hell , watching you walk around , taunting me with your lovely body and wanting you more than i 've ever wanted any other woman in my life .

that was painful . ''

she rolled her eyes .

`` what about you ?

undressing in front of me , making me crazy with lust .

unfair ! ''

she came back .

one of his dark eyebrows went up and he laughed .

`` i did n't know you 'd even noticed .

you gave a good impression of a woman completely oblivious to me . ''

she snorted , a very un-queen-like sound .

`` as if anyone could ignore you , '' she laughed .

turning serious , she said , `` thank you for defending me like that .

it was very sweet , '' `` i should have realized what was happening before now .

i 'm sorry you 've been so miserable the past three weeks . ''

she shrugged .

`` i love you , '' she said , then held her breath , waiting for his reaction .

she waited a long time , her whole body tense and worried .

`` do you mean it , ella ?

do n't say that if you do n't honestly mean it .

because i 'll never let you take back the words . ''

`` i mean it .

i might go crazy loving you , but i really do , '' she sighed .

`` i love you too .

you 've driven me crazy long enough . ''

he bent low and kissed her gently but the kiss turned into something completely different , something more , something that shattered any remaining hurt she might be feeling about the past .

she loved this man , could n't get enough of him and wanted to spend the rest of her life making him happy .

she pulled back slightly and took a breath .

`` will you do one thing for me though ? ''

`` i 'll do anything you ask . ''

she took a fist full of his shirt in both of her hands .

`` do n't leave me in the morning ! ''

she growled .

`` i hate waking up after a night like last night and not having you there ! ''

she laid her forehead down on his chest , ignoring the laughter grumbling through his body .

`` how about if i take you back to bed right now and show you that i will be beside you when you wake up ? ''

she smiled and looked up at him .

`` and maybe we could start on your daughter ? ''

she asked shyly .

`` no ! ''

she heard max 's voice say from behind her .

both ella and zayn stood up and looked down at their little boy who was angrily glaring back at them .

`` i do n't want a sister ! ''

she stomped his tennis shoe shod foot .

`` i want a brother ! ''

ella stared at her son with amazement .

`` and where did you come from ? ''

she asked , watching as zayn bent down and lifted him into his arms .

`` ms. miller said you had a meeting in here and i wanted to make sure you were okay , '' he said , his little-boy eyes softening as he took in his mother 's happy face .

`` you 've been sad lately so i was going to bring you some cookies . ''
