it 's a portrait of emerson i 've been working on for weeks , since our first heated exchange at that party .

the drawing shows him in half-profile , staring with determined purpose from the page .

i 'm really proud of how i was able to capture him , and i can tell he 's impressed with the effort .

`` this is how you see me ? ''

he asks , his voice surprisingly soft .

`` absolutely , '' i tell him .

`` to me , that 's the essence of who you are .

intelligent , strong , unwilling to back down from what you know is right .

from the things you want out of life . ''

`` can i ... can i keep this ? ''

he asks , looking up at me imploringly .

`` of course ! ''

i tell him , `` it 's for you , emerson .

i want you to have it , always . ''

placing the sketchbook down with great reverence , emerson leans forward and catches my lips in his .

`` thank you , '' he murmurs , running a hand through my hair .

`` it 's the best gift anyone 's ever given me . ''

i smile and lower myself onto my knees in front of him .

`` then you 're going to love this ... '' i say with my best seductive grin .

i slowly undo his belt and unzip his pants as he leans back , a look of utter disbelief on his face .

i can see the hardening outline of his staggering cock growing down the inside of his jeans and my mouth begins to water instinctively .

oh how i 've dreamed of this moment .

my heart feels like its going to beat out of my chest as he lifts his hips and i pull down his jeans and boxers , unleashing his throbbing dick .

it 's beautiful , i 've never seen one up close before , and his is absolutely amazing .

i grab it reverently , without thinking , and lower my mouth onto him , taking as much of emerson into my throat as possible ... chapter eight when the early morning light draws me back up from the depths of slumber , i 'm surprised to find that the bed beside me is empty .

i roll onto my side , peering around the hotel room for my missing companion .

even after one night , the feel of waking up without him does n't suit me .

i 'm just about to roll out of bed and go searching for him when the motel room door eases open .

emerson appears on the threshold , carrying two cups of takeout coffee and a paper bag .

he sees me sitting up in bed and freezes .

`` shit , '' he mutters .

`` good morning to you too , '' i say , raising an eyebrow .

`` no , it 's just ... i was going to surprise you , '' he says , closing the door behind him .

`` here-just pretend to be asleep . ''

`` emerson ... '' i moan .

`` come on , '' he pleads , turning his back to dump the contents of the bag onto the dresser .

`` for me .

please . ''

i flop back onto the bed and pull the covers over my head as emerson futzes with something across the room .

i hear the click of a lighter , the crinkling of the bag , and finally emerson saying , `` ok. open your eyes . ''

pulling the covers down ever-so-slightly , i feel my heart melt into a puddle of goo in my chest .

emerson is walking toward me with a little makeshift breakfast in bed .

there 's my coffee , some creamers , and a blueberry muffin with a couple candles in the shape of a 1 and 8 .

he places the tray in my lap with great ceremony , humming the happy birthday song .

`` go on .

make a wish before it gets all waxy , '' he instructs me .

i glance up at him , wondering what on earth else i can wish for now that he 's barreled into my life .

i wish that this all works out ... i think to myself .

somehow .

i blow out the candles , and emerson sits down next to me on the bed , his own coffee and muffin hand .

`` what did you wish for ? ''

he asks .

`` i 'll tell you ... if it ever comes true , '' i smile .

`` fair enough , '' he says .

`` happy birthday , abby . ''

`` thank you , '' i say , peeling the wrapper off my muffin .

`` adulthood is off to a pretty great start , do n't you think ? ''

the day only gets better from there .

after i treat myself to a long , hot bath and get dressed for the afternoon , emerson and i head down to the beach for a long walk .

we take our time , talking all the while about our pasts , our ideas , our notions about the future .

emerson 's planning on going to college , eventually .

but probably not this year .

i 'll be starting school in the fall , of course , but we do n't talk too much about that part-the never-seeing-each-other again part .

maybe we can find some way around the distance , if this whole thing does n't go up in flames .

but we 'll be step-siblings tomorrow , so maybe it will be better to stay away after all .
