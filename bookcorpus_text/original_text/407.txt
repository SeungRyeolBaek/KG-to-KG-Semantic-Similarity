`` you 'll break your neck trying and then i 'll be really irritated with you . ''

she had to laugh at his comment .

`` you 'll be irritated with me for breaking my neck ? ''

he raised an eyebrow at her reaction .

`` not a good enough threat ? ''

she chuckled again and shook her head .

`` not really .

irritation with you is n't anything to be afraid of . ''

he nodded as if accepting her point .

`` how 's this for a threat ... if you fall down and break your neck , i 'll have you exactly where i want you ... on your back and at my mercy . ''

she giggled at the image but agreed that that threat was better .

`` okay , i 'll stay put as long as you stay on that side of the hay . ''

he instantly agreed with her terms then relaxed back against the hay .

`` so how did you find this place ? ''

he asked .

she shrugged and looked down over the workers who were milling about , taking care of the horses or hauling in food and water .

for the next hour , they discussed non-threatening issues like her job , his job , politics and horses .

she relaxed and sank deeper into the hay , feeling as if their old friendship were back and that pesky sexual tension that always seemed to be around them now had dissipated slightly .

it was still there and she caught him glancing down at her breasts more often than she wanted to admit , but his eyes always moved back up to her eyes and he paid attention to what she was saying .

he also laughed .

his deep , lustrous voice laughed at several of the things she commented on and it made her feel special to make him laugh .

`` you sound so relaxed right now , '' she mentioned with a smile of contentment .

`` am i not normally relaxed ? ''

he asked , leaning towards her with his arm behind her on the bale of hay .

she shook her head .

`` no .

you 're always very serious , generally wrapped up in something very complicated . ''

she reached out and touched his forehead .

`` and you have a worry line right here , '' she said , her finger touching the line between his dark , tough looking eyebrows .

`` it 's very intimidating . ''

`` but you are n't intimidated by me , are you ? ''

he asked and took her hand in his .

she did n't even realize that he was making patterns on her palm .

`` yes , you 're very terrifying . ''

he scoffed .

`` you do n't act like you 're terrified of me , unless i 'm trying to make love to you . ''

she rolled her eyes and shifted on the hay bale uncomfortably .

`` which is all the time as of today . ''

`` do you blame me ? ''

he joked .

she smiled and pulled her eyes away from his , not wanting to get pulled into that sensuous heat .

she 'd been there once already today , twice if she counted her dream and it was hard to pull out of that kind of intensity .

`` well , i do n't blame myself . ''

`` if you 'd wear something other than a shirt that is too small for you , and one that draws my eyes to that black lace bra you 're wearing , by the way , then i would n't always be trying to make love to you . ''

her free hand reached up and covered the gap in her shirt and she tried to pull her hand away .

`` you 're a really horrible man , '' she laughed .

he tugged her hand which caused her to land exactly where he wanted her , in his lap with her hands holding onto his shoulders .

`` i 'm just a man .

you ca n't blame me for falling victim to your allure . ''

she thought that she might be in trouble in this position , but it just felt too good for her to move .

the alarm bells were ringing , but because of the laughter they 'd been sharing for the past hour or so , she was too relaxed in his company to take him seriously .

`` i think i 've been wrong to be afraid of you , '' she said with a sparkle in her eyes .

`` you 're just a pussy cat , are n't you ? ''

`` absolutely , '' he agreed .

`` i 'm completely uncomplicated and non-threatening . ''

she threw back her head and laughed at his blatant lie .

`` i think you 're actually a wolf in sheep 's clothing , trying to lure me into a false sense of security , '' she said .

his hand slid up her waist and he raised an eyebrow .

`` i think you 're correct . ''

she knew she was in trouble , but it just felt too good to be in his arms .

it was the first time she had n't felt threatened by his nearness .

his touch was hot , but not uncomfortable .

`` i 'm going to kiss you , rachel , '' he said , his voice huskier , deeper somehow .

her eyes dropped to his mouth .

she tried to form the words that would ask him not to do that , but they would n't come out .

she should n't want this , should be pushing him away , getting off of his lap and running as far away as she could from this man .
