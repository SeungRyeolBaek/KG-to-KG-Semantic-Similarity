`` well ... '' i amend , `` i promise you wo n't absolutely despise it , anyway . ''

if it were any other day , i 'm sure emerson would never submit to watching an old , tragically romantic movie with me .

i can practically see him swallowing his pride like a big old bite of mushroom risotto as he says , `` fine .

put it on .

i 'll try not to fall asleep . ''

with a gleeful squeak , i queue up the film and settle back against the couch .

as the opening theme swells to fill our living room , emerson eases over on the couch so that our bodies are almost , almost touching .

his closeness , his kindness , and his understanding very nearly erase the upsetting events of this afternoon .

i let myself get swept up in the film , in his company , in the wonderful , unprecedented feeling of comfort that 's wrapped around me like so many blankets .

as we fill our bellies and turn our attention toward the movie , i 'm amazed at how normal this all feels .

spending time with emerson feels natural .

easy .

maybe there was a little silver lining to being so vulnerable in front of him earlier today , scary as it was .

of their own accord , our bodies drift closer together over the course of the long film .

the big meal has made me happy and sleepy , and i can feel my eyelids growing heavy .

emerson 's long , built body relaxes next to mine .

and as we both lose ourselves in epic story , he casually encircles me with a strong , muscular arm .

i 'm elated to be close to him , but more surprised at how effortlessly our bodies fit together .

i snuggle against his side , resting my head on his shoulder .

the warmth of his body is like a balm to my frayed nerves , and we stay cozied up for the duration of the film .

at long last , when the final credits roll , i 'm reluctant to reach for the remote , to let reality come sweeping into this perfect , suspended moment .

i think i can sense hesitation in him too , but that could just be a lot of wishful thinking .

at long last , the screen goes black .

the house is almost entirely dark without the blue glow of the tv .

but even so , neither of us makes the first move to disentangle our bodies .

if there was any question before , i know that this embrace is more than merely platonic .

emerson 's hand moves slowly along my side , sending sensation sparking along each nerve he brushes .

i turn my face gently toward his , peering up in the dim light .

his blue eyes gleam even in the darkness , and his caring expression gives me the courage to rest a hand on the firm panes of his chest .

i take a deep , steadying breath , willing myself to be strong .

steady .

`` thank you for this , '' i say , unsurprised to find that my voice has slipped low in my register with wanting him .

`` i know you were out to make me feel better after this afternoon , and ... well .

it worked .

this was exactly what i needed . ''

`` i 'm glad , '' he says , tugging me just a hair tighter against him .

`` i hated seeing you so upset back at the restaurant .

i figured dinner and a movie was the least i could do .

was that a panic attack , or- ? ''

`` anxiety attack , yeah , '' i reply , scooting up so that our faces are level .

`` i 've been having them for a few years now . ''

`` did they start when your mom passed away ? ''

he asks .

`` um .

no , '' i say , averting my eyes , `` not exactly . ''

`` you do n't have to tell me anything you do n't want to , '' emerson insists .

`` no .

i do want to .

i want you to know what today was about , i just ... '' i sigh , trying to find the right words .

`` hardly anyone knows .

and this whole us-getting-along thing is pretty new , you know ?

i just need to know ... that i can trust you . ''

i swallow a gasp as emerson lays a hand on my cheek , his eyes burning intently into mine .

`` you can trust me , '' he says , `` i promise you that much , abby .

how can i prove it to you ? ''

`` trade me a secret for a secret ? ''

i laugh , only half joking .

`` ok , '' he replies , his gaze unwavering , `` deal . ''

`` wait , seriously ? ''

i ask , sitting up a little straighter .

`` seriously , '' he says , letting his fingertips trail over my shoulder , down my arm .

`` i want you to know i 'm for real .

i 'll tell you a secret if you 'll let me in on one of yours . ''

i try my best to take deep breaths , suddenly afraid of knowing emerson 's secrets , being bound to share mine as well .

but i know i have to be bold , now .

i 've spent too much time living in shame and fear .

`` ok , '' i whisper , inching closer toward him , `` tell me a secret , emerson .
