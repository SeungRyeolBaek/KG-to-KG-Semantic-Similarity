had it only been two weeks since he 'd come back into their lives ?

so much had happened , her whole life was different now .

`` what about you ? ''

she asked and snuggled down into the large pillows that were placed behind her on the bed .

it was a decadent feeling to slide into a bed that she had n't made earlier in the day .

she still was n't used to someone taking care of the house for her , but it was definitely something she could enjoy while it lasted .

he started to talk , but she kept yawning so she only heard about half of what he said .

`` that sounds good , '' she replied , but was n't really sure if anything he 'd said was good , bad or horrible .

there was a long pause and malik finally asked , `` siri , are you okay ? ''

`` of course , '' she replied , smothering another yawn .

`` why do you ask ? ''

`` you seem a bit standoffish .

i want the old siri back . ''

she should be angry at his comment , but she was just too tired .

she snuggled deeper into the pillows , pulling a soft , fluffy blanket over her legs because it was just too much effort to get under the covers .

`` sorry .

i 'm not sure why i 'm so tired .

i 'm not normally like this , am i ? ''

she heard the frustration come through the phone with his tone and tried to sit up , but the pillows were just too comfortable .

`` maybe it 's the weather . ''

`` how are things going over where you are ? ''

she asked , trying to sound more upbeat , but it was a huge effort to just form the words .

all she wanted to do was close her eyes and fall asleep , not to be disturbed for about ten hours .

`` things could be better , '' he said with a deep sigh .

he thought about the petty squabbles his advisors were having about his wedding to siri and stifled his irritation since it was n't productive .

some wanted a huge affair that would take months to coordinate ; others wanted a fast event that would show the world that they accepted his new wife unequivocally .

either way , the wedding was going to happen and they were all excited about welcoming siri and the boys into their world and helping them to assimilate into the duban culture .

it was just taking longer than anticipated to temper their excitement and get down to the details .

`` there 's lots of arguing and ridiculous things to work out .

but we 'll get there . ''

something in his tone alerted her to a problem and she roused herself enough to ask , `` i thought you 'd be back by now .

i hope things are n't going poorly .

there 's no question about the boys , are there ? ''

he heard the worry in her tone and wanted to reassure her quickly .

`` none at all .

everyone is thrilled that an heir is already in place . ''

he chuckled as he said , `` they were worried about my virility , if you can believe it . ''

siri had to laugh at that and it felt good .

she 'd been so tired and tense lately that even the smallest laugh felt wonderful .

`` i can attest to your ... .abilities , if they have any questions . ''

he chuckled at her teasing choice of words , some of the tension leaving him as he heard her laughter once again .

`` i 'd like you to be testing my abilities right now . ''

`` what ?

no little harem women hanging about to entertain you ? '

she joked , but the idea of him having a harem was extremely painful .

`` you 're my only harem woman .

and i can guarantee that you 'll be dressing up for me in some sexy , skimpy outfit with lots of scarves that i 'll rip off that luscious body of yours .

you will definitely be entertaining me when you get here .

i need lots and lots of your special brand of entertaining . ''

he said it with that sexy , deep voice of his that never failed to make her stomach do a flip flop .

`` as long as i can entertain you my way . ''

`` any way you want will be fine with me . ''

`` any way ? ''

`` absolutely . ''

`` what if i want to watch television ? ''

she teased .

`` then you 'll be watching television while i ravish your body ! ''

he growled .

siri laughed and then smothered another yawn .

`` you 're falling asleep on me .

am i that uninteresting ? ''

she could n't help but laugh again .

she loved the teasing , not used to this from him .

he was usually so stern and officious unless he was playing with the boys .

but even then , he took all of their questions so seriously .

she really liked this new side of malik .

it made him much more human and approachable .

`` so when are you coming back ? ''

`` as soon as i can come back and bring the three of you back here .

there are just a few more details that need to be worked out . ''

all the tension came right back and she rolled over to stare out into the darkness of her bedroom windows .
