dharr did n't respond but was impressed with her senses .

obviously she was more alert than he 'd given her credit for .

`` what else do you want to know about me ? ''

`` what 's it like negotiating oil leases ? ''

`` sometimes it can be difficult , depending on who is negotiating . ''

`` who are you negotiating with right now ? ''

`` the british government . ''

`` ah , '' she said , suddenly a little intimidated by his power .

`` where did you grow up ? ''

she asked , changing the subject .

he hesitated before answering , wondering if his answer would give him away .

`` in ashir . ''

`` wow !

what was that like ?

i 've heard that some parts of the country are pretty dangerous . ''

`` actually , the crime rate is lower in ashir than in great britain . ''

her head tilted to the side as she tried to remember her history lessons .

`` is n't the government a monarchy ? ''

`` yes . ''

`` do you think that will change ?

do n't the people want a more democratic state ? ''

he choked on his laugh , her suggestion treasonous in his mind since he was the head of the government of ashir .

`` i hope not . ''

victoria smiled slightly , understanding his statement .

`` i 'm guessing from your response that you work for the government ? ''

dharr laughed outright now and noted that they were pulling up at the park .

`` we 're here , '' he said , avoiding having to tell her that he was at the top of the government .

victoria picked up the picnic basket and blanket but they were instantly taken out of her hands .

`` you wo n't carry this , '' dharr said and handed it to the waiting guard behind her .

victoria 's heart sank .

she was hoping for a little privacy but now realized that the guards would probably be following them the entire time .

`` do they have to come along ? ''

she whispered to him as she led the way down the path .

`` i 'm afraid that they must always be with me , '' he explained .

`` they are a necessary evil . ''

she glanced at the five burly men surrounding them .

`` i did n't realize that negotiating oil leases was so dangerous . ''

`` there are many people who would prefer that i not be around , '' he said .

`` you 're probably a pretty tough dictator , '' she laughed .

`` i can imagine you laying down the oil price and not moving a smidge . ''

`` you think so ? ''

he laughed , uncomfortable with the conversation .

he wanted to steer it away from himself but knew that he 'd promised to answer her questions .

he knew he could n't answer them completely but would give her small glimpses into his life .

`` what else do you want to know ? ''

everything she thought to herself .

she wanted to know how this man woke up in the morning , what he did all day long and how he 'd become the incredible man he was today .

she ignored the other niggling questions like , was he dating other people besides her ?

or had he ever been in love before ?

those questions hurt her , deep inside somewhere she did n't want to explore .

she also did n't think she had the right to ask them .

this was only their third meeting and one did n't really count since it was an accident .

`` how did you learn to negotiate oil leases ?

what got you into the business ? ''

she asked the most mundane first , wondering how much of himself he would reveal .

`` it runs in the family , '' he answered .

it was the truth in a sense but not the way she 'd been asking the question .

he 'd inherited his title from his father , and therefore all the responsibilities of running ashir along with the title .

negotiating oil leases was just one of the activities that fell to him as the king .

he did n't negotiate all of them , only the very large contracts with large countries since politics and treaties were usually involved as well .

the smaller countries or companies were delegated to others within the government .

`` how about that spot over there , '' she said , pointing to an area that was surrounded by trees but still had a grassy spot that looked out onto the thames .

he looked back to his guards who nodded imperceptibly .

turning back to victoria , he nodded .

`` that is fine , '' he said .

victoria took the blanket from the guard , smiling her thanks at him and spread it out on the ground .

dharr had the picnic basket and took her hand to help her onto the blanket .

she laid out the ingredients to the picnic and looked up , surprised to find that they were completely alone .

or so it seemed .

`` where are your guards ? ''

she asked .

`` they are near but out of sight . ''

he sat down next to her and looked at the food .

`` did you make all this ? ''

he asked , touched to see that there were homemade cookies and freshly cut fruit .

`` did you make these ? ''

he asked , picking up a cookie to sample .

victoria was busy setting out the other items she 'd made for their dinner and glanced up to see him holding a lemon cookie curiously .
