`` did they ... pass away ?

your grandparents ? ''

emerson asks gently .

`` nah , '' i chuckle , `` they just decided that florida was more their scene is all .

did n't want to go through the hassle of selling this place .

they 're , uh , pretty well off , my grandparents .

good people , but loaded as hell . ''

`` not a very typical combination , is it ? ''

emerson replies gruffly .

he looks over as me as i avert my eyes , embarrassed .

`` sorry .

i did n't mean you .

i just- '' `` did n't you ? ''

i ask softly .

`` of course not , '' emerson says , reaching for my hand .

`` i told you not four hours ago how i feel about you , abby .

you 're not just some rich girl to me .

christ , i would never hold you accountable for your family .

that would mean you could hold me accountable for mine . ''

`` good point .

and i would n't dream of it , for the record , '' i laugh shortly .

`` though apparently , we 're about to have our shitty families joined in holy matrimony .

so ... congratulations to us ? ''

`` or something , '' emerson grumbles , shaking his head .

`` it 's a terrible fucking idea .

they do n't even know each other .

they 're going to make each other miserable . ''

`` i know , '' i reply , heaving a sigh , `` this is why marriage gets such a bad rap .

because assholes like our parents fuck it up for everyone . ''

`` seriously , '' emerson says , pulling out a cigarette .

i do n't even have to ask for one this time , he just passes it my way .

he holds the lighter for me as i run the tip of my cigarette through the flame .

we inhale deeply in unison , peering up at the stars through the canopy of leaves above .

our fingers are still entwined , natural as can be .

that might be what hurts the most-the potential of a relationship that feels as easy as breathing , scattered by our parents ' carelessness .

`` it 's not fair , '' i whisper , my eyes prickling with tears .

`` no .

it 's not , '' emerson replies , pulling me tightly against his side .

`` i mean jesus christ , their timing , '' i laugh , though nothing about this is funny .

`` no kidding , '' he replies , `` if they had n't shown up when they did ... abby , i do n't know what would have happened back there .

i mean .

i know what i wanted to happen . ''

`` and ... what 's that ? ''

i ask softly , unable to look him in the eye .

`` i think you know , '' he says , circling my waist with his muscled arm .

`` but what i do n't know , at least for sure , is what you want out of this .

out of ... us . ''

my heart is lodged in my throat as i think of how to answer .

i need to be bold now .

to tell him the truth .

even if i 've read him entirely wrong , and he thinks i 'm insane for what i 'm about to say , we 'll be out of each others ' lives in a few months ' time .

so , here goes .

`` if we had n't been interrupted , '' i say , softly but steadily , `` i would n't have stopped until we 'd had each other .

that 's all i wanted . ''

he glances down at me , and i force myself to meet his gaze .

his eyes smolder with wanting me .

the intensity of his lust nearly bowls me over .

`` that 's what i wanted , too , '' he growls , catching my chin in his hand .

he brings his mouth to mine , kissing me forcefully , deeply .

but there 's a hint of finality in his kiss that nearly brings me to tears .

`` what are we supposed to do ? ''

i whisper , pulling away from him .

`` it 's wednesday .

no , thursday now .

by sunday , we 'll technically be siblings . ''

`` i know that , '' emerson replies , his teeth gritted in hopeless frustration .

`` and once that 's the case , we ca n't ... '' `` i know , '' i whisper .

`` of course we ca n't .

it would n't be right . ''

`` nothing about this situation is right , '' he scoffs .

`` god , '' i mutter , `` why could n't we have just found each other years ago , before we were out of time ? ''

`` we 're not out of time .

yet , '' emerson says carefully , as if testing the waters .

my heart clenches tightly as he goes on .

`` tomorrow is my birthday , abby .

saturday is yours .

that means that on saturday , and only on saturday , we 'll both be legal adults .

legal , unrelated adults .

who can argue with that ? ''

`` are you ... are you suggesting ... ? ''

i reply , my eyes going wide .

`` if i do n't at least suggest it , '' emerson says , pulling me into his lap .

`` i 'll regret it for the rest of my life .
