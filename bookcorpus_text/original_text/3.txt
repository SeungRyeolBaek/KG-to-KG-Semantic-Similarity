casey snorted .

`` i 'm sure aidan would n't appreciate you alluding to the fact his gown is an antique , thus in turn saying he 's old . ''

emma laughed .

`` no , i 'm sure he would n't .

of course , he 'd probably argue that while the gown might not have held up , he still looks fabulous and much younger than his age . ''

megan smiled .

`` that sounds just like him . ''

she bent over emma to rub one of noah 's hands .

he grabbed her thumb in his fist and held on for dear life .

`` aw , you love your godmother , do n't you noah ? ''

emma asked .

noah momentarily stopped sucking on the bottle to flash a quick smile , which warmed megan 's heart .

`` he 's such a sweet boy , '' she mused .

`` and a charmer , just like his old man , '' casey mused .

`` that too , '' megan agreed .

thinking about her position , she cocked her head at casey .

`` are you sure you 're fine with me being the godmother ? ''

casey waved her hand dismissively .

`` honey , the last thing i need is the responsibility .

i plan on spoiling noah rotten and corrupting him as only a good auntie can do ! ''

emma rolled her eyes .

`` i 'm very satisfied with both my choices , megan .

you do n't have to worry . ''

`` so who is the godfather again ?

i know he 's not part of the family . ''

casey gasped as her hand flew to her chest dramatically .

`` you mean , you 've never met dr. mcdreamy bollywood ? ''

megan shrugged .

`` no , i have n't .

i mean , i 've heard about him and how he flew aidan home in time for noah 's birth . ''

she noticed the pleading look that emma exchanged with casey .

`` why ?

what should i know about him ? ''

casey tapped her chin with her index finger .

`` hmm , what should you know about the good godfather ? ''

she winked at megan .

`` first off , he is seriously delectable .

i mean , the man is like sex on a stick .

tall , jet-black hair , dark eyes , and he 's built like a brick shithouse . ''

megan suddenly felt her interest piquing .

she had n't imagined that the godfather would be good-looking .

it had been such a long time since she had dated anyone .

scratch that-it had been a long time since she 'd had sex with anyone .

she 'd spent the last two years completely dateless since she and davis broke up .

she could practically join one of the local parishes as a nun with how long she had abstained .

`` really ? ''

`` mmm , hmm .

he reminds me of that bollywood actor john abraham , '' casey said .

emma snorted .

`` since when do you watch bollywood movies ? ''

`` since one of nate 's friends asked us to an indian film festival . ''

casey grinned at megan .

`` besides the fact that he 's a serious looker , he 's also kind , compassionate , and caring-an overall wonderful man . ''

`` really now ? ''

megan questioned .

`` and he 's loaded because he 's a doctor . ''

this man was sounding better and better by the minute .

`` is he single ? ''

emma made a strangled noise before casey replied , `` oh , yeah , he 's single .

he 's a widower actually . ''

megan pursed her lips at the prospect .

widowers usually fell into two categories-those who were still devastated by their wives ' deaths or those who were ready to have fun and live a little .

she certainly hoped this pesh guy fell into the second category .

more than anything , she wanted to have a little fun herself .

`` do you really think you might be interested in dating pesh ? ''

emma asked , as she moved noah to her shoulder to burp him .

with a shrug , megan replied , `` dating him or just having some fun with him .

sounds like he could use some . ''

emma grimaced as she wiped noah 's face off .

`` this is exactly why i told aidan not to try and fix you two up . ''

`` what do you mean ? ''

`` pesh needs a relationship , not a hook-up after all he 's been through .

besides his wife 's death , he has n't had it easy on the dating front . ''

`` what happened ? ''

when casey snorted , emma shot her a death glare .

`` nothing .

it 's just he does n't need to get involved with someone who is n't interested in a long-term relationship . ''

`` em , you might as well tell her , '' casey urged .

megan glanced between the two of them .

`` tell me what ? ''

`` fine , '' emma huffed resignedly .

she handed noah to casey .

`` make yourself useful by changing his diaper . ''

as casey got busy cleaning up noah , emma turned to megan .

`` when aidan and i broke up- '' `` what you meant to say is , after you left aidan when he did n't show up for noah 's gender ultrasound because he was cheating on you ? ''

casey interrupted , waving around the wet wipe in her hand .

emma closed her eyes for a moment before shaking her head .
