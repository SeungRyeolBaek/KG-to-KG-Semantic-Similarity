`` all right then .

chuck e. cheese it is . ''

`` go get your shoes , '' megan instructed .

as mason raced back into the living room , megan stood up .

`` you really do n't have to do this . ''

`` honestly , i do n't mind .

we can go have lunch with mason , and then we can start our date .

i 'm sure he 'll be worn out and ready for a nap when we get back , right ? ''

`` yes , he will . ''

`` good .

then he wo n't have any reason to miss you if he 's asleep . ''

she smiled at his thoughtfulness .

`` thank you .

i really mean that . ''

`` you 're welcome . ''

he reached out and brushed her cheek .

when he started to lean in to kiss her , mason ran back into the foyer with his shoes .

pesh quickly jerked back .

to combat the awkwardness , megan busied herself with getting mason 's shoes on .

when she finished , mason bounded over to pesh and grabbed his hand .

`` go !

go ! ''

pesh laughed at mason 's enthusiasm .

he held his other hand out for megan .

she slid her hand into his and then they started to the car .

as megan walked through the doors of their local chuck e. cheese , she recoiled slightly at both the ear- splintering noise and the stomach-turning smells .

she also fought her embarrassment at the looks she and pesh were getting for their more formal outfits .

`` i think we 're a little overdressed , '' she said .

he held up his index finger and thumb before pinching them close together .

`` just a little bit . ''

tugging on pesh 's hand , mason dragged him over to the toddler area of games .

megan quickly dug in her purse for some money for tickets .

after she bought them , she went over to pesh .

`` i 'll go grab us some pizza . ''

she waved the tickets at him .

`` once these are gone , he 's done . ''

`` i do n't mind getting him more . ''

she shook her head .

`` trust me .

he 's done . ''

`` okay then , '' he replied good-naturedly .

megan felt completely at ease leaving pesh to watch mason .

she got them a couple of slices of mason 's favorite , pepperoni , along with some drinks and then made her way over to a table close to the toddler area .

when she caught pesh 's eye , she waved them over .

after several tense moments , he was finally able to convince mason to leave the play area to come and eat .

as mason bounced around in his seat , megan knew she would be doing good to get four bites of pizza down him before he was raring to go play again .

she also had a fear that she , pesh , or the both of them were going to be wearing tomato sauce before it was all said and done .

`` this place is very interesting , '' pesh remarked , as he gazed around .

megan laughed .

`` have you never had the pleasure ? ''

`` sadly no .

my brother , arjan 's , and his children live in florida , so i 've really never had a reason to come . ''

`` you 've dodged a bullet there .

that 's for sure . ''

he smiled before taking a bite of his pizza .

his expression turned so sour that megan could n't help giggling .

`` this is terrible , '' he muttered .

`` i should have warned you not to bother eating .

it only seems appetizing to small children who are hyped up on adrenaline . ''

he took a long swig from his coke and swished the liquid around like he was trying to rid himself of the taste .

when he caught mason looking at him , he put on a fake smile .

`` mmm , that 's good pizza .

you better eat yours before i do . ''

`` nice save , '' she murmured .

he winked at her as he threw his napkin on his plate .

she could n't believe when her heart fluttered at his gesture .

it was almost impossible to believe that she could be getting feelings for him in the middle of chuck e. cheese .

`` done .

go play , '' mason announced , bringing her out of her thoughts .

she shook her head .

`` i do n't think so .

you need to eat more . ''

mason scowled at her before grabbing another bite and shoveling it into his mouth .

he managed to clean his plate with a little coaxing from pesh .

then the two of them went back over to the play area .

as megan watched them , the small ache in her chest began to grow .

pesh was completely hands on , hoisting mason up where he could reach things and then catching him when he came off the slide .

he seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with mason .

some guys would have played with mason only to get on her good side .

but pesh did n't have an agenda when it came to her , unless it was to have her embrace the idea of a relationship with him .

when the last ticket was spent , she rose off her chair .

`` okay , time to go . ''

mason 's face scrunched up , and he looked like at any minute he might throw a tantrum to stay .
