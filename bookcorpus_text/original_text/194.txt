i glance out the window next to the door and see eileen walking up the driveway .

`` hi , '' i murmur quietly as she reaches the steps and i open the door .

`` hi , '' she replies nervously , smoothing her blouse .

`` do i look alright ? ''

`` you look fine , '' i assure her .

i ca n't imagine how she must feel , finally seeing her son face-to-face after all these years .

she looks around the foyer .

`` god , this place is even bigger than it looks from outside . ''

`` i know .

it 's ridiculous , '' i agree , and usher her into the den .

`` pierce and my mom are at some charity lunch , so they 'll be gone for a while , '' i tell her .

she bites her lip nervously and takes a seat on the couch .

`` i 'll call nate down , alright ?

i have n't told him anything ... i was n't sure he would come otherwise . ''

she nods , and i head to the stairs .

`` hey , nate ? ''

i yell , and hear his bedroom door open .

`` you wan na come down to the den ? ''

i feel a fissure of guilt as he replies happily , `` sure !

be right there , '' and i hear him moving around .

i do n't like the idea of setting a trap and lying to him , but i rationalize that it 's in the service of a greater truth , that of the true nature of his parents ' relationship , and his father 's character .

i walk back into the den , and stand nervously next to the couch where eileen 's sitting .

she stands as we hear nate walking down the stairs , and then he turns the corner and sees us .

his face is a blank as he surveys the scene before him .

he takes a step forward , looks like he 's going to say something , and then steps back .

`` nate , it 's me , your mom , '' eileen whispers .

`` i know who you are , '' nate replies quietly .

he turns to me .

`` you did this ? ''

`` i think you should hear what she has to say .

please , will you just sit for a minute ? ''

nate 's face twists into a sneer-an expression i have n't seen in weeks .

`` you 're unbelievable , '' he spits at me , and storms out the front door , slamming it behind him .

eileen sits down with a muted cry , and i run after him .

`` nate ! ''

i call as i shut the door behind me and head down the front steps .

he 's walking around the side of the house , probably headed for the garage and his car to make an escape .

`` would you just listen to me for a second ? ''

`` why ?

so you can try to poison my mind against my dad some more ? ''

he yells , reeling around .

`` i 'm trying to tell you the truth about him !

eileen can tell you- '' `` oh , so this is all about you !

you can try to paint it as some benevolent way of getting a mother and son to reunite , but really , this is all about getting me to believe your story , '' he turns again and begins to walk away across the grass .

`` no !

that 's not true ! ''

i protest , pursuing him .

`` your mom is a good person-i wanted to help her , and you . ''

`` you 're pathetic , you know that ? ''

he says , spinning around again .

`` stop following me .

whatever mistakes we made together this summer , it 's over . ''

`` what ?

nate , i- '' i feel like he just punched me in the gut .

how did this all go so wrong ?

`` i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i 've fucked , but you 're not , ok ?

from now on , let 's just smile at each other politely from across the room at family events , like normal stepsiblings do . ''

`` no , no !

we are different , we are . ''

`` you 're just attached because i was your first .

do n't worry about it , you 'll get over it soon .

you were nothing special to me , brynn , '' he says and walks through the garage 's side door .

i stand in shock as i watch the garage door slide open and his wrangler come speeding out .

i watch him head down the driveway , then disappear around the corner .

i hear the front door open behind me , and eileen approach me .

`` i 'm so sorry , brynn , this is all my fault . ''

`` no , it 's not , '' i reply , biting my lip to keep from sobbing .

she puts her arm around me .

`` he 's just angry .

he 'll come to his senses . ''

`` no , he 's just as stubborn as i am .

it 's really over . ''

i collapse against her , burying my head on her shoulder as i begin to cry .

`` first love always hits the hardest , '' she murmurs as she rubs my arm .

`` come on-your parents wo n't be back for a while .

i 'll make you some tea . ''
