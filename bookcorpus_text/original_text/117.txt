as the water beat down on us , i took her down to the hard floor and started f**king her again .

`` this is f**king insane . ''

was it because i 'd slept with her in my arms for three whole nights and not taken her ?

i could n't think of a reason for this hunger that would n't be assuaged .

the more i had her the more i wanted , but if we kept this shit up she 'd spend the next three weeks bed ridden .

already i had noticed the red puffiness to her labia and heard the slight sounds of discomfort she made even as she spurred me on to f**k her .

i was sure i was killing her against the marble floor , the grunts and groans she made were becoming almost animalistic , but she threw her hips up at me taking my c**k like a pro as i did my best to nail her into her ground beneath us .

this time when i came the roar was more like a grunt as i shook and thrust into her until i was dry .

`` that 's it , we 're getting out of here , please try to keep your greedy hands to yourself shiane , my poor man 's body can only take so much . ''

she threw herself into my arms and howled with laughter and i felt my heart give a little more .

we finally made it out of the bathroom and both just threw on robes as we headed down to the kitchen .

`` did you say you made dinner ? ''

`` yep . ''

she went to the pots and pans on the stove and i lifted my brow quizzically .

i guess i was guilty of stereo typing after all , i had n't expected the little pop sensation to know her way around the kitchen .

she 'd made a dinner of grilled lamb chops of all things , with rice pilaf and creamed green peas .

`` i hope i did n't spoil it . ''

yeah right .

`` nope , the lamb was n't grilled yet , it 's still sitting in the marinade it 'll take five minutes to cook and the rest of the stuff can be reheated no problem .

you just sit and i 'll take care of everything , '' `` yes ma'am . ''

i opened a bottle of wine and poured her a glass , taking one for myself as i sat at the island and watched her flit around my kitchen .

she seemed , happy .

it was strange to look at this almost stranger and realize that already i 'd come to know her so well .

did she even realize that she 'd started signing ?

she had n't done that since she 'd been here .

i would 've thought that she spent every waking moment singing , but this was the first time since i 'd brought her home that i 'd heard her so much as hum .

it was n't the song from the other night , this one was slow and dreamy , with a catchy little lilt to it that made me want to strain to hear the words since she was singing so low .

`` sing louder princess i wan na hear you . ''

she turned wide eyes to me and looked down at her feet .

`` i 'm not really good at that . ''

`` come again . ''

`` i mean i 've learned how to control my fear somewhat before i go out on stage , but i ca n't really sing in front of anyone just like that . ''

`` so how do you do it ? ''

'my manager gives me these pills ... '' i did n't like the sounds of that one bit .

`` what kind of pills ? ''

i lowered my glass and looked at her .

`` it 's nothing bad , just something to calm my anxiety . ''

`` is there a prescription ? ''

`` no nothing like that , i never even asked him where he gets them ... '' `` do you have them with you now ? ''

`` no why ? ''

she looked at me quizzically . ''

`` i 'll just like to have a look at them that 's all , make sure they 're okay . ''

`` oh i 'm sure they 're fine doug would never do anything to hurt me . ''

`` so you have the pills back at your place ? ''

`` no , doug keeps them with him , he gives me one before each performance or sometimes when i have to go on one of those talk shows .

looks like i was gon na have to have a talk with her manager .

she was so f**king green , i was sure it would never cross her mind to question anything the man did .

though i did n't know him personally , i 'm a businessman and i know all about the bottom line .

her voice is like liquid gold , i 'm sure dear old doug would do anything to see that nothing got in the way of her making them money .

that was something else i was gon na have to look into as well .

when i 'd made the decision to own her , everything that she is became my responsibility .

there might be some friction because i 've noticed that she has a bit of an independent streak , but i had no intentions on letting that stop me .

though i 'd save it for another time , nothing was going to mar the night for us .

`` voila , dinner is ready . ''
