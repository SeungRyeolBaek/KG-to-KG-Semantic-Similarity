it seems that with this pregnancy she 's having third trimester morning sickness .

i told her i would stay home with her , but she insisted i come get a good meal . ''

`` poor thing .

we 'll fix her a plate for you to take home to her later on , '' megan said .

aidan smiled .

`` thanks .

if she can eat it , i know she 'll be grateful . ''

patrick clicked his fork against his water goblet .

`` is everyone here that 's supposed to be here ? ''

a chorus of , `` yes , '' rang around the room .

`` good .

let 's return thanks . ''

pesh obediently bowed his head along with the others .

when patrick finished , the dishes were passed around and food was served .

it was certainly a lot different than how his family did it , but he still enjoyed being with megan 's family .

while mason ate off his plate , megan gave aidan a break by feeding noah , or more appropriately letting him drape her in food while he fed himself .

`` you 're a mess , '' megan said , into noah 's carrot-and-corn crusted face .

his response was to grin at her .

`` i 'm sorry , mister , but that cute little grin is n't going to work for me . ''

`` he 's so stubborn , '' aidan said .

`` a stubborn fitzgerald ?

i 've never heard of such , '' becky joked across the table .

aidan shook his head .

`` i 'm serious .

he refuses to let me or em feed him , and then he ends up wearing more than he eats . ''

`` sounds like his father , '' angie mused .

when aidan gave her an exasperated look , she said , `` you were the exact same way .

i do n't think you ate a meal until you were two that mother did n't have to hose you off after you finished . ''

aidan grunted .

`` do n't tell em that story .

she already blames me enough for noah 's stubbornness . ''

megan smiled .

`` let 's hope that this next baby has emma 's temperament . ''

`` like she is n't stubborn , '' aidan countered .

`` much less than you are , '' megan replied .

pursing his lips , he appeared to be surveying her words .

`` you might have a point , '' he said , with a grin .

after everyone finished eating , the adults lounged around the table talking and laughing while the kids went into the living room .

both mason and noah wanted to go with the bigger kids .

`` will you keep an eye on them ? ''

megan asked percy .

`` sure , '' he replied .

`` i owe you , perce , '' aidan said , as percy took the boys by the hand .

as he sat with his arm draped over the back of megan 's chair , pesh enjoyed listening to the lively conversation around him .

occasionally one of aidan 's sisters would ask him a question or his opinion .

he had always been naturally quiet , and when he got in the midst of such a lively bunch , he tended to be even quieter .

he realized if he was going to truly fit in , he was going to have to speak up more .

their conversation was interrupted by a shriek that came from the living room followed by a loud wail .

aidan was out of his chair in a flash while megan was close on his heels .

mason came running into the dining room .

`` what happened ? ''

pesh asked .

`` noah got hurted . ''

aidan reappeared in the dining room with noah in his arms .

`` he 's fine .

he just fell down . ''

taking noah 's hand , aidan said , `` here daddy will kiss the booboos away , okay ? ''

noah sniffled and bobbed his head .

once aidan finish with his hand , noah stuck out his leg .

aidan smiled .

`` okay . ''

once he bent down to noah 's leg and kissed it , he asked , `` are you daddy 's boy ? ''

`` uh-huh . ''

angie chuckled .

`` that 's not fair to do that when emma is n't here . ''

as the others laughed , pesh glanced at mason .

he was staring at aidan and noah with a contemplative look on his face .

never in a million years could he have imagined what he would do next .

mason crawled up into his lap and patted pesh 's chest .

`` esh mace 's daddy .

mace daddy 's boy . ''

conversation in the dining room silenced .

without even looking up , pesh felt his skin singing under the burn of everyone staring at him and mason .

there was no way he could deny the boy when he wore such an expression of happiness .

`` yes , you 're daddy 's boy . ''

a strangled cry caused him to snap his gaze from mason over to megan .

wide-eyed and open mouthed , she blinked a few times as if she were trying to believe that what she was seeing was real .

then without another word , she bolted from her chair and fled the room .

pesh sat in a shocked silence for a few seconds trying to decide what to do .

bending over , he whispered into mason 's ear , `` will you go back and play with the others ?

i need to check on mommy . ''
