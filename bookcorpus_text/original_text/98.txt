although he still had nothing to do with his son , davis had n't shown a lot of enthusiasm about the prospect .

the closer they got to the adoption hearing , the more megan worried that he would refuse .

`` dr. nadeen , i understand that you wish to adopt the minor child of your wife ? ''

pesh nodded enthusiastically .

`` yes , your honor , i would . ''

`` i see that you and your wife have been married less than two months , and that you 've only known her a year . ''

the judge adjusted his glasses that had slid down his pointy nose .

`` do you think it wise to legally bind yourself to this child after such a short time ? ''

megan fought the urge to stalk up to the bench and smack the judge .

instead , she took deep breaths and tried to reign in her temper .

she glanced over at pesh who merely smiled pleasantly at the judge .

`` your honor , i realize that on paper it might seem as though i am rushing into things .

however , i 've never been more certain of anything in my life as i am about my love for megan and in turn , my love for mason .

i 've waited a long time to be a father , and i do n't want to have to waste another second . ''

`` i see . ''

the judge eyed the folder open before him .

`` i understand the biological father has had no contact with the child . ''

`` that 's correct , '' megan replied .

`` he has also waved his parental rights so that dr. nadeen can adopt his son . ''

megan exhaled a relieved breath that davis had signed the paperwork .

`` i 'm glad to hear that , your honor , '' she said .

`` do you feel that your husband will make a good father for your son ? ''

`` i never would have dated , least of all married him , if i did n't believe that pesh would be a good and loving father to mason . ''

`` so the fact that he is a wealthy doctor had nothing to do with it ? ''

`` how dare you ! ''

megan cried .

when pesh grabbed her arm to silence her , she slung him away .

`` you 've known us for two minutes and you 're making assumptions about me , my husband , and my marriage ?

if this were about money , i could have used his father for child support considering he is a wealthy nfl player .

but i would have sacrificed everything to ensure that my son had a good father ! ''

`` mrs. nadeen , i will ask that you control yourself , or i will have to hold you in contempt , '' the judge said sternly .

pesh wrapped his arm around her waist , drawing her against him .

`` easy , '' he murmured .

although she hated to do it , she said , `` i 'm sorry , your honor . ''

when he smiled at her , she gasped in surprise .

`` and i am sorry for rattling you , mrs. nadeen .

i often say or do unorthodox things to see the true nature of the people who come before me . ''

`` you mean , you said that to get a reaction from me ? ''

`` yes , i did .

and you unwaveringly rose to my challenge .

i can see that you are truly concerned with the wellbeing of your son . ''

still reeling from the judge 's behavior , megan mumbled , `` thank you . ''

peering down over the bench , the judge surmised mason .

`` son , do you know why you 're here today ? ''

`` i gettin ' 'dopted , '' mason replied .

the judge smiled .

`` yes , you are .

do you want pesh to be your daddy ? ''

`` uh , huh . ''

`` do you want anyone else to be your daddy ? ''

`` no , '' mason replied quickly , shaking his head back and forth .

`` then come up here while i sign the paperwork . ''

mason happily ran around the side of the bench to the judge .

he climbed up onto the judge 's lap .

after signing several sets of papers , the judge handed mason his gavel .

`` once you bang that gavel , pesh is officially your daddy , and you are mason nadeen . ''

with a broad grin , mason brought the gavel down .

tears stung megan 's eyes , and she gladly let pesh pull her into his arms .

`` thank you , thank you , thank you , '' she murmured .

`` i love you , '' he replied , squeezing her tight .

`` i love you , too . ''

their attention was drawn to where mason kept banging the gavel .

the judge chuckled .

`` okay , i think that is enough .

why do n't you go to your mommy and daddy now ? ''

`` tell the judge thank you , '' megan instructed .

`` tank you , '' mason replied , before he hopped off the judge 's lap and came running to them .

`` i 'dopted !

i 'dopted ! ''

pesh bent down to pick him up .

`` that 's right , buddy .

you 're my son for now and always . ''

megan smiled and patted mason 's back as they started out of the courtroom .

`` come on .

let 's go to papa 's .
