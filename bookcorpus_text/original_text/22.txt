be back in a few , and we 'll finish the tour . ''

megan fought the urge to run after kristi as she walked off .

instead , she turned back to pesh who was staring expectantly at her .

`` you do n't exactly look happy to see me , '' pesh said .

she shook her head wildly .

`` how could i be ?

the man , who i completely made an ass out of myself in front of , is at the hospital where i 'm doing my clinicals .

that does n't exactly make my day . ''

`` for the last time , you have nothing to be embarrassed about . ''

`` sorry , but that does not make me feel any better , '' she grumbled .

`` what can i do to put you at ease about working with me ? ''

rubbing her now aching head , she replied , `` i do n't know .

if i thought it would n't make me look bad , i 'd request a transfer . ''

`` i offend you that much ? ''

pesh asked .

as she gazed up at him , his expression was wounded .

`` no , no , you do n't offend me .

it 's just that ... '' she chewed mercilessly on her bottom lip before she continued .

after taking a ragged breath , she replied , `` it 's just that for the past two years , i had pretty good control of my life .

the night i was with you , i let all that control crumble .

by getting drunk , i became someone else-someone i used to be .

the girl , or woman , who would do anything to get a man 's attention .

i do n't like that person very much , and i do n't ever want to go back there .

seeing you just makes me remember all of that . ''

megan could n't help being surprised by how honest she 'd been able to be with him .

pesh remained silent for a moment .

his dark eyes bore into hers .

`` i am sorry that you reflect so negatively on the night we were together .

for me , it was not marred by drinking or you getting sick .

i enjoyed spending time with you and getting to know you . ''

he swallowed hard .

`` i enjoyed waking up with you .

i would give anything for you to be able to look at me without having to feel bad about yourself . ''

`` you really enjoyed being with me that night ? ''

he nodded .

`` when i told you i wanted to see you again , i was serious . ''

she sighed .

`` that 's very sweet of you , but i have n't changed my mind about dating . ''

`` you have n't ? ''

with a shake of her head , she replied , `` i have too much going on in my life right now to get involved with someone .

it would n't be fair to them ... to you .

especially since we still want very different things from each other . ''

`` i see , '' he replied .

megan noticed the sadness that darkened his expression .

`` i 'm sorry , '' she murmured .

`` you have nothing to regret .

any grief i 'm experiencing is once again my fault . ''

he gave her a rueful smile .

`` i seem to keep falling for women who are n't meant for me . ''

she sucked in a harsh breath at his words .

`` falling ?

you are ... you were falling for me ? ''

pesh opened his mouth to reply , but at the sound of kristi coming back from the break room , he shut it .

closing the gap between them , he whispered , `` do n't worry about working with me , megan .

we 'll always be friends , and i will respect your wishes and your distance . ''

for some reason , his words had the opposite effect they should have , and regret ricocheted through her .

finally , she managed to say , `` thank you .

i appreciate that . ''

with a smile , he then turned and walked away .

she heaved a painful breath as kristi walked up to her .

`` such a sweetheart , is n't he ? ''

`` yes , he is , '' megan murmured .

`` not bad on the eyes either . ''

a nervous giggle escaped megan 's lips .

`` no , he 's not . ''

`` i swear that half of the women here in the er act like they 're in heat whenever he comes around . ''

kristi fanned herself .

`` i mean , that body , those eyes , and those dimples .

lord , if i was n't a happily married woman , what i would n't want to do to that man ! ''

megan knew exactly what kristi meant .

unfortunately , she was never going to get the chance to experience it for herself .

somehow she 'd managed to find the only man left in the world who would n't partake in just a sexual relationship .

no , pesh had to want more than she was willing to give .

`` did you hear what i said ? ''

kristi asked .

megan snapped her gaze from pesh 's retreating form back to face kristi .

`` i 'm sorry what ? ''

kristi laughed .

`` oh no , i 'm about to lose another one to dr. nadeen 's charms , huh ? ''

shaking her head wildly , megan replied , `` no , no , we 're just friends-i do n't feel anything like that for him . ''
