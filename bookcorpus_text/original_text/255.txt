i got my ged , and told myself i 'd take a year to learn some more about programming before applying to college .

i took some courses in the city , and found out that i was pretty damn good at the whole thing .

the app craze was only just about to take off as i put together my first real project .

with a little bit of luck , and a whole lot of venture capital backing , the thing took off .

i sold my app , made a ton .

overnight , everything was different .

so instead of going to college , i just kept building , and thinking , and meeting new people .

eventually , i ran into cooper , and he all but handed the european offices of bastian to me on a silver platter .

i 've been there for a couple of years , and it 's been amazing . ''

`` so you 're telling me that you went from bad boy jock to tech millionaire ? ''

i ask , staring at him across the table .

`` close , '' he says , unable to contain his proud but modest smile .

`` i went from bad boy jock to tech billionaire . ''

my eyes go wide as i try to comprehend the thing he 's just told me .

emerson 's smile fades as i sit silently beside him .

`` sorry , was that a total asshole move ? ''

he asks , frowning , `` i do n't know what i was thinking , just bringing that up- '' `` no , emerson , '' i say quickly , reaching for his hand before i can stop myself .

`` it 's amazing .

i 'm just so , so proud of you . ''

in unison , we glance down at our now-clasped hands on the table .

bashful as ever , i lift my fingers away .

my skin tingles where it glanced against his .

as if i did n't have enough reason to be nervous around him before , now it turns out that he 's not only my long-lost first love , but also a goddamn billionaire ?

this is shaping up to be quite a week , i 'll tell you .

`` but ... what about you ? ''

emerson says , breaking the pointed silence , `` how did things play out for you ? ''

`` well , '' i begin , taking a nice big sip of my drink .

`` from the point of our parents ' disastrous one-day marriage , my dad totally wiped out .

relapsed harder than ever .

really just never recovered .

my grandparents took me in until high school was over , and then i moved to the city to study at the new school with riley .

we 've been living together ever since , in this great place my grandparents own ... ugh .

sorry .

i sound like such a mooch . ''

`` no , not at all , '' emerson assures me , `` you 've got to use the resources you have , right ? ''

`` i 'll take that , '' i smile .

`` what else ... i studied graphic design and digital media , got my masters , and voila !

here i am . ''

`` design , huh ?

so you still get to be an artist , '' he says , his eyes resting warmly on my face .

i smile , touched that he 's remembered my childhood passion .

`` in a way , yes , '' i reply .

`` and i guess you 'll be seeing a lot more of my work soon , what with your kind of being my boss and all . ''

`` i 'm your colleague , not your boss , '' emerson insists .

`` uh-huh .

sure , '' i tease , `` whatever you say , boss . ''

`` careful , lackey , '' he shoots back , jumping on my joke , `` or i 'll have to dock your pay . ''

`` ooh , i 'm shaking in my panties , '' i snicker .

my cheeks flame red as i realize that it 's taken me all of five minutes to bring my panties into the conversation .

`` relax , '' emerson chuckles , seeing my face .

`` this is n't courtney haines ' house party .

i 'm not gon na make you hand them over or anything .

unless you really want to . ''

`` duly noted , '' i tell him , all but swigging my martini .

`` i hear she 's on broadway now , '' emerson goes on , glancing down at his drink .

`` really , '' i say , feeling an old trill of jealousy run through me as i remember the redheaded beauty who snagged emerson 's attention all those years ago .

`` yeah .

almost won a tony and everything , '' emerson says , plucking up his olive and popping it into his mouth .

`` maybe i should call her up and see how she 's doing ? ''

i 'm about to say something polite and change the subject , until i see the look in emerson 's gorgeous blue eyes .

`` are you baiting me , sawyer ? ''

i ask .

`` is it working , rowan ? ''

he winks .

`` you 're terrible , '' i inform him , relieved that he was n't serious about courtney .

`` it 's true , '' he sighs dramatically , `` some things never change . ''

`` besides , there surely is n't room for courtney in your harem , '' i go on , `` with your whole gorgeous bad boy billionaire thing , you 've probably got a girlfriend for every day of the week . ''
