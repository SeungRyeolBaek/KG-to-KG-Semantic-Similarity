i 'll be out in just a moment . ''

as pesh finished and climbed into the front seat , megan hurried to get her jeans up .

once she had them buttoned and zipped , she smoothed down her hair that had to look like she had just been f**ked against an airplane seat .

she slid into the passenger seat to find that pesh had opened the driver 's side and was talking to trace .

trace 's gaze left pesh 's and came to hers .

it took only a few seconds for him to put two and two together of what had actually been going on .

he slowly started backing away from the plane .

`` yeah , well , you two have a nice day then , '' he said .

`` same to you , '' megan called , trying not to start giggling again .

pesh shook his head as he hopped down out of the plane .

`` come on .

let 's go before we get in any more trouble . ''

`` but getting in trouble is so much fun , '' megan protested , as she opened her door .

he grinned at her as he came around to meet her .

`` you , my lovely , are a very bad influence . ''

he wrapped his arms around her waist , drawing her close to him .

`` but i 'm grateful for every moment i have with you . ''

`` mmm , you know just how to flatter a girl , '' she said , before kissing him .

after a few heated moments , pesh pulled away .

`` considering this hanger has security cameras , let 's not totally give them all our secrets today . ''

megan squealed and covered her mouth .

`` did they ... can they ... ? ''

`` not inside the backseat . ''

she exhaled with relief .

`` thank goodness . ''

he laughed .

`` come on , little troublemaker .

let 's go get something to eat . ''

`` sounds good to me . ''

with a wink , she added , `` especially if there 's dessert ! ''

chapter sixteen a few days after her flying adventure and partial induction in the mile high club , megan had started to take a few scripts to the pharmacy when she was yanked by the arm and dragged into an examining room .

`` what the ? ''

she began , as the door was slammed behind her .

instead of pesh before her , it was kristi .

`` i need to have a word with you . ''

anxiety bubbled in megan 's chest , and she had to take a few deep breaths before she could speak .

`` have i done something wrong with a patient ? ''

kristi shook her head .

`` oh no , this has everything to do with dr .

nadeen . ''

megan 's brows shot up in surprise .

`` pesh ?

what 's wrong with him ? ''

`` it 's not what is wrong with him .

it 's what is wrong with you . ''

megan gulped .

`` me ? ''

kristi nodded .

`` i really like you , megan , but i am worried that you are just playing him .

it is cruel .

he does n't deserve it . ''

`` i do n't know what you mean . ''

`` please do n't play coy .

not only do i have two daughters around your age , but i 've spent enough time working with women to have a pretty good insight into the female mind .

so , i 'll ask once again , what are you doing ? ''

megan squirmed under the heat of kristi 's stare .

if anyone found out that she and pesh were hooking up , it could be very bad for her nursing career .

`` we 're friends .

he 's my cousin 's godfather . ''

kristi rolled her eyes .

`` fine .

let me speak as freely as i can since you insist on playing dumb .

i do n't give two shits if you and pesh are screwing all over this hospital- '' megan was unable to contain her loud gasp .

`` excuse me , but i- '' now it was kristi 's turn to interrupt .

she held up her hands .

`` let me finish please . ''

`` fine , '' megan muttered .

`` i realize that deep down he 's just a man , and after going a long time without sex , it was probably a little easier for him to give in to just a causal relationship with you .

but i 've worked by his side for seven years , so i have a pretty good handle on what he 's truly feeling . ''

`` oh really ? ''

megan countered , unable to stop herself from being snarky .

`` yes , i do .

that man loves you with every fiber of his being . ''

those words caused megan 's steely resolve to fade .

she could n't help staggering a bit on her feet .

she knew that pesh liked her-i mean , any fool could see that .

but love ?

`` h-he does ? ''

`` oh yeah , he does .

he 's been holding a candle for you since the moment you walked in here .

i saw it the first day i introduced you two .

i do n't know what has happened since that day , but i know something has changed for you , too . ''

`` it 's true that i care about him .

he 's the most amazing man i 've ever known . ''
