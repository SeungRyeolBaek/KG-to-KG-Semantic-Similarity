but he was also walking such a fine line with her that he did n't want to come on too strong and scare her off .

`` i 'm not sure your mommy feels up to company . ''

megan smiled .

`` if you really do n't mind staying , we 'd love to have you . ''

`` are you certain ? ''

`` sure . ''

`` okay then . ''

mason grabbed his hand and led him through the door .

pesh took in the cozy decor of the basement apartment .

in one chair , megan 's textbooks and papers were strewn around , while on the floor it looked like a tornado had blown through the living room with all the toys lying around .

when he met her gaze , she flushed .

`` sorry it 's such a mess . ''

`` it 's fine . ''

`` are you hungry ? ''

she asked .

`` no , i 'm good , '' he lied , as his stomach rumbled .

megan cocked her head and shot him a look .

`` sit down and let me fix you something . ''

`` not with you feeling unwell . ''

`` although i wish i could cook you something , i think i 'm up to reheating some of the pizza we ordered today , or there are some homemade enchiladas i made last night , '' she replied , as she opened the fridge .

`` enchiladas would be lovely . ''

she smiled and took out a casserole dish .

`` you hungry , mace ? ''

`` mmm , hmm , '' he murmured , barely looking up at his mother from one of his toys .

after spooning out two heaping plates full , along with some rice , she put it in the microwave .

she then motioned for him to have a seat at the table .

`` you do n't need to wait on me . ''

`` just shut up and let me take care of you for two seconds . ''

her words reminded him of when she had cleaned his wounds after dev 's punch .

no matter what the situation , she was always ready to be there for him and take care of him .

the microwave beeped and brought him out of his thoughts .

mason hurried over to the table and sat down beside pesh in his booster seat .

when megan put down the steaming plates , he reached for her hand and kissed it .

`` thank you . ''

a funny look passed in her eyes before she smiled .

`` you 're welcome . ''

`` wo n't you sit with us ? ''

he asked .

`` actually , i would love to take a warm bath .

you know , to see if it would help relax my muscles . ''

pesh smiled .

`` i 'll be happy to keep an eye on mason while you do that . ''

`` you do n't mind ? ''

`` of course i do n't . ''

`` thanks .

i really appreciate it . ''

she kissed the top of mason 's head , and then kissed his cheek .

she turned to start into the bedroom before whirling back around .

he lowered his fork at the expression on her face .

placing her hands on his cheeks , she leaned in and laid a big one on him .

he could n't hide his surprise .

when she pulled away , she grinned at his speechlessness .

`` i wo n't be long , '' she said .

once the bedroom door closed behind her , pesh gazed over at mason .

`` what do you want to do when we finish eating ? ''

`` minions , '' he mumbled through a mouthful of food .

pesh furrowed his brows in confusion .

`` what 's minions ? ''

hopping down off his chair , mason ran over to the tv .

when he returned , he had a dvd box in his hand .

he pointed to some yellow blobs on the cover .

`` minions . ''

`` ah , i see .

you want to watch this . ''

mason bobbed his head .

`` is it your favorite ? ''

pesh asked .

`` uh , huh , '' mason replied .

`` then i guess we better eat fast so we can watch it . ''

at mason 's beaming grin , pesh felt a little tug in his chest .

even though he should n't , he already had strong feelings for the little boy .

from almost the moment they 'd met , mason had let pesh into his world .

the sound of a fork clattering on a plate brought pesh out of his thoughts .

`` done ! ''

mason exclaimed , hopping out of his chair .

although pesh was n't finished , mason grabbed his hand and led him from the table .

instead of arguing with him , pesh just let himself be dragged over to the tv .

once he got the movie on , they settled down on the couch .

he could n't fight the warmth that spread through his chest when mason snuggled close to his side .

instead , he just embraced the feeling and let happiness override the doubt that screamed in his mind .

under the strong , warm jets of the jacuzzi tub , megan 's pain started to fade .

of course , as much as she tried to relax , it was too hard considering that pesh was in her living room .

she could n't believe that he had shown up out of the blue to check on her .

just when she thought he could n't be any kinder or more attentive , he did something like that .
