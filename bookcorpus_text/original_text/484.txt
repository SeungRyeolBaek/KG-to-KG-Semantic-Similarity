she had a great deal to learn as well .

`` would you all excuse us , please ? ''

zayn said to the room in general .

ella was astonished at how many people were actually in the room .

there were guards she had n't even detected because they were so quiet and still , not to mention the maids and the butler who was supervising breakfast , his personal assistant and one other man but she had no idea what his job was .

when they were finally alone , she turned to face him , pleading with her eyes for him to help her through all of this .

`` zayn , what is happening here ? ''

she demanded .

he moved forward , ignoring her flinch when he touched her cheek .

`` what 's happening is that you and max will come back to tusain with me .

max will learn to be ruler of tusain and you will be my wife . ''

`` no ! ''

she cried out .

she was n't sure which part she objected to the most .

`` we 're not leaving .

and max is too little to be burdened with the task of ruling anything other than his toy trucks . ''

he took her hands in his , not letting her pull away .

`` it has to be like this , ella .

and i know how you feel .

believe me . '

`` no you do n't ! ''

she yelled back .

`` you know nothing about what this is doing to me !

you left me !

twice , you just disappeared .

now you 're coming back and all of a sudden my life is out of control .

max does n't need this .

he needs to go to school , i need to go to work and you need to just leave us alone . ''

zayn wished that were possible .

`` ella , you 're my wife now .

max is my son . ''

she shook her head , denying all of it .

`` what if i told you that max is n't yours ? ''

she asked , wondering if she could convince zayn to just leave them alone .

`` maybe max is someone else 's son . ''

zayn 's anger almost got the better of him but he did n't verbally lash out as he wanted to .

he hated the idea of anyone else touching this woman .

she was his and he would prove it to her once and for all .

with great care , he lowered his head , his lips covering her trembling ones with a barely leashed passion .

when she tried to pull away , he simply put his hands on her hips and pulled her closer , deepening the kiss , sliding his hands underneath her tee-shirt and showing her how intense his need was for her .

when she was trembling in his arms , her fingers moving in his hair , zayn knew that this path was not a good plan .

her response made him lose his own concentration .

pulling back , he cursed under his breath for putting himself into this painful situation .

he did n't want to discuss the problem of their future .

he wanted to make love to her .

he wanted to have her writhing underneath him , begging him to take her to the heights of pleasure .

he looked around , wishing they were already back in tusain .

he could show her his private suite , rooms which would also become her own , and make love to her on satin sheets , or under the stars on his private balcony .

`` zayn , '' she sighed , leaning her forehead against his chest .

`` how can you do this to me so easily ? ''

she whispered as if she were really asking herself that question .

`` this was bad timing , '' he said and stepped back .

taking her hand , he led her over to one of the sofas .

`` you did n't eat anything for breakfast .

are you hungry ? ''

she bowed her head , ashamed that he could do that to her with so little effort and he appeared to be completely unaffected by their kiss .

`` no .

not at all . ''

she scooted far back , not wanting another occurrence of his kiss .

`` look , this is crazy .

max is just a little boy , '' she said with as much control as possible .

`` i know you want him in your life , but perhaps ... '' `` i know what you 're going to say , ella , '' zayn interrupted her .

`` but i ca n't just walk away .

would you ?

could you actually leave your son , leave max , and only have weekend visits occasionally ? ''

she sighed , accepting that he was right .

`` no .

i could n't do that .

and i 'm very sorry for even suggesting that you do the same . ''

she looked up at him , pleading with him for sanity .

`` so what 's going to happen ? ''

he took her hand and pulled her down so they were sitting next to each other .

`` we fly back to tusain today .

he 'll have special tutors , classes that will teach him how to rule and he will be raised as my heir . ''

she swallowed painfully .

`` and what role will i have in all of this ?

do i have a say in how he is raised ?

or have i lost all my rights now ? ''

the realization that she was even thinking in that way frustrated him .
