i exclaim , `` but- '' `` we 're sticking to the plan , '' he says firmly .

`` tomorrow , when you 're no longer a the younger woman , it 'll be a different story . ''

`` ugghh , '' i groan , burying my face in my hands .

`` guess you have a lot more will power than i do , then , '' i tell him .

`` i like the thrill of the chase , '' he grins .

`` hey , '' i say , with mock sternness , `` do n't torment me , now , or i wo n't give you your real birthday present . ''

`` you got me a present ? ''

he asks , seeming genuinely touched .

`` it 's nothing , really , '' i reply , wanting to temper his expectations some .

`` just ... i thought you might like it , so ... '' `` well , come on then ! ''

he exclaims , sitting upright , `` show me the goods ! ''

`` are n't you supposed to be a grownup now or something , emerson ? ''

i shoot back , feigning impatience as i swing my feet over onto the floor .

really , i think his enthusiasm is downright adorable .

`` nah .

i do n't plan on being a grownup anytime soon .

being a legal adult is n't going to change that , '' he declares .

`` hey , we should drink to that . ''

`` drink ? ''

i ask , as i grab my backpack off the floor .

`` i know your dad just keeps this stuff in the house for company , '' emerson goes on , snatching up his own overnight bag , `` so i figured he would n't mind if we pilfered some .

dude had , like , twenty bottles in the basement .

how 's that for willpower ? ''

i watch as emerson produces a bottle of champagne , and ca n't help but giggle .

`` how fancy of you , '' i say .

`` what ?

does n't champagne in a motel room just scream class to you ? ''

he shoots back , searching around his bag for an opener .

`` or something like that , '' i say , my fingers finally closing around the sketchbook i 've been hunting for .

i pull out the thick , weathered book as emerson pops open the bottle and pours us each a styrofoam cup of the bubbly .

`` here you go , ma'am , '' he smiles , handing me some champagne .

`` to not becoming grownups until they literally force us to , '' he says , holding up his cup .

`` here , here ! ''

i laugh , touching the lip of my cup to his .

the fizzy wine tickles my nose as i take a sip , savoring the sweetness .

`` thanks for the booze , dad , '' i add , tipping my cup in the general direction of our hometown .

`` oh no , '' emerson groans , glancing down at my hands , `` tell me you did n't get me a book for my birthday . ''

`` first of all , what 's so bad about getting a book as a present ?

that 's , like , the best present on the planet , '' i reply , and before he can protest i add , `` secondly , it 's not a book .

it 's just in a book .

here ... '' he watches as i peel open the well-loved pages .

somehow , this feels nearly as intimate as what just went down between us on the bed .

i hardly ever show my sketchbook to anyone , yet here i am , flipping through the pages as emerson looks on .

sharing my art with someone has always felt impossible , something that required far too much trust for me to be able to do .

but emerson 's teaching me that trust is n't something that 's off-limits to me just because of my history .

and i 'm even starting to believe him .

`` are those all yours ? ''

he asks , his eyes glued to the pages .

`` yep , '' i reply , `` all of them . ''

`` they 're amazing , '' he says reverently , as i linger on a drawing of a stylized , distorted landscape .

`` please tell me you 're going to major in art when you go to school in the fall . ''

`` oh , i do n't know , '' i demur , `` i might try and focus on something a little more practical . ''

`` fuck practical .

these are incredible drawings , '' he exclaims .

`` well ... who knows ? ''

i allow , `` it 's not like there are any real jobs out there anyway , right ?

might as well major in something i actually like . ''

`` that 's the spirit .

i think , '' emerson replies .

finally , i come to the sketch i 've been looking for .

it 's right at the end of the book , my most recent finished piece .

drawing a steadying breath , i turn the sketchbook around and pass it to emerson .

his eyes fall on the elaborate sketch and go wide .

he drinks in the image for a long moment before finally looking up at me .

`` is this ... ? ''

he asks .

`` it is , '' i assure him , smiling at his amazement .

`` it 's you . ''

we study the drawing together .
