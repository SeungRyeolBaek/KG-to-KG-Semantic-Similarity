how was it possible for someone to remind him so much of what he had lost ?

aidan grinned as he glanced between the two of them .

`` i wanted to introduce you to pesh nadeen , the godfather . ''

thrusting out her hand , megan smiled warmly at him .

`` it 's very nice to finally meet you . ''

he stared at it a moment before his good manners overrode his shock .

he took her hand in his and shook it .

`` it 's very nice meeting you , too . ''

`` i 'll leave you two to get to know each other , '' aidan said .

before pesh could protest , aidan turned and disappeared into the crowd .

he turned to megan and tried clearing his throat of what felt like a wad of sawdust .

he knew he should try to make polite conversation , but he was still so shell-shocked by the way megan looked .

finally , she took pity on him .

`` so , emma tells me you 're a doctor . ''

pesh smiled politely .

`` yes , i am . ''

`` what type of medicine ? ''

`` emergency services . ''

megan 's face lit up .

`` oh , how interesting .

i 'm about to finish nursing school , and i 've asked for clinical placement in the er . ''

pesh widened his eyes in surprise .

aidan had failed to mention that they had the medical profession in common .

`` really ? ''

megan nodded .

`` i 'm hoping to get placed at grady , even though my parents would die a thousand deaths . ''

he cocked his brows at her .

`` i assume they 're afraid for your safety ? ''

`` yes .

they ca n't help worrying about the neighborhood .

they sometimes forget i 'm an adult , rather than a child . ''

`` what is it about grady that attracts you ? ''

`` besides the fact that it 's nationally recognized for its er ? ''

he smiled .

`` yes , besides the accolades . ''

megan tilted her head in thought .

`` i guess it 's the fact i really want to feel like i 'm making a difference and saving lives .

i feel like at grady i would be seeing some of the worst cases imaginable , and in turn some people who really do n't have a lot of hope . ''

he was taken aback by her words and the passion with which she delivered them .

while she possessed a beautiful exterior , she certainly seemed to have a greater depth of character than he had originally expected .

he did n't often meet someone like her .

most of the women at the hospital who threw themselves at him possessed only surface beauty .

he did n't have to be with them very long to perceive their true shallowness and self-centeredness .

to them , he was a prize to be won .

he could n't ever imagine megan feeling that way .

she was n't the type of woman to care about a trophy man on her arm-she wanted to make her own way in the world .

`` it is so good to hear someone speak with such passion about nursing . ''

`` really ? ''

he nodded .

`` we desperately need more people like you .

i know i would love to work alongside someone who had your passion . ''

she smiled at his compliments .

he could n't help noticing what a nice smile she had .

the way it framed her heart shaped face made her appear much less like jade than he had originally thought .

`` thank you .

maybe we 'll end up together . ''

she licked her lips before adding , `` you know , at the same hospital . ''

`` i would like that .

but i 'm afraid that wellstar pales in comparison to grady . ''

`` surely the suburbs offer some interesting cases ? ''

`` they do .

i 've been there since my residency , so i ca n't imagine working anywhere else .

after all , i would n't be standing here today with you if it were n't for wellstar and your grandfather . ''

`` that 's true . ''

tilting her head , she gave him a very alluring smile .

`` and what a pity that would be if our paths had n't crossed . ''

he sucked in a breath at the directness of her statement .

could she really be interested in him ?

sure , it was common knowledge that aidan and others wanted them to get together , but he had imagined that she had not known their intentions .

and while originally he had been turned off by aidan 's suggestion of fixing them up , he could n't help but be intrigued now .

there was something so refreshingly different about megan , despite her physical similarities to jade .

`` mommy ! ''

a small voice cried .

pesh glanced over megan 's shoulder where a fair-haired toddler came bounding over .

he wrapped his arms around megan 's thigh .

she gave him an apologetic look before bending over .

`` what 's the matter , sweetie ? ''

he grinned up at her .

`` miss you . ''

with a smile , she bent over and picked him up .

when he sat on her hip , she turned her attention back to pesh .

`` this is my son , mason . ''

pesh could n't help noticing how megan searched his face to see if there was any judgment or even disgust at her having a son .
