the crowd seemed to read something else into it , as it appeared that she was playing hard to get , evading his roving hands and prancing away as she continued singing , only to be followed by him time and again .

each time our eyes met i kept my face neutral , i did n't want to spoil her performance and like i said if this was part of her job then so be it .

but what i did n't like was the way he tried to manhandle her on the stage when it had nothing to do with their routine .

do n't ask me how i knew those times so well .

i was reading her body language sure , but each time it happened she 'd send me a look and it would tip me off .

i was n't mad at her though , not really , but him i 'd like to stomp into the f**king mud .

i left my seat and headed backstage just before the last number ended .

i cold hear the roar of the crowd as she bid them goodnight for the second time after giving them the encore they 'd asked for .

i was in the shadows sort of , behind this huge potted plant , when she came back followed by the rest of the band , and the ass**le. ``

hey i 'm talking to you . ''

he reached out to grab her arm and she pulled it out of his reach .

`` the show is over donnie we have nothing more to say to each other for the rest of the night . ''

`` that 's what you think .

where did you get this ? ''

he tried touching the mark i 'd left on her neck .

she slapped her hand over it and backed up .

`` that 's none of your business . ''

`` it is my business when my woman is sporting a hickey from some other dude . ''

`` your woman , are you insane ?

we 've been over for months now would you please get out of my way ? ''

she tried going around him and by this point i 'd seen all i needed to .

i started forward but before i could reach them he 'd reached out and grabbed her and was trying to kiss her .

the amazing this was that there were others heading backstage and no one seemed to witness the almost assault that was taking place right in front of them .

that could be because their voices had been kept low throughout this whole exchange .

as soon as his hand fisted in her blouse i was on him .

`` get the f**k off her ass**le . ''

i flung his hand away and got between the two of them .

you could say i was pissed but trying to contain it .

i was no longer angry about the display on stage , i knew that was all him and though the world might see a very well coordinated dance routine , that 's all that it was .

but this was something more , this was personal and this i would not allow .

`` who the f**k are you , shiane who 's this ass**le ?

is he new security ?

tell him who i am before i sue his ass . ''

`` listen you little shit , if you come anywhere near her again i 'll break every bone in your f**king body . ''

he looked at her wide eyed when he realized i meant every word .

then he stupidly reached out for her again , grabbing her hand this time and i saw red .

i punched him in the face until blood spurted from his mouth .

only the fact that he was so much younger than i , kept me from following through .

i grabbed her hand and pulled her out behind me mad as hell .

i did n't have a jacket to give her this time but thankfully she was more covered up .

`` did you leave anything back there that you needed ? ''

i asked her after we were in the back of the car on the way home .

she called one of her assistants to gather her shit .

that night i f**ked her like a beast , there was n't any part of her body that i did n't lick bite or kiss .

at one point she 'd cried because it was too much .

i ate her little pu**y until the sting was eased and then slid back into her .

we were both sore by the time i rolled away from her as the sun was rising .

dragging her into my arms i cuddled her as we slept .

the next day i was all over the f**king front page , just what i needed .

some hack had been there taking pictures of the whole thing and the story broke .

that 's how we were found out and since that night we could n't leave the house for weeks without a camera in our face .

things cooled down when they realized they were n't gon na get anything more from us and my security was very good at evading their asses .

they had no access to my private underground parking garage and since i had a whole fleet of cars to choose from they never knew which one we were in if i felt like taking my woman out for dinner .

since i did n't frequent the kind of establishments that catered to the paparazzi or that hired people who 'd tip them off to us being there , we were left relatively in peace after the hubbub had died down chapter 10 now it 's the night of the last show and she was pissing me off .
