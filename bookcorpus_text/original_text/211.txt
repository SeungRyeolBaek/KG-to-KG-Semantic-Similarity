`` ma'am ? ''

he teases .

`` let 's just get this over with , '' i grumble , storming past him to the closet door .

the crowd makes kissy noises as i wrench open the door and march inside with emerson on my heels .

as i step into the space , i 'm taken aback .

i was expecting some kind of coat closet , with barely enough room to move around .

but of course , courtney 's closet is an enormous walk-in affair , with rows and rows of clothing , shoes , and accessories lining the huge space .

her closet is fancier , and perhaps even as big , as my bedroom at home .

there are golden-plated fixtures , a sparkly chandelier hanging overhead , and a decadent , velvet fainting sofa standing front-and-center .

emerson steps up beside me as both of our gazes fall on the couch .

we steal simultaneous glances at each other , then quickly look away .

my cheeks flame red as i try and dislodge the sexy image playing out in my mind 's eye : emerson laying me out across that sofa , ripping my clothes off , and having his way with me as the smooth velvet upholstery caresses my bare skin .

he , on the other hand , is probably preoccupied with counting down the minutes before this little joke is over .

`` see ?

this is why i never come to parties , '' i murmur , crossing my arms tightly across my chest .

`` really ?

i thought it was 'cause no one ever asked you to , '' he says wryly , taking a seat on the fainting sofa and stretching out his long , toned body .

tormenting me , is more like it .

`` i would have expected you to have better plans , at least , '' i reply .

`` we need to start coordinating with each other so this does n't happen . ''

`` what , this ? ''

he asks , gesturing around at the closet as our seven minutes unfold .

`` not this specifically , '' i say , rolling my eyes , `` i just mean we should avoid seeing each other any more than we absolutely have to .

especially now that you and your mother ... '' i trail off , shaking my head .

`` since we what ? ''

emerson snaps , suddenly on the defensive , `` invaded your precious ivory tower ? ''

i bite my lip , intimidated by his heated tone .

my dad and deborah have recently decided to move in together .

or rather , they 've decided that deborah and emerson are going to move in with us .

they 're going to rent out their apartment on the other side of town and shack up in our place for the time being .

one big , utterly strange , less-than-happy family .

as if crushing on emerson was n't weird enough for me , now the object of my unfortunate desire is going to be sleeping under the same roof , as well .

college really ca n't start soon enough for me .

`` you have to admit , it 's kind of strange , '' i murmur , averting my eyes .

`` dad and deborah 's whole thing , i mean .

they 've known each other for , what , two months ?

and they 're already moving in together ? ''

`` my mom 's a crazy , impulsive bitch , '' emerson shrugs , `` and your dad seems like someone who does whatever the fuck he wants without thinking about the consequences .

what about this is surprising to you ? ''

`` good point , '' i laugh hollowly , daring to sit on the very edge of the couch beside him .

the mere proximity of his body to mine has my stomach twisting in anxious knots .

has it been seven minutes yet or what ?

`` well , '' emerson sighs , swinging his legs around so that he 's sitting beside me .

`` are we gon na get it on now or what ? ''

`` ugh , '' i groan , giving him a shove , `` stop it , would you ?

why do you get so much pleasure out of making me miserable ? ''

`` i do n't , '' he replies , `` it 's just so goddamn easy that i ca n't help myself .

how the hell did you get to be such a little prude ? ''

`` who says i 'm a prude ? ''

i shoot back , `` you do n't know anything about my life . ''

`` i know that i 've never seen you even talk to a guy , '' emerson shoots back .

`` what 're you , keeping track of my lovers or something ? ''

i reply .

`` get a life , sawyer . ''

of course , i do n't mind at all that emerson 's taking notice of my love life , paltry though it may be .

as insane as it is , i ca n't help but hope that there 's some chance he could come to feel the same way about me as i do him .

call me a dreamer , i guess .

a dirty dreamer .

`` what are brothers for ? ''

emerson grins , slipping an arm around my waist .

my head sets to spinning as the nearness of him entrances me .

i look up at his gorgeous , sculpted face , mere inches away from my own .

i 've never been this close to him before .

i memorize the contours of his perfect features-his high cheekbones , his aquiline nose , the scruff along his razor sharp jaw , and of course those dark blue eyes .
