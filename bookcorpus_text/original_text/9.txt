he liked the feel of her against him a little too much .

it made him want to draw her into his embrace ... maybe do other things that he should n't be thinking when he was in a church .

glancing over her shoulder at him , she joked , `` jeez , you 're like a giant standing next to me . ''

`` am i ? ''

he had n't noticed the differences in their heights-he 'd been focusing on her too much .

she laughed .

`` just a little bit .

of course , it does n't take much for someone to make me look short . ''

`` you look perfect to me , '' he said sincerely .

craning her neck back to look at him , she gave him a teasing grin .

`` do i ?

are you flirting with me , dr .

nadeen ? ''

he stared down at his feet , trying to avoid the heat of her stare .

he tried to hide the red flush he felt entering his cheeks .

`` okay , now just with the godmother , '' the photographer ordered .

reluctantly , pesh stepped away from megan .

as the flashes went off , snapping hers and noah 's picture , he kept his gaze on her .

as she focused on the camera , megan 's blue eyes sparkled as she stretched her face into a wide grin .

noah 's tiny fingers wrapped around some of the strands of her hair , causing megan to yelp in pain .

`` easy now .

i got ta keep that , '' she said to noah .

`` okay , that should get it , '' the photographer said .

`` here godfather , it 's your turn , '' megan said , as she handed noah to him .

by now , noah was tired of being held and tired of being ensconced in yards of lace .

he peered up at pesh before howling .

`` i 'm sorry , little guy , '' he cooed , trying to bounce noah in his arms .

as noah continued to cry , pesh looked apologetically at the photographer .

just before he was ready to give up , megan came up and started clapping her hands and making noises at noah .

the baby instantly stopped crying .

`` that 's right , noah .

give me a smile , '' megan urged , as she backed up to stand by the photographer .

she continued making the noises , and she even resorted to flashing one of the strands of her hair at him .

finally , noah 's quivering lips broke into a grin .

`` there we go , '' the photographer said .

pesh quickly plastered a smile on his face .

after several flashes went off , the photographer put down his camera .

`` got it . ''

both noah and pesh sighed in relief .

gazing down at him , pesh asked , `` bet you 're ready to get home and get out of that dress , huh ? ''

`` it 's a gown , not a dress , '' megan countered with a smile .

he laughed .

`` regardless of what it 's called , i do n't think he likes it very much . ''

megan brought some of the lace between her fingers .

`` probably a little itchy for him . ''

`` did your son wear this gown ? ''

`` no , this is aidan 's gown .

mason wore my mother 's , which my brothers and i also wore . ''

`` i see . ''

`` in your culture do they do anything special like this for a baby ? ''

pesh nodded .

`` we have the namakaran , or naming ceremony .

it 's sometimes held in a temple .

and like this , it 's all about offering blessings to the child-family and friends coming together in support of the new baby . ''

`` i like it . ''

they were momentarily interrupted by aidan and emma walking up .

noah immediately reached out for emma .

`` such a mama 's boy , '' aidan muttered , which earned him a glare from emma .

he merely winked at her in response before starting down the aisle .

pesh saw megan 's mother beckoning her with a wave .

`` guess you need to go , '' he said .

`` but i 'll see you at aidan and emma 's , right ? ''

she asked .

he swallowed hard .

`` um , yes , i 'll be there . ''

`` good , '' she replied , with an alluring smile .

she gave him a small wave before walking off to join her parents .

shaking his head , he mumbled , `` this is trouble . ''

chapter four when megan arrived with her parents at aidan and emma 's , she was surprised to see a catering truck outside in the driveway .

her surprise continued once she got inside the house .

gazing out into the backyard , she saw where tables were set up alongside the pool .

the tables were adorned with blue and white tablecloths and glittering blue and white centerpieces .

a low whistle behind her got megan 's attention .

turning around , she saw casey shaking her head .

`` wow , this is one epic baptism party , '' she remarked .

`` it 's impressive .

that 's for sure , '' megan agreed .

as emma breezed into the kitchen with noah in a more comfortable outfit , casey cocked her head .

`` so , i was just wondering where the ice sculptures were ? ''

pink tinged emma 's cheeks .
