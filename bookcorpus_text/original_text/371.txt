`` you can tell him apart by the wiggle in his nose , '' she teased , `` and by the darker eyes .

he has slightly darker hair as well . ''

turning to malik she said , `` they 're fraternal twins but they 're so alike that they are almost identical .

and they already like tricking people who ca n't tell them apart as well .

right boys ? ''

she asked and winked at them as they grinned up at her .

`` guys , '' she said , pulling their attention away from the bags in front of them , `` remember how i told you that your daddy was a very busy man ? ''

when she received a nod from both , she went on , `` well , he 's really sorry and he 's here now . ''

she turned to malik and took a deep breath .

`` this is your father , guys . ''

the boys did n't react at all .

they continued to stare up at him , their blank faces not really showing anything at all .

siri glanced at malik , who was staring right back at them , with an identical expression on his face as well .

`` so ? ''

she said , just to break the silence .

`` are you guys okay with us sharing our lives with your dad ?

he 's come an awfully long way just to meet you . ''

sam was the first to speak .

`` momma says we ca n't go around naked . ''

he turned to malik as if seeking confirmation .

`` but you were naked last night .

does that mean you 'll let me go naked too ? ''

of all the things she 'd thought they might say when they first met their father , siri could honestly say that question was the absolute last thing she would have guessed that he would ask .

her mouth fell open and she stared , wondering what the best way to answer her son was under this situation .

malik , bless his heart , spoke up and gave the answer that made her heart melt just a little bit towards him .

`` if your mom says that we ca n't go around naked , then we ca n't do that . ''

sam 's crestfallen face only lasted for a moment before he perked up and thought up his next question .

`` are you going to come to school with us today ?

momma always comes to school and gives us a hug and a kiss before we can go play .

she makes us , '' he replied with a grimace on his cute little face .

siri bent over his head and gave him a big , loud smooch .

`` and do n't you forget it ! ''

she said and tickled his tummy .

`` but we 're not going to school today .

you 're going to spend some time with your dad . ''

she looked up and glanced at malik , then pulled her eyes quickly away , afraid of the way he was looking at her right now .

she could n't tell if he was admiring the way she treated the boys , or if he was just amused by her teasing .

`` what did you bring for breakfast ? ''

she asked , trying to distract him .

he continued looking down at her for a moment , then he pushed himself away from the counter and picked up the bags .

`` i actually have no idea .

i told the chef to make something for kids and adults . ''

siri grimaced and peered into the bags .

`` what do you think , guys ?

do we trust him ?

he 's not used to being a dad .

he might have really gone off the mark here . ''

she almost laughed when they both looked into the bag , bumping their heads in their eagerness to find out what was inside .

malik chuckled and carefully took the bag away , pulling out several boxes with an elaborate label on the front .

`` let 's see how badly i did on my first try . ''

he opened one box and raised his eyebrows , then handed it to siri .

`` this is probably for you . ''

he pulled out another one and looked at the contents and smiled slightly .

`` i think this is probably a good meal for a cute kid , '' he said and glanced at sam and jacob , both eager with wide eyes , the anticipation making their little bodies wiggle in excitement .

he handed the box to jacob who took it with a distracted `` thank you ! ''

before he peered inside .

`` cool ! ''

he exclaimed and grinned over at sam who was leaning as far over the table as possible so he could see inside the box .

`` its pancakes in the shape of different kinds of animals ! ''

he exclaimed .

sam looked up at malik , his eyes pleading for something just as interesting .

malik pulled out the next box and peered inside .

`` yep , this is another one for a kid , '' he said and handed the box to sam .

`` awesome ! ''

sam said as he happily clapped his hands over his own box of animal shaped pancakes .

the last box he kept for himself , not even bothering to look inside as he turned to siri , winking at her amused expression as her sons dug into the pancakes without even bothering to wait for the syrup .

`` they 're made of tofu and i think the chef even put a bit of flax seed in them , '' malik whispered in her ear , then nibbled slightly , sending shivers throughout her whole body .
