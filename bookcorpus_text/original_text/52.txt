`` you okay over there ? ''

she grinned .

`` are you kidding me ?

this is amazing . ''

`` i 'm glad to hear you like it .

i did n't know if you were going to take after your uncle aidan . ''

`` i hear you gave him drugs to make it . ''

pesh laughed .

`` yeah , i did .

he slept most of the way there . ''

`` total wuss , '' she remarked with a smile .

after adjusting one of the controls , pesh said , `` well , i have to admit that my late wife was n't a fan , either .

she tolerated flying with me because she knew how much i loved it , but most of the time , she 'd take a pill to relax . ''

`` so she did n't share your passion ? ''

`` no , she did n't .

she always encouraged me to do what i loved .

she never was one to make me choose between her or something else .

she was that sacrificing . ''

`` that was really amazing of her to be that giving . ''

when pesh remained silent , megan knew it was time for a conversation change .

`` now that i know we 're going to savannah , are you going to tell me where we 're going for dinner ? ''

he smiled .

`` it 'll probably be a late lunch when we get there . ''

`` so , where will our late lunch be ? ''

`` do you like the historic district ? ''

`` i love it . ''

`` good .

i 've picked a restaurant there for us . ''

`` do you come to savannah often ? ''

`` a couple of times a year , mainly for medical conferences on the coast . ''

`` and you always fly ? ''

`` i do , '' he replied , with a smile .

the flight took less time than she thought , and with clear weather , it was totally smooth .

as they started making their descent , pesh glanced over at her .

`` are you ready for the landing ? ''

`` sure .

why would n't i be ? ''

`` it can be a little intense for some people .

you see a lot more of the ground rushing at you than when you 're in a 747 . ''

she cocked her head at him .

`` i went skydiving , remember ? ''

`` ah , that 's right . ''

with a wink , he added , `` you 're my little adrenaline junkie . ''

megan laughed .

`` i was .

not anymore . ''

`` what changed all that ? ''

`` mason .

when you 're responsible for the health , safety , and happiness of someone else , your entire perspective changes . ''

`` he 's a true gift . ''

she jerked her gaze to him .

`` yes , he is . ''

pesh gave her a small smile before radioing the tower .

once he had clearance to land , they started rapidly losing altitude .

the runway got closer and closer until the plane jolted forward and then began skidding along the pavement .

when it finally came to a shuddering stop , megan exhaled the breath she 'd been holding .

`` still okay ? ''

pesh asked .

she grinned .

`` never better . ''

the sound of the tower came in her headset as pesh listened to the instructions .

the plane started rolling toward one of the hangers .

once he had parked and powered down the plane , he got out to help her .

after a quick talk with a member of the grounds crew , pesh took her hand and led her out of the hanger .

a cab waited to take them into the city .

she laughed as she slid across the seat .

`` what ? ''

pesh asked .

`` i 'm surprised by the cab .

i thought you might really go upscale by having a limo or chauffeur-driven car pick us up . ''

`` i like to stay humble , '' he replied with a wink .

she shook her head at him before turning to gaze out the window at the scenery .

when they began winding through the antebellum homes of the historic district , megan felt her stomach growl .

she 'd been too nervous to eat breakfast , and then she had n't dared eat at chuck e. cheese 's .

the cab stopped outside a chic looking restaurant .

as pesh paid the driver , megan hopped out and took in the sights around her .

she loved the old world feel of the city with all its history and charm .

pesh offered her his arm , and then they walked inside .

the restaurant 's popularity was evident in how crowded it was even at four in the afternoon .

they were ushered to a quiet , candlelit table .

`` wine ? ''

pesh asked .

`` yes please . ''

`` white okay ? ''

`` sure . ''

after the waiter left with their drink order , megan surveyed the menu and sighed .

`` everything looks so good . ''

glancing over his menu at her , pesh said , `` with the cuisine being southern , i imagined you would like it . ''

`` i love all types of food .

trust me , as hungry as i am now , i would have eaten anywhere . ''

the waiter returned with their wine , and megan knew she needed to make a decision .

`` i 'll have the shrimp and grits , please . ''
