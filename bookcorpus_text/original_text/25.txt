a red flush entered aidan 's cheeks .

`` um , well , i have n't actually mentioned it to her . ''

`` you do n't think your wife needs to know about such a life-altering decision ? ''

`` well , of course i 'd tell her before i went in for the surgery . ''

as pesh crossed his arms over his chest , he could n't help wondering just how hard aidan had been hit in the head .

`` you can not seriously be sitting there saying that . ''

aidan stared at pesh for a moment before he groaned .

`` oh man , i 'm being a giant , selfish tool about this , are n't i ? ''

pesh smiled .

`` pretty much . ''

aidan rubbed his hand over his eyes .

`` it 's just ... being a father is f**king scary sometimes .

i worry about noah constantly , and now there 's another baby in the mix .

plus , another baby means more time taken away from emma . ''

he gave a weak smile .

`` i love her so much .

sometimes ... i just ca n't get enough of her , and i do n't want to share . ''

`` i think that 's a perfectly normal feeling . ''

aidan shook his head .

`` it makes me sound like a selfish bastard .

i mean , who is jealous of their kid for taking their wife 's time ? ''

`` a lot of men .

so stop beating yourself up over what you 're feeling .

most of all , do n't bottle it up .

talk to emma . ''

aidan 's blue eyes widened as he shook his head furiously back and forth .

`` oh hell no , i do n't want her thinking badly of me . ''

`` she wo n't .

emma always appreciates honesty . ''

`` about me being jealous of her time with our kids ?

i 'm pretty sure she would not want me being honest about that . ''

`` what has emma always said is the most important thing in a relationship ? ''

`` trust . ''

pesh nodded .

`` so how are you building her trust by lying to her about your feelings ? ''

aidan 's blonde brows furrowed .

`` so i should just tell her i 'm afraid of losing her and that i want us to maximize our time together ? ''

`` i would think so .

i do n't think any woman could get angry hearing her husband say how much he loves her and wants to be with her . ''

aidan appeared thoughtful .

`` i guess you 're right . ''

pesh smiled as he patted aidan 's shoulder reassuringly .

`` you 're doing a wonderful job being a father .

i 'm sure you 'll do just as well with a second and maybe even a third child . ''

at the mention of a third child , aidan swallowed hard , his adam 's apple bobbing up and down .

`` i do n't mind a third kid ... just not now .

maybe in a couple of years . ''

he glanced up and smiled at pesh .

`` but thanks for the vote of confidence on me being a father . ''

`` i just call it as i see it . ''

`` i appreciate that . ''

`` how about i check on your head now ? ''

aidan nodded .

`` okay . ''

pesh started feeling for unusual lumps and bumps on aidan 's head .

`` hmm , i do n't feel anything abnormal .

but just to be on the safe side , i want you to have a ct scan to rule out concussion or any brain bleeds . ''

`` jesus , i could have all of that from just hitting my head ? ''

`` you would be surprised .

let me go call in the order , and they 'll come take you back .

hopefully you wo n't have too long a wait .

we 're usually slower during the afternoons when the doctors ' offices and imaging centers are open . ''

as he started for the door , aidan stopped him .

`` hey , man , with all the craziness , i almost forgot to ask how is megan doing with her placement ? ''

pesh did n't have to think twice before responding , `` she is going to make an incredible nurse . ''

aidan grinned .

`` i 'm glad to hear it .

not that i ever doubted her abilities .

it 's just good to hear her praises sung by a doctor . ''

popping pesh on the chest teasingly with his hand , aidan asked , `` how 's it going between you and megan ? ''

pesh almost laughed out loud at aidan 's forthrightness .

it was not in his nature to be so blunt , and after megan turning him down yet again , he was n't really sure how to answer .

`` i truly respect and admire megan . ''

he considered that the most diplomatic way to answer her uncle 's enquiry .

despite feeling glad that he obviously had earned his friend 's respect , he would n't say anything untoward about megan in front of him .

it is her business who she did or did n't date .

`` that 's not what i meant . ''

`` i did n't imagine it was . ''

aidan eyed him before saying , `` look i know you got off to a rocky start , but it 's not hopeless .

are you planning on asking her out ? ''

`` you 're not letting this go , are you ? ''
