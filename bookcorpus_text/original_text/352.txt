he seemed to be meeting with very high level people , but he was n't a name dropper , so she did n't know who he met with or why .

she knew he was extremely wealthy because his 'apartment ' was the penthouse of one of the most expensive buildings in the city .

she also knew that he had several body guards and he had n't arranged for the limousine for her benefit , but because that was simply the way he traveled .

she did n't ask many questions about that either , not sure she wanted the answers .

six months into the affair , she was coming out of the bathroom , snuggled into his enormous white robe and rubbing her hair with a towel after her shower .

she 'd woken about a half hour ago after spending the night in malik 's arms .

she had n't gotten much sleep , but she did n't come here for sleep .

she came to be with him , to make love with him and enjoy his company .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

she asked when he walked into the room , wearing only a pair of jeans .

he pulled her into his arms and kissed her .

`` good morning , '' he said , as his hands slipped inside the robe .

`` you look beautiful , as always . ''

she laughed up at him and shook her head .

`` you 're not getting out of answering my question .

why did you look so concerned when you first walked in here ?

is something wrong ? ''

he sighed and pulled her over to the bed .

`` my father just called .

i have to get home quickly , '' he explained , but he did n't seem to be in any kind of hurry .

he sat down on the edge of the bed and held the ties of her robe in both hands , pulling gently .

`` should n't you be getting dressed ? ''

she asked , her body already reacting to the look in his eyes .

he was n't even glancing at his watch , preferring to watch the white , terry cloth fabric as he pulled the edges slowly apart .

he shook his head slightly , his eyes intent as he looked at her naked body , still pink from the heat of the shower .

`` i should be right here .

wondering what 's underneath this robe , '' he countered .

she pulled the edges closed , refusing to let him pull the robe off .

`` you already know what 's underneath , '' she laughed .

`` you saw enough of me last night .

if your father needs you , why are n't you rushing to his side ? ''

`` my father can wait a while .

i have a very short memory when it comes to your body .

i think i need a refresher . ''

she chuckled and tried to step back .

`` you have a photographic memory . ''

he would n't let her move back but instead , yanked her forward , catching her in his arms and tumbling over her onto the bed so he was looking down at her .

`` i like how you think you can outmaneuver me , '' he said a moment before he took her ear lobe with his teeth .

`` it always amuses me . ''

she laughed and tried to wiggle away .

`` well , that 's what i 'm here for .

just for your entertainment . ''

he stilled and pulled away , suddenly looking at her seriously .

`` do n't say that , '' he said sternly .

`` say what ? ''

she 'd never seen him look at her like that , as if he were worried and angry at the same time .

`` you 're not just my entertainment , '' he replied , his eyes serious .

she reached up and touched his cheek .

`` i know .

i 'm sorry .

i did n't mean to belittle what we have together . ''

he watched her for a moment before turning his face into her hand , kissing her palm .

`` do n't forget it , '' he growled before pulling her close , becoming serious for a whole different reason .

that was the last time she saw him in person .

three days later , siri was sitting in their tiny apartment when linda arrived back from the grocery store , her eyes wide with concern .

she placed the groceries on the kitchen table and looked over at siri , one hand hiding something behind her .

`` what 's up ? ''

siri asked as linda walked into the apartment and sat down across from her .

`` you look worried about something . ''

`` did you know where malik is from ? ''

siri shrugged and glanced down at her economics book .

`` he 's mentioned traveling to several countries lately , but he told me he 's originally from duban . ''

linda cringed and crossed her legs , obviously about to say something horrible and not sure how to convey the message .

`` do you know anything else about him ? ''

siri closed her economics book and started to become worried .

`` i know that he hates broccoli and asparagus , loves the opera and ballet and rides horses extremely well .

other than that , most of my knowledge is about the conversations we 've had on various subjects . ''

she watched linda 's eyes , concern growing .

`` has something happened to him ?

is he okay ?

please tell me he 's not hurt . ''
