and courtney is most certainly one of that number .

`` come on babe , '' the redheaded girl says to emerson , `` we 're just about to play a little game .

you girls should play too ! ''

`` what sort of game are we talking about ? ''

riley asks , stealing a nip of my booze .

`` darts ?

poker ? ''

`` seven minutes in heaven , '' courtney squeals , bouncing up and down excitedly on the balls of her feet .

`` are you serious ? ''

i blurt out .

`` sure , '' courtney replies , miffed by my less-than-enthusiastic response .

`` what 's the problem ?

we 're doing it ironically .

you 're some kind of hipster , are n't you ?

you should appreciate that . ''

`` i 'm not a hipster , '' i reply , `` i just like to read , occasionally . ''

emerson tries to cover up a hearty chuckle with a cough .

i glance over at him , amazed .

did i actually just make my detractor-in-residence laugh ?

`` whatever , '' courtney chirps , towing emerson back toward the group , `` join in or do n't . ''

`` let 's get out of here , '' i mutter to riley , as emerson strides away .

`` and miss your chance to wind up in the closet with your otl ? ''

she grins back .

`` my what ? ''

i ask blankly .

`` your one true love , obviously , '' she says , looping an arm around my waist and dragging me toward the group .

`` oh please , '' i whisper , `` it was just a crush !

and besides , it 's over now . ''

`` right , '' she says , rolling her eyes , `` because i did n't just see you fawn over his six pack for a long , steamy moment back there . ''

`` i did n't fawn over anything , '' i hiss , `` i just- '' `` ok ! ''

courtney chirps , rubbing her hands together and looking around at her assembled guests .

`` let 's do this .

everyone know the rules of seven minutes in heaven ? ''

her eyes land on me .

`` abby ? ''

`` ha .

ha . ''

i murmur , wanting very badly to melt into a puddle .

`` yes , i know the rules .

i was in eighth grade once , too . ''

the group chuckles , surprised by my swipe at the queen bee .

courtney is n't the kind of girl who gets talked back to very often .

which , in my opinion , is why she should be talked back to at every opportunity .

even emerson cocks his head at me in something that looks faintly like admiration .

or at least , something other than generally bored disdain , which is his default attitude toward me .

`` ok .

so who wants to pick our first two victims ? ''

courtney asks , her green eyes sparkling with mischief .

`` me !

dibs ! ''

riley says firmly , thrusting her hand into the air before anyone else has a chance to .

a cold stab of panic rips through me as my best friend smiles wickedly .

`` great , '' courtney chirps .

`` riley , you start .

who should we stick in the closet first ? ''

`` do n't you dare , '' i mutter under my breath , `` riley , i mean it- '' `` emerson and abby ! ''

riley crows triumphantly , shooting me a smile that clearly says , you know you want it .

you 'll thank me for this someday .

`` oh , '' courtney replies , the corners of her pretty mouth turning down .

`` i mean .

i guess that 's fine .

if you 're into incest or whatever . ''

our classmates laugh with delight as that taboo word drifts through the air like some smoke from one of emerson 's cigarettes .

a deep pang of shame twists my core .

i 've spent many a sleepless night berating myself for still being attracted to emerson .

i 've hurled the `` i word '' at myself a million times , hoping to break the spell he 's cast over me .

but no dice .

no matter how wrong the rest of the world might think it is , i 'm crazy for this gorgeous , cool , sneakily intelligent boy .

our parents little affair ca n't change that .

`` super twisted , riley , '' emerson laughs , crossing his thick arms .

`` i like it . ''

courtney 's eyes flash with jealousy as she swings her gaze my way .

`` fine , '' she snaps , clearly annoyed not to be heading into the closet with emerson herself .

`` but you two had better make good on it .

no twiddling your thumbs in there .

we 'll want some proof that you actually did something .

right everyone ? ''

a chorus of assenting murmurs sounds off around the circle .

i look around at my classmates , befuddled and humiliated .

`` what the hell kind of proof do you want ? ''

i ask , `` i 'm not the sex tape sorta gal . ''

`` figure it out yourself , '' courtney sniffs , shoving emerson toward me .

`` you can thank your bestie riley for her suggestion . ''

`` thanks bestie , '' emerson grins at riley , coming to a stop in front of me .

he makes a grand sweeping gesture , offering his arm as if we were going to a ball .
