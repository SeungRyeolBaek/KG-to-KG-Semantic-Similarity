`` i 'd certainly hope not . ''

`` so what 's wrong with having an innocent dinner and maybe a movie ? ''

casey asked .

`` because that 's not fair to him .

i 'd just be leading him on , and i think we can all agree that he does n't need that . ''

`` exactly , '' emma agreed .

cocking her head , casey eyed megan thoughtfully .

`` deep down , you like him , do n't you ? ''

megan rolled her eyes .

`` of course i do .

everyone likes him . ''

`` no , you really like him .

you find yourself thinking about him more than you should .

and you 're kinda wishing you were n't such a stubborn ass about dating him .

because even though you 'd kill to know how well he uses his wang , you 're even more intrigued about what being loved by him would be like . ''

dumbfounded , megan could only stare at casey .

she 'd certainly hit the nail on the head about her feelings .

finally , she sighed .

`` look , it 's a no-win situation .

i 'm a nursing student .

i ca n't get involved with a physician .

it just would n't look good on my record .

that 's just one of the many reasons it would n't work between us . ''

`` fine .

you just keep telling yourself that . ''

`` why do n't we talk about something else ? ''

megan suggested .

`` who 's up for a movie after we hit the mall ? ''

emma asked .

megan chewed her lip .

`` oh , i do n't know if i should be gone that long .

i do n't want to take advantage of ankle 's kindness for watching mason . ''

emma shook her head .

`` he wo n't mind .

he 's happy to do it . ''

as megan raised her brows skeptically , casey snorted .

`` lem me guess , you bribed him sexually to get him to give up a perfectly good saturday watching two kids who are under two . ''

a red flush entered emma 's cheeks .

`` i do n't know what you 're talking about . ''

casey laughed .

`` oh em , you are so busted ! ''

leaning forward , she put her elbows on the table and stared straight at emma .

`` so what was it ?

green lingerie ?

a blow job ?

maybe a b**w j*b while wearing green lingerie ? ''

refusing to meet casey 's inquisitive gaze , emma finally murmured , `` it was a b**w j*b in the shower this morning , okay ? ''

casey snickered .

`` i knew you had done something .

hmm , that was fun .

it was like solving a sexual game of clue-it was emma in the shower with a blow job . ''

megan brought her hands up to cover her eyes .

`` umm , hello ?

that 's my uncle you 're talking about . ''

`` sorry , sorry .

i 'll refrain from making any more comments about aidan and emma 's sex life . ''

`` thank you , '' megan and emma replied in unison .

`` shopping and a movie then ? ''

casey questioned .

megan reluctantly agreed .

`` i 'll just blame you two if ankle gets all pissy . ''

casey winked .

`` just blame emma .

then he can take it out on her later ... in the bedroom . ''

`` i seriously hate you , '' emma grumbled .

thankfully , the food arrived then and all sex-based conversation was forgotten .

at least for the moment .

chapter eleven brushing his hand across his sweaty brow , pesh leaned back against the glass door of the trauma area .

as the adrenaline began depleting from his system , he needed to prop against something hard for support .

regardless of how physically drained he felt , he was emotionally on cloud nine .

a beaming smile lit up his face as he stared across the room at the gurney .

on it , a young woman was getting acquainted with her newborn son .

she had been brought in just twenty minutes before after a car accident sent her into early labor .

the paramedics had gotten her through the roughest patches , but thankfully , they had made it to the hospital in time .

because her labor was so advanced , they had n't risked getting her up to the labor and delivery floor .

instead , they 'd wheeled her in , and pesh had gone to work .

it really was an amazing moment considering he 'd only delivered three other babies in the history of his medical career .

each one was an experience he treasured .

the woman glanced up at him and smiled .

`` thank you so much , dr .

nadeen . ''

`` you 're very welcome .

they will be taking you up to maternity in just a few minutes . ''

as he stepped out of the room , he found himself ambushed by kara , one of the shift nurses .

`` hey there .

how 's the good doctor doing today ? ''

the way she spoke was more of a purr , which was a pretty apt summation since she basically acted like she was a cat in heat anytime he was around .

he cringed as she ran her hand up his arm .

`` it 's fine , thank you .

how are you ? ''

he questioned politely .

`` i 'm better now that i 've seen you , '' she replied .
