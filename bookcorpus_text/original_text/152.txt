`` really ?

you look like you 're so in shape . ''

`` oh , thanks , '' i reply , managing to only blush a bit .

from anyone else it would have seemed like a ham-fisted compliment , but jackson has such a natural , easygoing way about him .

`` you going to this party in georgetown tonight ? ''

he asks , dunking his head briefly underneath the water , then shaking off his hair like a dog .

`` what party ? ''

`` oh , i figured nate told you . ''

`` told her what ? ''

nate asks , appearing next to him .

`` 'bout chris 's party , '' jackson replies nonchalantly .

nate 's jaw muscles twitch .

`` had n't mentioned it , '' he replies shortly .

`` well , you should come , '' jackson says , turning back to me .

`` she 's not going to know anyone , and i think it 's just gon na be a small thing , '' nate says .

`` dude , chris said to invite anyone .

they 've got the whole townhouse .

it 's gon na be great . ''

`` i just- '' nate begins , as i bite my lip .

here i thought we were maybe getting along better , despite the awkwardness , and now he 's going out of his way to exclude me .

`` if you 're worried about being a third wheel , just invite dana or someone , '' jackson says , though even when he 's arguing , he does n't seem to have a care in the world .

`` so , what do you think ? ''

he asks me .

`` sounds great , actually , '' i say , glancing at nate , feeling a bit gratified as he glares at me .

it feels good to spite him a little , since he so clearly does n't want me to go .

`` awesome .

tonight then .

we can go together-i 'll pick you guys up around ten , '' jackson says , before jumping on top of nate and trying to wrestle him under the water .

i close my eyes as they disappear .

for the first time in a while , i wish i had something cute to wear .

chapter ten in the end , i have to go with the same black top i wore to that crew party .

it 's really my only top suitable for a party , i think .

besides , nate 's the only one who 's seen me in it , and i doubt he remembers .

my mom excitedly waves goodbye as nate and i walk out to jackson 's green suv .

she is so thrilled that i might have a social life that it 's embarrassing .

jackson opens up the front passenger door for me and nate slides in back .

`` we picking up dana ? ''

jackson asks as we pull away .

`` it 's natasha tonight .

and she 's meeting us there , '' nate answers from the back seat .

i guess i 'm relieved , because i do n't think i could look dana in the eye after seeing her and nate having sex by the pool .

`` oh , fuck , natasha , of course , '' jackson says , laughing and hitting the steering wheel .

i frown a little .

i guess it 's par for the course for my stepbrother .

jackson picks up most of the slack in the conversation , and the radio does the rest .

i 'm too nervous and stuck in my head , thinking of what i should say , while nate mumbles one word responses from the back .

i 'm relieved when we find a parking space on the street near the party .

as we walk toward the riotous townhouse , i 'm surprised the neighbors have n't already called the cops .

people are spilling out the front door and i can hear the music halfway down the block .

there 's a pretty olive-skinned girl standing on the curb who turns her head as nate calls out , `` natasha ! ''

she smiles coyly as we walk up .

nate dips her in a jokingly romantic manner and plants a kiss on her lips as she breaks out into giggles .

`` come on , '' jackson says , draping an arm around my shoulders protectively and escorting me inside .

he high-fives a few guys as we walk in , and he guides me to a keg in the middle of the living room , which is strung with little white christmas lights .

there 's an impenetrable crowd around it but somehow he manages to snag me a beer , and before i know it i 'm taking my first sip of the summer .

with his hand on the small of my back , we walk into the next room .

the dining room table is being used for a beer pong game , and jackson and i take a seat on a couch nearby .

`` you 're gorgeous , you know that ? ''

jackson whispers in my ear .

i 'm startled and almost spit out my beer .

`` no ... '' i look down , blushing , `` i mean , that 's sweet of you to say . ''

`` i 'd love to see you again after tonight .

maybe we could get dinner next weekend , '' he offers .

`` oh , sure , '' i reply , feeling flattered .

i mean , it does feel a little ... rushed , or something , but i 've heard so many stories about guys just wanting to hook up , that it 's refreshing to be asked out on an old-fashioned date .
