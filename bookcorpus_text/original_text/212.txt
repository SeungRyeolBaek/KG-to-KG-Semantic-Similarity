from this close , i can see that there are specks of gold gleaming in his irises , and a dash of freckles across the bridge of his nose .

at last , my eyes land firmly on his full , firm lips , half curled into a devilish grin .

his arm is still circled around my tiny waist .

am i imagining things , or is his grip growing the slightest bit tighter ?

a silence blooms over us , heavy and thick .

my eyes flick back up to his .

a cast of seriousness has come over his gaze .

to my amazement , i watch as his face moves closer to mine , by barely a millimeter- `` five minutes ! ''

i hear courtney call from outside the door .

`` shit , '' i mutter , tearing my eyes away from his perfect face .

my whole body is on fire with scattered anticipation .

for a second there , i actually thought he was going to kiss me .

talk about wishful thinking .

`` so .

how are we going to please the horny masses ? ''

i ask , nodding toward the door .

`` i have an idea , '' emerson says , his grin returning at full force .

`` you 're going to give me your panties . ''

my jaw falls open as i whip around to face him .

`` excuse me ? ''

i splutter .

`` you heard me .

hand them over , '' emerson says , punching me lightly on the arm .

`` i can hold them up as proof that we did the deed , and everyone will know that you 're not a frigid , virginal weirdo . ''

`` that is so messed up , '' i say , jumping to my feet .

i 'm just going to leave the whole `` frigid virgin '' thing alone for now , i decide .

no use opening that can of worms .

`` let those assholes think what they want .

i 'll never have to see any of them again in a few months . ''

`` come on , sis .

do it for me , then , '' emerson says , standing to meet me .

he catches my arm , giving me a soft tug toward him .

`` do n't you want to help me protect my reputation ? ''

`` not really , '' i reply , as he closes the space between us .

i wonder if he can see my heart pounding through my black sweater , see my knees trembling beneath my tartan miniskirt ?

`` what if i ask you nicely ? ''

he returns , his voice softer , huskier than i 've ever heard it .

he runs his hands down my arms , not an inch of air between our bodies .

that seriousness has hardened his features once again ... or is he just fucking with me ?

`` are you really capable of that ?

asking nicely ? ''

i try to joke , but my own voice seems to have dropped a lusty octave .

my breath catches in my throat as his hands land firmly on my slender hips .

`` give me your panties , '' he growls , his fingers tightening ever-so-slightly , `` please . ''

i stare up at him in amazement .

he 's totally serious .

if i had any sense at all , i 'd step away , laugh off his request , and wait for the next five minutes to tick by .

but my sense has been fully eclipsed by my want to please him in any way that i can .

maybe he 's joking after all , but i 'm not going to let this moment slip away between my fingers .

i have to show emerson sawyer what i 'm made of .

it 's now or never .

`` you have to turn around , '' i whisper hoarsely .

his eyes spark with intrigued wonder .

slowly , silently , he pivots away from me .

keeping my eyes fixed firmly on his face to make sure he does n't peek , i reach up under my skirt and slip my thumbs under the elastic band of my panties .

thank god i thought to wear one of my sexiest pairs tonight .

i do n't usually go for fancy underthings , but this black lace g-string is an exception .

my breath comes hard and fast as i slowly lower my panties over my firm ass and thighs , balancing carefully as i ease them down .

i step out of them , wobbling just slightly , and shiver as i feel the cool air against my sex .

i can feel myself getting wet , standing so close to emerson , bare and ready .

god , i hope he wo n't be able to tell .

unless he intends to make good on it , that is ... `` here , '' i tell him , holding up the delicate lace g-string .

emerson turns back to face me , looking taken off guard for the first time since i 've known him .

`` damn , '' he murmurs , taking the panties carefully-almost reverently-from my hand .

`` there 's more to you than i thought , abby . ''

he called me abby , not `` sis '' , i think to myself , a grin spreading across my face .

maybe seven minutes in heaven is n't such a terrible game after all ... `` now , my question is , '' i begin , easing toward emerson once more , `` what do you intend to do with those ? ''

those soft , sculpted lips part , ever-so-slightly , as he draws in a deep breath .
