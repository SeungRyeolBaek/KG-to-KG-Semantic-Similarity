megan pinched her eyes shut .

the room was beginning to spin around her a little .

as she brought her hand to her forehead , she heard a smack across the room and aidan cry , `` ow , dammit , em ! ''

`` that tequila is a hundred and fifty proof alcohol , aidan , '' emma chastised .

`` sorry .

i did n't realize it .

i just thought it was the better stuff because it was white tequila .

that 's your drink of choice , not mine . ''

oh god , she was in so much trouble .

she 'd barely consumed any alcohol since she got pregnant and had mason .

now she 'd had one regular dosed margarita and almost a full one of straight alcohol .

a gentle hand landed on her thigh .

`` are you all right ? ''

pesh asked .

she opened her eyes to see two blurry images of him staring at her with concern .

`` not exactly . ''

`` would you like me to take you home ? ''

`` yes , please .

while i can still walk . ''

as she rose out of her chair , she swayed a little in her heels .

after taking two steps , aidan 's apologetic face appeared before her .

`` i 'm sorry , meggie . ''

`` it 's not your fault .

and i 'll be fine . ''

she wagged a finger at him .

`` but when i get shit for coming home drunk , i 'm so telling mom it was your fault . ''

he smiled .

`` i 'll gladly take the blame and fear angie 's wrath . ''

he leaned in to hug her .

`` thanks for today-you know , for being noah 's godmother . ''

`` you 're welcome .

thanks for me asking you . ''

she shook her head .

`` i mean , thanks for asking me . ''

god , this was bad .

after exchanging hugs with emma and reassuring her at least twenty times that she would be fine and that she did need to go home , pesh led megan out the front door .

he slid a strong arm around her waist to steady her as they went down the porch steps .

as she staggered to the car , she moaned .

`` i ca n't go home yet .

not like this . ''

she stared up into his face .

`` i ca n't let mason see me like this . ''

he pushed a strand of hair out of her face .

`` do n't worry .

i 'll take you to my house then . ''

`` just so i can sober up ? ''

she questioned , although she really did n't mean it .

she wanted to go to his house for a lot more , especially after being so close to his fabulously built body .

`` yes , of course .

i 'll make you some strong , black coffee . ''

`` thank you , '' she murmured , trying to still the spinning of her head .

`` you 're welcome . ''

always the gentleman , pesh opened the door for her , and she collapsed onto the seat .

once he made sure she was comfortable , he closed the door and went around the front of the car .

megan gazed around at the plush interior of the jaguar with its leather seats and sleek console .

after pesh slid into his seat , he put the key in the ignition and cranked up .

as they started backing out of the driveway , she glanced over at him .

`` do you have to come to the rescue women of drunken . ''

she shook her head .

`` i mean , drunken women a lot ? ''

she asked .

wait , was she slurring ?

he cut his eyes over at her and smiled .

he seemed to be trying really hard not to laugh at her .

`` not exactly .

but i 'm always happy to help a damsel in distress . ''

megan giggled .

oh god , now she was giggling ?

she never giggled .

she eyed pesh suspiciously .

`` got a hero complex , huh ?

wan na be every woman 's knight in shining armor ? ''

`` not every woman 's , '' he murmured .

`` mmm , pesh , you wan na be my knight in shining armor ? ''

as soon as the words left her lips , she fought the urge to slap her hand over her mouth .

alcohol always had this effect on her-it left her completely without a sensor .

pesh 's jaw clenched , and he did n't reply .

pitching her upper body over the armrest , she got as close to him as she could .

`` you did n't answer my question . ''

taking his eyes momentarily off the road , he pinned her with an intense gaze .

`` i 'd be anything and everything you wanted me to be , if you would give me the chance . ''

momentarily dumbfounded , she could only stare at him .

`` oh wow , '' she replied , as she collapsed back onto the seat .

the motion caused her to feel dizzy .

mumbling almost incoherently , she said , `` mmm , hot as f**k and anything i want .

lucky me . ''

`` i have a feeling you would n't have asked the original question if you were n't intoxicated . ''

with a snort , she replied , `` drunk or sober that woulda been a helluva line to hear from a man . ''

`` i 'm glad you think so . ''
