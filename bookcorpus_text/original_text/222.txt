nicer .

it is n't that he 's pitying me , thank god .

it 's almost as if he 's recognized something of himself in me .

go figure-i 'm sure he has more pain hidden inside of him than anyone should be made to live with .

`` well , i 'm a terrible cook , '' i tell him , leaning my elbows on the kitchen island .

`` could n't even boil water if i tried . ''

`` huh .

lucky for you , i happen to be an excellent chef , '' emerson says seriously , opening up the kitchen cupboard .

`` wait .

really ? ''

i ask , surprised .

`` really , '' he replies , `` i had to cook for mom most of the time growing up .

letting a wasted person near sharp knives and open flames is a terrible idea . ''

`` that follows , '' i reply .

`` so , what do you have in mind , master chef ? ''

`` well , '' he says , plucking a few items down off the cupboard shelf .

`` how do you feel about risotto ? ''

`` are you kidding ? ''

i blurt .

that 's one of my all-time favorite foods .

i used to ask my mom to make it every year for my birthday .

but there 's no way he could have known that .

`` i 'll take that as a 'fuck yeah ' , '' emerson smiles , plunking a container of arborio rice down onto the counter .

`` why do n't you find us a movie on demand to watch or something ?

i 'll get this thing whipped up in no time . ''

i follow his suggestion and head for the living room .

stealing a glance at emerson over my shoulder , i feel my heart warm up a few degrees .

his face is composed , free from the scowl that usually rests there .

with dad and deb out for the night , i can almost imagine that this is our place-mine and emerson 's alone .

we 've never once spent time like this together .

he hardly ever stays in for a night , and i 'm mostly preoccupied with extracurriculars and long study sessions at the library .

after our disastrous outing before , this evening is suddenly looking up .

maybe we 'll even get around to discussing this sudden shift in our relationship .

he 's cooking me dinner , after all .

clearly , miracles do happen .

i scroll through dozens upon dozens of movies as emerson cooks .

the savory fragrance of his recipe makes my stomach growl in eager anticipation .

`` jesus .

was that you ? ''

he calls from the kitchen .

`` not very ladylike , sis . ''

`` what do you want from me ? ''

i grin back .

`` your gourmet masterpiece is taking forever .

i 'm starving in here . ''

`` i could always just scrap it and make you some easy mac instead , '' he teases .

`` you 're not that inhumane , '' i shoot back .

`` that is true , '' he chuckles , filling two bowls with the steamy , decadent meal he 's prepared .

`` besides , this looks too good to waste . ''

emerson walks over to the deep sectional couch where i 've made myself a nest of pillows and blankets .

i let out a low moan as i smell the garlicky , mushroomy goodness of the food .

emerson hands me a heaping bowl topped with a mound of parmesan cheese and plops down onto the couch beside me , kicking his feet up onto the coffee table .

almost reverently , i scoop a bite of risotto onto my gigantic silver spoon and raise it to my mouth .

emerson watches expectantly out of the corner of his eye as i sample his cooking .

`` oh my god , '' i mumble around a mouthful of rice , `` i think i just came . ''

emerson lets out a bark of surprised laughter at my crass joke .

`` so you like it then ? ''

i nod eagerly , burrowing into the couch while i take bite after delicious bite of the food he 's prepared .

it occurs to me , as i nosh , that i have n't had an honest-to-god home cooked meal since my mom died .

that awareness only makes this gesture of emerson 's that much more meaningful to me .

`` so , what 're we watching ? ''

he asks , taking a bite of risotto for himself .

i grab the remote and click through to the film of my choice .

it 's an old favorite of mine .

`` ta-da ! ''

i say happily .

`` the fuck ? ''

emerson scoffs as he sees what movie i 've picked out for us tonight .

`` i thought you were gon na go for something with super heroes .

or vampires .

anything but this . ''

`` what ? ''

i reply .

`` dr. zhivago is a classic ! ''

`` classically depressing , '' he says .

`` have you ever even seen it ? ''

i press .

`` well .

no , '' he admits , `` but look at all that snow and shit on the poster !

unless we 're talking about snow dogs , that 's never a sign of a cheerful movie . ''

`` cheerful is overrated , '' i tell him , `` and this movie is fantastic .

just give it a chance .

i promise , you 'll love it . ''

he raises an eyebrow at my fervid vow .
