`` i 'm sorry . ''

`` it 's alright .

i 've got some tissues in my car-why do n't you come sit down for a moment . ''

i nod .

in a saner moment , i might have questioned the safety of getting into a strange woman 's car , but this is not a sane moment .

she wraps her arm around my shoulders and leads me to the passenger side of her blue sedan , parked just down the street from the gates of the house .

she sits me down then hurries around to the driver 's side and gets in .

`` here you go , '' she says , pulling a box of tissues from the floor of the back seat .

`` thanks , '' i murmur rather incoherently .

she flips on the car 's overhead light .

`` oh ! ''

i exclaim .

`` you 're the woman from the boathouse parking lot . ''

she smiles wryly .

`` i thought you saw me that day .

i 'm not a stalker or anything .

it 's just , sometimes i like to get a glimpse of him , that 's all .

see what he looks like , how he 's doing . ''

`` i understand . ''

`` but what 's happened to you ?

is there anything i can do ? ''

`` it 's pierce , '' i murmur as more tears fall from my eyes at the mention of his name .

`` what 'd he do now ? ''

`` he ... he made a pass at me at work .

i mean , i actually was n't sure that 's what it was right after , but then tonight he got on my case about something i did n't even do , and that 's when i knew for sure . ''

`` oh , sweetie , i 'm sorry , '' she says , rubbing my shoulder .

`` pierce has a serious case of entitlement .

he thinks that anything with a vagina is fair game , even his stepdaughter , it seems . ''

`` i mean , i already knew he was an asshole from the way he treats nate , but i just had n't felt it directed at me yet . ''

she stills .

`` he does n't treat nate well ? ''

she asks quietly .

`` oh , oh , i 'm sorry , '' i reply , looking at her through bleary eyes .

`` he 's ... he 's very hard on nate .

he calls him entitled , selfish , when i think those are really things he knows deep down are true about himself . ''

`` my little nate , '' she murmurs to herself .

`` but he 's really ... nate is a good person , you should know that .

well , to be honest , at first i thought he was more like pierce , but that 's just a cover .

maybe it 's that half his genes are yours , or maybe his father raised him to be a better person than he is himself , i do n't know .

but he 's smart , funny , hardworking ... '' `` thank you , '' she says , taking my hand .

`` i 'm sorry you have to go through this .

did you tell your mom ? ''

`` she found out at dinner , but ... '' i shake my head .

`` she 's completely under pierce 's spell .

she gets like that about men , but i 've never seen her quite so enamored of one before him .

she looks a lot like you , actually , '' i realize , studying her beautiful , slightly lined face .

`` pierce certainly has a type , '' she says with a sad smile .

`` there 's another thing you should know ... about nate ... i found out after you called : he thinks you left because he was too much for you , because he was a bad kid , basically .

i tried to talk to him about it , really , but he would n't hear it . ''

`` nate was a wonderful child , and even if he 'd been the devil incarnate , i still would n't have left him . ''

`` yeah , i figured as much .

he said that the night before you left , you and pierce had a big fight over him , because he misbehaved , and that 's why you left the next day . ''

`` oh , god , '' she murmurs , covering her face in her hands .

`` he must have felt so alone , so responsible .

no ... i remember that fight , because it was our last .

we 'd been to some big gala that night , and we 'd seen this woman there who was in our circle at the time .

i knew he 'd cheated before , but he promised me he 'd stopped , and then at this party , i could just tell by the way they looked at each other that they were sleeping together .

i confronted him about it at home , and he barely even bothered to deny it .

i was yelling at him , asking what kind of example he was setting for his son .

i left ... i never thought that would be one of the last times i 'd see nate .

i never thought that was even a possibility . ''

`` i want to help you , '' i say suddenly .

`` what ?

no .

you have too much going on already , '' eileen says , shaking her head emphatically .
