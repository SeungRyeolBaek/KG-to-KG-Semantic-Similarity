crossing my arms over my chest and throwing my blonde hair into a messy ponytail , i pad over to my bedroom window and ease it open .

leaning out into the warm spring air , i see emerson leaning heavily against the hood of his car , looking up at our house with despair .

`` hey , emerson , '' i whisper , waving to get his attention .

`` what are you doing up ? ''

he murmurs back .

`` what do you think ? ''

i say , `` i was waiting for you .

stay there-i 'm coming down . ''

`` you do n't have to , '' he starts to say , but i 've already turned away from the window .

i take the stairs two at a time , not pausing long enough to be self-conscious about my tiny cotton shorts and camisole .

i gently push open the front door and step out into the darkness of the very early morning .

emerson watches as i cross the driveway toward him .

he smiles wryly at my approach .

`` are you trying to kill me with those shorts or what ? ''

he says .

though i know he 's teasing , there 's a frustrated , regretful hunger beneath his words that breaks my heart .

`` some of us have been in bed for hours now , '' i remind him , leaning against the car by his side , `` instead of rending our shirts and bellowing into the wind .

or whatever it was you were doing out there . ''

`` that about sums it up , '' he replies .

`` what , are you pissed at me ? ''

`` it would have been nice to not be stuck alone with our parents after all that , '' i point out , `` your mom cried for hours . ''

`` it 's one of her favorite hobbies , '' emerson shrugs .

`` you could have at least taken me with you , '' i shoot back .

`` after everything ... '' `` i know , '' he says , a small sigh escaping his lips .

`` i 'm not used to looking out for anyone besides myself , abby .

i gave up on my mom years ago , and i guess when shit gets real i just look out for me .

i 'm sorry . ''

`` it 's ok , '' i whisper , reaching for his hand .

to my relief , he lets me take it .

`` you 're back now .

that 's what matters . ''

he looks my way , his blue eyes gleaming even in the darkness .

i can see a million thoughts swirling behind those eyes , afloat in a churning sea of turmoil and rage .

i wish there was anything i could do to ease that pain .

and maybe , just maybe , there is .

`` come on , '' i say , tugging his hand , `` let 's go . ''

`` go where ? ''

he asks , standing stock still .

`` i 'm exhausted , abby . ''

`` just follow me , sawyer , '' i reply , pretending impatience .

`` unless you 're too chicken shit , that is . ''

he rolls his eyes with just enough playfulness to give me hope .

without another word , i tow him away from the car .

silently , we make our way around the perimeter of the house , the expansive back yard , the black water of the in-ground pool .

i lead emerson along the edge of the woods that surround our property , peeling off down a well-worn dirt path .

i expect his body to tense up as i drag him into the foliage , but he follows gamely .

i suppose he does n't scare so easy , emerson sawyer .

`` here it is , '' i say , after a few minutes of trudging along through the underbrush .

we 've come to a stop before a thick , sturdy trunk , inlaid with wooden planks that serve as footholds .

it 's a place i 've come to love and depend on as a safe haven .

during the worst of mom and dad 's fights , and later the worst of his drunken rages , this is where i 'd come .

`` what is 'it ' ? ''

emerson asks , raising an eyebrow at the makeshift ladder .

`` i 'll show you , '' i tell him , grasping a plank and pulling myself up a foot .

`` just do n't check out my ass the whole time i 'm climbing , now . ''

`` that ... is not a fair request , '' he smiles , as i scurry up the trunk before him .

i can feel his eyes raking along my body the whole while .

and despite my instructions , i ca n't pretend that i mind too much .

as we hit the point where the tree 's branches begin to fan out , i pull myself onto a wide wooden platform , scooting over to make room for emerson beside me .

this weathered deck was built to last , but it helps that i 've maintained it over the years .

it 's not quite a treehouse , but it does the trick as far as secret hideaways go .

`` well , this is rustic , '' emerson laughs , swinging himself up onto the platform to join me .

`` did your dad make this ? ''

`` my grandpa did , actually , '' i tell him , `` back when my dad was still a kid .

this was his and my grandma 's house , before they passed it along to my mom and dad . ''
