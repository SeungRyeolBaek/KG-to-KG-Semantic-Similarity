`` i do .

i honestly do . ''

unfastening her seat belt , she lunged over to kiss him .

when she started to deepen the kiss , he had to pull away .

`` hey now , you got ta stop that or we 're not going to make it to my parents . ''

she giggled and then eased back down into her seat .

she managed to behave herself the remaining five minutes .

when he pulled into his parents drive , he saw it was already crowded with cars .

the sight of so many people set megan off , and she began tapping her fingers nervously on her leg .

`` ready ? ''

he asked , as he turned to her .

`` as i 'll ever be , '' she muttered .

he shook his head as he got out of the car .

like always , he opened her car door and helped her out .

as they started up the sidewalk , megan was a flurry of movement .

she smoothed down her hair and then she adjusted her top .

then she fiddled with her purse on her shoulder .

`` quit fidgeting , '' pesh whispered , as he rang the doorbell .

`` i ca n't help it .

i 'm nervous . ''

he grinned down at her .

`` megan , they 're going to love you .

i promise . ''

she shook her head .

`` they 're going to hate me because i 'm not a submissive indian woman .

wait until they hear i had a child out of wedlock .

they 'll be ready to disown you then . ''

the door flew open , cutting off the rest of their conversation .

`` brother , it 's so good to see you ! ''

his brother-in-law , sanjay , cried .

after he hugged pesh , his gaze went to megan .

his eyes widened , and he gasped in surprise .

`` uh , hello . ''

`` hi , '' megan said .

sanjay gave pesh a curious look .

`` you did n't tell me you were bringing company . ''

`` this is megan . ''

with a self-assured tone , he added , `` she 's my girlfriend . ''

`` really ?

well , what about that ? ''

sanjay gave megan a welcoming smile .

`` we 're so glad to have you . ''

`` thank you , '' megan replied .

as sanjay turned to go into the living room , megan smacked pesh 's arm .

`` you did n't tell them you were bringing me ? ''

he shook his head .

`` no , i like the element of surprise when it comes to my love life . ''

`` s-seriously ? ''

she sputtered .

`` it 's better this way .

trust me . ''

before she could say anything else , pesh started taking off his shoes .

wide-eyed , megan watched him .

quickly , she stepped out of her heels and put them in the pile next to his .

`` more etiquette you forgot to tell me ? ''

she hissed .

he patted the small of her back .

`` you 're fine . ''

as they came into the living room , pesh felt megan tense at his side .

he supposed that it was overwhelming coming into a room packed full of strangers .

his sister , shveta , came forward first .

`` hello brother .

you 're looking well this evening . ''

`` thank you .

so are you . ''

he hugged her tight .

as he pulled away , he glanced down at her swollen belly .

`` and how is the future prince doing ? ''

shveta smiled and brought her hand to her abdomen .

`` he 's busy kicking me at the moment . ''

when she spied megan behind him , she gasped .

`` and who is this ? ''

he drew in a breath and gazed around his family .

`` before i go through this with each and every one of you , i might as well get it out of the way .

i want to introduce you to someone very special , my girlfriend , megan . ''

deafening silence reverberated around the room after his statement .

his mother and father exchanged a glance before staring back at pesh .

megan tucked herself even closer to his side .

although public displays of affection between men and women were frowned upon in his culture , he wrapped his arm around her waist .

`` well , say something , '' he commanded .

`` we 're sorry , son .

it 's just you caught us off guard , '' his mother said .

his father 's bushy brows rose .

`` so you 're really dating , eh ? ''

`` yes , i am . ''

at his declaration , his father clapped his hands and grinned .

`` that is most wonderful to hear ! ''

he came forward to embrace megan .

`` you are very welcome here . ''

`` thank you , '' she said .

`` i 'm charlie , '' his father introduced .

`` megan , '' she replied , with a small smile .

pesh peered past his father where his mother stood chewing her lip .

he could tell she was n't entirely happy that another blonde-haired , blue-eyed woman was standing beside her son .

while shveta and arjan had both sought out indian partners to marry , he and dev were somewhat the black sheep since they had n't chosen to settle down with women within their culture .

finally , his mother 's manners won out over anything else , and she stepped forward to shake megan 's hand .
