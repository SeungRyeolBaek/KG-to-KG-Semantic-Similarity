pierce 's lawyer offered me a settlement in the divorce !

and it specifically included payment of your tuition . ''

`` pierce paid my tuition ? ''

i ask , my mind reeling .

`` yes !

as soon as i signed , the money was wired over . ''

`` but ... but mom , was it a good settlement ?

i mean , did you have a lawyer look it over ? ''

`` yeah , it was the same lawyer who told me i 'd get nothing because of the pre-nup i signed .

he was completely floored , and told me i 'd better sign before pierce changes his mind . ''

`` but ... why ?

i mean , it seems so out of character for him . ''

`` i know !

i can hardly believe it either .

it 's crazy !

i 'll be able to pay off the mortgage on the house and have a little left over .

i mean , we 're not rich or anything , but we have a bit of leeway now . ''

`` was it , you know , 'hush money , ' do you think ? ''

`` i doubt it .

the lawyer said that there 's no less reliable witness than a woman trying to defame her ex-husband , so i do n't really think pierce would be worried about me going to the press with stories or anything-not that i 'd want to do that anyway .

but honey , it 's done now .

it 's really over .

we do n't have to worry about him anymore . ''

`` well , i 'm glad that you 're happy with it .

if you 're happy i 'm happy .

man , this is the first good news we 've gotten in a while , huh ? ''

i touch my lips with my fingertips , wondering when the last time i smiled was .

`` have you seen him yet ? ''

my mom asks quietly .

she does n't need to specify that she 's referring to nate .

`` not yet , '' i reply .

`` though i 've convinced myself that every brown-haired guy i 've seen from the back is him . ''

`` that 's normal , '' my mom assures me .

`` you 'll see him everywhere for a while .

but it will pass soon , my darling .

i promise . ''

chapter twenty-nine realizing i now have the evening off , i take a deep breath and call allison .

i 'm still in a daze , but i want to share my good fortune with her and miriam .

allison and i have n't talked since our argument over the summer , so i 'm relieved when she accepts my invitation on behalf of both of them .

i pick a rather fancy restaurant , and assure her that it 's my treat .

half an hour later , i 'm walking out of my room in a light summer dress-the weather here in virginia is still sweltering , even though it 's september .

i walk slowly across the quad to the off-campus restaurant , trying not to work up a sweat .

i watch a group of freshmen girls giggling as they head out for a group dinner .

new hall mates , no doubt .

i remember how nervous i was my first year here , worrying that i would n't make any more friends than i did in high school .

my insides contract as i pass the spot where i first saw nate crossing the grass , just a couple weeks into my freshman year .

i shake my head at myself .

i have to forget him .

when i reach the restaurant , an upscale mexican place known for its flavored margaritas , i 'm relieved to feel the ac hit me .

the hostess smiles at me just as i see allison sitting in a booth by herself .

she stands with a nervous smile and i walk over .

`` i hope you do n't mind , '' she murmurs as we hug awkwardly .

`` i sort of lied to miriam and told her you pushed back dinner by fifteen minutes so we 'd have a chance to talk . ''

a short bark of laughter escapes my mouth .

`` i do n't know if i 've ever heard you lie before . ''

to my surprise , she blushes as we sit down across from each other .

`` well , i 've been thinking about what you said ... about my being judgmental ... and maybe i am a bit of , you know , a goody two-shoes .

maybe i need to loosen up a little .

what i 'm trying to say is , i 'm sorry for what i said . ''

i reach over and place my hand over hers .

`` thanks .

it means a lot to hear you say that .

i 've hated not talking to you . ''

`` me too , '' she replies .

i see her glance over my shoulder .

`` and here i thought i was early ! ''

i hear miriam say .

i stand up to give her a hug .

`` i see you two have synced your watches , being in the same city together all summer !

ugh , i was so jealous ! ''

she sits down with a dramatic sigh in the booth next to allison , her bright red hair falling onto her shoulder .

`` so .

catch me up on everything that 's been happening . ''

to my horror , i begin to tear up .

`` oh , god , sorry , '' i murmur , reaching for a napkin .
