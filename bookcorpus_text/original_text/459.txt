ella rolled her eyes .

`` i guess you think i 'm going to fall for the chocolate trick , eh ? ''

she asked .

he leaned forward and poured her more wine .

`` i did n't know there was a chocolate trick , '' he came back .

`` enlighten me . ''

`` tempting a woman with chocolate .

but i 'm not addicted to chocolate .

so it wo n't work . ''

he raised an eyebrow .

`` i 've never known a woman who was n't addicted to chocolate . ''

`` ah , more proof that you 've been running in the wrong circles .

women of my social class ca n't afford chocolate .

so there 's no chance we can be addicted .

therefore , we ca n't be tempted . ''

he looked at her with determination .

`` i am going to change that . ''

she shook her head .

`` no , you 're going to continue doing what you 're doing , which is obviously something very important , '' she argued .

`` and i 'm going to continue to work on my degree and get a fabulous promotion so i will get off of working at the front desk which will mean i wo n't have to deal with all the horrible people that come through the hotel . ''

his head tilted to the side .

`` why do you work in a hotel ? ''

he asked gently , wanting to figure out how to get her into a better position , something that was n't as hard as what she was currently doing .

she shrugged her shoulders .

`` it 's actually a very good job with a relatively reliable career potential .

i earn more doing this than i did working at a fast food restaurant .

the customers are basically the same , '' she teased .

`` in an ideal world , what do you want to do ? ''

he asked .

she sighed and shook her head , her eyes changing .

gone was the light that had been there only moments ago , replaced by something different .

was it wisdom ?

or something worse ?

something defeated ?

or was she just a realist whose dreams had been pushed out of her mind because of the ongoing hardships she faced every day ?

ella leaned back in her chair , twirling her fork with her fingers .

`` i do n't play those games , zayn .

we do n't live in an ideal world , do we ?

are you doing what you dreamed of doing when you were younger ? ''

she paused , seeing the negative response in his eyes without him having to say anything .

`` so we both do what we have to do .

we get by , we push ourselves to reach a higher standard of excellence , and do a little bit of good whenever there 's an opportunity . ''

zayn knew that her words were true , of more than just the two of them .

people the world over did what they had to do to survive .

but he did n't want that for ella .

`` there are many people who have achieved their dream . ''

she smiled sadly .

`` i do n't think that 's in the stars for either of us .

do you ? ''

he stared hard into her eyes , wishing there was some hope , some small spark that continued to dream .

`` what happened to you ? ''

she shrugged one shoulder as if to dismiss his concern .

`` my life is n't nearly as hard as others , zayn .

working in a hotel is a great opportunity .

and at least i 'm not covered with grease from fried food or working out in the heat and humidity , or in the freezing cold .

i 've got it pretty good , '' she explained , smiling despite the sadness in her eyes .

he saw her smile , but there was a weariness to her eyes , a resignation that this was the best that life could offer her .

`` what happened to the little girl who danced home from school ?

or who would run down the stairs , tripping and falling , scraping her knees simply because she 'd made cookies and wanted to share ? ''

her smile disappeared and she looked down at the linen covered table .

she 'd loved baking cookies , but she had n't done that in over four years .

`` i used to make cookies with my mother , '' she said softly , fighting back the sudden tears that threatened to embarrass her .

`` i have n't made any cookies since she died . ''

`` you were a good cook , back then .

angelo , dominic and i would know when the two of you were baking .

we would purposely stand underneath your apartment window , hoping for handouts . ''

ella could n't stop the giggle at that admission .

`` you 're kidding ! ''

`` no way , '' he came back , his eyes smiling down at her .

`` when one of us got a whiff of the cookies , we 'd let the other two know .

and we 'd meet up , standing at mr. jones ' doorway across the street , waiting for however long it took for you or your mother to notice us . ''

she shook her head .

`` we were always making them for you three guys , '' she said .

then grimaced .

`` well , most of the time .

we liked them too .

but my mom would always wonder how it was that the three of you were standing by that doorway despite mr. jones ' horrible temper . ''
