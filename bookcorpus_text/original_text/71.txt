`` would it be wrong if he were dating ? ''

a long sigh escaped megan 's lips .

`` no , he deserves to be happy .

my nana has been dead for six years , so it 's not like he raced out the moment he was free and started going through women like kleenex . ''

pesh chuckled at her summation .

`` did you not like her ? ''

crossing her arms over her chest , megan replied , `` that 's the other part .

she seemed really nice .

and mason loves her .

i guess she 's been there before when he stayed with papa . ''

after abandoning his place by the stove , pesh placed his hands on the marble countertop and leaned in close to megan .

`` it sounds to me like patrick has found a good woman who loves him and his family .

i do n't think you could ask for a better scenario . ''

she stared into his eyes for a moment before she smiled .

`` you 're right .

i do n't know why i got so upset about it all . ''

`` because as much as you love your grandfather , you 're still protective of your grandmother 's memory . ''

`` you 're so wise , '' she murmured .

`` it comes with age , '' he replied , with a wink .

`` whatever . ''

he gave her a quick kiss on the lips before returning to the stove .

`` so besides patrick 's new lady friend , what else happened to get you so upset ? ''

when megan did n't reply , pesh turned around .

`` what else is it ? ''

`` you need to have a serious discussion with kara . ''

his brows rose in surprise .

`` i do ? ''

`` yes , you do . ''

`` megan , you do remember that i 'm not in charge of nurses . ''

she rolled her eyes .

`` yes , i realize that .

but you are in charge of your dick , are you not ? ''

`` excuse me ? ''

crossing her arms over her chest , megan said , `` kara seems to think that the two of you are an item . ''

pesh chuckled .

`` oh that 's nonsense .

we 're just friends from working together . ''

megan narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him .

`` you 've never seen her outside of work ? ''

this was one area of questioning he had n't bargained on ever having to answer .

the truth was something he really did n't want to admit to megan .

carefully choosing his words , he replied , `` we got together for drinks a couple of times after work a few months back .

i hardly think that categorizes us as an 'item . ' ''

`` it must be enough for her to think she can tell me that you 're only using me for sex . ''

pesh winced at the words .

he would have never taken kara for being someone who was jealous .

he put down the spatula and turned off the stove .

he knew he could n't go forward without coming clean .

`` megan , i have n't been honest with you . ''

`` what do you mean ? ''

she asked .

`` i told you that kara and i had only had drinks a couple of times .

but that is n't the whole truth . ''

megan 's eyes widened .

`` what are you saying ? ''

defeated , his shoulders drooped a little .

`` after the night of noah 's baptism , i could n't get you off my mind .

i wanted to prove to myself that i was n't so enamored by you .

so after having a couple of drinks one night , kara and i went to my car and fooled around . ''

`` you got drunk ? ''

he gave a mirthless laugh .

`` that is what is most shocking to you in what i just told you ? ''

`` did you think i would be mad at you for messing around with some woman when we were n't dating ? ''

`` yes , '' he answered honestly .

megan shook her head .

`` what you did then was your business .

i mean , i 'm not thrilled to hear that you fooled around with her , especially since you would n't sleep with me when i asked you to . ''

`` but do n't you see the difference ?

i cared for you , and i cared nothing for her .

we were barely in the car fifteen minutes if that tells you anything . ''

the corners of her lips tugged up in a small smile .

`` i really do n't need the details of how much you did n't enjoy yourself . ''

he ducked his head .

`` i 'm sorry .

i should n't have said that . ''

`` but at the same time , i 'm glad to hear that you wo n't be going back for a repeat performance . ''

jerking his gaze up to meet hers , he replied , `` never could i do that . ''

`` and you really were trying to get me off your mind ? ''

`` yes , i was . ''

`` in a warped way , that 's very romantic , '' she teased .

`` i 'm glad you think so , '' he mumbled .

`` look , it 's not the fact that she said you were using me for sex that has me so upset . ''

`` it 's not ? ''
