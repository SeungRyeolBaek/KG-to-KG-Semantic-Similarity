it all seemed pretty extreme to her for just an engagement party-it was almost like a wedding .

`` it 's show-time , '' pesh murmured in her ear before he stood up .

she quickly followed his lead .

he took one of the flower wreaths off the table and brought it over her head .

he made sure to adjust her hair so it flowed over the flowers .

when he was done , she did the same , although it was a little harder for her to reach up over his head .

then he took one of the platinum bands and put it on her trembling finger .

`` i love you so very much , megan .

there 's not another woman in the world i could love like i do you , '' he whispered to reassure her .

`` i love you so much , too . ''

she then slid the band on his hand .

once it was done , applause went out over the ballroom , and pesh pulled her to him for a kiss .

`` now what do we do ? ''

she asked .

he smiled at her .

`` we dance . ''

after exhaling the breath she had been holding , megan took pesh 's hand and let him lead her to the dance floor .

a song she had never heard before in her life began to play from the dj .

`` so what were you thinking when it came to the wedding ? ''

pesh asked .

`` something small . ''

his brows rose in surprise .

`` really ?

i was thinking you would want to go all out . ''

she shook her head .

`` i just want something simple with our closest friends and family .

i do n't have to have something showy to make me happy . ''

he grinned .

`` you know that anything 'simple ' is not going to set well with my parents . ''

megan laughed .

`` well , they 're just going to have to accept it . ''

`` we could just run off and get married in a cave in hawaii , '' he suggested .

`` that idea has potential , but i think as my parents ' only daughter , they would kill me if they did n't get to plan something . ''

his expression grew serious .

`` i do n't want us to have to wait much longer . ''

`` i agree .

i want to get married in the next couple of months . ''

he smiled .

`` good .

i 'm glad to hear that . ''

as megan glanced over to see her grandfather dancing with his lady friend , an idea popped into her head .

`` what if we got married in papa 's rose garden ? ''

`` it sounds like a beautiful place , but is there enough room ? ''

`` only our closest friends and family , remember ? ''

she insisted .

`` it could work . ''

`` so you like the idea ? ''

`` i do . ''

with a wink , he said , `` it makes sense considering you proposed to me at patrick 's house . ''

megan grinned .

`` that 's right .

it does . ''

`` think we can put it all together in two months ? ''

`` i do n't see why not . ''

he brought his warm lips to hers , and megan shivered in spite of the heat on the dance floor .

`` i ca n't wait to make you my wife , '' he murmured against her lips .

`` i 'm ready to make an honest man out of you , too . ''

pesh threw his head back and chuckled .

`` only you would say something like that . ''

`` hey , the truth is the truth . ''

the song ended , and pesh escorted her back to their table .

after they finished with the blessings from pesh 's family , dinner was served .

megan could n't believe all the food that was paraded by her .

she lost count on how many plates of delicious indian food she sampled .

by the time the desserts came out , she was thoroughly stuffed and could n't eat any .

`` let 's go mingle , '' she suggested when pesh also turned down any dessert .

`` sounds good to me , '' he said , before getting out of his chair .

they made their way through the maze of tables , talking to family and friends .

megan was introduced to so many of pesh 's relatives that she was sure she would never be able to remember them all .

when they finally got to the fitzgerald tables filled with her parents and aunts and uncles , she was thrilled when pesh took a seat across from aidan and emma .

after they had been talking for a while , emma turned aidan .

`` do you think noah 's okay ? ''

aidan smiled .

`` i 'm sure he 's fine , babe .

the sitter looked very qualified . ''

although emma nodded her head , megan could tell that she was n't convinced .

both mason and noah were upstairs in the hotel with babysitters outside of their family for the first time in their young lives .

megan shared a bit of emma 's apprehension , but when she had dropped mason off in the suite , he seemed to get along with the woman they had hired .

`` i might just go peek in on him .

you know , make sure she got him to sleep , '' emma said , rising out of her chair .
