i open my eyes as i push the water past me with my hands and look up toward the house rising against the sun on my left .

a flash of movement in the second floor window grabs my attention .

there 's a figure moving there , pulling a curtain aside .

at first i think it 's nate-it 's his room , i think-but then i catch a glimpse of blonde hair .

must be his friend jackson .

i turn onto my stomach and dive back under the water .

i want nate to be the one watching me .

i was never much into sports , but i 've always wondered if i 'd be any good at them .

i push harder for the last couple laps and finally pull my head up at the shallow end , gasping for breath .

i take the steps back out of the pool and walk around to my towel and dry off my hair , then drape it onto the chair and lay down on it .

i can feel the suit clinging to my torso , and water sitting in my belly button .

i hear the door to the house open behind me and shield my eyes from the sun as i turn around to see who it is .

jackson bounds out of the door , his face spread in a genial grin .

`` hey , you must be brynn .

i 'm jackson , one of nate 's oldest friends . ''

`` nice to meet you , '' i say as we shake hands .

i notice nate lagging behind , standing just outside the door and looking reluctant to put another foot toward the pool .

`` come on , man , let 's get in .

i 've been dreaming about this pool for days . ''

`` we should n't bother her , she likes to be alone , '' nate says reluctantly .

jackson pulls off his shirt , and i look down at my interlaced fingers in my lap .

he 's got a great body .

maybe not as good as nate 's , but whose is ?

jackson kicks off his flip-flops and jumps in , his splash narrowly missing me .

nate slowly walks toward the chair furthest from me , and takes off his shirt .

i watch his back muscles tense as he lifts it off his head .

`` nate and i grew up playing lacrosse together , '' jackson says , swimming to the edge of the pool and leaning his elbows onto the deck in front of me .

`` hm ?

oh , '' i reply , as nate dives in the deep end .

`` so you guys go to school together ? ''

`` yup .

uva-i mean , of course you knew that . ''

`` which sorority are you in ? ''

he asks , pushing his wet hair out of his eyes .

`` i 'm not .

it 's expensive , and i 'm already pretty busy with work .

um , where do you go ? ''

nate pops up next to jackson .

they make quite a pair , nate with his dark eyes and jackson with his light blonde locks .

`` you wan na get some food now ? ''

nate asks .

`` dude we just got here .

besides , you 're not supposed to eat for thirty minutes after you swim . ''

`` before , '' nate and i both chime in .

we glance at each other as he continues .

`` you 're not supposed to eat for thirty minutes before .

why would n't it be ok to eat after you swim ? ''

`` i dunno , '' jackson replies , flashing me a blindingly white smile .

`` just thought that was the rule . ''

i find myself smiling back at him .

he has a boyish charm that 's infectious .

`` i 'm pretty sure that 's a myth adults made up so they 'd have time to eat their own lunch without the kids swimming unsupervised . ''

i smile .

`` ah that makes more sense .

you grow up around here ? ''

he asks me .

`` yeah , on the eastern shore . ''

`` oh , sweet .

my family has a vacation house there .

i love going out there .

sailing in the bay and everything .

you go sailing a lot ? ''

`` um , not really , '' i reply .

nate kicks off the wall and begins to swim back and forth behind jackson .

i guess he 's decided not to take it easy on his injured shoulder .

`` we should go some time .

maybe not with him , '' he replies , nodding behind him .

`` too competitive . ''

`` he is , is n't he ? ''

it feels nice to be able to talk about nate with someone who knows him .

and who will gossip .

`` was he always like that ? ''

`` oh man , always .

we 're like , ten years old , playing lacrosse on our school team , and coach was constantly having to pull him back during practice 'cause he was always going full out , full contact . ''

he and i laugh together .

i notice nate pause in his stroke , but i ca n't imagine he can hear us .

`` do you still play lacrosse ? ''

`` naw , i do n't really have the discipline to keep up with it .

i was good in high school , but you have to be great to cut it in college .

what sport do you play ? ''

`` oh , none . ''
