`` i do n't know ... i mean , maybe he was just a flirt , and it got blown out of proportion , you know ? ''

`` i bet that 's what it is , '' allison says , nodding her head sagely .

`` who knows how stories like that really get started ?

and once they 're out there , you ca n't erase them . ''

`` i hope that 's what it is ... i do n't want to discount some woman 's , or women 's , experience just because it would be inconvenient for me , though , and painful for my mom .

she would be so crushed if it were true . ''

`` i would n't worry about it .

and that girl said they were old stories , right ? ''

`` right . ''

`` and you said he treats your mom well , so i bet they 're just ugly rumors . ''

`` yeah , yeah , '' i reply , pushing the thought of pierce 's alleged misbehavior to the back of my brain .

`` how 's the place you 're staying at george washington ? ''

i ask , knowing she 's taking advantage of a program at the nearby university to give summer interns a low-cost place to stay in an otherwise expensive city .

`` it 's fine .

my roommate 's kinda loud , though .

how 's your new house ? ''

`` it 's so big !

i do n't know why anyone would need that much space .

i mean before my mom and i got there , it was just for two people .

well , three , including the maid . ''

`` there 's a maid ? ! ''

`` there was .

she does n't live there anymore .

oh , and there 's all this flagstone on it , so i thought it was old , but my mom said that pierce had the house built around fifteen years ago .

he must have spent a lot of money to make something so new look worn-in . ''

`` you 're lucky , '' allison says .

`` i know . ''

`` how 's the stepbrother ?

i do n't know if i could live with a dumb jock . ''

`` well , nate 's not dumb .

i 've been in a few classes with him , and he 's really smart .

he was even waitlisted for a lawn room . ''

`` you 're a little defensive of him , '' allison observes , sipping her water .

`` yeah , i guess so .

i do n't know why though .

he 's been playing these weird mind games with me . ''

`` mind games ? ''

she repeats , frowning .

i push a crouton around my plate as i think about how much to tell her .

i have a feeling it 's not the kind of situation she 'd condone , but i also really want to talk to someone about what 's been going on .

`` well , you remember that i used to have a crush on him ? ''

`` yeah , i remember you saying something about it sophomore year . ''

`` i ... i still have a crush on him .

or i think i do ... i do n't know .

i 'm definitely attracted to him , and he 's aware of the fact .

he can be really rude , and then last night , he almost kissed me , but he ... '' `` whoa , what ?

i mean , brynn , he 's your stepbrother . ''

`` i know !

but only for the last few weeks , and- '' `` ok ... but what if you did kiss ?

what then ?

you 'd have to see him every day , because your mom and his dad are married .

and then even if you were n't living together , what about holidays ?

you 'd be cutting the thanksgiving turkey and sitting across from the guy you 'd made out with ... for every thanksgiving . ''

`` ugh , you 're right , '' i reply , dropping my fork and covering my face with my hands .

this is why i did n't want to tell allison-she 'd throw logic in the face of my hormones .

but the truth is , she 's right .

i feel like a bucket of cold water has just been poured over my head .

`` you 're right , '' i repeat .

`` i ca n't believe i even let it get this far . ''

i head back to the office after lunch and spend the rest of the afternoon sitting in an awkward silence with constance .

i try to get her to engage about online shopping , but she only offers me one-word responses .

later in the day i meet another intern named greg , a cute , strawberry-blonde guy who blushes when i look him in the eye .

he is more the kind of person i should be looking to date .

i just wish i felt that same rush that i do whenever i 'm around nate .

i drive home just after six in the old audi that was just sitting in the thornhill 's garage .

it 's definitely the most expensive car i 've ever driven , and it 's fun to really let out the engine on the short stretch of the beltway on my way back to potomac .

i park in the garage and let myself in to the small anteroom off the kitchen , where i kick off my shoes .

`` mom ? ''

i call out , before spotting her outside on the back lawn , talking on the phone as the sun sets behind her .
