he felt neither of those emotions .

he had to admit he was a little surprised .

aidan had failed to mention that fact as well .

not to mention , she seemed young to be a mother , considering she was just finishing her clinicals .

`` it 's nice to meet you , mason . ''

`` can you tell pesh hi ? ''

megan urged .

`` hi , esh , '' mason said , with a grin .

pesh could n't help laughing , and he was thankful that megan giggled as well .

`` how old are you ? ''

mason held up two fingers to which megan shook her head .

`` he 's seventeen months . ''

pesh smiled .

`` you must be very proud of him . ''

`` i am . ''

she snuggled mason against her chest .

`` he 's the sweetest and best boy i could ever hope for . ''

`` you 're very blessed . ''

`` thank you . ''

they were interrupted by aidan 's sister , angie , who pesh had met earlier .

`` looks like it 's time to start .

come on mason .

mommy has to go be noah 's godmother now . ''

mason reluctantly went to his grandmother .

`` be good for grammy , '' megan instructed .

after angie walked off with mason , the other family members began filing out of the room .

pesh turned to megan and gave her a sheepish smile .

`` i must admit that even though i attended a class with emma , i 'm a little unsure of what i 'm supposed to do . ''

`` it 's okay .

just follow my lead , and you 'll be fine . ''

`` thank you . ''

once it was only the two of them and aidan and emma in the room , aidan motioned for them .

a priest in decorated golden robes appeared at the door with a gleaming crucifix in his hands .

pesh tried not to feel intimidated as the odd man out in the situation .

music struck up on the organ , and the priest motioned for them to follow .

before they went out the door , emma glanced down at noah .

`` please , please , do not scream in there and act like a demon baby .

be the angel i know you can be . ''

he acknowledged her request by sticking his tongue out and flailing his fists .

aidan chuckled at emma 's plea .

`` relax , babe .

if he feels you getting all tense , he 's going to get fussy . ''

emma sighed .

`` he 's already fussy .

he was fine until i put him in the gown . ''

`` i guess he feels that wearing a dress is insulting to his manhood , '' aidan reasoned with a smile .

when emma shot aidan a death glare , megan and pesh could n't help laughing at the two of them .

aidan winked at emma before starting out the door .

at megan 's side , pesh walked up the aisle .

when they reached the baptismal font , the music ended , and the priest began speaking .

he informed the crowd of what was about to take place and the significance of all the religious rites noah was about to receive .

aidan and emma made the sign of the cross on noah 's forehead before megan leaned in to do the same .

when megan elbowed him , pesh reached over to clumsily follow their lead .

after he finished , he glanced at megan .

she smiled and mouthed , `` good job . ''

he returned her smile .

he followed through the rest of the proceedings as aidan and emma pledged to raise noah in the faith .

then it came time for him and megan to agree to stand by noah as godparents .

the priest took a fussing noah from emma 's arms .

when the first trickles of water hit the base of noah 's head , he cooed and kicked his arms and legs .

emma appeared relieved at how noah was n't behaving like a possessed baby as she had feared .

`` thank god he loves his baths , '' aidan muttered beside pesh .

once the baptism part was finished , the priest made a final talk , and then it was over .

just as pesh sighed with relief and was looking forward to making a quick exit , aidan grabbed his arm .

`` do n't go anywhere .

we have to do pictures . ''

inwardly , he groaned .

he wanted , no he needed , a moment alone to process his thoughts .

everything had been so overwhelming-being outside his usual world , meeting all of aidan 's family , and then having the prospect of megan thrown in as well .

awkwardly , he stood around as a photographer came forward and proceeded to take several pictures of aidan , emma , and noah .

then it was just aidan and noah or emma and noah .

`` okay , i need the godparents now . ''

pesh smoothed down his tie and allowed the photographer to pose him in the group shot .

after they finished with the four of them , noah was handed to megan for pictures with just the godparents .

as the photographer pushed megan closer against pesh 's chest , he glanced down at her .

her reassuring smile caused his heartbeat to accelerate .

for the first time , he noticed the sweet aroma of her hair as the long , blonde strands brushed against him .

he could also make out the alluring scent of her perfume .
