neither of us start our jobs in town for another week , but i 'm glad we came early .

we have all the unpacking to do , we still need a lot of furniture ... `` are you going to get tired of me ? ''

nate asks , walking over and wrapping his arms around my waist .

`` living together , you mean ?

absolutely .

are you going to get sick of me ? ''

`` absolutely , '' he says , nodding seriously , then he grins .

`` i love you . ''

`` i love you , too , '' i reply as he leans in to kiss me .

once such a big deal for him to say , nate now tells me he loves me regularly .

i squirm happily as his tongue darts quickly against mine .

a year later , and his kisses still make me weak in the knees .

`` what 's that box ? ''

i ask as he releases me and i glance over his shoulder .

`` which ? ''

he asks , looking around .

`` there , '' i say , pointing to a medium-sized box sitting where we plan to put the couch , when we get one .

`` dunno , '' he says with a shrug .

`` clothes ? ''

`` mm , no , i do n't think so , '' i reply , walking over to it and picking it up .

`` it 's really light . ''

i shake it and can just hear the crinkling of paper .

`` that 's weird . ''

i set it back down on the floor and kneel next to it , scratching at the corner of the packing tape sealing it shut .

i finally get enough up to get my finger under it , and pull it across the boxes flaps .

nick comes to stand near me as i pull it open .

`` i really do n't remember packing this one , but maybe i 'm going crazy . ''

it has been an eventful week .

we graduated last weekend , and played host to both of our moms , and then just a few days later we were driving up to boston .

we both managed to secure jobs here , nate with a historical society , and me in the research side of a non-profit .

i pull the brown packing paper out of the box , piling it on the floor next to me .

`` oh dear , did i pack an empty box ? ''

i ask , just as my fingers close around a much smaller box at the bottom of the larger one .

`` what 's ... '' my eyes widen as i realize i 'm holding a jewelry box .

i glance up at nate , who 's grinning at me .

he kneels down onto the hardwood floor next to me .

`` oh my god , '' i murmur , as he takes the small box out of my hands .

of course we 've discussed marriage , but i did n't think he would propose so soon .

`` brynn , '' he whispers , `` i 've come alive since i met you .

my world before you came into it was cold and dark , and then you showed up and brought light into it .

every day , i find a new reason to fall more in love with you .

i know we 're still young , but i want so much to have the honor of calling you my wife .

will you marry me ? ''

he asks , opening the box .

i stare at the simple , beautiful diamond ring sitting in the middle of the red velvet box as my eyes fill with tears .

`` yes , yes , of course i 'll marry you , '' i gasp , wrapping my arms around his neck and covering him with kisses .

he laughs joyously and lifts me off the ground with his free arm .

`` here , try it on , '' he finally says .

`` i measured your ring finger while you were sleeping . ''

`` sneaky ! ''

i tease him as he slips the ring on my hand .

`` it 's a perfect fit , '' i say , holding it toward the nearest window so the light catches it .

`` should we call your mom ? ''

he asks , wrapping his arms back around my waist .

`` let 's wait until tomorrow .

for today , only you and i will know . ''

`` only you , '' he echoes , pressing his forehead against mine .

`` only you . ''

the end chapter one `` i thought you said this was going to be a small gathering , '' i shout , raising my voice above the blaring music .

i can feel the pounding bass line vibrating through my body as i hesitate at the edge of the gigantic house party .

`` did i say that ? ''

my best friend , riley , grins back .

`` i meant to say that this was going to be an 'epic rager unlike anything you 've ever seen ' . ''

i roll my eyes at her as we 're swallowed up by the teeming crowd of our classmates .

i should have known better than to think that riley would spend her saturday night anywhere but at a legendary party .

she and i have been best friends for all seventeen years we 've been on the planet .

but even so , our ideas of what makes a `` good time '' are starkly different .

if i had any sense at all , i would never have let her drag me to this party .
