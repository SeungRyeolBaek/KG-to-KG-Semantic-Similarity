`` no , i want to .

not just for you , either .

for nate .

he needs you in his life .

i can tell that you 're good , and kind , and he needs people like that to love him .

please let me help you . ''

`` i do n't want to put you in a position ... i do n't want to jeopardize anything .

you and nate , you have a special relationship . ''

`` um , sure , yeah , he 's a great guy , '' i hedge .

`` brynn ... it 's ok .

i know . ''

i swallow .

`` know what ? ''

`` when i saw you that day at the boathouse , i could just tell .

at first i thought you were his girlfriend , and then i realized who you were , and i saw the way you two looked at each other .

you 're in love , '' she whispers .

i begin to tug at my hair nervously .

shit .

shit .

`` you 've acted on your feelings ? ''

it 's all i can do to nod .

`` do your parents know ? ''

i shake my head .

`` brynn , you do n't have to be embarrassed .

life 's messy .

people find love wherever they can .

hell , it 's not like you 're breaking any laws . ''

my tears begin to slip down my face again , renewed .

`` i ca n't believe it 's so obvious . ''

`` maybe i just caught you two in an unguarded moment .

but , see , if nate and you are together , i do n't want to come between you . ''

`` honestly , i 'd like him to meet you .

i think it might do him some good .

when pierce was chewing me out tonight , he did n't say anything . ''

`` i 'm sorry . ''

`` so you 'll meet with him ? ''

`` if you 're sure it 's ok with you . ''

`` i 'm not sure how i 'll set it up yet , but write down your number for me , and i 'll get in touch with you when i know . ''

she nods and tears a slip of paper from a paperback book in the back seat .

as she hands it to me and i get out of the car , she leans over into the passenger seat .

`` brynn , if i could just give you a little advice ... i would avoid pierce for the next few days .

he does n't like it when people stand up to him . ''

i nod and shut the door , walking slowly back to the house as i run my fingers over her phone number .

i peer cautiously through the first floor windows , not wanting to walk back in on dinner , but it looks like they 've finished and the plates have all been cleared .

i quietly open the front door and tiptoe up the stairs to my bedroom , locking my door behind me .

i put eileen 's phone number on my bureau and am just about to change out of my dress when i hear a soft knock on the door .

usually nate just comes in now , so he clearly knows that i 'm upset with him .

i walk over and unlock it , then open it a few inches .

`` you locked it ? ''

he asks , looking hurt .

`` i want to be alone right now , '' i murmur , though a knot forms in my throat at the thought of spending the first night in a week without him .

`` i ... i ca n't choose between you , '' he whispers .

he looks so forlorn , and i see a glimpse of the little boy that he once was , overhearing his parents ' arguments .

`` i know . ''

`` they 're going to some charity lunch tomorrow afternoon ... maybe we could spend some time together . ''

`` ok , '' i nod , my mind already moving in a different direction .

he pauses , unsure if he should kiss me .

`` alright , goodnight , '' he says , and walks down the hallway to his bedroom .

i close and lock the door after him , then grab my cell phone and put in eileen 's number .

tomorrow afternoon , i text her .

i 'll let you know when my parents are gone , and then you come meet nate .

chapter twenty-six i yawn as i sit by my window , waiting for the sounds of my mom and pierce leaving .

i was n't able to sleep well at all last night .

there were too many worries rattling around in my brain .

mainly , though , it felt strange not to see nate .

i missed his presence in my bed with a physical ache that gnawed away at me .

finally i hear some movement in the rest of the house .

i walk to my door and crack it open , sticking my head out into the hall .

i can just hear my mom murmuring something to pierce as they make their way to the garage .

soon i hear the car pulling out of the driveway and i glance at the clock .

i 'll give them ten minutes .

i wait impatiently , and as soon as it 's up , i text eileen and head down to the foyer .

luckily nate has been safely ensconced in his room all morning .

i do n't know if he even got up to train this morning , which is highly unusual for him .
