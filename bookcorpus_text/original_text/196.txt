`` you 've really blossomed this summer , brynn .

you 've become a woman , '' he says , stepping into me .

i can feel his warm breath on my face .

`` i want you to get away from me , '' i whisper , my throat tightening .

`` just for a moment ... i need to feel ... '' he moans pitifully , sliding his hand onto my hip and then over my ass .

my anger ignites at his touch , blasting away my fear .

i get my arms up between us and shove him away .

`` get off me , you fucking asshole ! ''

i scream .

he looks at me in shock .

`` you think you 're some gentleman with your fancy suits and your mansion , but inside you 're just some sick pervert , taking advantage of anyone you can .

i see who you really are , even if no one else does . ''

his face twists with anger , and i feel my cheek light up with pain before my brain can process that he 's slapped me .

i bring my hand up to my burning face , my head still pulled to the side , just as pierce disappears in a blur .

i straighten up with a gasp as i realize nate has just tackled him to the floor , and they are now grappling fiercely on the kitchen tiles .

`` do n't you fucking touch her ! ''

he yells at his father , whose face is turning red in an effort to defend himself against his much stronger son .

i hear footsteps from the stairwell and see my mom running down the hallway and manage to unfreeze myself .

`` nate !

nate , stop ! ''

i yell , as he manages to find the top position .

my mom screams as nate punches pierce hard across his jaw .

i throw myself on nate 's back as he cocks his arm back in preparation for another punch .

`` nate , i 'm ok , i 'm ok , '' i repeat in his ear .

i feel him relax a little and begin to pull him up .

he drops his arm and stands up with me .

pierce pushes him away as he stands up , too , and they face off , each breathing heavily , pierce with a trail of blood dripping from the corner of his mouth .

`` what 's going on ? ''

my mom finally whispers , her voice full of fear .

`` i saw everything , '' nate growls , addressing his father .

`` you hypocrite . ''

to my shock , pierce begins to laugh .

`` i knew it , i knew it !

look at you two ! ''

he says , pointing at us .

`` what 's he talking about ? ''

my mom asks , glancing at me .

`` they 're fucking ! ''

pierce bursts out .

`` no ... what ? ''

my mom murmurs .

`` oh , christ , holly , are you really that fucking stupid ?

you did n't even suspect ? ''

my mom shakes her head .

`` that 's why you 're fighting ? ''

`` no , '' nate says , turning to her .

`` i saw him trying to feel up brynn , and then she told him to stop , and he slapped her . ''

a look of horror spreads across my mom 's face .

she looks at me , then at pierce .

`` is this true ?

is it true ? ''

pierce does n't even bother responding to her accusations , just turns his palms upward and shrugs .

a wailing cry escapes my mom 's lips .

for a second i think she 's going to collapse , but then she throws herself at pierce , her limbs a blur as she attacks him .

`` i trusted you !

i trusted you ! ''

she screams .

pierce puts his arms up to defend himself as nate steps forward and wraps his arms around her , hemming her in and then pulling her away .

`` my own daughter !

my own daughter , you son of a bitch ! ''

with a strangled cry , she turns her head and begins to sob against nate 's chest .

pierce surveys the three of us , aligned against him on the other side of the kitchen .

`` nothing ? ''

nate whispers , as he rubs my mom 's shoulder .

`` you have nothing to say for yourself ? ''

`` come on , nate .

you 're really going to believe them ? ''

pierce says , a sneer of contempt on his face .

`` i do n't have to-i saw you with my own eyes .

but i should have believed brynn in the first place , '' nate says quietly , though i can hear the strength in his voice .

pierce can only manage a snort of derision before he walks toward the hallway .

`` my mother , '' nate says , and pierce stops , his back still toward his son .

`` you made everything up , did n't you ? ''

pierce stands frozen for a moment , his head slightly cocked to the side .

i ca n't see his face , and ca n't imagine what could be going on inside his mind .

his carefully crafted history , now falling apart around him .

he shakes his head slightly , as if waving away an unpleasant smell , then continues to walk down the hallway .

he heads straight to the front door , and shuts it behind him .

as we hear the sound of his car heading down the driveway , my mom straightens up , and nate 's arms fall to his sides .
