as nate walks back over , he smiles as he sees me struggling to smear it in between the straps of my sports bra .

`` want some help ? '

he asks .

`` ... sure , '' i reply , though i 'm anything but .

the idea of nate 's hands on me , when i know nothing else is going to happen , sounds like torture .

i might actually prefer getting a first-degree sunburn , but he 's already taken the bottle from me and squeezing some of it out into his palm .

`` um , just pull the back of your shirt up , '' he instructs me .

i do as he says , pulling it up to my hairline .

i feel his greased-up hands slipping under the straps of my bra , and am glad he ca n't see the blush that immediately spreads across my face .

i take a deep breath , trying to keep my raging hormones at bay , as his fingers slide around the side of my ribcage .

`` now you do me , '' he says , as i release my shirt .

`` that 's what she said , '' i mutter .

`` ha ! ''

nate barks , a short , joyful shout of laughter .

`` i did n't know you were funny brynn , '' he says , grinning wide at me .

`` there 's a lot you do n't know about me . ''

i say , daring to meet his gaze for a brief moment .

i clear my throat and take the bottle of sunscreen from him , willing myself to keep my thoughts clean .

he pauses , then turns around and pulls off his shirt .

i groan inwardly at the sight of his wide , muscular back .

where are our parents ?

i need some kind of buffer between us .

but there are no signs of any cars pulling into the parking lot anytime soon , so i dutifully squeeze some lotion onto my fingers and then begin to spread it across his back .

i carefully press it all the way up to his neck , across his shoulder blades-feeling the sinewy ropes of muscle there , down his back , and finally down to the top of his athletic shorts , my fingers venturing just inside his waistband .

i hear him suck in a small bit of air , and see the slight throbbing of his member in his shorts .

he 's trying hard to hold back , i can tell .

`` ok , all done ! ''

i say overly cheerily , as i hand him the bottle .

nate tosses his shirt into the back of his jeep and begins to spread sunscreen across his chest .

i keep my eyes trained on the hazy river .

`` they say how long they were going to be ? ''

`` nope , my mom just said- '' i break off as i hear my phone start to ring in my purse on the front seat .

`` i bet that 's her now .

hey , mom , '' i greet her as i accept the call .

`` hey , honey . ''

`` what 's wrong ? ''

i ask , immediately hearing stress in her voice .

`` oh , it 's nothing , but pierce wo n't be able to get out of the office long enough to go kayaking today .

i 'm just going to drive down to the office now , so at least he and i can have lunch together . ''

`` ok , should we- '' `` no , you two go kayaking and have fun , alright ?

we 'll see you tonight for dinner . ''

`` oh , alright , if you 're sure , '' i reply , wincing as i catch nate watching me , his muscular torso gleaming in the sun .

`` your dad got caught up in work stuff , and my mom 's going to go meet him at the office for lunch , so they 're not coming .

they said we should still go if we want , '' i explain as i hang up .

`` since we 're here , '' nate says with a shrug .

`` you ever been kayaking here before ? ''

`` never been kayaking at all . ''

`` well , you 'll love it , '' he replies , locking up his car .

`` says the captain of the uva crew team . ''

i smile .

in short order , we 're pushing off the dock in a tandem kayak .

with nate 's powerful oar strokes , we quickly clear the shallow , muddy water and head toward the open water .

`` you 'll get the hang of it , '' nate encourages me , and i turn around to smile sheepishly at him .

`` i think i 'm just holding you back , here , '' i laugh , trying to get the feeling of how to dip the oar in the water at the right time .

`` well , i have a lot more experience than you in a boat , '' he says .

`` we used to train for crew on the potomac in high school , but we were a lot closer in to the city .

we 'd pass georgetown , the kennedy center ... you 'd be amazed at the wildlife you can see out here , though , '' he tells me as he steers us upriver and into the current .

`` i feel so far away from everything , '' i observe as the sounds of traffic are quickly covered up by the trees rising on either side of us .
