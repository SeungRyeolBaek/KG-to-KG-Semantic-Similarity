`` christ , '' i mutter , stepping out of the way just in time .

`` watch where you're- '' `` there you are , '' a very familiar voice says .

`` i was looking for you . ''

i glance up only to find emerson 's blue eyes looking back at me .

i do my best to tamp down my automatic excitement at seeing him .

ca n't let him get me all riled up , now .

`` oh ? ''

i say , feigning indifference .

`` and why were you looking for me ? ''

`` because we 're getting out of here , '' he replies , as if it 's the most obvious thing in the world .

`` right now .

let 's go . ''

`` i thought you said we were heading out after school ? ''

i reply , even more confused .

`` i say a lot of things , '' emerson shrugs , `` but right now , i 'm saying that you and i are getting in my chevy and blowing this pop stand .

what , are you afraid to miss math class or something , miss rowan ? ''

`` do n't be an ass , '' i mutter .

`` if you 're so hell-bent on leaving now , fine .

it 's your freakin ' birthday , after all . ''

`` that 's the spirit , '' he grins , turning on his heel .

`` let 's go , sis . ''

he walks away toward the student parking lot , and i turn to stare at riley , bewildered .

`` what are you waiting for ? ''

she whispers , giving me a little push , `` go with him ! ''

`` all right , all right , '' i mutter , and set off after emerson .

i 've never straight-up ditched school before , but i ca n't let him see that i 'm nervous about this little operation .

struggling to appear cool as a cucumber , i duck through the front doors on his heels and hurry over to his chevy .

holding my breath as i slide into the passenger seat , it occurs to me as strange that there 's no one else hitching a ride with us .

i thought we 'd be transporting at least a couple of emerson 's meat head friends to the beach with us .

emerson steers the chevy out of the school parking lot , and for a moment it seems that we 're totally in the clear .

that is , until the security guard at the front gates looks up from his crossword puzzle with a scowl .

`` you might want to duck down in your seat a little , '' emerson tells me .

i obey , without daring to ask why .

the security guard lumbers out of his hutch , signaling for us to stop .

emerson eases up on the gas as we approach , rolling toward the gates .

but just as we 're coming up on the school guard , my reckless companion floors it .

with a rabid whirr of the engine , we fly past the baffled guard and swing out onto the main road out of town .

i swallow down a terrified yelp as i watch our school shrink behind us in the rearview mirror .

`` desperate times , right ? ''

emerson laughs , slapping the steering wheel with his palms .

`` i do n't understand why you 're so desperate to get to some stupid house party , '' i grumble , crossing my arms .

`` even if it is in honor of your birthday . ''

emerson raises an eyebrow at me , an amused grin spreading across his face .

`` holy shit , abby , '' he crows , laughing at my surly expression .

`` you are , hands down , the most gullible person on the planet .

did you seriously think- ? ''

`` what ? ''

i ask , sitting up a little straighter , `` did i think what ? ''

`` did you seriously think i was going to blow off what we planned for some stupid birthday party ?

damn .

i must be a better liar than i thought , '' he chuckles , pulling out a cigarette .

my heart inflates like a helium balloon as i catch his drift .

`` you mean , '' i breathe , `` we 're still on ?

for ... ? ''

`` of course we 're still on , '' he says , glancing my way .

`` you think i 'd actually miss the chance to follow through on my promise to you ?

you must be out of your damn mind , lady . ''

`` but then why- ?

what- ? ''

i stammer , smiling despite myself .

`` i had to feed bob and deb that house party bullshit , '' he explains , turning off onto the highway ramp .

`` they may be the two most oblivious , self-centered people on the continent , but even they would have been suspicious if their teenage son and daughter had announced they were going off on a romantic seaside retreat together . ''

`` you know something sawyer , '' i say , beaming at his brilliance , `` you 're a lot smarter than you look . ''

`` wish i could say the same for you , '' he scoffs playfully .

`` i ca n't believe you fell for that whole thing . ''

`` guess my heart is just too pure and wholesome for my own good , '' i kid , fluttering my eyelashes daintily .

`` or you 're just gullible as hell , '' emerson replies , cranking up the radio and laying on the speed as we soar along the highway .
