i slip everything back on as quickly as i can , and then look back at him .

his eyes are closed , and he 's sitting nude and perfectly still on the edge of the bed .

he looks as perfect as i 've ever seen him look , which is really saying something .

my heart breaks a little , as i move to the door and shut it behind me .

i hurry down the hall and into my own bedroom , which now feels cold and empty .

i crawl into bed without bothering to take off my clothes and pull the covers over me .

i 'm no different to nate thornhill than any of the other girls he 's been with , and i should have known that .

stupid , stupid , stupid .

i hear a soft knock at the door and pull the covers up a little higher , but do n't answer .

if it 's my mom , i do n't want to see her , and if it 's nate , i really do n't want to see him .

there 's another knock , a little louder , and then the door is slowly pushed open .

i can just see nate 's shadow in the moonlight .

he closes the door behind him and moves into the room .

to my surprise , he walks around the foot of my bed and to the other side , then hops on , lying down over the covers next to me .

`` i 'm sorry , '' he whispers , laying his hands over his stomach .

`` you do n't have to apologize .

you were just being honest . ''

`` no , i think i do .

and i 'll stop interfering with you and other guys . ''

i clear my throat to keep the pain down .

`` good . ''

`` i do n't really have female friends ... '' he says .

`` dana ? ''

`` dana and i are , well , fuck buddies , mostly .

and that 's what she wants , too , so it 's ok. '' `` mmm . ''

`` but i 'd ... i 'd like us to be friends . ''

`` we 're already step-siblings , '' i point out .

i can hear him smile next to me .

`` true .

but that was n't by choice . ''

he pauses .

`` i like you .

i ca n't deny that i 'm attracted to you , of course , but i 'm just not the relationship kind of guy .

not to mention the kind of issues that dating my own stepsister would bring up . ''

he sighs .

`` so can we be friends ? ''

i consider for a moment .

if i 'm nate 's only female friend , then i really am different to him .

maybe not in the way i 'd most like , but still , it 's something .

`` ok. friends , then .

wait , actually , '' i turn onto my side and face him .

`` before we 're officially friends , i have to ask you some non-friend questions . ''

`` ok ... '' he replies warily , turning on his side , too .

`` was i ... am i ... ok at all that stuff ?

you know ... '' he laughs .

`` what we just did , you mean ?

yes .

you are more than ok at it . ''

i smile .

`` when did you lose your virginity ? ''

`` when i was fourteen . ''

`` wow . ''

`` she was my friend 's older sister . ''

`` wow . ''

`` how many women have you slept with ? ''

`` oh my god , i do n't even know ... '' `` wait , really ?

you do n't even know ? ''

`` i mean , dozens ?

i do n't count . ''

`` sheesh .

ok , one more : why are n't you the relationship kind of guy ? ''

he pauses .

`` i do n't know , '' he says softly .

`` i tried a couple times , but that kind of closeness , it just makes me uncomfortable .

that 's all i know . ''

i nod , sensing he 's telling me everything he can , and roll back over onto my back .

i like the feeling of lying here with him next to me .

i feel much more comfortable than i would have thought possible .

i feel my eyes beginning to flutter closed as sleep pulls me under .

`` brynn ... i ... ''

i can just hear nate say .

`` you 're going to make some man very happy one day . ''

chapter seventeen `` i 'm just glad the whole thing has blown over , '' greg says as we pull off the beltway .

i nod as i look out at the trees whizzing by in the dark .

the woman who accused pierce of sexual harassment rescinded her claims after it turned out she had accused two other former bosses of the same thing .

`` it just feels like there 's been a shadow over the office for the last month . ''

`` yeah , '' i reply noncommittally .

greg clears his throat as we near my house .

`` so , i 'm glad we got the chance to go out again , '' he says .

`` me too , '' i reply with a smile .

this is our third date , and he still has n't tried anything .

i 'm wondering if tonight will be the night .
