`` well , congratulations , both of you , '' my mom breaks in .

`` i have no idea what i 'm going to order !

everything looks so wonderful . ''

she runs her finger down the menu in front of her .

having grown up in a family of irish immigrants , my mom has always avoided conflict like the plague , though this time i 'm glad for the change of subject .

i decide to order the steak since money does n't seem to be an issue , and we each order a cocktail in addition to the champagne .

something begins to tug at the back of my brain after the waitress leaves to put in our food orders .

`` pierce , i 'm sorry if this is an ignorant question , but were you in office ?

your name sounds so familiar . ''

`` yes , '' he replies , looking pleased .

`` i 'm a former congressman- '' `` -for virginia .

now i remember .

you helped pass the campaign finance reforms . ''

i smile .

`` good memory . ''

`` one of my majors is political science , so i try to keep up with it . ''

`` and your other major ? ''

`` global health . ''

`` you know , i run thornhill and co .

consulting of k street , and we 're still looking for a summer intern .

interested ? ''

`` dad , i thought you were going- '' nate breaks in before i can respond .

`` and i thought you were going to get a lawn room , '' his dad replies , keeping his voice light .

`` so , brynn , what do you think ? ''

`` well , um , i was just going to get a summer job back in maryland to help pay for tuition , '' i murmur .

did pierce promise his son the internship ?

i do n't want to start off this relationship with nate on the wrong foot .

`` you do n't need to worry about tuition now , honey , '' my mom says softly .

i look at her in surprise .

oh my god-is pierce going to pay for my college bills ?

the thought had n't even occurred to me .

i look between them as they stare back at me calmly .

`` oh , oh , i did n't think-i mean , i 'd love to , but i just-if nate wants the- '' `` then it 's settled , '' pierce cuts in .

`` i tend to go into the office quite early , but we have an extra car you can use . ''

`` sorry ?

i do n't understand . ''

`` well , pierce and i are moving in together .

i mean , i basically live there now , but i 'm officially selling the old house , now that we 're married . ''

`` right .

of course . ''

my brain scrambles to process all the new information .

just as i 'm working it all out , i feel a hand on my knee .

i look down in surprise to see nate 's arm disappearing under the tablecloth .

i glance at him .

he 's looking straight ahead as though nothing 's happening .

i struggle to maintain my composure as heat travels from his hand and all the way up to ... `` so , this summer , i 'll be living with you then ?

all of you ? ''

nate turns to smile at me politely .

his hand moves another inch up the bare skin of my thigh .

i widen my eyes at him but he does n't react .

`` that 's right .

we 'll all be living at pierce 's house- '' `` our house , '' pierce corrects my mom with a smile .

`` our house , in potomac .

it 's got tons of space , beautiful views of the river .

it 'll be wonderful to have the summer to bond with each other , and really become a family . ''

nate 's hand moves another inch up my leg .

i can feel the rough , calloused skin of his palm .

i 've never been so turned on in my life , but i 'm struggling against it .

what is he thinking ?

we 're at dinner with our parents !

`` i know you have some stuff at the old house , but we 'll have it moved to the new one .

everything will be all set up when you get home , '' my mom says , smiling at me .

`` mmm , '' i reply , trying to focus on her words .

`` i was n't that attached to the old place anyway , '' i add with a shrug .

we 'd moved a couple times after my dad left , so no one place has ever felt like home .

nate 's hand moves another inch up my thigh , pushing up the hem of my dress so his fingers rest under it .

my whole body is tingling .

holy hell , i can barely breathe .

i 'm shocked pierce and my mom do n't seem to notice that anything 's happening .

with his other hand , nate takes a calm sip from his champagne flute .

where 's the waitress ?

he 'll have to move his hand when the food comes .

he moves his hand up another inch .

i ca n't take it any longer-another second and i 'm going to start moaning .

as my mom moves her head to pierce 's ear to murmur sweet nothings , i slide my fork off the table and press it tongs-first into the top of nate 's hand .
