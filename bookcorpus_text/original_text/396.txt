he looked a little bit like a small boy on christmas morning , eager to see what kinds of presents he 'd received under the tree .

she took a step closer and looked inside the stable and the sight she saw made her gasp with awe .

staring back at her were two of the most beautiful thoroughbred horses she 'd ever seen in her life .

one was pure white and the other pure black , both of them just standing in the middle of the large stall , sniffing the air in order to determine if the new scent was friend or foe .

when she stuck out her hand , wanting to touch the newest beauties , they rebuffed her initially , too proud to come close .

`` here , '' rais said and handed her some sugar cubes .

`` they both have a horrible sweet tooth . ''

she took the sugar cubes , pretending that she did n't shiver when their hands touched , then turned back to the beauties .

`` i thought a white thoroughbred was rare . ''

`` they are .

but this one came on sale just a few months ago .

there was a bidding war for him but i was determined . ''

as the horses approached , sniffing in her hand to see what she had for them , rachel could n't stop her eyes from rolling at his comment .

`` of course you won .

do n't you always ? ''

`` i prefer to win .

do n't you ? ''

he leaned against the stall , watching her as she smiled at the horses as they nuzzled her palm licking up the last of the sugar crystals .

`` oh , i would love to win all the time .

but that does n't happen . ''

`` what have you lost recently ? ''

she asked , not believing he 'd ever lost at anything in his life .

his smile grew slightly and he shrugged one shoulder .

`` nothing recently . ''

she raised one eyebrow at him as she said , `` have you ever lost something ? ''

he laughed softly and moved closer , running his hand down the black mare 's neck .

`` sure i 've lost .

i do n't keep track of those issues though .

i move on and figure out how to overcome that challenge . ''

he hesitated for a moment , then said , `` come riding with me tomorrow ? ''

immediately she shook her head .

`` i ca n't . ''

`` why not ?

you used to love to ride .

and i used to love watching you ride .

i have n't seen you on a horse in years . ''

she blushed and shook her head again .

`` i ride , '' she countered .

`` just not when i 'm around .

why is that ? ''

she shrugged , feeling as if he were closing in on her .

`` i guess our schedules just have n't been in sync lately . ''

`` or you 've purposely been avoiding me . ''

she bit her lower lip nervously and took a step backwards .

`` why would i do that ? ''

she shook her head .

`` no , it 's really just been a crazy period in my life . ''

`` then come with me .

show me that you can ride like you used to . ''

`` i ca n't . ''

`` you ca n't ride like you used to or you ca n't ride at all ? ''

`` i can ride ! ''

she gasped , rising to the challenge he was tossing out there at her .

`` good .

then we 'll ride tomorrow morning . ''

she blinked and shook her head slightly .

`` what ?

no , i did n't mean that i could ... . '' `` it 's settled , rachel .

you can even ride this guy here . ''

what had just happened ?

`` i did n't agree to ride with you ! ''

she gasped .

he moved in even closer .

`` sure you did .

i know that you 're afraid to be alone with me for some reason .

but it will be fine tomorrow .

i 'll be the perfect gentleman . ''

she laughed and shook her head .

`` i 've seen you in action , rais .

you 're never the perfect gentleman . ''

he put his hands on her hips as he moved even closer .

`` were you spying on me as a kid ? ''

he asked softly , his eyes looking at her lips .

she pressed back against the wall , her breathing ragged and heavy .

`` no ! ''

`` then how do you know i was n't a gentleman ? ''

`` i was n't spying .

i was around doing my chores or my homework and you just happened to be around with your ... . '' she halted , not exactly sure what to call the parade of brunettes that had come through his life .

`` lady friends ? ''

he put in for lack of a better word .

`` yes .

lots of them . ''

she tried to keep the jealously out of her voice , but even she heard the angry tone come out .

`` and i really do n't want to be one of them . ''

she put her hands on his chest and pushed , but he did n't move , not even an inch .

`` what if you 're not one in a crowd ? ''

he suggested .

`` i 'm not . ''

he looked at her beautiful features and had to agree with her .
