she pulled out the well worn envelope , still sealed with the postmark date and the `` return to sender '' stamped on the outside .

malik looked down at the envelope , then back up at her .

when his fingers moved to unseal the envelope , siri 's stomach twisted with the memory of what she 'd written .

there had been no emotion left which would have enabled her to give him any details other than the pertinent ones like a due date , the schedule and any additional information the doctor had provided to her .

the opening words had been simple , `` i 'm pregnant with our child .

if you 'd like to be a part of this child 's life , please contact me through our lawyers . ''

and then she 'd given the name of her father 's attorney and his contact information .

a simple signature , no greeting or salutation , a few facts about the pregnancy and that was it .

she 'd been too sick , both physically and emotionally to write anything else .

when the letter had been returned , the attorney had advised that she store it in a safe place , for just such a moment like this .

`` i did n't get this , '' he said .

glancing at the date , he shook his head .

`` they never would have sent this to me .

not during this time period .

things in duban were ... .chaotic . ''

she did n't care about his minions and how they 'd harmed her and her life .

in response , she crossed her arms over her chest and watched him , waiting for his next move .

`` that 's what you wanted to talk about tonight , '' he said and shifted uncomfortably on the sofa , his hands still holding the letter and envelope as he absorbed all of the news .

`` yes .

i wanted to talk . ''

he smiled and shook his head .

`` okay , so we 're talking . ''

siri took a seat as well and curled her legs underneath her .

trying to be fair , she considered the situation from his perspective and knew that she might have jumped to the same conclusion .

it was yet another reason they should n't become intimate since their trust in each other was completely destroyed .

`` they 're really wonderful boys , '' she said softly .

the anger was gone now , and all that was left was her joy in her sons .

`` they are painfully smart , well ahead of their class in school . ''

`` what are their names ? ''

he asked .

`` jacob and samuel .

i picked those names because they sounded strong and tough .

i did n't want anyone messing with my kids . ''

he nodded and looked at the wall , seeing their baby pictures framed and hung with pride .

`` what were they like as babies ? ''

he asked .

she told him about their birth and what they were like , described their personalities and their accomplishments .

malik continued to listen , asking questions and only pausing for a moment to make a terse phone call .

it must have been to his driver who was outside her house waiting because he spoke rapidly in arabic , then snapped the phone shut , turning back to her for more questions .

for the next several hours , malik asked questions and she answered them , not holding anything back as she talked about her favorite subject .

she told him funny stories about their antics , pulled out their baby books and showed him photos .

they sat on the sofa together and she caught him up on their sons ' lives .

she did n't know when it happened , but at some point , she fell asleep .

she woke up the next morning with jacob and sam playing `` softly '' beside her bed .

they were trying to be quiet , but each one was building something with legos , and it was a little hard to be quiet when arguing about who got which piece of the legos set .

`` mom 's awake , '' jacob whispered to sam .

`` yes .

i 'm awake , '' she replied , pushing her hair out of her eyes and looking for malik .

`` he 's gone , momma .

he left a note . ''

sam picked up the piece of paper beside him and handed it to her , all without looking away from his legos bridge which he was trying to figure out how to make longer without making it taller as well .

`` it says he 'll be back with breakfast . ''

siri looked at the note and read the words .

simple and to the point .

`` i 'll be back with breakfast .

m. '' she looked down at her son , eyebrows raised and her head spinning with both fatigue and surprise .

`` sam , did you read this note ? ''

`` yes . ''

he pulled his concentration away from the bridge and looked up at his mother with a confused expression .

`` was i not supposed to ? ''

siri shook her head , dumbfounded that her three year old son was reading already .

`` when did you learn your letters ? ''

he looked back down at his bridge , shrugging his shoulders .

`` we figured those out last month , momma , '' jacob replied .

`` ms. tennley kept spelling things and it was irritating .

so we decided to figure out what she was spelling . ''

jacob looked up from his building , his eyes puzzled .
