`` well .

why did you start ? ''

he asks , halfway interested .

that 's still halfway more than usual , at least .

`` when i was eight , my dad let me watch jurassic park with him , '' i reply .

`` you know that scene where the goat gets eaten by the t-rex , and its leg flies up and sticks to the window ? ''

`` yeah , obviously , '' emerson replies .

`` shit was groady . ''

`` yep .

that 's what did it , '' i admit .

`` i have n't eaten meat since watching that movie .

my mom was so pissed at my dad for turning me off chicken nuggets , i do n't think she spoke to him for days .

they kept waiting for me to grow out of it , but i never did .

and so , here we are . ''

`` that 's hilarious , '' emerson says , smiling genuinely for perhaps the first time i 've known him .

it 's not like his usual , sarcastic grin .

it 's something warmer , more honest .

and it just about does me in .

luckily , the waitress comes back for our orders right at that moment , so i do n't end up throwing myself at him right then and there .

we lapse into silence again as we wait for our food to arrive .

he agreed to talk to me about what 's been going on between us , since the night of the party .

but now that the moment has arrived , i ca n't think of how to begin .

`` so .

are you and courtney a thing or what ? ''

i blurt out .

smooth , abby , i grumble internally .

`` courtney ?

nah , '' emerson shrugs , `` a little too high maintenance for me .

and crazy as shit , too .

plus she 's always got show tunes on ... who listens to show tunes for fun ? ''

`` i 'm sure she 's ... nice .

when you get to know her , '' i reply .

the last thing i want to do is go shitting on other girls just because they happen to have sucked face with emerson .

if i did that , just about every pretty girl in our school would be on my shit list .

girl on girl hate is something i try and avoid altogether , if i can help it .

`` i 'm not really that interested in 'nice ' , is the thing , '' emerson scoffs , picking at a bit of loose paint on the table .

`` what ... are you interested in ? ''

i ask , my voice going soft on me .

emerson lifts his eyes to mine , the gold specks reflecting in the dying spring light outside the diner window .

i swallow hard , waiting for him to go on .

`` i 'm interested in someone who can teach me things .

show me things , '' he says .

i 'm totally taken aback by his direct answer .

`` oh ? ''

i say meekly .

`` i could hang out with hot girls who do n't give a damn about me as a person , or look for someone who seems interested in something other than my fantastic body , '' he continues , `` i 'm gon na go with the latter . ''

of course , he ca n't let a serious phrase go by without turning into a joke .

is that a defense mechanism or what ?

`` have you ever met someone like that ? ''

i dare to ask him , `` someone you could be interested in for more than a weekend ? ''

he lets me writhe under his gaze , taking his sweet time to formulate an answer to my question .

i can feel my cheeks growing hotter by the second before he finally says one word : `` maybe . ''

the rest of the restaurant seems to fall away around us as emerson trains his eyes on me .

i have to choose my response very , very carefully here .

this one little moment could be a turning point .

a transformation .

with my heart in my throat , i let my hand rest on the table , only a couple of inches away from his .

those mere inches of space spark with electricity , searing my already frayed nerves .

i wish i could tell him that i want the same thing from a relationship-to be with someone who challenges me , like he does .

someone who 's not interested in being nice or normal , like he is .

someone who could show me a life i 'd never be able to dream up on my own .

like he very well could .

`` emerson , '' i say softly , letting my hand drift slowly toward his , `` i- '' the front door of the diner flies open , slamming against the wall with a loud clatter .

emerson turns to look over his shoulder at the sound , and just like that , the spell is broken .

shit .

i glance up , annoyed , to see who 's disrupted our near-perfect moment .

but when i recognize the group that 's just sauntered inside , i feel myself going numb .

`` goddamn it , '' i whisper , `` not now . ''

i quickly hiding my hands under the table , not wanting emerson to see how they 've begun to shake .

i pretend to be very interested in something out the window as i hear the boisterous voices of three guys from my school fill the enclosed space , one of whom i 'm very intimately , and very unfortunately , acquainted with .
