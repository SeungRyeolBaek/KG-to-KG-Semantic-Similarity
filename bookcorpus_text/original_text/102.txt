without emma , he and megan never would have met .

sara , which meant 'soul ' , was given her mother 's real name , margaret , as her middle name .

at the sound of megan 's gentle snores , he smiled .

`` did you wear your mommy out today ? ''

he asked maya .

she opened her tiny mouth like she wished she could respond to him .

`` let 's wake her up . ''

after he swept a strand of megan 's long blonde hair out of her face , pesh leaned down to kiss her cheek .

she stirred as her eyes fluttered opened .

`` hey , '' she said with a lazy smile .

`` hello , my love , '' he replied .

`` how was your first day back ? ''

she asked , as she stretched her arms over her head .

he grimaced .

`` absolutely miserable without you and the girls . ''

megan smiled .

`` we missed you , too . ''

she jerked her chin up at maya .

`` she cried for thirty minutes straight after you left .

i think we have a serious daddy 's girl on our hands . ''

`` really ? ''

he asked , gazing down at maya .

he could n't help the warm glow that spread through his chest at megan 's words .

at just six weeks old , his girls were already showing distinct and different personalities .

maya was inquisitive and fought sleep to be awake to see what all was going on .

he 'd ended up holding her more than sara simply because maya often exhausted megan by not going to sleep .

sara , on the other hand , was already very sweet tempered and a natural snuggler .

she probably represented his more laid-back , quiet personality where maya was likely to be a little firecracker , just like her mom .

maya stared up at him , her dark eyes peering intently at him .

`` did you miss me , my little princess ? ''

a fleeting smile appeared on her face .

`` oh my god , she smiled at you ! ''

megan cried .

`` but babies do n't respond with smiling until later .

it must be gas or something , '' he argued .

megan nudged his leg with her knee .

`` she most definitely smiled at you , pesh . ''

she rose off the couch to rub maya 's cheek .

`` you smiled at your daddy , did n't you ? ''

without taking her eyes off of pesh , maya flashed another smile and waved her fist .

the sight caused tears to sting his eyes .

he blinked fast , trying to clear them .

he did n't like feeling emotionally weak in front of megan .

but he knew he was busted the moment megan murmured , `` oh baby . ''

she slid her arm around his waist , leaning up on her tiptoes to burrow her face in his neck .

`` do you know how much my love for you grows because you just got teary over your daughter ? ''

he glanced down at her in surprise .

`` really ? ''

`` mmm , hmm . ''

she gave him a brief kiss .

`` after davis , all i ever wanted was for my children to have a father who loved and adored them . ''

she smiled .

`` you make that dream come true every day . ''

he brought his lips to hers .

his mouth worked frantically to illustrate all that he was feeling inside-the intense love that he felt would burst from him .

`` i love you , '' he murmured against her lips .

`` i love you , too . ''

just as he started to kiss her again , a loud commotion in the kitchen drew them apart .

megan rubbed his cheek tenderly before bestowing a kiss on maya 's head .

she then jerked her chin towards the kitchen , and he followed her .

patrick had just burst through the backdoor with all the kids in tow .

`` we 're back ! ''

mason called , as he bobbed around the kitchen .

three-year-old noah and his two-year-old sister , caroline , made a beeline for their mother .

they began chattering non-stop to emma while their bodies shook with unspent energy .

pesh watched with amusement as emma 's hand came to her hip and she pointed her stirring spoon at patrick .

`` you gave them ice cream , did n't you ? ''

patrick shrugged .

`` i 'm a grandfather .

spoiling them is what i 'm supposed to do . ''

emma rolled her eyes .

`` yeah , and then you bring them home to detox on my watch . ''

`` mommy , i hungwy ! ''

caroline protested , stomping her foot .

with her auburn hair swept back in pigtails and her emerald eyes narrowing in determination , she looked just like her mother .

well , her expression was pure aidan .

`` caroline fitzgerald , you get one ice cream cone in you , and you start acting like you have no manners .

we do not stomp our feet to get what we want . ''

she appeared thoughtful for a moment before saying , `` pwease mommy , i vewy hungwy . ''

emma grinned .

`` go wash up and then have a seat at the table in the dining room . ''

`` come on guys , '' mason said .

at almost four-and-a-half , he was always the caretaker of his younger cousins .

noah and caroline followed him into the half bathroom off the kitchen .
