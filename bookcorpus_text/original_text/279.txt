it 's times like this when i most keenly feel the loss of my mother .

i wish more than anything that she was here for me to talk to .

she 'd be able to help me through this mess .

but of course , that 's just a dream .

i 'm all alone in this , as ever .

`` well , self , '' i mutter , raising the wine glass to the empty apartment , `` it 's just you and me again .

let 's figure out what we 're going to do . ''

i nearly lose my balance on the bar stool as a loud knocking rings out from the front entry way .

that 's weird .

emerson just left five minutes ago , and besides , he has a key .

we did n't order any food , and there 's no way riley 's swinging by to say hello after what i 've done to her .

so then who could possibly be knocking at this hour ?

cradling my wine glass , i stand and cross to the front door .

probably it 's just emerson 's dry cleaning , or something .

billionaires have things like dry cleaning delivery , right ?

i step into the entryway and unlock the front door , swinging it open with my free hand .

there 's a man standing on emerson 's front steps .

he wears a dated but clean sport coat , a fair amount of stubble , and scuffed shoes that must once have been very expensive .

his hands are clasped nervously in front of him , and his hunched shoulders give him a look of preemptive defeat .

there are red splotches across his nose and cheeks , signature features of an alcoholic .

the man is staring at shoes , and for a moment i ca n't place him .

but then , he lifts his face to me , and i feel the wind rush out of my lungs .

`` dad ? ''

i breathe , paralyzed in the doorway .

`` hello abigail , '' he replies with heartbreaking formality .

`` i hope this is n't a bad time .

well .

i know it is , but ... can i come in ? ''

`` oh .

of course , '' i tell him , stepping aside to let him in .

my dad shuffles past me into emerson 's loft , looking as frail as i 've ever seen him .

i stare after him , utterly baffled by his sudden appearance here .

i have n't seen him since my masters program graduation ceremony , and even then he barely said hello before disappearing into thin air again .

he 's not exactly an active presence in my life , so what the hell is he doing here , on one of the most intense nights of my life ?

`` dad , '' i begin , watching as he stands awkwardly in the middle of emerson 's loft , `` why are you here ? ''

`` your grandparents .

they told me what was going on , '' he mutters , `` i figured you might be in a tough spot , so i thought i 'd come and try to ... i do n't know .

help ? ''

`` but how did you even find this place ? ''

i ask .

`` your friend .

roommate .

she mentioned you were with emerson .

this address was n't too hard to find , '' he shrugs .

i take a nervous sip of wine and immediately feel horrible for doing so as my dad shifts uncomfortably .

`` i 'm sorry , i should n't , '' i murmur , setting down my wine glass .

`` no , it 's ok , '' dad assures me , `` i 've been sober for a solid six months . ''

i bite my lip .

six months is always about how long he lasts between relapses .

i do n't want to set him off .

what i do want is to understand what possessed my father to track me down tonight .

we have n't had a real conversation in years .

really , not since his falling out with deb .

his endless cycle of relapses and recoveries has broken him own .

he looks feeble , now .

broken .

i hate to see him like this .

`` so ? ''

i prompt him , `` are you here to save me from the evil emerson sawyer ?

are you going to tell me that grandma and grandpa are right , and that i should steer clear of him if i know what 's good for me ? ''

`` no , '' my dad replies , shoving his hands into his pockets .

`` no ? ''

i reply , taken aback .

`` but- '' `` i 'm not here to save you from emerson , '' my dad goes on , `` i 'm here to save you-try and save you-from yourself . ''

`` you 're gon na have to drop a few more bread crumbs if you expect me to follow this , '' i tell him , crossing my arms .

`` i know this is going to sound insane , coming from me , '' my dad says , struggling with his heart-to-heart dynamic .

`` but when your grandpa told me what the situation was , it 's like i knew what you 'd be thinking .

you 'd be thinking , 'i should just give up on emerson , ' and 'it 's too hard , ' and 'it 's not right to let someone help me , i need to go it alone ' . ''

i stare at him across the room , flummoxed by how spot-on he is .
