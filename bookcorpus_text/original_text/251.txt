i reel backward , having collided with the human equivalent of a solid brick wall .

jeez , i thought this was a tech company , not a holding room for the iron man competition .

i think i actually bruised something on this guy 's sharply cut muscles .

`` sorry about that , '' a voice says from about a foot over my head , `` i hope i did n't hurt you , or ... '' the voice is oddly familiar , though i ca n't place where i may have heard it before .

a commercial , maybe ?

or the radio ?

it trails off into distracted silence , and i look up for some more clues as to whose it might be .

the face looking down at me is utterly gorgeous-sculpted , symmetrical , and engaged .

a short crop of dark hair and a hint of stubble on the mans 's razor-like jawline perfects his look .

there 's a pair of dark rimmed glasses perched on his straight nose , and for a moment the overhead light glares against the lenses , obscuring his eyes from me .

but then he shifts , ever so slightly , and i can see his blue eyes clear as day .

i recognize them at once , from the very core of me .

how could i not ?

i 've only thought about them every day , at least once a day , for the past eight years .

emerson sawyer is standing right in front of me .

and from the look in those all too familiar eyes , i know full well that he recognizes me , too .

`` ah !

here he is ! ''

i hear cooper say , as if from very far away .

`` emerson , i thought you were n't due in for another couple of hours ? ''

`` i was able to catch an earlier flight , '' emerson replies , his eyes still locked on me .

now that i 've placed that voice , every syllable he utters twists my heartstrings .

his voice is lower , now .

richer .

he 's even taller than he was when we last met , at least by a couple of inches .

his body was muscular even when we were kids , but now every ounce of boyish baby fat has melted from his frame , leaving nothing but a perfectly cut form in its wake .

he 's wearing perfectly-fitted dark wash jeans , a white cotton button down , and those designer black-rimmed glasses .

no wonder i did n't recognize him at first-emerson 's transformed from a grungy , angry teenage boy to a successful , intellectual tech genius ... a tech genius who works for the same company i just landed a job at , who 's supposed to show me the ropes of my new position , and who clearly was n't briefed on the fact that i , abby rowan , was going to be his new protege .

`` i , uh , really have to run , '' i say , my voice faint .

`` i have a ... i 've got to ... '' `` no worries .

we 'll see you soon ! ''

cooper says .

`` emerson here will teach you everything you need to know next week . ''

`` right , '' i say , my eyes locking onto emerson 's once more .

`` ok. well .

bye . ''

i skirt around emerson 's tall , built form , all but dive into the elevator , and jab the `` close door '' button with as much ferocity as i can muster .

the second those doors snap shut again , i fall back against the elevator wall , my chest heaving , trying not to burst into tears .

i feel like i 'm going to faint .

or be sick .

how could i have possibly not known that emerson works for bastian these days ?

what are the chances that we 'd end up face-to-face like this , after all these years ?

and what the hell am i supposed to do now ?

i burst back out of the front doors , gulping down deep breaths as best i can .

all around me , new yorkers brush past , completely unaware that i 'm having the strangest , most disorienting day of my life .

but , that 's new york city for you-the best and worst place ever to have a panic attack .

struggling to regain a modicum of composure , i straighten myself up and make to book it away from the bastian offices .

i get about three steps , too , before i feel a strong hand catch mine .

`` abby , '' i hear emerson say , `` abby , wait- '' `` what did you do , scurry down the drain pipe ? ''

i breathe , spinning around to face him .

`` i prefer the stairs to the drainpipe , but thanks for the tip , '' he replies , looking at me with dazed wonder .

`` i ca n't believe you 're here . ''

`` i know .

i 'm sorry , '' i say quickly , stepping out of the busy sidewalk traffic .

`` i had no idea you work here , emerson .

if i 'd known , i never would have applied . ''

`` what ? ''

he says , taking a step toward me .

`` why not ? ''

`` i did n't mean to show up here , unannounced , and ... you know .

crash your party , '' i babble , unable to keep my eyes on his face for long .

in the last eight years , his gorgeousness has solidified into sheer perfection .
