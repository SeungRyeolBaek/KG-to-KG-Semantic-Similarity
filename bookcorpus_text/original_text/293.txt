`` why ? ''

`` because they seem like the most misunderstood part of the population .

they ca n't always express themselves so they act out in sometimes violent ways .

most people do n't even try to interpret their actions . ''

`` and what if the child is just innately bad ? ''

she shook her head in disagreement .

`` there is no such thing , '' she said adamantly .

`` any child that is lashing out is just in pain and we 've caused it . ''

`` we ? ''

he challenged .

`` are you including everyone or just the child 's parents ? ''

her grin was impish as she looked across the table at him .

`` oh , i 'm not that nice .

i think we as a society are all responsible . ''

`` what about the parents that are bad behind closed doors and we do n't know about it ? ''

`` usually people know .

children give off signals and if we choose to ignore them , well then we reap what we sow ? ''

`` and what about the men in your life ? ''

he asked changing the subject .

victoria understood that he disagreed with her on her child psychology but that was okay .

not everyone needed to agree with everyone else .

diversity was what made the world work in wonderful ways , she told herself .

`` i do n't currently have a boyfriend but my suitemate , jasmine , is constantly setting me up with men she thinks would suit me wonderfully . ''

`` and what kind of man does she think is suitable for someone like you ? ''

victoria 's head tilted slightly to the side .

`` what kind of a woman do you think i am ? ''

dharr leaned closer and took her hand , drawing circles on the palm while his eyes held hers hostage .

`` i think you 're younger than your twenty years in some ways , older in others .

and i think you 're idealistic which is sad because you 're going to be disappointed when you enter the real world after college .

but you 're strong and will survive .

and i think you 're going to be in my bed soon . ''

victoria could barely breathe .

his thumb was tracing patterns on her palm and moved slowly up to her wrist , sending shivers through her entire system .

she tried to pull her hand from his but he would n't release it .

and he continued to stare at her eyes , seeing the fear that entered them with his words .

`` you do n't have to be afraid of me , victoria .

i promise you that anything you do with me , you wo n't regret . ''

`` how can you promise something like that ? ''

`` because i 'll make it so , '' he said , arrogance reeking from his body .

`` relax , '' he said .

`` i ca n't with you doing that to my hand . ''

`` then you feel it too ? '

he asked .

`` feel what ? ''

dharr allowed a half smile , wondering if she was serious or just pretending .

because he was so cynical , he half considered calling her on the issue .

but the other half of him wanted to play along , let her either play the game or let him determine that she was the real thing .

he pulled his hand away and sat back .

`` never mind , '' he replied , noting the confusion in her eyes .

she was either the real thing or she was the best actress he 'd ever met .

`` tell me about your classes . ''

they talked throughout the dinner and eventually victoria was able to relax .

dharr made her laugh more than she had in years and she 'd never talked so much in her life .

but each time she questioned him , he simply reverted back to asking her questions .

by the end of the night when he was walking her to her door , she knew no more about him than she did when she left the hospital the day before .

`` i 'm going to kiss you , '' dharr said , turning her to face him in the dimly lit hallway .

it was around midnight so the students who were partying were still out for another few hours and the ones who had settled in earlier were already asleep .

they were relatively alone in the hallway and the realization sped up victoria 's heart rate .

`` that would be nice , '' she whispered but she was shaking all over .

she did n't even know what to do with her hands .

she 'd been kissed in the past , but it had been selfish kisses where the men simply put their mouths on hers without any permission or signal from her .

each time , she 'd waited for some feeling to stir within her but had been left cold and had pulled away before anything serious started .

now , standing here with dharr looking down at her , she felt young and foolish , unsure of what to do to encourage him or how to even start the kiss she wanted so badly .

thankfully , he took matters into his own hands .

he took her hands in his and pulled her closer , settling his own large , strong hands on her waist , leaving hers to flutter around his chest before finally settling down on his lapels .

she looked up under her lashes , wondering why he was taking so long but the desire she saw in his eyes almost scared her .
