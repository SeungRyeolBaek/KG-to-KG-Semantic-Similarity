they 're dressed to the nines-grandpa frank in an italian wool suit , grandma jillian in her favorite fur stole .

they 've always looked to me like first class passengers on some old-timey luxury cruise line .

the only things unappealing about their appearances today are the twin scowls they try to cover up as i approach .

`` abigail , '' grandma jillian smiles , air-kissing both of my cheeks .

a soft wash of her signature chanel perfume brings back a million memories of tense family gatherings and etiquette lessons .

i love my grandparents , but there 's definitely a lot of pressure that goes along with trying to meet their expectations .

`` you look gorgeous , dear , '' grandpa frank says , giving me a swift kiss on the hand .

they 're a beautiful couple , and look much younger than they actually are .

grandma 's perfect crown of platinum blonde curls , grandpa 's swoosh of silver hair , and their bright white smiles make them look like an advertisement for the swankiest retirement community around .

`` grandpa , grandma , this is emerson-deb 's son , '' i say , glancing emerson 's way .

he 's got both hands shoved into his pockets , and his mouth is a hard , solemn line .

`` ah , '' grandpa says , without warmth .

`` well .

hello , emerson . ''

`` hey , '' emerson nods .

`` i 'm jillian .

it 's nice to meet you , '' grandma says , offering her hand for emerson to kiss .

i watch , trying not to laugh , as he takes her hand and gives it a good solid shake instead .

`` and here 's the man of the hour himself , '' grandpa says , looking up as dad walks into the kitchen with the justice of the peace-a balding man with a cheerful red face .

`` are we starting soon ? ''

grandma asks , `` the girls are playing bridge at three and i 'd really prefer not to be late . ''

`` we 'll start as soon as deb is ready , '' dad replies curtly .

`` i 'm sure she 's just putting the finishing touches on- '' `` i 'm all set ! ''

deb sings out from the stairs .

we all turn to watch her grand entrance as she clatters down the last few steps and struts her stuff our way .

i can practically hear my grandparents ' jaws crack against the tile floor as deb meets us in the kitchen .

her rhinestone-encrusted heels must be five inches high , and fully visible beneath the micro minidress that 's serving as her wedding gown .

a huge , flowing bustle trails along behind her , and her already voluminous blonde curls are stacked a mile high in a hairdo that would make the most seasoned pageant girl raise an eyebrow .

her makeup looks painted on , most especially her hot pink lipstick .

she looks positively ecstatic ... but not exactly the picture of the blushing bride we all had in mind-especially my grandparents .

`` i ca n't believe our wedding day is finally here ! ''

she squeals , leaping into my dad 's arms .

she kisses every inch of his face , leaving little smudges of pink all over .

i 'm a little concerned that my grandparents have literally turned to stone beside me .

dad manages to pry deb off of him long enough to turn her frank and jillian 's way .

`` deb , '' my dad says through a forced smile , `` these are my parents . ''

`` oh .

my .

god , '' deb breathes , splaying her hands out over her heart .

`` you are just about the fanciest people i 've ever seen in my entire life . ''

`` yes .

well , '' grandma says , unable to form any additional words .

`` that is ... some dress you 've got there , '' grandpa attempts .

`` dad , '' my own father hisses warningly .

`` oh , you like it ? ''

deb chirps , giving us all a little spin .

`` i got in at forty percent off .

still a rip off , if you ask me , but heck-it 's a special occasion , right ?

and it 's not like bob here is hurting for money . ''

my grandparents ' eyebrows shoot up , disappearing into their hair lines .

deb falters , looking back and forth between them .

`` i 'm sorry .

was that tacky ? ''

`` ah , so you are familiar with the word , then , '' grandma says coolly .

i glance at emerson , embarrassed by my grandparents ' icy behavior .

but his face is totally unreadable-i have no idea if he 's even listening .

deb , not knowing what to do with my grandparents ' disdain , turns to emerson and me with a tight grin .

`` now you two look so darling , '' she sighs tearfully .

`` our big happy family , at last . ''

i catch grandpa rolling his eyes as the justice of the peace claps his hands .

`` so ! ''

the jolly official says , `` shall we head to the backyard for the ceremony ? ''

deb grabs hold of my dad 's hand and yanks him out the back door .

they 've set up a flimsy white altar in front of the pool , which is filled with floating flower blossoms .

emerson walks out ahead of me , keeping his eyes straight ahead , and my grandparents bring up the rear .

deb 's heels sink into the grass as she teeters toward the altar on my dad 's arm .
