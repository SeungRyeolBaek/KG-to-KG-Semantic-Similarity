`` oomph ! ''

strong arms reached out to stop her backwards fall while at the same time , she dropped her bag and reached out to grab hold of the brick wall .

when she was steady again and able to focus , she looked up .

then up higher again .

right into the eyes of dharr .

`` oh my ! ''

she gasped , her eyes widening and her cheeks blushing instantly .

`` oh my , indeed .

we really have to stop meeting like this , '' he said but his hands remained on her hips , holding her close .

victoria quickly released her hold and stepped back , her blush deepening when she realized she was holding onto him , and liking it .

the muscles she 'd felt under her hands were impressive and her fingers itched to feel them again , to be close and smell his aftershave which was spicy and masculine and just plain sexy .

`` i 'm sorry , '' she said quickly , trying to hide her embarrassment .

`` i 'm not , '' dharr said , his eyes full of humor and appreciation for her beauty and refreshing innocence .

`` i just wish i could find a way to get closer without the possibility of marring such perfection , '' he said , one hand reaching out to touch the now purple area along her jaw .

victoria smiled but could n't hold his gaze .

`` oh , do n't worry about this , '' she said , waving the bruise aside .

`` i bruise easily , '' she said .

`` does it hurt ? ''

he asked , ignoring her attempt to ease his conscience .

she dared to glance at him , wondering if the tenderness she heard in his voice was reflected in his face .

it was n't but there was a softness in his eyes that had n't been there before .

`` not really , '' she lied .

it actually ached quite a bit .

dharr smiled slightly and touched her cheek again .

`` i wonder if you 're lying to protect me or the man who did this to you with his carelessness ? ''

victoria laughed nervously .

besides her mother , no one had been able to see through her quite so easily .

`` a little of both perhaps . ''

`` you have a tender heart , '' he replied .

then he looked around .

`` but what is that noise ?

is someone beating themselves ? ''

victoria listened for a moment and realized what he was hearing .

odd , but she 'd blocked out the rest of the world completely while he was touching her .

`` that ... ah ... is my roommate , '' she explained .

`` she 's listening to music . ''

dharr 's mouth thinned .

`` that 's not music , '' he declared .

`` it is simply noise .

and you are running from it yourself , are you not ? ''

`` yes , '' she admitted .

dharr studied her for a moment .

`` and you are too nice to ask her to turn it off ? ''

victoria shrugged .

she suspected that he would never hesitate to ask someone to turn down their music but it just was n't in her to ask someone to change when it was just as easy for her to leave the area .

`` it 's her suite as well , '' victoria justified .

`` and where will you go to escape the abhorrent noise ? ''

he asked .

`` i was going over to the library to study , '' she said .

she suddenly looked up at him and asked , `` how did you find out where i lived ? ''

she knew she had n't given him her address , nor even where she was going to school .

it was odd that he had been able to track her down .

he looked at her for a long moment , considering his words .

`` i have many sources , '' was all he would say in response .

she watched his eyes , wishing she had the courage to ask more , but he was too intimidating .

and overwhelming .

`` well , i need to go , '' she finally said .

but she did n't move , still staring up into his magnificent , dark eyes .

`` have dinner with me tonight ? ''

he asked .

victoria instantly smiled , delighted at the possibility of spending more time with him .

`` really ? ''

dharr 's face actually smiled again .

`` really .

i would enjoy your company , '' he explained .

her smile faded a moment later .

`` is this just another way to try and pay me off ? ''

she asked .

`` because it is n't necessary .

i promise , i wo n't sue you or your employee . ''

dharr actually laughed out loud .

`` the thought never even entered my mind , '' he said .

it was delightful to talk to someone who did n't have any idea of who he was .

the idea of someone suing the king of ashir was too ludicrous to contemplate .

but he was going to relish being just a man for as long as it lasted .

it was refreshing to see a woman 's reaction to him and him alone .

not his title nor his power or wealth .

it was also refreshing to see such innocence .

the women of his acquaintance were either bred specifically to entice him and therefore were taught in the ways of pleasing a man and his tastes therefore became theirs .
