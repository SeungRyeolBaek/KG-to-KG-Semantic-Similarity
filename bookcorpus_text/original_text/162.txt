before this summer , i felt sure of things in my life .

sure of my ideas and opinions .

sure that i was right .

but i feel less and less sure of myself the longer i stay in this house .

just as i finish brushing my teeth , i hear a thud from the hallway , then a groan .

that sounded like nate .

with a frown , i open my bedroom door .

sure enough , there 's nate , lying on the carpet just outside his own room .

i hesitate , realizing i 'm wearing my little nightgown , but figure he 's seen me in it already .

`` nate ?

are you ok ?

what happened ? ''

i murmur , hurrying to kneel next to him .

the whiff of alcohol coming off of him gives it away before he says anything .

`` i 'm so drunk , brynn , '' he says , beginning to laugh .

`` shhh , you 'll wake up our parents , '' i admonish him .

`` why are you on the floor ? ''

`` tripped .

on my own foot , '' he replies with a sigh .

`` well , come on , get up , '' i order him , sliding a hand under his torso to pull him upward .

he slowly obeys and stands on his feet , where he sways dangerously .

`` ok , now in here , '' i continue , pushing his bedroom door open with my foot as i slide an arm around his back to stabilize him .

i feel his muscles clench under his t-shirt as we walk .

not the time , brynn .

`` shoes off , '' i order him as we reach the bed .

`` mmm , '' he grunts , as he kicks them off .

`` i 'm getting you some water .

do n't move . ''

i hurry back to my bedroom and grab my water glass from the bedside table , then refill it from the tap in my bathroom before heading back to his room .

i shut the door behind me to keep the noise from filtering around the house , then stop in surprise as i see that nate has stripped down to his boxers and is standing at the foot of his bed .

`` thanks , '' he slurs , as i hesitantly walk forward and hand him the water .

i watch him gulp the whole glass down , the grey moonlight from the window illuminating his ripped torso .

he puts the glass down on his desk and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand as he sways slightly .

`` you alright ? ''

i ask worriedly .

`` i 've never seen you drunk before . ''

`` do n't really drink .

no time .

work , practice , work , game . ''

`` and i thought i was the nerd , '' i tease him .

`` you 're funny , '' he says , cocking his head slightly , then takes a step toward me .

`` nate ... '' i say as my core clenches .

`` yes , brynn ? ''

he asks innocently .

`` you said this was wrong .

those were your words , '' i remind him .

`` do you think it 's wrong ? ''

he takes another step toward me , and looks down at me .

`` i- '' his hand reaches around my waist .

`` does it feel wrong ? ''

`` yes ... no , '' i breathe .

i barely have time to inhale before his mouth is on mine .

his mouth tastes like whiskey , but i do n't care .

i wrap my hands around his neck and he grabs my ass with both hands , our kiss picking up right where our last one broke off .

i dig my fingers into his hair as our mouths open to one another .

he pulls me roughly against him and groans deep in his throat as our bodies collide .

suddenly he stumbles back , steadying himself on my shoulders .

`` sorry , '' he whispers , shaking his head as though to clear it .

`` will you just stay with me for a while ? ''

`` yes , of course , '' i reply immediately , even though i 'm taken aback by his request .

i watch him turn to his bed and crawl over to his pillow , then curl up on his side and look at me expectantly .

i pause , then follow him , crawling across the bedspread and curling around his back .

i bury my head between his shoulder blades then drape my arm over his waist , and feel him take my hand in his and pull me closer against him .

i lie as still as i can , barely breathing .

i ca n't believe he 's letting me touch him like this .

well , he is wasted , but still .

i never thought he 'd be so vulnerable around me .

i hear his breathing deepen .

`` i 've always looked up to him , '' he murmurs , startling me .

`` i know , '' i whisper back , knowing that he 's talking about his dad .

`` i do n't know what i would do if he- '' `` i know , '' i murmur , softly kissing the back of his neck .

he stills on his pillow , and his breathing slows down again .

i stay with him for a while , until i know he 's asleep .

i need to understand nate 's feelings about his mother before i tell him what she told me .
