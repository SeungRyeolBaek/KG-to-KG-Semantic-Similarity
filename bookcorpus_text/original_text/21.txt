she grabbed his arm .

`` stop it , ankle !

it 's not him , it 's me .

it 's all my fault .

okay ? ''

he stared at her in surprise .

`` what happened ? ''

`` give me some coffee and a chance to calm down , and then i 'll tell you everything . ''

although his expression was skeptical , aidan nodded , and then started to close the door .

megan stole one last glance of pesh as his car started reversing down the driveway .

she hoped for her sake and his it was the last time she would have to see him .

chapter seven megan nervously tapped her thumbs on the steering wheel of her car .

her clinical placement had come through , and she was now on her way to make her introductions to her preceptor , the nurse who would supervise her .

although she had initially been disappointed in not receiving grady , she was still excited to be doing the last part of the journey to becoming a nurse .

she was also grateful she had n't received the night shift that some of her fellow nursing students had .

she would have rarely been able to see mason if she had to sleep during the day and work at night .

she pulled into the parking lot of the wellstar er and eased into the first space she found .

after turning off the car , she grabbed her folder of paperwork along with her purse and headed inside .

she stopped at the front desk .

`` i 'm not a patient .

i 'm a clinical student here to see kristi parkman . ''

`` go on through , '' the receptionist said , before she buzzed open the authorized personnel only door .

breezing inside the heart of the er , megan could n't help feeling excited .

she could n't wait until she got her feet wet by working with patients .

glancing around , she was n't exactly sure how she was going to find the preceptor .

she stopped at an area teaming with nurses .

`` can i help you ? ''

one of them asked .

`` yes , i 'm here to see kristi parkman . ''

a tall blonde woman in her fifties came over to her with a beaming smile .

`` you must be ms .

mckenzie ? ''

`` i am . ''

`` it 's so nice to meet you . ''

megan smiled .

`` it 's nice meeting you , too . ''

`` we 're so very glad to have you .

i 've taken a look at your transcript , and it 's quite impressive . ''

`` thank you , '' megan replied .

`` why do n't i show you around today ?

that way you 'll be ready to go with the flow tomorrow . ''

`` sounds good . ''

with a smile , kristi led her around the maze of rooms .

she pointed out where the medicine room was , the trauma area , and where she would find the break room .

each time they passed a nurse or a doctor , kristi was quick to introduce megan .

`` everyone seems very friendly , '' megan mused .

`` it really is a great place to work .

now , i 'm not going to lie that some of the residents can be real ass**les .

but we 're so lucky to have a supervisor who is such a sweetheart . ''

`` that 's wonderful . ''

`` yes , everyone loves dr .

nadeen . ''

megan 's heartbeat slowed to a standstill .

nadeen .

no , it could n't be .

surely there were more doctors with that last name .

searching her mind , she tried desperately to remember where he said he worked .

`` oh good , he 's just down the hall .

let me introduce you two . ''

`` no , that 's really is n't necessary , '' megan protested feebly .

ignoring her , kristi called , `` dr. nadeen , come meet our newest nursing candidate . ''

the moment he turned around , megan felt like she was going to throw up .

after spending two months trying hard to forget about her infamous night with pesh nadeen , there he was right in front of her .

she could n't help having the classic line from casablanca flash in her head , `` out of all the gin joints in all the world , she had to walk into mine . ''

she certainly felt that way about all the hospitals she could have possibly been assigned to , she had to be assigned to his .

the shock and surprise registered on his face as well .

he was quick to mask it by smiling warmly at her .

`` hello again , megan . ''

kristi 's brows shot up at the familiarity of pesh 's greeting .

`` you know each other ? ''

`` um , well , '' megan began .

how was she going to explain ?

the last thing she needed was to get off on the wrong foot with her coworkers .

pesh nodded .

`` she and i share a godson . ''

`` oh how wonderful . ''

kristi patted megan 's back .

`` what luck for you then ending up here out of all the hospitals ? ''

`` yes , what luck , '' megan murmured .

kristi smiled .

`` well , i 'll let you two catch up for a minute or two . ''

`` no , that 's okay .

you do n't have to do that , '' megan protested .

waving her hand dismissively , kristi said , `` it gives me a chance to go grab a snack and something to drink .
