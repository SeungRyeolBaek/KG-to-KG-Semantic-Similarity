`` you must really trust this guy , huh ? ''

`` i know it 's crazy , but i really do , '' i tell her .

`` it might blow up in my face and ruin me for life , but hey , nothing 's been able to ruin me yet .

so , i like my chances . ''

`` see ?

you 're plenty optimistic , '' riley says , raising an eyebrow .

`` well .

optimistic-ish . ''

later that evening , i 'm curled up on the couch going through some mind-numbing calculus homework .

i have my headphones in , trying to drown out deb and dad 's pre-wedding chatter with some kings of leon .

they 're huddled over the kitchen table , going over the last-minute plans for their spur-of-the-moment wedding ceremony and honeymoon .

i ca n't even think about how excruciating it will be for emerson and i to be alone here for the whole week of their honeymoon , unable to touch each other ever again .

maybe riley will let me crash at her place .

or i guess i could just invest in a chastity belt .

`` hey honey ! ''

deb chirps happily as emerson strolls in through the front door .

i look up as he enters and tug out an earbud , in case we 're all about to have a family meeting .

`` hi mom , '' he replies shortly .

to my surprise , he makes a beeline to where i 'm sitting on the couch and plops down next to me .

i feel unaccountably nervous to be near him in our parents ' presence .

what if they can sense what 's gone on between us ?

but of course , they 're oblivious to the end .

for once , their narcissism is working in our favor .

`` our best man and maid of honor , here together , '' deb goes on , clasping her manicured hands in elation .

`` when did that get decided ? ''

i ask under my breath .

`` do n't look at me , '' emerson replies , `` it 's the first i 'm hearing of it . ''

`` we 'll need you kids up bright and early on sunday morning , '' my dad calls over to us .

`` we 've got the justice of the peace booked from noon until half past .

got ta make it snappy . ''

`` how romantic , '' i observe .

`` and guess what else , '' dad goes on , his cheerfulness dwindling just a hair , `` grandma jillian and grandpa frank are going to be here to celebrate . ''

`` really ? ''

i ask , raising my eyebrows .

my grandparents , frank and jillian rowan , adore me , but their relationship with my dad is rather spotty .

grandpa frank is pretty critical of my dad 's history of `` freeloading '' off their old money .

`` they insisted , '' my dad smiles tightly .

it 's actually something of a comfort that dad does n't get along with his parents , either .

just goes to show that it runs in the family .

grandma and grandpa have been supporting our little family since i was born .

they really adored my mom , sandy , and pretty clearly thought she was doing my dad a favor by sticking around .

most of the money for my schooling , clothing , and extracurriculars still comes from them .

they 've even offered to pay my way through college .

well , whatever i ca n't cover with scholarships , that is .

`` well .

i 'll be sure to get to the church on time , '' emerson says with sarcastic enthusiasm .

`` but i wo n't be around much beforehand . ''

`` what ? ''

i ask , whipping around to face him .

what the hell is he talking about ?

he has to be around .

`` what do you mean , emerson ? ''

deb presses her son .

`` a friend of mine is throwing me an eighteenth birthday party at his parents ' beach house this weekend .

a whole bunch of people are going to be there , '' emerson says casually .

`` is that so ? ''

i whisper , my stomach flipping over .

he 's ditching me , and our rather important plans , to hang out at the beach ?

`` oh ... well , that 's nice ! ''

deb smiles .

`` you 've always been such a popular boy , emerson .

it 's good that you 'll be with your friends on your birthday . ''

`` uh-huh , '' emerson says , examining his fingernails .

`` guess it 'll just be the three of us celebrating your birthday then , abby , '' my dad says .

`` so it would seem , '' i reply , glaring at emerson .

i can feel a hard knot forming in my throat .

was he just messing with me last night , when he told me that he wanted me ?

has he been telling all his friends about how his pervy almost-stepsister secretly wants to jump his bones ?

i ca n't believe i let my guard down .

i should know better than to trust anyone at all .

`` actually , you know what ? ''

emerson says , finally shifting his gaze my way , `` my friends probably would n't mind too much if you tagged along , abby .

i 've got a spare seat in the car . ''

`` you ... i ... what ? ''

i stammer , uncomprehendingly .

`` oh , you should go , abby ! ''
