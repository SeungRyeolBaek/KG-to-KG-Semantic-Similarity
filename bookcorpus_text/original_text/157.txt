i never wanted for anything big , though we certainly frequented the goodwill racks often enough .

but i do n't want you to think ... i mean , my mom , she really cares for pierce . ''

`` relax-i do n't think your mom 's a gold digger .

there have always been some of those around , and i can practically smell them at this point .

i mean , maybe at first i was worried , but i 'm not now . ''

`` was your mom- '' i begin , feeling brave .

`` i do n't like to talk about her , '' he cuts me off , and chucks another rock out onto the water .

it hits the surface with a plopping sound and sinks .

`` sorry , '' i whisper .

`` how 's your shoulder ? ''

`` hurts , '' he replies shortly .

`` i 'll see you up there , '' i say after a moment , since he 's clearly done with the conversation .

`` hey , '' he calls after me as i climb the steps .

`` jackson and his parents are here .

they 're family friends .

they 're on the guest list every year . ''

`` got it , thanks , '' i reply , before mounting the rest of the steps .

that was considerate of him , and it sounds like he was telling me that he did n't invite jackson himself .

as i walk across the lawn , i can see that the first guests are beginning to arrive .

i wonder if now that i 'm pierce 's stepdaughter , i 'm going be expected to put on the same song-and-dance routine as nate .

usually if i have to go to a party , like my aunt 's christmas party , i 'll hang out for a while , and then disappear somewhere to read a book .

my fears are realized as my mom waves me over to where she and pierce are standing with two guests .

i 'm introduced to the couple , who turn out to be higher-ups for the state department , and my accomplishments are trotted out while they murmur enthusiastically , though i have to wonder if anyone could possibly be genuinely interested in such self-serving prattle .

as we talk , my mom breaks away to greet the guests that are now pouring in .

i listen politely as pierce chats away , impressed with his wit and charm .

clearly nate gets it from his dad , even if he does insist that it 's a learned skill .

i manage to slip away and head over to the buffet table .

like any good maryland girl , i absolutely love crabs .

as i pile my plate high , i feel a hand on the small of my back .

i turn to see jackson grinning at me .

with his open , friendly face , it 's hard to keep in mind what nate told me about him , and what i experienced for myself .

`` hey , brynn ! ''

he says , brushing a kiss against my cheek .

`` jackson , good to see you , '' i reply politely .

`` you disappeared so fast the last time i saw you !

i was worried , '' he replies .

`` sorry about that , '' i respond , wondering if nate gave him any explanation .

`` we ever going to go on that date ? ''

i 'm saved by the sight of allison walking out onto the deck .

`` could you excuse me for a moment ?

my best friend just got here and she does n't know anyone else , '' i explain as i slip away .

i wave at her as i approach , but she 's looking around nervously and does n't register my presence .

`` allison ! ''

i call out , just ten feet from her .

`` oh !

oh my gosh , i did n't recognize you , '' she says .

i give her a hug as i walk up .

`` this party is really fancy !

and this house !

i mean you said it was big , but i did n't think it was this big . ''

`` i know , '' i groan .

`` i 'll give you a tour later if you have a couple hours , '' i add wryly .

`` come get something to eat with me-i was just filling up a plate .

i 'm so glad you 're here .

i do n't really know anyone else , and none of the interns have shown up yet . ''

`` the interns ? ''

allison asks as we head back over to the buffet , where i pick up my abandoned plate .

`` yeah , pierce invited all the interns from the office . ''

`` oh , that was nice of him , '' allison comments , picking up her own plate .

`` wow , i think that guy 's a senator ... the one in the blue seersucker jacket . ''

i glance over .

`` from georgia , yeah , '' i confirm .

`` i think he and pierce served in congress at the same time . ''

i start giggling and allison looks at me with a questioning smile .

`` sorry , i just ca n't believe i 'm talking about my stepfather serving in congress . ''

`` this is your real life ! ''

allison says , laughing .

`` when do you think it 'll sink in ? ''

`` no idea , '' i reply as we head toward a couple empty seats at one of the tables .
