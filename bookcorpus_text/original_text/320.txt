dharr blinked at her statement .

`` but he does n't need to do that , '' dharr countered .

she raised her eyebrows at him , showing him her opinion of his perception .

`` have you told him that ? ''

she argued .

dharr looked confused .

`` no .

why should i ?

he knows that i 'll take care of him . ''

victoria shook her head .

`` no , he does n't .

children are black and white .

their world only makes sense on their level , not necessarily on ours .

so in his mind , his mother and father are gone , that means he 's the man of the house . ''

dharr considered her words carefully and victoria was surprised when he did n't contradict her again .

`` that 's an interesting perspective , '' he conceded .

`` i 'll think about what you said .

what will you do tomorrow ? ''

victoria sighed , thinking about the governess .

`` i do n't know .

can i spend some time playing with them alone ?

not just a small span of time but for perhaps half the day ? ''

`` why would you want to do that ? ''

victoria looked stunned .

`` why not ? ''

`` do n't you get tired of them ? ''

he asked , curiously .

victoria smiled , understanding at last .

`` ah , you 're one of those . ''

`` what of what 'those ' , '' he challenged .

`` one of those people who thinks children should be seen and not heard ; and only at appropriate , limited times during the day . ''

`` of course , '' he replied as if that was the most obvious thing in the world .

victoria eyed him suspiciously but then saw the amusement in his eyes .

`` no you 're not .

you just do n't know any differently , do you ? ''

she refused to laugh , hating that he could still do that to her .

he could be a horrible tease , she remembered .

dharr chuckled and moved closer .

`` i 'll admit that my parents did n't play with me much .

but i do n't think some commingling of adults and children would be inappropriate .

as long as you are there to supervise , '' he challenged .

he stood up and walked closer to the bathtub .

victoria was n't overly concerned , thinking he was actually leaving and she could get out of the tub .

it was becoming uncomfortably hot , what with the warm water and dharr 's gorgeous body so close and his intense , sexy eyes watching her closely .

but he did n't stop his momentum towards the tub when she thought he should be turning towards the doorway .

`` dharr , what are you doing ? ''

she asked , all the nervousness she 'd been holding at bay came rushing back to the forefront now that he was much too close to the bathtub .

`` it is time for you to get out of the tub , '' he claimed .

`` dharr ! ''

she snapped , watching his hand move to the faucet .

`` what are you thinking of doing ? ''

`` i 'm going to let the water out .

you 're here as my guest and i am honor bound to take care of you .

i ca n't let you become too water-logged , '' he explained as if that were the most obvious action in the world .

`` do n't you dare ! ''

she squealed .

but he dared .

all the time .

with a simple press of a button , the drain to the bathtub opened up .

`` dharr ! ''

she gasped , frantically searching for a towel or a washcloth , anything that would cover her up .

`` there 's a towel beside the bench over there , '' he explained , still bending down close to the bathtub .

his dark eyes were filled with amusement and mischief and something she did n't dare define , too afraid it would be desire .

the water drained out of the tub and she watched in horror as dharr walked patiently over to the stack of thick , pink towels .

he unfolded the top one and held it open for her .

`` you 're going to have to come out sooner or later , '' he chuckled .

`` you 're a bastard , '' she said , glaring at him but still frantically watching the water which was quickly draining away .

`` so you 've mentioned before .

now be a good girl and come out of there .

after all , you 're not afraid of me , are you ? ''

victoria scooped up as many bubbles as she could , holding them in front of her primly .

she did n't care how silly she looked but rushed over to the open towel .

she tried pulling it out of his hands , but his strong , muscular arms only closed around her , thankfully covering her up but now she had a new problem .

and this one was more painful than the last .

the towel was closed , covering up her nakedness but dharr 's hands were holding it there .

his chest was pressed against hers and his arms were pulling her close , pressing her hips against his .

`` you can let go of me , '' she said breathlessly , worriedly looking up into his face .

`` i do n't think i want to , '' he said , his eyes were staring at her lips .

`` do n't , '' she said , knowing where his thoughts were going and hoping she could dissuade him somehow .
