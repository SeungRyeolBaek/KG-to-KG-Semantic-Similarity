it 's time to meet my mom and her new boyfriend , and hear their big news .

i glance around as i enter decanter .

its architecture is modern and elegant , a mix of cream fabrics and dark wood .

i 've never been here before-way out of my price range .

i 'm about to approach the hostess when i recognize my mom in a prime booth in the corner .

i walk toward her between a row of tables , hearing the hushed tones of conversation and the clinking of wine glasses around me .

her eyes light up and she stands as she sees me approaching .

she looks even more gorgeous than usual .

her blonde hair , a little lighter than mine , hangs in a long bob almost to her shoulders , and her perfect teeth show brightly behind her deep red lipstick .

`` brynn !

i 've missed you , honey , '' she says , enveloping me in a hug .

`` you look gorgeous .

is n't this dress a little big for you , though ? ''

she asks , pulling at the extra fabric .

`` you know i like this kind of fit , '' i reply , allowing only the slightest bit of impatience to enter my voice .

this is a recurring conversation with us .

she always wants me to dress a little more feminine , a little more `` form-flattering '' as she puts it .

`` well , i 'm so excited for you to meet pierce .

he 's just in the restroom-oh !

here he is . ''

i follow her gaze to an elegantly dressed man with salt-and-pepper hair and blue eyes who 's approaching us with a warm smile .

`` holly , i 'd think this was your sister if i did n't know any better , '' he says , and my mom giggles .

`` brynn , i 'm pierce .

your mom has told me such wonderful things about you , '' he says as we shake hands .

`` likewise , '' i reply politely , though the truth is that she 's told me almost nothing .

`` well , let 's sit .

i ordered us some champagne for the table .

it should be arriving soon . ''

we all obediently sit , me on one side of the cushy leather booth , and my mom and pierce on the other .

`` so , brynn , you 're in your junior year ? ''

`` yes , that's- '' i break off as my mom reaches for her water glass and i spot a ring on her left hand .

not an engagement ring , either .

a wedding ring .

`` what 's that ? ''

i ask sharply .

`` oh , '' my mom flutters .

`` well , we were going to wait until my son arrived , but- '' `` we 're married ! ''

my mom announces suddenly .

my jaw drops open .

`` married ? ''

i squeak .

`` i mean , i thought maybe you 'd be engaged but married ? ''

`` you 're upset ? ''

my mom asks worriedly .

`` no , not upset ... '' i struggle to put my emotions into the right words .

i always feel the need to protect my mom from what i 'm really feeling .

she 's always been more fragile than me .

`` just surprised , that 's all .

i mean , how long have you known each other ? ''

`` well , we met six months ago , '' my mom says .

`` and then pierce took me on a surprise trip to the turks and caicos last week , and everything was just so perfect ... '' she trails off , looking to him for support .

`` it really was , brynn .

and it felt so right .

we wished you guys could have been there , but we just felt that we had to seize the moment .

it was in this little gazebo on the cliff , with spectacular views of the water , and the captain of a boat that was docked at the resort officiated ... '' `` it was engagement , honeymoon , and wedding in one !

we just wished you and nate could have been there .

that would have made it even more perfect . ''

i struggle to catch up with all the information they 're throwing at me .

`` sorry , who 's nate ? ''

`` oh , nate 's my son .

he goes to school here , too .

i tried to get a hold of him so we could tell you together , but-wait !

there he is ! ''

pierce slides out of the booth to wave to his son .

nate .

not nate ... `` what 's pierce 's last name ? ''

i whisper urgently to my mom .

`` thornhill , '' she whispers back distractedly , sliding over to stand next to pierce .

oh my god .

nate thornhill is here .

nate thornhill is currently walking up behind me .

nate thornhill is my new ... stepbrother , i realize in horror .

beads of sweat form at my hairline and i 've suddenly lost my appetite .

chapter four as nate walks into my periphery , i watch in slow motion as he hugs his dad and shakes hands with my mom .

i can not believe this is happening .

surely i 'm in the middle of some strange nightmare and will wake up soon .

i hoped i 'd never have to see him again after last night .

`` brynn , honey , this is nate , pierce 's son , '' my mom says , cutting through the fog of emotion in my brain .
