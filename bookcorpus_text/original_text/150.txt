`` i am , '' he replies .

i glance up sharply , but his eyes are n't focused on my face .

they 're looking at my body , which i now realize is quite exposed in my thin , white cotton nightie .

i completely forgot i was wearing it .

there 's a moment of silence , and i suddenly become very aware of every inch of myself , and every inch of him .

his smell of sweat , beads of it still dripping forward down his chest , through a smattering of hair between his nipples .

allison 's face appears in my mind , and i 'm reminded of what she said .

`` i 'm done . ''

`` what ? ''

he says , his eyes pulling up to mine .

`` with your hands .

i 'm done . ''

`` right . ''

i grab a glass from the cabinet and pour him some water from the faucet .

`` here , you felt dizzy because you 're dehydrated . ''

`` thanks , '' he says .

he reaches for the glass with his left hand , which is closer , and then pauses and takes it awkwardly with his right .

`` what was that ? ''

i ask , frowning .

`` what ? ''

`` let me see your left arm , '' i reply , reaching for him , but he pulls back .

`` no , no , it 's nothing . ''

`` what is ? ''

`` my shoulder .

it 's just a little tendonitis . ''

`` oh really ?

did a doctor tell you that ? ''

`` not exactly . ''

`` webmd ? ''

i ask , raising my eyebrows .

he shrugs , then winces .

`` you need to take better care of yourself .

you ca n't keep pushing yourself so hard . ''

he frowns , and does n't respond .

`` well , at least take some tylenol for the pain , '' i add as i pour two pills into my hand and begin to repack the first aid kit with the other .

`` that 's ok. '' i tilt my head at him .

`` pain is n't going to make you heal any faster , '' i point out .

`` fine , '' he says with a little smile .

i blush as his fingertips scrape my palm as he takes the pills .

`` well .

i think i 'm going back to bed .

i 'm supposed to check out some of the smithsonian museums later , so ... '' i trail off , feeling awkward now .

`` ok , see you later , '' he says , turning toward the back door .

i pause for a moment , then head back toward the staircase .

just like that , the one real conversation that my stepbrother and i have ever had is over .

i could practically feel him closing back up at the end there .

i climb the steps and shut my bedroom door behind me .

i feel more confused now than ever about our relationship .

i did n't think it could get any weirder after that peep show i gave him , but somehow this candid glimpse of him makes things even more complicated .

i close my eyes and try to fall back to sleep , but when my alarm goes off at ten , i 'm still wide awake .

chapter nine the humidity is really starting to thicken by the middle of june , and it 's a wonder that i have n't taken advantage of our pool yet .

the only swimsuit i have is an old athletic one-piece , and i pull it on reluctantly in my bedroom .

my mom keeps asking me if i want to go shopping , but i have n't taken her up on it yet .

all her new clothes look wonderful but i think i 'd feel uncomfortable spending so much money on myself .

i head down the hallway and almost bump into nate as he leaves his bedroom .

i reflexively cross my hands over my chest , even though i know he 's seen me in less .

`` hey , '' i say .

`` hey , '' he replies .

it 's the same conversation we 've had ever since i saw him in the kitchen that morning .

we quickly slipped into polite , but formal , interactions with each other afterward .

if i had to choose between this and the mind games we started out with , i might choose the mind games .

the doorbell rings and i start to move past him to answer it .

`` it 's ok i 'll get it .

it 's my friend jackson . ''

he walks down the hallway toward the stairs .

i follow after him , and turn toward the backyard once we 're in the foyer .

i hear his friend walk in just as i exit the french doors .

there 's a chest set against the house with the outdoor towels in it , so i grab one and set it on a chair .

the area around the pool it is paved with light stones before it turns into grass , and lounge chairs and a table with an umbrella are carefully set around it .

i turn to the pool and step gingerly onto the first step in the shallow end .

it 's nice-warm , but still refreshing in the hot summer day .

i step down the rest of the way until the water circles around my stomach , and then dive forward .

i swim to the other end , where the water gets darker and deeper , then push off and glide onto my back .
