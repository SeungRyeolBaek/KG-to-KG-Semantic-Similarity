`` so get ready to be on your toes today . ''

megan laughed .

`` okay , sounds good . ''

as they started working their way through patients , things continued to escalate into overwhelming territory for megan .

kristi seemed to be experiencing the same feeling since the tops of her cheeks had a shine of perspiration beads on them .

the moment they finished with one patient and disinfected the room , another patient was waiting to enter it .

megan followed behind kristi as she went to poke her head in to the registration area .

`` hey janet , could you not call anyone else back ?

we 're getting swamped . ''

janet shook her head .

`` it 's just as crazy out in the waiting room .

like we 're almost overflowing . ''

kristi rolled her eyes .

`` fabulous .

it 's probably another full moon , which makes things absolutely insane . ''

she turned back to megan .

`` listen , since we 're so swamped , can you take the man in exam b ? ''

megan could n't help her eyes from widening .

`` really ?

on my own ? ''

kristi smiled before patting megan 's hand .

`` i 've seen you in action the last week .

i have faith in you . ''

`` okay , if you 're sure . ''

`` i 'm positive . ''

megan could n't contain her smile .

`` thank you . ''

taking her ipad , she flipped open the registration details on the patient awaiting her .

when she pushed open the door , she eyed the man on the examining table .

`` good evening mr. robertson , i 'm megan .

what- '' before she could even get out the standard `` what seems to be the problem ? ''

question , the man started shaking his head furiously .

`` no , no .

i wo n't let you examine me .

i want a doctor .

a male doctor .

you understand ? ''

`` sir , i understand , but i have to follow protocol , which is to ascertain your issues before the doctor comes in .

i see on the chart that you 're experiencing some abdominal swelling ? ''

he refused to meet her eye .

instead , he gazed over at the wall before holding up one finger to her .

`` i meant what i said .

i demand to see a male doctor . ''

`` yes , but we 're very backed up this afternoon .

i 'm not sure how long it will be before you are able to see a doctor , least of all a male doctor . ''

when it appeared the man 's resolve was fading a little , megan took a tentative step forward .

`` please , if you would just let me take a look at your abdomen . ''

`` it is n't my stomach , '' he mumbled .

`` then what is it ? ''

when he did n't respond , she sighed with frustration .

`` mr. robertson , you can not ignore abdominal swelling .

it can stem from many issues and have many repercussions . ''

he shifted uncomfortably on the table .

just when she thought she was making headway with him , he threw his head back and began screaming at the top of his lungs .

`` get me a male doctor ! ''

megan rolled her eyes .

the first time she had the chance to see a patient on her own , and he had to be a stark raving lunatic .

refusing to give into him or accept defeat , she stalked over to him .

she was going to exam his sexist ass if it was the last thing she did .

`` keep screaming , and i 'll call security , '' she warned before snatching the sheet off him .

his screams cut off to a shriek as he clawed for the sheet , but the damage was done .

she had seen more than enough .

`` oh .

my .

god , '' she murmured .

she gazed wide-eyed and open-mouthed at what had to be the poster child picture to go along with the warning labels on viagra and cialis for four-hour erections .

`` that 's going to have to be aspirated . ''

`` excuse me ? ''

he demanded .

she cocked her head at him .

`` the excessive blood in your penis ? ''

he nodded .

`` it 's not just going to go away on its own .

it has to be aspirated , which means drained out . ''

mr. robertson swallowed hard .

`` like with a needle ? ''

`` yes , with a very large needle . ''

when he started to protest , she brought her hand up .

`` lucky for you , i can not do the procedure-it is to be handled strictly by a doctor . ''

`` a male ? ''

`` if it came to your penis exploding from the pressure by waiting for a male doctor , would you seriously be that picky ? ''

his blue eyes widened in horror .

`` yeah , i thought so .

i 'll be back . ''

when she whirled out of the room , she ran right into the last person she wanted to have to deal with at the moment .

`` i 'm so sorry .

are you all right ? ''

pesh asked .

`` i 'm fine . ''

he smiled down at her .

`` doing some patient evaluations on your own ?

that 's wonderful . ''

`` um , well , yes and no . ''

his brows knitted in concern .
