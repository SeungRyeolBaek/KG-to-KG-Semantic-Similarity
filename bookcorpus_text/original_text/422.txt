to make the whole image better , or worse depending on one 's perspective , he was holding two glasses of brandy in his hand , offering one to her .

this was at least safer , she thought as she stepped forward to accept the brandy .

`` thank you , '' she whispered , then moved away from him , taking a position on the other side of the room .

`` the night went smoothly , '' he said and sat down on the leather sofa , watching her with hooded eyes .

`` thank you . ''

`` you did an excellent job .

very good food . ''

`` i told lana that i thought it was great , but i 'll pass along your praise as well .

it will mean more coming from you . ''

`` probably not , '' he laughed softly .

her eyes sliced over to him , not sure why he 'd said that .

`` what do you mean ? ''

`` i mean , everyone who was here tonight basically worships you .

they are all eager to do your bidding and please you . ''

she flushed , feeling embarrassed by that kind of a comment .

`` you 're exaggerating . ''

he shook his head .

`` not in the least .

you 're a very good hostess .

not that i ever doubted you . ''

by the end of his statement , he was standing right in front of her .

`` you 're charming and interesting despite disobeying just about everything i tell you to do . ''

she could n't help the chuckle that escaped .

`` so stop trying to order me around . ''

one side of his mouth tilted up in a semblance of a smile .

`` it 's in my nature . ''

his hand slipped around her waist , drawing her closer .

`` what am i going to do with you ? ''

she inhaled sharply when he pulled her against him , his dark eyes conveying his desire for her .

`` maybe you could just enjoy my company before you head back to dunari , '' she said softly , pulling her eyes away from his and staring at his chest .

she really did n't want him going back home , she thought with a touch of sadness .

she wanted him here where she could laugh with him and talk with him .

just being in the same room with him was stimulating , although at times he terrified her .

`` i was without your beautiful presence for six years .

do you really think i 'm going to just leave you now that i have you right where i want you ? ''

she stopped breathing with those words .

`` where do you think you have me ? ''

she asked worriedly .

`` in my arms . ''

he grinned and took a sip of his brandy with his free hand , `` and in my house with no one else around . ''

those words startled her and she looked back towards the kitchen .

they were too far away for her to see or hear anything but she suspected that he was correct .

her shivering increased and she gripped her brandy glass with both hands .

`` would you take me home ? ''

he shook his head .

`` not before i kiss you , '' he replied .

`` i 'd rather you did n't . ''

he chuckled and she felt that sound throughout her whole body .

`` i know , love .

but it 's something i have to do . ''

he paused to let those words sink in as he looked at her dress .

`` and what are we going to do about this flagrant disobedience about my instructions on your attire tonight ? ''

she glanced down at her dress , then back up to him with a grin .

`` i do n't take orders from you , rais . ''

he shook his head and bent lower so his lips were almost touching hers .

`` ah , but i like it when you disobey me . ''

her eyes widened and she started to pull back , but the arm around her waist was too strong .

`` what are you going to do about it ? ''

he took another sip of brandy before setting it down on the table behind him .

`` oh , there are a numbers of punishments i can dole out for a major infraction like that . ''

again , another giggle slipped out and she shifted in his arms so that her free arm was higher on his shoulder , almost wrapped around his neck .

`` can you give me some examples ? ''

she suggested .

`` maybe i 'll choose one over another . ''

he looked back at her askance .

`` you do n't get to choose your punishments , my dear . ''

`` why not ? ''

he took her brandy glass out of her hand and set it down next to his .

when both of his hands were free , he used one to take her other hand and place it on his shoulder .

`` because that would defeat the purpose of punishments , my love . ''

he bent low and kissed her neck , causing rachel to shiver and move closer to him .

she even tilted her head so he had easier access .

`` i need to get home . ''

`` not before i kiss you , '' he countered , nibbling on her collar bone .

`` i think you 're already kissing me . ''

`` i 'm not kissing you where i want to kiss you . ''
