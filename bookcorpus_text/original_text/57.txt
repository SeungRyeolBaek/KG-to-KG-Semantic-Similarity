neither one of us has been with anybody in at least two years-we 've had tests for the hospital . ''

`` that 's all well and good but what about pregnancy ?

are you on the pill ? ''

`` no . ''

she chewed on her bottom lip momentarily .

`` wait a minute , '' she murmured .

in her mind , she began counting down the days since her last period .

`` twenty . ''

`` twenty what ? ''

`` i 'm on day twenty , so we should be safe . ''

`` i 'll still pull out . ''

`` if you say so , '' she replied .

gripping his biceps , she urged him to cover her again with his body .

she loved the feel of his chest hairs rubbing against her ni**les .

pesh widened her legs , and then he eased inside her , filling and stretching her walls .

it had been so long that she could n't help feeling a bit of a sting .

`` are you all right ? ''

`` i 'm fine . ''

he withdrew and flexed his hips , thrusting back inside her .

this time they both moaned .

setting up a rhythm , he began rocking in and out of her .

the pace was slow and sensual , and while he was hitting all the right spots , she wanted more .

the entire time he moved in and out of her , he kept his eyes locked firmly on hers .

his gaze was so dark with desire that she did n't dare look away .

the longer she stared into his eyes , the more connected with him she felt .

the old saying was that the eyes were windows to the soul , and she was getting a pretty good glimpse into his .

and that scared the hell out of her .

wanting to make things less sensual , she gripped his biceps .

`` harder , '' she panted .

rising on his knees , he slid his forearms under the backs of her knees .

this enabled him to pull her back against his pounding thrusts .

while their connection at first had been so intimate , this was more about lust and desire .

she reached up and clasped his face in her hands , bringing his head down to hers .

their mouths and tongues met in frenzied kisses .

when he pulled out of her , megan whimpered at the loss of feeling .

he quickly flipped her over onto her stomach .

pulling on her hips , he raised her up onto her knees .

when he reentered her , megan moaned .

with each thrust , he went deeper and deeper .

her fingers fisted the sheets as he leaned over her back , kissing a trail down her spine .

she did n't know how he was able to be so many places at once .

while his mouth licked her back and teasingly left love bites , his hands were rubbing her thighs and then sliding under her to squeeze her br**sts or tease her clit .

he was giving her so much that she could n't stay silent .

she moaned , chanted his name , and cried out as the sounds of their wet skin slapped together .

finally , she could n't take it anymore .

dropping her head , she screamed into the mattress as she found her release .

once her walls finished clenching , she felt pesh withdraw from her .

as he groaned , megan felt warmth spurt onto her back and bu**ocks .

after seeing him come before , she hated she could n't see his face .

he was so beautiful when he was finding release .

once he finished , she eased down onto her stomach and curled a pillow under her head .

after a few seconds , pesh lay down beside her .

she turned her head and met his gaze .

exhausted and completely sexually satisfied for the first time in her life , all she could muster to say was , `` wow . ''

a slow grin spread across his cheeks .

`` you seem to say that a lot around me after orgasms . ''

she laughed .

`` it 's because you render me absolutely speechless with your talents . ''

`` thank you .

i could say the same about you . ''

his gaze left her face and trailed down her na**d back .

`` we need to get you cleaned up . ''

rolling her shoulder blades , she said , `` i kinda like it .

makes me feel marked or something . ''

he smiled shyly at her .

`` i like the idea of marking you-making you mine . ''

he wanted her to be his .

she did n't know quite what to think about that statement .

did she want to be his ?

she certainly could n't imagine belonging to anyone else .

besides the amazing physical chemistry they shared , she was starting to feel such a deep connection to him .

staring over at him , she could n't help wondering what was going on in his mind .

`` we 've really done it now , have n't we ? ''

`` yes , i do believe that was the universal `` it '' that we just did , '' he teased .

she smacked his arm playfully .

`` that 's not what i meant . ''

`` i know , '' he murmured .

`` no matter what , this changes everything . ''

`` for the better , i hope . ''

`` i suppose . ''

the truth was she 'd never really had casual sex before .

there was one time her freshman year that she hooked up with a guy at work .
