`` that we 're two single people having dinner , '' he replied .

`` you 're a physician , and i 'm a clinical student .

could n't i get in trouble ? ''

`` doctors and nurses often have dinner together on their breaks .

the cafeteria is a pretty inconspicuous place for us to be alone together .

if someone came upon us in one of the medicine rooms or an empty patient room , then we might have a problem . ''

`` if you say so , '' she mumbled , as he punched the down button on the elevator .

after they stepped on the car , pesh eyed her .

`` you really are worried , are n't you ? ''

she nodded .

`` my career means everything to me .

i do n't want to do anything to jeopardize it . ''

`` then i 'll make sure we do n't sit by ourselves . ''

`` thank you .

i really appreciate that . ''

as the car started its decent down , pesh threw his head back and exhaled a long breath .

`` well , that was ... '' megan grinned at him .

`` the good doctor seems speechless .

surely in all your years in the er , you 've seen crazier or more mortifying cases . ''

he cocked his head , appearing thoughtful .

`` a screwdriver lodged in a rectum is probably the tamest . ''

`` the tamest ? ''

megan questioned incredulously , as the elevator door dinged open .

pesh laughed .

`` a man high on meth walking into the er with his penis in his hand is probably the craziest . ''

megan 's hand swept over her mouth .

`` he actually cut off his ... '' she gazed around to make sure no one was listening to their conversation .

`` is the good nurse speechless ? ''

he teased .

she rolled her eyes at him .

`` so what happened ? ''

`` we got him sedated and into surgery as soon as we could .

i heard they were able to sew it back on .

i 'm not aware of whether or not it was ever ... fully functional again . ''

`` that is crazy . ''

`` i know . ''

pesh handed her a food tray .

as they surmised their choices , megan asked , `` was that your standard line of questioning in a situation like that ? ''

`` i think we 've established that i have n't been privy to many priapism cases , but yes , any time there is an issue with the penis that is not related to the urethra or bladder , you would ask those questions . ''

after the food service worker gave them both an odd look , pesh looked pointedly at her .

`` why do you ask ? ''

she shrugged .

`` just to be prepared for the next time . ''

he cocked his brows at her .

`` do you want to practice your line of questioning ?

you know , show me what you 've learned ? ''

`` let 's get our food first , shall we ? ''

`` okay . ''

after deciding that the grilled chicken salad was about the most appealing item in the food line , she grabbed a drink and some of the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies .

just as she inched up to pay , pesh put his tray next to hers .

he had chosen some kind of stir-fry that did n't look appetizing to megan .

when she dug in her purse for her wallet , he handed a twenty to the cashier .

as he took his change , she shot him a look .

`` what ? ''

he asked .

`` you buying my dinner does n't look very innocent , '' she hissed , as they started toward the tables .

pesh shook his head with a smile .

`` i highly doubt she 's keeping the gossip mill going on how dr. nadeen bought the lovely new clinical student a salad . ''

`` you never know , '' megan countered .

trailing pesh , she watched as he made his way over to a table filled with doctors and nurses .

while the bottom half was filled with people , the top was practically empty .

`` mind if we take these seats ? ''

pesh asked .

`` go right ahead , nadeen , '' a bushy haired doctor replied .

`` we 're expecting a few more to join us , '' he said , before covertly winking at megan .

`` you play a good game , '' she said , softly .

`` thank you . ''

she 'd just finished drizzling dressing over her salad when pesh said , `` ready to prove yourself ? ''

`` are we really going to talk about this while we eat ? ''

`` you 'll learn that most lunches and dinners are spent either reviewing cases or getting input on cases . ''

`` fine then . ''

putting on a professional air , she asked , `` have you taken any erectile dysfunction medication ? ''

after swallowing a bite of stir-fry , he replied , `` no , never . ''

`` do you have trouble obtaining an erection ? ''

the twinkle returned to his eyes .

`` i would think you would n't need to ask that question after our previous encounter . ''

a shiver went down her spine as she remembered her core rubbing against the hardened ridge in his pants .

`` considering it is unlikely that i would have any previous knowledge of the patient , just answer the question . ''

he gave her a sly smile .
