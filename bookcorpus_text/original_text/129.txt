we 'd had an argument of sorts that morning , well i would n't call it an argument exactly but there was definitely some tension .

we were lazing around having breakfast doing our usual thing , which was something the therapist had told her was helpful for her anxiety .

i was reaching over to pour her some orange juice when she sideswiped me .

`` trace are we gon na get married ? ''

she caught me off guard with that one , coming out of the blue like that and i guess i did n't handle the situation to her liking .

`` why do n't we talk about this later after you 're done with the show ? ''

it was the best i could come up with on such short notice .

for some reason my answer pissed her off .

she 'd been showing her mettle a lot here lately once she realized i was n't the type to fold my fist and punch her in the face just for kicks .

after she asked me that she got all quiet for the rest of the day and when she was n't slamming shit around the house she was ignoring me .

i decided to leave her to her mad and do some work in my office .

two hours before she was due to leave i cornered her in the shower and f**ked her against the stall although she 'd tried to give me shit at first .

`` mine , you do n't tell me no ever no matter how f**king pissed you are . ''

i had my hand covering her wet crotch when i said that and moved it away to enter her swiftly .

as much of a fuss as she 'd made by the time i had her pinned to the wall , her legs were wrapped around my waist and her fingers were digging into my scalp as i f**ked her to within an inch of her life .

she 'd cleaned my c**k off after i 'd off loaded inside her the second time and we 'd cleaned each other up after so i was under the impression that she was over her mad .

now she pulled this f**king stunt .

we 'd had a few conversations about the way she dressed on stage and when she let it be known that she was n't too comfortable with some of the costumes either but her wardrobe people chose them , i 'd put my foot down .

her talent did n't need any gimmicks .

i did n't expect her to dress like a nun on stage but neither did i expect her to show her ass to the world , not when that ass was now the exclusive property of trace mckenzie .

i waited until the number was almost at an end and she would be headed backstage for a clothes change .

i caught her as soon as she got off the stage and while her helpers were waiting to help her change i dragged her off to the dressing room and locked the door .

`` your next outfit had better be something more presentable shiane , or i swear to f**k , i will drag your ass off that f**king stage and take you home . ''

`` do n't tell me how to do my job trace , i was doing this before we met and if you do n't like it ... '' my hand came up and went around her throat and i pulled her face close to mine .

`` watch what the f**k you say to me little girl , i 'm holding onto my temper by a thread , so unless you want me to heat up your little ass when we get home you 'd better quit while you 're ahead . ''

`` maybe i wo n't be going home with you . ''

she was pissed and obviously not thinking too clearly because of it or she would 've been more careful .

i laughed in her face .

`` try it , there is n't a hole or rock big enough to hide your ass .

and if you get any one of these f**kers around here to help you hide from me i will destroy the f**k. '' i kissed her hard enough to bruise her lips before leaving her there .

i knew what she wanted but she was just going to have to wait .

i 'm a man and for a man there 's always the right way and a wrong way to do things .

i headed back out my seat and that 's when she really did it .

i thought i 'd made my point when i saw the long dress with the slit up the front .

but then one of the male dancers came up behind her and wrapped his arm around her from behind while she sang to him and they did some sorta two- step dance .

then he did something with his hand and the dress was at her feet .

she kicked it out of the way as the crowd went wild .

she had the nerve to dead at me was she sang and then and shook her ass at the crowd .

i thought there was going to be a riot .

i sat there for the rest of the set until she left the stage for the last time .

by now my rage was a cool controlled anger simmering inside me .

i said nothing as i went backstage where everyone was congratulating her on her performance .

`` let 's go . ''

i walked over and took her elbow . ''

`` wait i have to ... '' one look at my face had her changing tact .

she swallowed hard and i could see from her expression that she was finally getting that she 'd gone too far .
