she 'd made a repeated fool out of herself the night before , and he still wanted to see her ?

`` you ca n't be serious . ''

`` i am . ''

she gave a slight jerk of her head .

`` i do n't think that is a good idea . ''

`` but why ? ''

he countered sincerely .

with a contemptuous snort , she replied , `` is n't it obvious ? ''

`` if you 're alluding to the fact you accidentally got drunk last night and then became ill , that has little relevance to me .

accidents happen , and i 'm man enough to realize that . ''

he closed the gap between them .

`` i liked being with you yesterday . ''

remembering what emma had said , megan could n't help asking , `` you want to date me , do n't you ? ''

`` yes of course .

what else would i want to do ? ''

when she replied , `` have sex , '' a flush entered his cheeks .

`` that is not what i meant . ''

`` and that 's a pity . ''

his brows furrowed .

`` whatever do you mean ? ''

`` you and i ... we want different things .

you want to date and get married again , right ? ''

`` yes , that is something i desire very much . ''

she shook her head .

`` but i do n't want to be in a serious relationship right now with you or anyone for that matter .

i 'm certainly not ready to get married anytime soon .

i just wanted to have some fun with someone . ''

pesh frowned .

`` i do n't think i understand . ''

`` what i want from you is the same thing i wanted last night .

just sex , '' she answered honestly .

`` you do n't want to date me ... you only want to have sex with me ? ''

if the situation had n't been so dire , megan might 've laughed at the horrified expression on pesh 's face .

he appeared absolutely floored that she could ever think of only using him as a sex toy .

finally , when she gathered herself together , she shook her head .

`` i 'm sorry , but that 's the way i feel . ''

she braced herself for some sort of wrath out of him or even a lecture .

what he did was even more surprising .

he gave her a sad smile .

`` and i 'm sorry you feel that way because i would have really enjoyed getting to know you better . ''

without another word , he opened the door .

always the gentleman , he waited for her to go through first .

tucking her head to her chest , she bypassed him to walk to the car .

once again , he appeared to open the car door for her .

`` thank you , '' she murmured .

he nodded before walking around the front of the car .

without another word to her , pesh cranked up , and then began backing down the driveway .

the ride to aidan and emma 's was only twenty minutes , but it seemed to take an eternity .

the painful silence hung heavy around her .

pesh did n't look at her .

instead , he kept his gaze firmly on the road ahead of them .

when he pulled into aidan and emma 's driveway , megan felt her stomach clench .

she wished there was some way to make things right between them .

but she had a feeling she had gone too far and said too much .

as he put the car in park , he turned to look at her .

`` thank you for the ride , '' she said .

`` you 're welcome .

it was my pleasure . ''

`` most of all , i want to thank you for taking care of me last night .

you truly went above and beyond .

i can never thank you enough . ''

`` you do n't have to thank me .

i 'm glad i was able to help you . ''

nibbling on her bottom lip , she finally allowed herself to say what she was holding back on .

`` i wish things could be different , '' she said softly .

when she dared herself to look at him , she found him staring intently at her .

`` i 'm sorry , too .

take care of yourself .

okay ? ''

she bobbed her head .

`` the same to you . ''

with trembling hands , she fumbled for the door handle .

when she was finally able to open the door , she stumbled out onto the pavement .

as she made her way up the driveway , she could feel pesh 's eyes on her .

the car remained parked as she climbed the porch steps and rang the doorbell .

she hoped that noah was already up , and she was n't waking the household .

aidan threw open the door .

`` megan ?

what the hell ? ''

he asked .

his question and concern caused her to burst into tears .

`` why are you crying ? ''

aidan demanded .

`` it 's a long story . ''

he glanced from her out the door to pesh 's car .

his expression darkened .

`` did pesh hurt you ? ''

`` no !

of course not . ''

`` if he 's made you cry , i do n't care whether he 's noah 's godfather or not .

i 'll punch his lights out ! ''
