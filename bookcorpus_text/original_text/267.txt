i decide not to worry about what anyone else might be thinking and focus on learning the ropes .

by the end of my first day , i feel like i 'm starting to have an idea of all that the job will entail , and i 'm more excited than ever to keep learning more .

it turns out , emerson is a great teacher .

cooper does n't roll into until after noon , just like emerson said .

he smiles around at his worker bees , and comes over to say hello to me and emerson .

`` how 's your first day so far , abby ? ''

he asks jovially .

`` i have n't broken anything yet , '' i reply , `` so i guess it 's all good ! ''

`` she 's a natural at this , '' emerson tells cooper .

out of the corner of my eye , i see tyler nudge bradley and shoot him a knowing look .

i should remind emerson not to praise me too vocally around the others .

it might get people talking about us .

maybe even feeling a little jealous of my friendly relationship with one of the agency 's higher-ups .

my grandfather 's quip about what i might have done with emerson to get this job still stings .

i do n't want anyone here getting the same idea .

though glancing around the communal workstation , it looks like it might be too late for that .

i feel myself growing quiet as the day wears on , self-conscious of what my coworkers might be saying about my rather cozy relationship with the head of the company 's european branch .

by the time we all start to clock out and head home once more , my jaw may as well be wired shut .

my growing silence is n't lost on emerson , either .

`` i know it 's a lot to take in all at once , '' he says , as we step into the elevator together with a few other coworkers , `` but you really are doing a great job .

you 're going to do so well here , abby .

i 'm proud of you . ''

i bite my tongue until we reach the ground floor .

as the other bastian employees head off in their own directions , emerson and i fall into step with each other out on the sidewalk .

i feel like i can breathe again for the first time in hours .

never underestimate the stifling nature of coworkers ' judgey passive aggression .

`` how does it not bother you that people are clearly gossiping about us in there ? ''

i ask emerson , as we head for the subway .

`` what are you talking about ? ''

he asks , cocking an eyebrow at me .

`` our coworkers , '' i spell it out , `` they obviously know that something 's up between us . ''

`` well , something is up , is n't it ? ''

he asks , slipping an arm around my waist in his mischievous fashion .

`` seriously emerson , '' i say , drawing to a stop beside the subway entrance , `` are n't you worried that this could mess things up for us at work ? ''

`` no , '' he says shortly , looking a bit irked .

`` i 'm not worried about being fodder for the rumor mill for a week or two .

this is n't high school , ab .

gossip ca n't hurt you . ''

`` it could be a bigger deal than that , '' i reply anxiously , `` i mean , what if cooper does n't approve of us ... being whatever we are ? ''

`` how can he disapprove of 'whatever we are ' if we have n't even decided what we are yet ? ''

emerson counters .

`` oof .

this is making my head hurt , '' i laugh , the tension of the day dispelling now that we 're out of the office .

`` bet i have the cure for what ails you , '' he replies , taking my hand in his and tugging me down the block .

`` that 's my train , '' i inform him , glancing back at the subway .

`` i know , '' he says , `` but my apartment is this way . ''

`` are you inviting me over ? ''

i ask , trailing along behind him .

`` obviously , '' he laughs .

`` what ... for ? ''

i ask , digging my heels in ever-so-slightly .

`` in case you 've forgotten , i 'm a pretty decent cook , '' he replies , `` let me make you dinner .

we can call it a belated double-birthday celebration , since our other attempts at celebrating got ... derailed this weekend . ''

dinner at emerson 's apartment ?

that sounds an awful lot like a romantic evening to me .

and though i know it would be wise to take this whole thing slow , i just ca n't resist him tonight .

who am i kidding-when have i ever been able to resist emerson sawyer ?

`` ok , '' i smile , `` lead on , iron chef . ''

we swing by a fancy high-end grocery store on the way to emerson 's apartment so he can gather his ingredients .

i ca n't help but smile wistfully as i think of the last time he cooked for me .

there was so much sweetness and sorrow wrapped up in those few fleeting weeks of our younger years that any thought of them is bursting with remembered sensation .

of course , it 's not like this reunion of ours has been without its emotional moments .
