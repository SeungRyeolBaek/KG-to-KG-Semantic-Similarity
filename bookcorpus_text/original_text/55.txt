as if he read her mind , pesh 's mouth closed over hers .

darting her tongue out , she sought to find his warmth .

when she did , he tasted like a mixture of the wine and spices they 'd eaten .

his tongue pulled back to trace her lips as his h*ps jerked , pushing him against her .

she followed his lead by pressing herself flush against him to where her br**sts were rubbing against his chest .

she shivered when he groaned into her mouth .

his thumb slid back and forth between her shoulder blades , and she could n't help arching into his touch .

as he pulled away from their kiss , he kept his eyes locked on hers .

she 'd never had a man stare at her so much .

it was like he was trying to see through her to her very soul .

it both overwhelmed and inflamed her at the same time .

it was all part of his slow seduction plan , and it was working .

`` please take me somewhere-somewhere we can be alone . ''

his expression became pained .

`` megan- '' she brought her hand from his shoulder to cover his lips .

`` do n't make me beg to be with you anymore . ''

shaking his head , he replied , `` i ca n't deny you anymore , not after having a taste of you . ''

megan shuddered at the intensity of both his words and the way he delivered them .

taking her by the hand , he led her off the dance floor .

they snaked around the tables in the dining area until they reached the exit .

weaving through the people , they went into the hotel that adjoined the restaurant .

it was actually more of a historic bed and breakfast than a hotel .

as they neared the reception area , pesh dropped her hand to reach into his coat pocket .

once he retrieved his wallet , he stepped up to the desk .

`` i need a room please . ''

`` credit card and identification please , '' the inn keeper droned .

as she sized him up , megan could n't help thinking he looked rather pompous-the usual type of person who worked in a high-end place .

`` would you prefer queen or- '' `` a king please , '' pesh requested through clenched teeth .

`` do you need help with your luggage ? ''

`` no , we do n't have any . ''

the man typed something into the computer .

`` and how long will you be staying with us ? ''

`` as long as we need , '' pesh replied , drumming his fingers on the marble counter .

megan watched as the man 's eyes widened and a flush entered his face .

he quickly finished the reservation and handed pesh a key card .

`` we have you in one of our balcony king suites . ''

`` thank you . ''

taking her by the hand , pesh led her over to the elevators .

when megan dared to glance over her shoulder , she saw the man peering curiously at them .

as they stepped onto the car , megan could n't help the nervous giggle that escaped her lips .

when pesh looked at her in surprise , she laughed even harder .

`` what is it ? ''

`` by the way that conversation went down , he probably thinks i 'm a prostitute . ''

pesh 's eyes widened .

`` you do n't seriously think that ? ''

`` okay , maybe a high-end escort ? ''

a growl came from low in his throat .

`` do not demean yourself like that . ''

`` i 'm not demeaning myself .

think about it .

we come in during the middle of the day with no luggage , and we want a hotel room with a king sized bed . ''

she tapped her chin with her finger .

`` hmm , what could we possibly be doing ? ''

the corners of his lips turned up in a smile .

`` i probably should care what the man thinks , but right now , i frankly do n't give a shit . ''

she laughed .

`` me either . ''

the elevator dinged , signaling they had reached their floor .

they stepped out and read the signs to find their room .

once pesh opened the door , megan walked inside .

she took in the cozy decor of the room with its brick fireplace , antiques , and four-poster bed .

going to a hotel could have been sleazy , but this room had such a romantic feel to it .

when he came up behind her and slid his arms around her waist , she could n't help suddenly feeling shy .

`` are you all right ? ''

he asked .

`` i 'm fine . ''

his breath warmed against her ear .

`` you tensed when i touched you . ''

`` i 'm sorry .

i did n't mean to .

i guess i 'm just nervous . ''

pesh turned her around to face him .

`` you do n't have anything to feel nervous about .

if you do n't want to do this anymore , we do n't have to . ''

`` no , i want to do it , '' she assured him .

without another word , his fingers went to her hair .

after he undid the clasp , her hair tumbled down over her shoulders .

an appreciative shudder rippled through her when he nuzzled his face into the strands at her neck .

from there he sought out the zipper at the middle of her back .
