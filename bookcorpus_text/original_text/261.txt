and with that , he tugs me tightly against him and brings his mouth to mine .

i bend my body to his , opening myself without a second thought .

the familiar taste of him , still the same after all these years , sets the synapses of my brain sparking , dredging up a million memories .

my every barrier and defense goes crumbling down as i run my fingers through his now-cropped brown hair .

i press my body flush against his as i feel his tongue sweep against mine .

he kisses me swiftly , ferociously , and i match his intensity at every stroke .

now that we 've given ourselves the permission to touch and be touched by each other , there 's no stopping us .

`` no one 's ever made me feel the way you do , '' i gasp , as emerson pulls me onto his lap , kissing down along my throat .

`` i just know you , abby , '' he growls , his hands running down the length of my body .

`` my god , you feel exactly the same .

the way your body moves , the way you respond to me ... '' `` i 've missed these hands , '' i groan softly , as emerson brushes his fingers against my tender inner thigh , runs his hands over the rise of my ass .

`` they 've missed you , '' he smiles devilishly , catching my lips in his once more .

i ca n't keep my hips from grinding against his as i straddle him on the couch .

our tongues glide against each other , twisting and caressing like i wish our limbs could , right this second .

my breath comes hard and fast as that throbbing between my legs grows more intense-more intent on getting what it wants .

i can already feel myself getting wet for him as he pulls me flush against him-lets me feel the telltale rise in his jeans .

`` no one 's ever known how to turn me on like you do , either , '' he says , his fierce blue eyes hard on my face .

`` i ca n't believe we 've gone so long without this , '' i breathe , taking his gorgeous , sculpted face in my hands .

`` we do n't have to wait any longer , '' he replies , turning his face to lay a kiss against my palm .

`` not if you do n't want to . ''

`` i do n't want to , '' i whisper , letting my sex rub ever-so-lightly against his stiff cock .

the feel of him pressing hard against me brings a sudden , untempered cry to my lips .

i just ca n't help myself as i feel the staggering bulk of him brush against my aching clit , even through layers of clothing .

the second my moan escapes into the air , my eyes go wide .

i clasp my hands over my mouth , but it 's too late .

riley 's bedroom door flies open , and i scramble off of emerson 's lap as she appears in the doorway in full action mode .

i 'm surprised she is n't carrying a frying pan or something .

`` are you ok ? ''

she demands , taking in the scene .

`` oh , sure ! ''

i laugh dementedly , leaping off of the couch .

`` we 're fine !

sorry ! ''

my best friend sees emerson 's flabbergasted , frustrated expression , not to mention the tousled state of my hair and clothes , and puts two and two together .

her game face is replaced by a knowing grin .

`` i thought i heard you scream , '' she says , feigning innocence .

`` i did n't mean to interrupt anything , or- '' `` it 's ok , '' i insist , shooting her a look that says , please shut the fuck up , dude .

`` is that emerson sawyer i see sitting on our couch ? ''

she goes on , crossing her arms with an amused smile on her lips .

`` that it is , '' emerson says , grinning gamely back at her as he stands .

he 's rolling with the interruption , just like that night when our post-dr. zhivago make-out session was interrupted by our parents-and the announcement of their doomed engagement .

he 's always been quick on his feet , my emerson .

my emerson ?

i ask myself , what 's this about my emerson , abby ?

`` man , it 's been forever ! ''

riley exclaims , `` you look great , man . ''

`` thanks .

you too , '' he replies , shoving his hands into his pockets .

the flush fades from his chiseled face .

good .

at least one of us is composed .

i probably look like a deer caught in the headlights .

who also happens to be in heat .

`` abby , did you offer our guest a drink ? ''

riley asks .

`` oh .

no , '' i mumble bashfully , `` i did n't .

emerson ? ''

`` sure , if you guys are having something , '' he says .

`` vodka tonics good for everyone ? ''

riley asks , making her way over to our home bar .

`` make mine a double , '' i mutter , trading glances with emerson .

he strides my way and leans close .

`` later , '' he whispers in my ear , `` just you wait . ''

`` are you trying to make me faint or something , sawyer ? ''

i whisper back .
