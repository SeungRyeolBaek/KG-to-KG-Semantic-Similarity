`` uh , oh , i should n't have said that , '' megan muttered under her breath .

`` my daddy ? ''

`` he 's at the hospital with mommy .

we 'll take you there in the morning , '' she replied .

that statement caused noah 's lip to tremble .

before he could start crying , pesh rose out of his chair .

`` let 's go look at all the pretty party decorations . ''

megan smiled as she watched pesh take noah around the room .

her heart warmed at his thoughtfulness .

she could n't believe there was ever a time when she fought her feelings for him .

there was n't a better man in the whole world , and the fact that he loved her was a true miracle .

by the time pesh returned , noah had fallen asleep .

he carefully sat back down beside her .

`` here , '' she suggested , taking off her glittering drape .

she wrapped the fabric over noah like a blanket .

`` did i mention how much i loved you in a sari ? ''

pesh questioned , with a wicked gleam in his eyes .

she glanced down to see the top had her boobs bulging out the front as well as the fact her stomach was now bared .

`` i 'll have to wear one more often for you . ''

`` i would love that . ''

when her phone beeped , she reached across the table and grabbed it .

`` oh my god ! ''

`` what ? ''

pesh asked .

`` that was aidan .

the baby is already here . ''

`` considering it 's a second baby , it is n't too surprising . ''

`` i need to tell my mom and aunts . ''

he nodded .

`` go ahead .

we 're fine . ''

megan smiled at noah sleeping soundly against pesh 's chest .

`` be right back . ''

she made her way over to her family 's table .

`` that was aidan .

caroline was just born . ''

a whoop went up around the table .

`` is emma okay ? ''

becky asked .

megan nodded .

`` he said mother and baby are doing great . ''

julia shook her head and smiled .

`` aidan with a daughter-now that 's going to be something to see . ''

they all laughed .

`` that 's so true , '' megan said .

becky glanced at the group .

`` why do n't we go see them ?

i mean , the hospital is n't too far from here . ''

angie nodded .

`` sounds good to me .

i 'd personally like to see aidan in action with his baby girl . ''

with a snort , megan added , `` i would have liked to have been in the delivery room when she was first born .

his expression then would have been priceless . ''

`` i bet he cried , '' liz said .

`` oh yeah , he bawled for sure , '' angie replied , with a grin .

as her aunts started gathering up their purses and telling their husbands where they were going , megan said , `` i want to go too . ''

before they could argue , she held up her hand .

`` it 's late .

the party is pretty much over , and there 's two more next week at some of pesh 's relatives ' houses .

besides , i want to see the newest fitzgerald baby girl . ''

her mother frowned .

`` are you sure ? ''

`` i 'm positive . ''

`` all right .

go tell pesh , and we 'll meet you out front . ''

she smiled as she went back to their table .

`` my mom and aunts are going to the hospital to see aidan and emma . ''

`` you want to go ? ''

her heart warmed at the fact that he already knew what she was feeling .

`` do you mind ? ''

he shook his head .

`` of course not .

can i go too or is this just a hen party thing for the women ? ''

she laughed .

`` yes , you can come . ''

pesh glanced down at noah .

`` he 's going to want to see his mother . ''

`` oh yes .

i do n't think we could go without him . ''

as pesh rose out of the chair , noah stirred but did n't wake up .

`` get aidan and emma 's keys out of my pocket . ''

she nodded and reached into his pants .

when she accidentally touched his penis through the fabric , he jumped .

`` sorry about that , '' she replied , as she pulled out the keys .

`` no problem , '' he muttered through gritted teeth .

they said a quick goodnight to pesh 's parents and other relatives who remained .

then they headed out to the lobby .

after giving the valet aidan 's keys , they waited for the suv to be brought around .

when she caught her reflection in the glass doors of the hotel , she gasped .

`` what 's wrong ? ''

pesh inquired .

`` the jewelry !

i ca n't go loaded down with this expensive stuff to the hospital ! ''

she cried .

she snatched off the earrings and then started working on the necklace .

`` i 'll run go give it to your mother . ''

`` if you insist , '' pesh replied .

she kicked off her heels so she could run easier .

the necklace and earrings weighed down her hands .
