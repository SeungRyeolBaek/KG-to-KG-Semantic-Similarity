aidan shook his head and stood up .

`` you need to be off your feet .

you said yourself you were n't feeling too well before we left . ''

emma shot him a murderous look .

`` thanks for saying that in front of pesh and megan . ''

aidan gave them a sheepish grin .

`` sorry guys .

i hope it does n't ruin your fabulous party knowing that emma , at nine months pregnant and some change , was n't feeling wonderful . ''

megan laughed while pesh shook his head .

`` emma , if you want to go on upstairs and lie down , we wo n't be hurt .

i remember how awful it feels being overdue , '' megan said .

`` no , i 'm fine .

i want to stay , '' emma replied .

when aidan motioned for her to have a seat , she shook her head .

`` i need to go to the restroom . ''

`` you want me to go check on noah ? ''

emma sighed .

`` i 'm sure he 's fine or the sitter would have texted me .

i 'm just being overprotective . ''

aidan gave her a quick kiss .

`` love you , sweetheart . ''

she smiled at him .

`` i love you , too . ''

after she headed through the crowd to the bathroom , aidan began telling pesh some wild story from work that had pesh doubled over with laughter .

when emma returned , she did n't sit back down .

instead , she swayed back and forth on her feet next to her chair .

`` aidan , '' she said in a strained voice .

megan could n't help noticing how emma had paled considerably since her trip to the bathroom just a few minutes before .

he held up his finger .

`` one second , babe .

i got ta finish telling pesh this story . ''

`` but my water broke . ''

without taking his eyes off pesh , aidan slid his glass of water over to her .

`` here take mine . ''

if the situation had n't been dire , megan would have laughed at how oblivious aidan was .

pesh leaned forward in his seat .

`` um , aidan , i think- '' he did n't get a chance to finish .

instead , water splashed against the side of aidan 's face .

he shot out of his chair before whirling around to emma .

`` what the hell , em ? ''

`` my .

water .

broke , '' she muttered through gritted teeth .

`` oh shit , '' he replied .

after tossing his napkin back on the table , he held up a hand .

`` okay , it 's fine .

no need to panic .

we 're not that far from the hospital- '' `` like twenty minutes , '' emma argued .

aidan 's hands came to her shoulders .

`` it 'll be fine , babe .

i promise . ''

emma huffed out a few frustrated breaths as she weighed his words .

then her grim expression softened .

`` okay . ''

aidan grinned as he turned back to pesh and megan .

`` i hate to cut and run , but it looks like baby caroline is a big attention whore who wants all the glory tonight . ''

megan rose out of her chair .

`` do n't you worry about it one bit .

since she 's a week overdue , i 'm going to let her have this one without accusing her of trying to steal the limelight . ''

`` can we do anything ? ''

pesh asked .

while aidan shook his head , emma said , `` just make sure noah is okay . ''

angie rose out of her chair .

`` i 'll go check on him right now . ''

emma smiled .

`` thanks . ''

aidan dug around in his pocket .

when he produced a set of keys , he tossed them at pesh .

`` since i came after work , em and i are in separate cars .

whoever has noah overnight will need our suv to get him to the hospital tomorrow . ''

pesh nodded as megan said , `` good thinking .

i 'm not sure if mom is taking him or becky . ''

at emma 's somewhat apprehensive look that there was n't a strict plan in place for noah , megan said , `` it 'll be fine .

i promise . ''

`` okay , '' she said , a little reluctantly .

sliding his arm around emma 's waist , aidan said , `` come on , sweetheart .

we need to go . ''

at the feel of pesh 's hand on her back , megan glanced up at him .

`` exciting night for them , eh ? ''

`` yes , it is . ''

`` how about letting me take you for another spin on the dance floor ? ''

`` i 'd love that . ''

as an indian love song flowed out from the speakers , megan wrapped her arms around pesh 's neck .

this time he did n't bother dancing more formally like he had in savannah .

instead , he wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her flush against him .

closing her eyes , she rested her head on his broad chest , loving the gentle beat of his heart beneath his shirt .

when the song finished , they did n't move .

they just waited for the next one .

thankfully , it was another slow one .

halfway through , she felt a tug on the bottom of her drape .
