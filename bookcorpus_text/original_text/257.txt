for a while , i scoped you out on facebook , myspace , checked in to see how you were doing .

but once you got to college , and it seemed like your whole life was just opening up in front of you ... i knew you 'd be ok .

i knew you did n't need me anymore . ''

`` that 's not true , '' i whisper , my eyes stinging with unexpected tears .

`` i did need you , emerson .

so much ... '' `` i needed you too , '' he replies , rubbing his thumb against my hand , `` but we could n't be in each others ' lives then .

not with everything that had happened .

but look .

we seem to have found a way back in again . ''

`` so it would seem , '' i smile softly .

`` i 've spent the past eight years wondering what i would say to you , if i ever saw you again , '' emerson murmurs , his voice dipping low .

i know that dip , know what it means .

between that and the gleam in his eye , his intentions are pretty clear .

and despite every ounce of logic i possess , i can feel myself responding to his lead .

`` what do you want to say , then ? ''

i ask , my own voice soft and husky .

my heart feels like a kick drum as emerson moves closer to me .

our sides brush against each other as he moves his hand up my arm , pulling me in .

`` it turns out , i do n't want to say anything , '' he says , his words gravelly and ardent .

his lips move ever closer to mine , and i can feel my mouth lifting to his , as if of its own accord .

emerson goes on , his mouth nearly on mine , `` i 'd rather show you ... '' `` hey emerson ! ''

someone says from across the room .

i jerk away from emerson as a trio of familiar faces make their way across the room .

i recognize the two men and woman as some of the young people manning the communal desk at bastian .

my new coworkers , as it were .

and they 've just happened upon me about to suck face with my superior .

i stare at emerson , my mind scrambling to figure out what my heart wants .

he just looks back at me with frustrated desire , forcing a smile as his colleagues come over .

`` how 's it going , bradley ? ''

emerson asks , as the stylish threesome comes to a stop before us , `` tyler , emily-do you guys all know abby ? ''

`` you 're the new recruit , right ? ''

the man called bradley asks .

he 's doing the whole trendy-pseudo-rustic look , full beard and all .

and from the barely-concealed amusement on his face , i know he 's hip to what was about to happen between me and emerson .

they all are .

`` that 's me , '' i say faintly .

looking up at them , then across the table at emerson , i feel like we 're back in our hometown diner-that night emerson 's lax bros nearly gave me a heart attack .

i feel the panic beginning to rise inside of me at the mere thought of it .

`` you guys mind if we join you ? ''

asks emily , the chic hipster with bright violet hair .

`` i was actually just going to head out , '' i say , grabbing my purse and rising quickly to my feet .

`` i 'll have to catch a drink with you guys some other time ! ''

`` abby , '' emerson says , his smile tightening .

`` you do n't have to go already- '' `` i really do , '' i shoot back firmly .

`` what about your drink ? ''

he presses , as our coworkers drink in the tense drama .

with my eyes locked on emerson , i raise my martini glass and knock back the rest , chugging the insanely expensive and delicious liquor just to spite him .

he holds my gaze , his expression hardening into that unreadable mask i know so well .

`` see you guys later , '' i say to emerson and our three flabbergasted coworkers .

`` you have a lovely evening . ''

without another word , i turn on my heel and dash out of the bar .

i 've barely made it back onto the busy street before the tears come .

i should have known that this-being alone with emerson-would be too much for me all at once .

there 's too much history there , too much pain , for some breezy birthday drinks to be possible .

i hurry back toward the subway , cursing myself for being such a damn idiot .

`` i 'd love to not make this running-after-you thing a habit , '' i hear emerson 's terse voice say from over my shoulder .

`` there 's an easy fix for that , '' i snap back , `` stop running after me . ''

i draw myself up short as emerson places his staggering , perfect body in my path .

`` i did n't mean to freak you out , '' he tells me , `` i should n't have pushed you .

it 's just ... i ca n't pretend that i do n't still want you , abby .

that i do n't still care- '' `` goddammit emerson , '' i exclaim , wrapping my arms around my waist , `` have n't you ever heard of subtlety ? ''
