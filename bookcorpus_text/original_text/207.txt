i 'd much rather be curled up at home with my sketch pad and a cup of tea .

but seeing that the damage is done , i suppose there 's nothing to do but try and have a good time .

`` here you go ladies , '' a burly junior boy says , sidling up to us with a red plastic cup in either hand .

`` first drink 's on me . ''

`` warm beer , now with extra roofies ? ''

riley says , cocking a perfect eyebrow at him .

`` we 're all set , champ , '' i tell the boy , producing a flask full of my dad 's very fine whiskey from my purse .

it 's not like he 's using it much , these days .

`` better luck next time . ''

`` what a couple of buzz kills , '' the kid grumbles , sulking away .

`` great party so far ri , '' i laugh sarcastically , unscrewing the top of the flask .

`` just remember , abby-in less than a year , we 'll never have to deal with high school boys again , '' she points out , accepting the flask as i pass it her way .

`` i ca n't wait , '' i say wistfully , `` i know you 're not supposed to wish away your youth or whatever , but the sooner high school can be over with , the better . ''

`` what ?

you 're not enjoying your glory days ? ''

riley asks with mock astonishment , gesturing toward our fellow partygoers .

i look around at the party unfolding all around us .

some rich kid 's parents are out of town , and the entire school has descended on their mcmansion to spend the night getting wasted , listening to someone 's crappy ipod playlist , and making questionable choices about who to sleep with .

i nearly step on two people going at it right in the foyer , writhing all over each other in a drunken tizzy .

with a wild yell , some kid tries to swing on the crystal chandelier , only to miss and fall flat on his face to onlookers ' uproarious laughter .

`` if these are our glory days , '' i say to riley , `` we 're in serious trouble . ''

`` come on , '' she laughs , slipping her fingers through mine , `` i 'm sure we can find a quieter corner somewhere .

there must be , like , a hundred rooms in this place . ''

i let riley tug me off through the party , ignoring the tipsy dudes who make lesbian jokes about us along the way .

as gorgeous as my best friend is , with her silky black curls , tanned skin , and amazing curves , i 've never been the least bit interested in `` experimenting '' with her .

we 've only ever loved each other as sisters .

but the fact that i 've never had a real boyfriend leads some people in my school to question whether i 'm into guys at all .

the short answer is , i 'm plenty into guys .

but finding one that 's worth the time of day at my connecticut high school has proven to be impossible .

well ... just about impossible , anyway .

the party is just a forest of legs and torsos from my vantage point .

at five foot three , i 'm what you might call `` vertically challenged '' .

being petite is great for hide-and-seek , but not so great for feeling like anything close to an adult .

or being treated like one .

but in a couple weeks ' time , the world will have no choice but to acknowledge my adulthood-at long last , i 'll finally be turning eighteen .

the only question that remains is how quickly i can get out of town and be on my own once i 'm officially a grown-up .

as riley and i climb the sweeping staircase and sidle into the master bedroom suite , we pass a passed out classmate who 's had his face graffitied with permanent marker penises .

yep .

adulthood ca n't come soon enough .

we poke our heads into the master bedroom , and i note with relief that it 's far quieter in this corner of the house .

maybe we can just hang out here and ride out this shit show in peace .

`` uh-oh , '' riley mutters , glancing down at me with a wicked glint in her eye .

`` look who 's here , abby . ''

i peer around my best friend , scanning the dozen or so people already hanging out in the master bedroom .

it only takes half a second for me to see who it is she 's talking about .

my solar plexus rocks on its axis as a very familiar set of blue eyes turns my way from across the room .

`` shit ! ''

i squeak , ducking back around riley 's taller form .

`` i did n't know he was going to be here ! ''

`` the entire school is here , abby , '' riley laughs , `` you could have guessed . ''

`` he 's supposed to be too cool for this sort of thing .

or whatever , '' i say , rolling my hazel eyes .

`` come on .

i do n't think he saw me .

let 's just go- '' `` hey , sis ! ''

a rough baritone calls from across the room .

`` what are you doing here ?

is n't it past your bedtime ? ''

i groan as a volley of chuckles goes up around the room , and turn to see emerson sawyer , my blue-eyed nightmare , striding toward me .
