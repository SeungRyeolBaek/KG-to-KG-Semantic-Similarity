what do you think ? ''

`` looks great , mom , '' i reply half-heartedly .

if she notices my downtrodden mood , she does n't mention it , she just sweeps me back into the kitchen to show me the extravagant meal she 's spent the day preparing .

when pierce comes home about half an hour later , he quickly enters his study , calling to us that he has to make a quick call .

my mom asks me to carry the roasted duck out on a silver tray , and i acquiesce , knowing i 'd feel too guilty to fake sick when she 's spent so much time on the food .

when i walk back into the kitchen , pierce is murmuring into my mom 's ear as she blushes , so i quickly back out again .

i hear nate enter through the front door , and he walks into the dining room just as i 'm leaning on the back of my chair .

`` hey , '' he says with a smile .

`` i was thinking about you- '' he breaks off as my mom and pierce walk in .

pierce brandishes a bottle of champagne and walks around filling up our crystal flutes .

i step back to give him a wide berth , and then we all sit down as he finishes filling up his own glass .

`` cheers , '' he says .

i avoid his eye contact as we all clink our glasses .

nate frowns at me slightly and i know he can tell there 's something up .

oh god , i ca n't even think about talking to him later tonight .

he can always tell when i 'm lying , so i do n't know what i 'm going to say .

`` brynn , did you messenger those envelopes like i asked ? ''

pierce says , turning to me .

`` hm ? ''

i ask , startled by his question .

`` the envelopes .

i wanted to double check because you 've seemed so distracted lately , and they 're quite important . ''

i frown at him .

what the hell ?

`` you did n't ask me to messenger anything today , pierce . ''

`` brynn , '' he sighs in a patronizing way , setting down his champagne glass .

`` you did n't ! ''

i reply , a little more defensively than i mean to .

i glance at nate and see him raising his eyebrows at me .

`` you know that i did .

and it 's not like this is the first time this has happened , '' pierce counters .

`` maybe we should- '' my mom breaks in .

`` wait , no , '' i say to her , holding up my hand .

`` i honestly do n't know what you 're talking about pierce . ''

`` well , this clearly is n't the time to discuss it , but since you 're pressing me , i 've heard from some of your immediate superiors that you have n't been very responsible . ''

`` what ?

like who ?

when ? ''

`` obviously i ca n't give you exact dates , and i need to protect their anonymity- '' `` wow .

wow , '' i snap , tossing down my napkin .

`` you are just making all this up , are n't you ? ''

`` brynn , calm down , '' nate murmurs from across the table .

`` calm down ?

seriously ?

he 's lying ! ''

`` he has no reason to- '' nate argues .

`` he damn well does .

he called me into his office today and unzipped my dress , and i told him to back off , and now he 's pissed . ''

`` you know that 's because i was worried about those bruises on your neck , brynn .

do n't get hysterical . ''

`` you 're a liar , '' i whisper .

he slams his hand down on the table , causing me to jump .

`` i will not be spoken to that way in my own house ! ''

i glance back and forth at my mom and nate , speechless .

are they really just going to sit there staring at me ?

i stand up so abruptly that my chair almost falls over backward .

i ca n't take being surrounded by this bullshit anymore .

i walk quickly around the table and then out the front door , clenching my fists to try to contain my anger until i 'm outside .

as i close the door behind me , i pick up my pace , walking straight down the driveway and out of the gates .

the woods rise up quiet and dark around me as tears of frustration and humiliation begin to stream down my face .

i do n't know where i 'm going-i just need to get away from that house .

`` hey !

wait ! ''

i hear a woman 's voice call out behind me , but i keep walking .

`` you 're brynn , right ? ''

i freeze and take a deep breath before turning around .

`` look , if you 're a reporter or something , i 'm really not in the mood . ''

i can just see her blonde hair reflect the moonlight as she takes a couple steps closer .

`` i 'm not a reporter .

i 'm nate 's mom , eileen . ''

chapter twenty-five `` are ... are you alright ? ''

she asks , taking another step toward me .

`` i 'm , i 'm just- '' i break off as a sob escapes my lips .
