she was too busy digging her cell phone out of her purse and dialing the phone number rais had given to her .

unfortunately , the call went to his voice mail and she had to ignore the shiver of excitement that tore through her when she heard his deep voice telling her to leave a message .

`` rais , i refuse to be treated like this ! ''

she said as her message .

`` i 'm sending them back and please do n't ever do that again ! ''

she ended the call and tried to hold back the tears .

she packed up the boxes then picked them both up as well as her purse .

she stormed out of the office with the dresses in her arms telling lenora that she was going out for lunch .

she was driving out of the parking garage when his call came back so she pulled over and took the call .

`` what 's wrong , beautiful ? ''

he asked softly .

she squeezed her eyes closed as the humiliation washed over her .

`` why did you do this ? ''

she asked , her voice sounding funny even to her ears .

`` do what , love ? ''

she ignored the insincere endearment and focused on trying to see through the tears .

`` the dresses , rais !

why did you buy me the dresses ? ''

`` ah , '' he replied , finally understanding .

`` i knew that you would be with me for the two events this weekend and i did n't want you to have to worry about spending your money on dresses when you are helping me .

was it so wrong to buy something beautiful for you ? ''

`` yes ! ''

she stated emphatically .

`` i do n't understand , rachel .

but let 's talk about it this weekend , okay ?

i have to go to another meeting . ''

`` that 's fine but i 'll be wearing my own clothes . ''

he paused slightly with her declaration .

`` i would love to see you in the dresses i sent you .

i picked them out myself . ''

that hurt and she squeezed her eyes shut , uncaring that her mascara would probably be a mess after this conversation .

`` i 'm not for sale , rais , '' she said softly .

`` i never thought you were , rachel . ''

`` you ca n't buy me with expensive dresses . ''

`` i was n't trying to , honey .

i just thought you would look pretty in those and i wanted to do something nice for you . ''

he paused to let that sink in before he said , `` could you look at it slightly differently ?

i was thinking about you and wanted to show you .

i chose those dresses out of several other options because i thought they were something you would like and would look lovely on you . ''

put that way , it did n't sound so bad .

it was even a nice sentiment .

`` dammit rais ! ''

he laughed softly .

`` does that mean you 're going to keep the dresses ? ''

`` not necessarily . ''

`` well , that 's at least an improvement from sixty seconds ago , '' he replied dryly .

`` you ca n't do this kind of stuff . ''

`` why not ?

it 's my money and i want to spend it on you .

what 's the problem ? ''

she took a deep breath and let it out slowly .

`` because it 's just not fair .

i ca n't do anything along these lines and i feel ... .like i owe you now . ''

`` do n't even think like that , rachel .

you do n't owe me anything .

i just wanted you to know that i think you 're as beautiful as the dresses .

more so actually . ''

she dropped her head on the steering wheel .

`` you 're incorrigible . ''

`` i know .

so will you wear them this weekend ? ''

`` no . ''

`` why not ? ''

`` because they cost too much . ''

`` not for me , '' he came back .

she was silent for a long moment while she tried to come up with a response .

`` rais ... '' she started to say but he interrupted her .

`` rachel , let 's talk about this when i can see your face .

i would love to see you in those dresses , or more specifically , i would love to take you out of those dresses , slowly and with a great attention to detail .

but if you have something else you would like me to take off of you , i 'm more than willing to compromise . ''

she was about to contradict him before he ended in that manner .

it was so typical of him that she could n't help but laugh despite her frustration with his high handed manner .

`` you 're incorrigible , '' she came back .

`` yes , but you want me . ''

she laughed again and wiped her eyes .

`` i 'm promising nothing . ''

`` promise me that you 'll spend the weekend with me again . ''

`` no .

you deserve to wait and wonder after this stunt . ''

`` why is giving you a nice dress or two a stunt ? ''

she sighed and rolled her eyes at his obtuseness .

`` first of all , because you delivered those dresses to my office and now everyone is gossiping about me , probably assuming that i 'm sleeping with a client . ''
