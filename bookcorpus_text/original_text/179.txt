he pulls out a second time , and as he returns , my lips part in surprise at my body 's response .

i think he can sense that i 'm starting to warm to the sensation , because he begins to move a little faster .

`` oh , nate , that feels ... it feels ... '' i trail off .

there are no words .

i simply wrap my legs around his back and dig my hands into his hair as he moves against me , as exquisite waves flow through my body .

his lips find mine again , kissing me with a passion that matches the faster pace he 's setting .

i feel an orgasm begin to build inside me .

i 've had orgasms before , including an amazing one with nate , but this one feels different .

it 's so powerful that it scares me .

i bear down against it , holding my breath to keep it at bay .

but everything nate is doing is working against me .

i feel his hands move to my breasts , and my back arches against the heat of his palms .

he kisses my neck as i bend to him , and his cock finds new and untouched nerve endings to drive me to the edge .

`` oh , nate , it 's too much ... '' i breathe , opening my eyes .

`` i do n't know if i can . ''

he slows down for a moment .

`` brynn , you 're safe with me , '' he murmurs , his dark eyes finding mine , tenderness and passion mixed in them .

`` you just have to let go .

let go with me . ''

he begins to speed up , but his eyes do n't leave mine .

i follow his advice , trying to let the orgasm take me rather than trying to control it .

`` yes , yes , brynn , '' he grunts as my eyes roll back in my head .

he slams his hips into me now , driving his cock inside me .

i hear myself begin to moan as though i 'm outside of my own body .

his torso lifts off of me and he thrusts in a little deeper .

the slightly new angle is enough to push me right over the edge .

i completely lose control , my body arching with spasms of its own accord .

i can vaguely feel him bucking on top of me , his sweat dripping down onto my skin .

he collapses on top of me and i tuck my face into his neck .

his body weight feels exactly right on top of me .

i feel like i could stay like this forever .

chapter twenty-one i wake up to soft kisses on my cheek .

my eyes flutter open in surprise .

`` mmm ? ''

i murmur incoherently .

`` you passed out , '' i hear nate whisper back .

i realize he 's still on top of me-and inside me .

`` oh , sorry , '' i smile , blushing a bit .

`` i hope i did n't make too much noise . ''

he grins .

`` well , i think if they 'd heard anything , we would have known about it by now . ''

`` how long was i asleep for ? ''

`` just twenty minutes or so .

i was worried i was going to crush you . ''

he kisses my lips and then reaches down .

i watch him hold the base of the condom as he pulls out of me .

the sensation of him leaving my body is jarring , and i lay still for another minute , absorbing it , as he walks to the bathroom .

he comes back with a couple of wet tissues and i sit up to take them from him .

`` it 's ok , '' he says .

`` lie back . ''

i obey , and feel him carefully wiping up the inside of my thigh , and then begin to giggle .

he stops and looks at me with a confused frown .

`` i 'm sorry , i just-i never thought i 'd be in this position with nate thornhill ! ''

i explain .

he shakes his head with a bemused grin as i continue to giggle .

`` you bled a little , but it did n't get on the comforter .

that would have been tough to explain , '' he says as he returns to the bathroom .

`` i could have just said i had my period , '' i point out as i pull my comforter back and crawl underneath the sheets .

`` oh , i guess that 's true , '' he says , coming back and sliding into bed next to me .

`` i ca n't believe i 'm not a virgin anymore , '' i grin as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me close .

`` i was beginning to think it would never happen . ''

`` so ... you liked it ? ''

he asks , running his fingers up and down my arm .

i 'm shocked to feel my body respond hungrily , as though i have n't just had a mind-blowing orgasm twenty minutes ago .

`` are you kidding me ? ''

i ask , raising my eyebrows at him .

`` what about me ?

was i ... '' `` you were excellent , '' he assures me .

`` it was different , though . ''

`` different , how ? ''

i ask , frowning .

he shrugs .

`` i usually do n't really know the girls i sleep with .

or have feelings for them .
