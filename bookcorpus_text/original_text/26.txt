`` nope .

not a chance . ''

pesh shoved his hands into his lab coat .

`` i have asked megan to accompany me on a date , but at this point , we are at a stalemate .

but , i am not planning on giving up anytime soon .

does that satisfy your inquisition ? ''

aidan laughed , but then his brows furrowed .

`` what do you mean ?

you two looked pretty cozy and comfortable together when we walked up . ''

with a regretful shake of his head , pesh replied , `` she does n't want to date me . ''

`` i call bullshit .

i may have been bonked in the head , but no one could deny the way she was looking at you .

maybe if you- '' although it was against his character , he let his anger override his better judgment .

`` she wants me for sex but not for a relationship , okay ? ''

aidan 's mouth gaped open .

`` you mean , she 's acting like ... a dude ? ''

`` if you mean that she has pretty much refused to go to dinner with me or any other honorable event that a man and woman can partake in on a date , and instead , she would rather pursue a strictly physical relationship , then the answer is yes . ''

`` my god , it 's like she 's turned into the old me , '' aidan muttered .

he ran his hand over his face before he looked at pesh again .

`` i 'm so sorry . ''

with a shrug , pesh replied , `` she 's still very young .

i suppose in her eyes , she 's been deprived of fun the last two years .

this is a way for her to make up for that .

regardless if we agree or understand it . ''

`` well , i still call bullshit on the whole thing . ''

he gave pesh a long , hard stare .

`` you have to keep trying , no matter what . ''

`` i did n't say i was giving up , did i ? ''

`` no , but i know from personal experience how hard it is to keep trying when it feels like you are n't winning . ''

`` what occurred with you and emma is totally different than with megan and me . ''

`` you still have to try . ''

aidan hopped off the examining table and wobbled for a moment on unsteady legs .

`` megan has been hurt before , and i do n't think she really knows what it is to be loved .

not deeply where her needs were considered .

hell , she was only twenty-three when she got knocked up .

i want her to find someone who will cherish her , man .

i want my girl cared for . ''

he patted pesh 's shoulder .

`` i think that someone could be you . ''

`` we 'll see . ''

when aidan started to argue , pesh shook his head .

`` time to see about your head . ''

`` whatever , '' aidan mumbled .

when pesh opened the door for aidan , emma and megan stared expectantly at them .

`` so what 's the verdict ? ''

megan asked .

`` i think he 's going to be just fine , but to be on the safe side , i 've ordered him a ct scan . ''

emma 's eyes widened in fear .

`` you think he has some brain injury from the fall ? ''

she asked in a panicky voice .

pesh smiled to try and put her at ease .

`` i do n't think there 's anything wrong besides a slight bump on the head , but i want to make sure there is nothing wrong with him . ''

`` okay then , '' emma replied .

an orderly appeared with a wheelchair to escort aidan to his scan .

before he sat down , aidan leaned over to kiss emma .

`` i 'm fine , babe .

stop worrying .

it is n't good for you or the baby . ''

she gave him a weak smile .

`` i 'll try hard not to . ''

he winked at her before collapsing down in the wheelchair .

`` nothing can keep me down-you should know that by now . ''

megan snorted .

`` at least we know the bump did n't do anything to your ego . ''

`` of course not , '' emma agreed .

kristi poked her head out of one of the examining rooms .

`` dr. nadeen , i need you . ''

he nodded before turning to megan .

`` why do n't you show emma to one of the family waiting rooms ? ''

`` sure , '' megan replied .

emma reached up to hug him .

`` thanks for taking care of aidan . ''

`` it was my pleasure . ''

he gave them a final wave before disappearing into the waiting patient 's room .

but after talking to aidan , he definitely had a little more determined bounce in his step .

chapter nine two days later when megan came in for a later shift , she found the emergency room in a state of chaos .

`` whoa , what happened ? ''

she asked kristi , after she 'd clocked in and put away her things .

kristi rolled her eyes .

`` every month or so we seem to have a day where everything is madness from start to finish .

you can never anticipate it-you kinda just have to go with the flow . ''

she grinned at megan .
