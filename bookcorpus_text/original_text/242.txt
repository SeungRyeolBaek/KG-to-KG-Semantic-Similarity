but the thing is , i do n't need to tell him .

just laying here beside me , it 's clear that he already knows .

chapter nine i arrange my blonde hair into a hasty up-do , trying to keep from crying .

i 've been on the verge of tears since about five minutes after i woke up this morning-when i remembered what today is .

our parents ' wedding day .

the day that emerson and i become step siblings .

i 've changed into my maid of honor dress , a lavender sheath , and tried my best to apply fancy makeup .

we have to head right to the church this morning , just like we promised , and we 're already getting kind of a late start .

i lock eyes with myself in the mirror , see the tears shining there .

`` stop it , '' i whisper , `` you ca n't cry now .

you always knew this was coming . ''

but even though emerson and i had our one night together knowing full well that it would be our last , it does n't make it hurt any less .

stepping out into the hotel bedroom , i feel my heart clench painfully as emerson turns to face me across the space .

he 's wearing a simple gray suit , but it might as well be a tux for how good it looks on him .

his hair is pushed away from his face , though the signature stubble i love so much is still in place .

his blue eyes are shining with remorse for what 's about to happen and elation at what passed between us last night .

`` you look beautiful , '' he says , his voice ragged with conflicting emotion .

`` thank you , '' i say softly , `` you look amazing , too . ''

`` here , '' he says , moving to the motel mini-fridge .

he opens it up and takes out a corsage in its little container .

it 's a small sprig of lilac tied with an ivory ribbon .

`` what is this , prom ? ''

i laugh tearfully , as emerson eases the band of the corsage up over my wrist .

`` just as miserable as prom , probably , '' he grins wistfully , lacing my fingers through his .

`` well , do n't go overboard , '' i joke , stepping toward him .

without preamble , he pulls me into a tight embrace , pressing his lips ardently to mine .

i take his face in my hands , kissing him hard .

we both know that this is the last kiss we 'll ever share .

it 's closed-lipped , almost sacred .

and i 'll never forget it .

`` i do n't know how just yet , '' emerson murmurs , running his hands down my arms , `` but it 's going to be ok , abby .

we 're gon na make it through this . ''

`` i 'll have to take your word for it , '' i say , shaking my head , `` because right now , i ca n't see how i 'm ever going to feel alright again . ''

`` at least we 'll still be in each others ' lives , '' emerson says , searching for a silver lining .

`` even if it wo n't be ... how we 'd prefer . ''

`` i hope you know that i 'll never stop wondering what might have happened between us , '' i whisper , `` you know .

if only ... '' `` i know , '' he says softly , kissing me on the forehead , `` me too , abby . ''

knowing that we wo n't be able to utter another word without breaking into tears , we silently gather our things .

we stand in the threshold together , looking back at the motel room .

i 'm not sure that i 'll ever be as happy again as i have been here .

as emerson closes the door behind us , it feels like something is being entombed here-some part of me that is lost forever .

i sink into the passenger seat of the chevy and stare out the window as we set off on the long drive back to our home town .

hopefully , by the time we get there , i 'll find it in my heart to fake a smile or two for my father 's wedding day .

things are already well underway at our home by the time we pull up .

my dad is waiting on the front steps , looking tense .

i recognize my grandparents ' car , and another that must belong to the justice of the peace , in the driveway .

`` there you two are ! ''

my dad cries , beckoning us forward .

`` come in , come in .

frank and gillian are waiting to see you . ''

that 's why he looks tense .

he and my grandparents are already sure to be butting heads .

i give dad a quick kiss on the cheek as i pass .

`` you look nice , daddy , '' i tell him , trying to be chipper .

`` you too , sweetie , '' he replies distractedly .

a pang of sadness twists my core at our clipped address .

he 's taking so much away from me today , more than he could ever know , and for what ?

a shadow of the relationship we used to have ?

i force myself not to think of it as i hurry toward the kitchen with emerson in tow .

stepping inside , i spot my grandparents huddled over the counter .
