i ca n't remember the last time i got off without my handy dandy vibrator .

it 's been ages since i 've hooked up with anyone , and the intensity of the pleasure emerson is bestowing on me is almost too much to bear .

almost .

`` i 've been dreaming of this for so long , '' i sigh , letting my head fall back against the couch cushions .

`` you have no idea , emerson ... '' `` oh , i think i do , '' he chuckles , pressing his hips against me , letting me feel that staggering length .

`` is that the secret you were going to trade me for ? ''

`` w-what ? ''

i stammer , my eyes springing open .

`` you know .

a secret for a secret .

like we said , '' emerson clarifies , propping himself up on his forearms .

`` oh , '' i say softly , feeling the wonderful peace this evening has brought slipping away as the moment of my big reveal approaches .

`` um .

no , i- '' `` shit , '' he mutters , brushing a lock of hair away from my face , `` i 'm sorry .

i 'm totally killing the mood , here .

i ca n't be trusted not to fuck up something as awesome as this . ''

`` you have n't fucked anything up , '' i insist , but it 's too late .

i can already see his expression darkening .

i need to backpedal , right things before it 's too late .

deep dark secrets can wait for a spell .

i need to show him that we 're on the same page .

and like emerson says , better to show than tell .

without a word , i reach for his belt buckle , whipping it open with a metallic clank .

emerson 's eyes go wide as i slowly ease down the zipper of his jeans .

i guide him onto his back , climbing on top of him as i work to release his member from his jeans .

his hardness strains against the thick denim , ready to burst through- we both sit bolt upright as the sound of keys in the front door lock ring through the empty house .

giddy giggles sound from beyond the door as emerson and i look at each other in abject horror .

no more playing house for us .

deb and dad are home .

`` shit , '' emerson fumes , buckling in his staggering erection and covering his lap with a throw pillow .

`` fucking shit . ''

`` it 's ok .

they 'll never know , '' i assure him , smoothing down my hair .

`` how would they ever even guess , right ?

i 'll still be right down the hall , you know .

this is n't over . ''

we trade wary smiles as the front door bursts open .

if i did n't know any better , i 'd say that our parents are absolutely trashed .

my dad all but carries deb over the threshold , humming some sort of ridiculous-vaguely familiar-marching tune .

but taking a closer look , it 's plain to see that they 're just excited , not drunk at all .

thank god for that .

a two-for-one relapse is not what we need right now .

`` abby !

emerson ! ''

deb squeals , kicking her high-heeled feet in the air as dad spins her around the foyer .

`` i 'm so glad you 're both here ! ''

`` you seem ... glad , '' emerson says , his brow furrowed as he takes in the sight of our giggling parents .

`` what 's , uh ... what 's going on with you two ? ''

`` did you win the lottery or something ? ''

i wager a guess , trying not to think of what would have happened had they come home just a few seconds earlier .

`` we did win the lottery , in a way , '' my dad beams , setting deb down at last .

emerson and i trade baffled looks , overwhelmed by our parents ' behavior , and the bizarre turn this evening has taken .

between our mutual confessions and whatever 's going on with dad and deb , i , for one , ca n't seem to get my bearings .

`` you tell them the good news , baby , '' my dad urges deb , wrapping an arm around her slender waist .

`` ok honey bear , '' she squeals , bouncing on the balls of her feet .

`` abby , emerson .

bob and i ... well .

let 's just say we finally figured out what to get you guys for your birthdays . ''

`` and what 's ... that ? ''

emerson asks cautiously .

in answer , deb simply holds her left hand up for us to take a gander at .

for a split second , i 'm totally at a loss .

that is , before i catch the sparkly glimmer shining off her ring finger .

there on her hand is a rock the size of rhode island .

an engagement ring , by the looks of it .

the implications of her new accessory wallop me as i sit beside emerson , staring in horrified silence .

deb 's wearing an engagement ring .

`` we 're going to get you each a brand new sibling !

we 'll be one big , happy family at last ! ''

she cries ecstatically .

`` what the fuck are you talking about ? ''

emerson says , springing to his feet .

safe to say any lingering evidence of our blissful excitement is long gone .
