he strolls out of the kitchen , pausing for half a second to snatch a bag of chips out of the cupboard .

deb is so pissed off at his behavior that she and my dad do n't even try to stop me as i hurry off after emerson .

`` hey , '' i call to him , taking the stairs two at a time to catch up .

`` emerson , wait . ''

`` what .

did i steal your afternoon snack ? ''

he grins over his shoulder , holding the chips up over my head .

his favorite game .

`` if you can grab 'em you can have 'em ! ''

`` yeah , no .

i 'm not interested in your chips , '' i say , standing before him on the landing .

`` i just wanted to know if we 're on speaking terms again now or what . ''

`` what do you mean , sis ? ''

he asks , ripping open the bag and popping a chip into his mouth .

this boy can even making chewing sexy .

goddamn him .

`` i mean ... are you done giving me the cold shoulder ? ''

i press him .

`` you 've been avoiding me since that party the other night .

when we- '' `` whoa , whoa , '' emerson chuckles .

`` you are way paranoid .

i have n't been avoiding you .

i just have n't noticed you .

there 's been other shit going on .

and you 're pretty easy to miss . ''

`` bullshit , '' i snap , taking a step toward him .

`` i know you 've been going out of your way not to see me ever since that stupid game in the closet .

something ... happened between us , and- '' `` i do n't know what you 're talking about , '' he says , the joking laughter fading from his voice .

`` but i do know that i do n't want to hear another word about it out of you .

ok ? ''

`` you ca n't just pretend that nothing happened ! ''

i cry out , exasperated .

`` keep your voice down , '' he growls , glancing down at the kitchen where our parents are still talking in hushed tones .

`` i wo n't .

not unless we can have a real conversation about this , '' i say at full volume , crossing my arms .

`` you owe me that , at least . ''

`` you are so fucking impossible , '' he says , shoving a hand through his chestnut hair .

`` ok. fine .

you wan na take a drive or something ?

will that shut you up ? ''

despite the context of his offer , my stomach still does a thrilled somersault at the idea of being alone with him .

`` sure , '' i say , `` let 's hit the road .

bro . ''

`` i hope you know i 'm just using you as an excuse to get out of this house again , '' he grumbles , dropping the chips onto the floor and storming off down the stairs .

i follow right behind him , wondering whether or not he 's fucking with me .

at this moment , it does n't much matter .

i 'm just happy that he 's speaking to me again at all .

you 're just pathetic , i berate myself silently .

berating myself is something i 'm pretty great at-i have a lot practice .

`` are you leaving again already ? ''

deb cries from the kitchen as we try to make our exit .

`` you just got home ! ''

`` yes mother , '' emerson sighs , in his most over-the-top cordial voice .

`` abigail and i are going to take a spin around town .

take in some fresh air .

cheerio ! ''

`` oh .

well .

good .

you guys are spending some time together , '' deb says uncertainly .

`` um .

be back ... sometime ? ''

`` will do ! ''

emerson says , tipping an imaginary hat to our parents .

i step out the door after him , shaking my head in amused befuddlement .

`` and i 'm the weirdo , right ? ''

i laugh .

`` have n't you figured it out yet , sis ? ''

he says , striding over to the beat up chevy parked in the driveway .

`` we 're both weirdoes , you and me .

get in the car . ''

i trundle into the front seat , trying not to gawk as i settle in .

i 've never been allowed in emerson 's car before .

true , he and his mother have only been living with us for a few weeks .

but still .

being admitted into this `` sacred vessel '' of his feels pretty significant .

it 's all i can do to keep myself from caressing the worn out leather seats , the dusty dashboard , as if this car were a shrine to the boy i 'm crazy for .

`` so .

what kind of shit do big brothers do with their little sisters ? ''

he asks , rolling down his window and lighting up a smoke .

`` want me to take you to the playground or something ? ''

`` no .

but you could bum me a cigarette , to begin with , '' i say lightly .

`` you do n't smoke , '' emerson scoffs , looking over at me sharply .

`` not anymore .

but i did , '' i inform him .

`` no fucking way , '' he says , narrowing his eyes .
