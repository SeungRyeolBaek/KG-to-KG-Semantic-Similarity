there 's another long pause , and i begin to feel uneasy .

`` it 's eileen ... nate 's mom . ''

i almost drop the phone in surprise .

`` oh , um , i don't- '' `` wait !

please , please do n't hang up .

i just saw the news , and thought that nate might be willing to talk to me now . ''

`` i do n't understand . ''

`` because he 'll know the truth about pierce , and then maybe he wo n't believe whatever he says about me . ''

`` i 'm sorry , i do n't think i should be in the middle of this . ''

whatever it is .

`` please , please ... '' i hear her gasp and the clear sound of crying .

`` i have n't talked to nate in so long ... he 's my son , he 's my son . ''

`` but you chose to leave him ... '' `` is that what pierce told you ? ''

`` no , nate . ''

`` he heard it from pierce .

i left pierce because he was cheating on me .

but pierce is used to having everything his own way , and he was furious .

he was the one with the money , i came into the marriage with nothing , and signed a pre-nup .

i mean , i barely even looked at the thing at the time-i thought we 'd be together forever .

he had an expensive lawyer and managed to get full custody in the divorce .

i never had a chance .

i 've been trying to get in touch with nate for years to tell him the truth ... i left pierce , not nate .

i would never leave my son .

i never would have divorced pierce , even though he was cheating on me , if i had known i 'd never see my son again .

i thought after seeing this woman on tv , maybe he 'd believe me ... '' she dissolves into sobs .

`` eileen , eileen , it 's ok , '' i whisper , feeling sick .

something about what she 's telling me rings true .

i can feel it in my gut .

`` i want to help you , but ... nate , he 's really touchy about his father .

i do n't know what i can do . ''

`` i know , and i 'm sorry to put this on you .

i call the house now and then trying to get nate , and i was just hoping that he would pick up tonight and not hang up on me . ''

a sound behind me makes me fly around .

pierce is standing in the doorway to the dining room .

`` everything ok ? ''

he asks .

`` yep , everything 's fine , pierce , '' i reply so that eileen can hear me .

`` just take down my number , alright ? ''

eileen says quietly .

`` please , just tell him what i said . ''

i write the number down on a small notepad on the counter , conscious that pierce is watching me .

`` got it , thanks .

talk to you later , '' i say , and hang up .

`` not a reporter , i hope , '' pierce says with a sad smile .

`` no , just a friend , '' i reply as nonchalantly as possible , and rip the paper off the pad and stuff it in my pocket .

`` god , this has been the longest day of my life , '' he says with a sigh , running his fingers through his hair .

`` i hope you and your mom do n't get dragged into anything .

there might be some reporters hanging out by the gate tomorrow .

probably best to just avoid them . ''

`` sure , no problem . ''

he looks so tired , and i find myself quickly feeling sorry for him .

he seems so genuine right now that it 's hard to believe what eileen and this other woman are saying about him .

the man in front of me paints such a different picture .

`` on the other hand , though , i 'm glad that you and your mom are here right now .

maybe it 's selfish of me .

but i do n't think i 'd make it through all this without her .

she 's really brought light back into my life . ''

`` she 's ... yeah , she 's great , '' i reply awkwardly .

`` are you having a good time at the internship ?

not too much busy work , i hope . ''

`` no , not at all , pierce .

it 's wonderful , thank you . ''

he nods .

`` well , i better get back to work .

you 'd think i 'd have gotten a lot done , considering how long i 've been in there , but i 've just been staring at the wall . ''

`` oh , well , i 'll see you tomorrow then . ''

`` 'night . ''

`` goodnight . ''

i walk back upstairs with the phone number burning a hole in my pocket .

it 's amazing to me that i 've gone from being almost sure that pierce is lying , to feeling like i 've betrayed his trust in the span of one short conversation with him .

is he telling the truth , or does he just possess a consummate politician 's ability to spin the story for himself ?

i get ready for bed slowly , my mind wandering uncontrollably .
