`` you are sleeping with a client , '' he came back .

`` i have slept with a client , but that might not ever happen again . ''

his laugh was deep and sexy and she could just picture him leaning back against a big , leather chair like the one in his office at the main house , his feet propped up on his desk as he smiled that handsome smile of his that never failed to make her stomach quiver in anticipation .

`` i 'd like to see you try and resist me now that you know what an incredible lover i am . ''

that comment caused her amusement to dissipate .

it reminded her that this man had a great deal of experience and she hated the thought of him with other women .

especially the women she 'd seen him with in the past because they all looked like her .

`` let 's talk this weekend , '' she said , all humor gone from her tone .

`` that sounds ominous .

what just happened rachel ? ''

he asked , much more alert .

she sighed and shook her head .

`` like you said , it 's hard to talk when you 're thousands of miles away , '' she replied .

he sighed as well .

`` okay .

i 'll get there as soon as i can .

but next weekend , we do n't have any events , right ? ''

`` you have n't scheduled anything , '' she replied cautiously .

`` did you want something on the calendar ? ''

she felt herself tensing , worried that she would n't see him if he did n't have a social obligation here .

that did n't sit well with her , even though she 'd just been upset about him and the women he had been with in the past , and those he most likely would be with in the future .

`` i was thinking that maybe you could come out to visit me this time around .

i would love to show you my home . ''

she laughed .

`` you mean your palace ? ''

`` whatever you want to call it .

i only occupy a portion of the building in which i work .

there 's more than a residence here . ''

`` but you 're the ruler so most of it is reserved for your personal use , is n't it ? ''

he hesitated .

`` why do n't you come out next weekend and i can show you everything . ''

she thought about it for a moment , biting her lip nervously .

`` rais ... '' `` do n't say no .

just think about it .

we 'll add it to the numerous other topics we need to discuss this weekend , okay ? ''

she released her lip and stared up at the roof of her car .

this was a painfully complicated relationship .

`` okay .

i 'll see you friday . ''

`` i 'll be there as soon as i can . ''

`` okay .

i lo ... . '' she started to say something , then stopped herself , shocked at what she was about to say .

`` see you soon . ''

she pressed the end button quickly , not sure if he 'd caught her comment .

she stared at her phone , wanting to text him and tell him that she had n't been about to say 'love ' but she did n't want to get into that .

a moment later , she received a text from him .

all it said was , 'back at you ' .

what did that mean ?

what was coming back to her ?

was he teasing her about her almost 'love ' comment or just about seeing her soon ?

her head fell back against the head rest again and she took a deep , calming breath .

back up in her office , she sat down behind her desk and stared at all of her sticky notes .

how was she supposed to focus when she knew she had sixteen thousand dollars worth of clothes in her car ?

she did n't have time to drive to her apartment and be back in time .

she looked around , feeling as if the office were different somehow .

was it just because of her phone call with rais ?

had his voice completely altered her perception of her reality ?

she was n't sure , but she had things to do , vendors to schedule and confirm .

she did n't have time to dwell on her life right now .

`` i hear someone has had a very interesting morning , '' derrick commented as he strolled into her office .

he looked around and noticed the small space with the older chairs .

`` dear , since you have our biggest client , it seems as if you should also have a bigger office . ''

rachel swallowed uncomfortably .

she did n't feel as if she 'd earned this promotion since she 'd known rais all her life .

`` i think i should be honest with you .

rais is a personal friend of my father 's , '' she confessed .

`` that 's why i have these parties . ''

derrick waited another moment , then shrugged .

`` and ? ''

rachel leaned forward , confused by his calm demeanor .

`` and , i have n't earned a bigger office , derrick .

i 'm not as experienced and i feel as if i 've cheated . ''

he laughed and shook his head .

`` dear , this business is all about making connections .

do n't worry at all that you had a connection through your father .
