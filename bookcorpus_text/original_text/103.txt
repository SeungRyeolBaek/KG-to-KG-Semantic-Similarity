cradling maya in his arms , pesh joined emma at the stove .

`` something sure smells good . ''

`` thank you .

it 's megan 's favorite chicken casserole .

then there 's broccoli and cheese casserole , green beans , and some cornbread , extra crispy on the edges just like megan loves it . ''

the corners of her mouth turned down in a frown .

`` i 'm sorry it 's not indian food . ''

he grinned .

`` i would have been very surprised if it had been considering how much you did n't appreciate it many years ago . ''

patrick nodded in agreement .

`` that 's quite a spread you 've fixed for us . ''

emma smiled .

`` i was happy to do it . ''

`` are you feeling all right ? ''

pesh asked , motioning to her expanding belly .

emma patted her bump lovingly before responding .

`` i think i 've felt the best this pregnancy out of all the others .

you would think with a three and two-year-old , i would be exhausted all the time , but it 's amazing how good i 've felt . ''

patrick gave a beaming smile .

`` i ca n't tell you how thrilled i am to be having yet another grandson to carry on the family name . ''

with a wink , he added , `` not to mention the fact he 's been given fine irish names . ''

aidan and emma had found out the sex of their third , and final child , the week before .

they had decided on the name connor liam , which was a double representation of irish names .

while emma 's best friend , connor , was thrilled at the namesake , he also wanted them to call the baby connor as well .

in the end , it would be liam fitzgerald joining the rest of the crew in four and a half months .

`` and is aidan still feeling okay ? ''

pesh asked .

emma opened her mouth to answer him , but aidan chose that moment to walk in the door .

`` me and my soon to be non-swimmers are just fine , '' he replied , with a grin .

a week before he had gone under the laser for a vasectomy .

while caroline had been a surprise , liam had not .

with emma nearing thirty-four , they thought it best to finish out their family while they were still young .

and while emma was pregnant and there were no worries about conception , aidan thought it was the best time to get his vasectomy and let it take effect .

`` daddy ! ''

caroline squealed , as she came bounding around the corner .

aidan 's grin grew wider as he took his daughter in his arms .

`` hi sweet pea . ''

she kissed both of his cheeks before she started wiggling , wanting down .

noah ran to him next , and he got to hold his son a little longer as noah told him all about his day helping out with the babies .

a cry from the living room snapped pesh 's attention away from aidan and emma .

megan was bending over the pack n play , picking up sara .

`` aw , what 's wrong , sweetheart ? ''

she cooed , as she took sara into her arms .

as megan rocked her back and forth , sara continued wailing , which caused maya 's face to crumple up as well .

`` you must be hungry . ''

`` i 'll get their bottles , '' pesh called , over the twin 's loud cries .

`` thank you . ''

as emma worked to gather the kids , along with patrick and aidan , around the dining room table , pesh got busy heating up the formula .

once he had the two bottles fixed , he grabbed them and then went to the dining room .

megan was already seated with mason trying to entertain sara to stop crying her crying .

he passed a bottle to megan before sitting down himself .

he 'd barely gotten the bottle in her mouth before maya started sucking greedily at the formula .

as aidan reached to start spooning some chicken casserole onto his plate , patrick shot him a disapproving look .

with a sigh , aidan dropped the serving spoon .

`` you gon na say grace even though it 's not your house , pop ? ''

`` why yes , i am .

it 's good for all these children to learn , '' he replied , motioning to noah and caroline who sat between their parents , and then over to mason .

`` it should be up to pesh and megan whether it 's said or not , '' aidan grumbled .

pesh held up his free hand that was n't holding maya .

`` it 's fine .

truly , i do n't mind . ''

aidan mouthed `` suck up '' at him before grinning .

pesh merely shook his head at aidan 's antics .

`` then let 's return thanks , '' patrick said .

with maya still taking long pulls at her bottle , pesh bowed his head .

as patrick recited the blessing , pesh could n't help feeling so very blessed himself .

three years ago , the dining room would have been empty .

most likely , he would have been grabbing something on the way home or finishing some leftover takeout .

but now , he had a beautiful , loving wife by his side-one he fell a little more in love with each and every day .

across from him , he had a son who was strong and healthy .
