nate asks , tilting his head toward me but not making eye contact .

`` yes , '' i whisper back , unsure of what else to do or say .

`` ok , meet you in there in ten minutes , '' nate says simply and walks out .

i wait until i can hear him walking up the stairs before i move .

i 've never heard a father talk to his son like that before , and our old neighborhood was n't exactly full of model families .

and the way nate 's shoulders slumped as pierce was speaking to him , it was like he agreed with what his father was saying about him .

i walk up the stairs to my room and change into my sweats , before heading back downstairs to make some popcorn-food always makes me feel better .

as soon as it 's finished popping , i head into the den to wait for nate .

should i tell my mom about what pierce just did ?

would she even listen ?

she seems to have drunk the pierce kool-aid pretty heavily by this point .

and now that pierce has been the victim of false allegations , it will be even harder for her to believe anything bad about him .

i glance up , frowning , as nate walks in and sits down on the couch next to me .

`` i can tell by that expression on your face that you want to talk , '' he begins .

i smile slightly , he knows me well .

`` but the stuff with my parents-it 's off-limits , ok ? ''

but i need to tell him that those things pierce said are n't true .

`` just- '' `` no , brynn .

i really want us to be able to keep hanging out .

but if you keep bringing it up ... '' i sigh .

`` fine .

i wo n't say anything .

in exchange , though ... '' i walk to the wide bookcases full of dvd options .

`` no romantic comedies ! ''

`` big fish , '' i say , pulling out the case .

`` is that a romantic comedy ? ''

he asks , narrowing his eyes suspiciously .

`` well , not really .

there is romance in it , but it 's more about a family , '' i explain , careful not to mention the predominant father-son themes .

`` hey , friendships have to have some compromise , '' i add with a smile .

`` ok , fine , '' he says , rolling his eyes .

he takes a handful of popcorn and leans against one end of the couch as i pop the dvd in .

as i make myself comfortable on the other end , he pulls a blanket from the back of the couch and arranges it over my feet , because he knows that they get cold .

i feel a pang in my chest at the small gesture , but try to push it away .

he 's not being romantic , just thoughtful .

i look up at the large tv screen as the picture comes up .

i feel more comfortable around nate than i do with anyone else in my life right now , so i have to settle for being friends with him .

otherwise i could lose him altogether .

chapter eighteen `` you and nate head down there so we do n't lose the reservation ! ''

my mom instructs me .

she planned a family outing to go rafting on the potomac , but pierce is stuck at the office in meetings , even though it 's a saturday .

`` i 'll swing by and get him and meet you there . ''

`` you sure ? ''

`` yeah , he said he 'd only be a little longer , '' she assures me .

`` ok , '' i reply with a shrug , and walk into the anteroom off the kitchen where nate is slipping on his sneakers .

`` my mom says they 're going to meet us there , '' i tell him .

`` fuck it , let 's make tracks , sis . ''

he smirks .

and off we go in his wrangler , nate blasting some god-awful metal music .

`` how do you listen to this shit ?

it sounds like two cat 's screwing in a trashcan . ''

i shake my head .

`` what ?

this is slayer , they 're classic trash metal , you have to have respect . ''

he says reverently .

`` i always listen to reign in blood before all of my games . ''

`` lovely . ''

i screw my face up in mock horror .

he turns it up louder , nodding his head enthusiastically as the guitar riffs collide into what i assume is his favorite part of the song .

it 's strange to see him let loose like this , and even though i think his taste in music is horrifying , i have to admit i like to see him enjoying himself .

thankfully , the boathouse is just a little ways down the potomac in the direction of the city , and i 'm only subjected to slayer for a few more minutes .

the temperature on this august day is in the mid-nineties , but my mom was insistent upon doing a family activity outdoors .

as we take a left on the dirt road with an old sign pointing the way , i spot an empty parking lot , and figure most people are wisely staying inside with their air-conditioning today .

after we park , nate heads over to the wood-slatted structure to secure the boat , and i take the sunscreen out of my bag .
