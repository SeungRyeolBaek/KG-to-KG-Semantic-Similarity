`` well , he is .

i 'm not blind .

actually , pierce looked just like him when he was his age . ''

i see nate get out of the pool over my mom 's shoulder and shake himself off .

i force myself to look down at my sandwich as he walks across to a lawn chair and lies down .

`` what happened to nate 's mom ? ''

my mom winces .

`` pierce does n't really like to talk about it-too painful .

apparently , she cheated on him and then abandoned him and nate .

they never see her . ''

`` oh , that 's awful , '' i murmur , trying to shove down the twinge of pity i feel for my new stepbrother .

`` i think it 's one of the things that brought us together-raising a child by ourselves . ''

my eyes flick to the door as nate slides it open .

he 's put his shirt back on but it clings to his still damp torso , emphasizing his muscular pecs and shoulders .

he drops his sneakers on the mat as he shuts the door behind him .

`` hey nate , '' my mom greets him .

`` would you like a sandwich ? ''

`` you do n't have to do that , '' he says , a little gruffly .

`` i do n't mind at all , '' she replies , standing to move back to the counter .

he pauses , then sits in her abandoned chair a bit reluctantly .

`` it 's so funny that you and brynn never met at school ! ''

`` i think there might have been one time- '' he says , glancing at me , that same devilish look back in his eyes .

i feel his knee come to rest against mine under the table , and i quickly cross my legs .

`` in class .

we have been in a few of the same classes together , '' i clarify , narrowing my eyes at him .

`` we have ? ''

he asks looking genuinely surprised .

my mom quietly spreads mayo on a slice of bread at the marble island .

`` yes , '' i whisper , embarrassed .

of course he would n't remember all of the times we 've sat in the same classroom-only the time when i ogled him in the doorway of his bedroom and completely embarrassed myself .

i blush .

i want to sink into this seat cushion and disappear .

he frowns at me then turns his palm over and begins to pick at a callous .

`` so honey , pierce says you 'll start your internship on monday , ok ?

that 'll give you a few days to settle in , '' my mom says as she slides the sandwich in front of nate .

`` sounds good , '' i reply , glancing at nate out of the corner of my eye .

`` i 'm having someone over for dinner tomorrow night , '' he announces rather abruptly .

`` oh , wonderful .

a friend from around here ? ''

`` not a friend , really .

a girl i dated in high school , '' nate clarifies .

i keep my eyes trained carefully forward .

`` do you know if she has any dietary restrictions ? ''

my mom asks , excitedly flying into hostess mode .

`` i could make this chicken dish my mom passed down , or ... '' i tune out as she offers more ideas , and polish off my sandwich as quickly as possible so i can excuse myself and go upstairs .

i sigh as i close my bedroom door behind me .

so now i have to have dinner with nate 's ex-girlfriend .

is this what the rest of the summer is going to be like ?

nate punishing me for his father 's favor by exploiting my attraction to him ?

i 'd rather be back in the library , buried in a book .

chapter six i push the sauteed chicken around my plate as i try not to watch nate drape his arm around the back of dana 's chair .

she 's pretty .

very pretty .

and sweet .

i wish she were n't so sweet so i could hate her for a good reason .

`` so how long did you two date ? ''

my mom asks .

`` well , it was on and off , so ... hard to say .

he actually went to prom with one of my friends , '' she replies , jokingly nudging nate , who at least has the grace to blush .

`` nate ... '' his dad says , shaking his head admonishingly .

`` oh , it 's ok .

i went with one of his friends , '' dana says with a smile .

`` i think we both knew it was n't meant to be . ''

`` a couple of my friends met their husbands in high school , '' my mom says , resting her fork on her plate .

`` though i read an article recently that said that twenty-eight percent of women meet their husbands in college . ''

she looks pointedly at me and i jump up .

`` i 'll clear , '' i announce .

i have a feeling i know where this conversation is headed and i want to avoid it .

`` oh , thank you , brynn , '' pierce says , as i stack the plates on top of one another .

`` no problem , '' i reply .

`` i waited tables in high school . ''

`` same , '' nate says , as i reach in front of him to take his plate .
