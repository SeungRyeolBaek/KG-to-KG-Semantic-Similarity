`` my chest , '' she said , with a grimace .

pesh pulled back the hospital gown .

`` were you wearing your seat belt ? ''

`` yes , i always do . ''

`` from the dust in your hair , can i assume the airbag deployed ? ''

`` yeah , it did . ''

`` is this where it hurts ? ''

he asked , running his fingers down an angry red whelp .

it started at her neck and crossed over her chest .

some of it was hidden by the many leads coming from the heart monitor .

`` yeah . ''

`` it looks like the seat belt and the airbag did a number on you . ''

mary winced .

`` i thought they were supposed to help you , not hurt you . ''

pesh smiled .

`` trust me .

you 're much better off with a little burn than if you had n't been wearing it . ''

after eyeing the monitors mary was hooked up to , he turned to megan .

`` blood pressure is low .

let 's administer some blood products to raise it . ''

megan nodded .

after checking mary 's chart for her blood type , she grabbed a bag of blood from the coolers .

trading places with pesh , she started another iv in the crook of mary 's right elbow .

`` besides your chest , are you hurting anywhere else ? ''

pesh asked , after he finished listening to her heart and lungs .

`` my stomach . ''

megan 's breath hitched .

it was never good for a car accident patient to have stomach pains .

that usually meant hemorrhaging , which could also attribute the low blood pressure .

pressing on mary 's abdomen , pesh asked , `` does this hurt ? ''

`` no . ''

`` here ? ''

`` no . ''

`` what about here ? ''

a screech came from the bed .

pesh 's brows drew with worry .

`` i 'm going to do a quick ultrasound , mary .

i want to see what 's causing the pain . ''

`` okay . ''

megan pulled the machine over to the bedside .

she squirted the jelly onto mary 's stomach , and then pesh began running the wand over the skin .

`` i 'm feeling a little dizzy , too , '' mary said , in a low voice .

pesh and megan exchanged a quick look before he shoved the ultrasound machine back .

turning to kristi , he said , `` call the or .

she 's got a ruptured spleen . ''

after depressing the break on the gurney , pesh swung it out of the trauma room and started down the hall .

`` go with him , '' kristi instructed , as she held onto the phone .

megan jogged down the hall to catch up with pesh .

he smacked the buttons on the elevator before glancing down at mary .

`` stay with me , okay ?

we 're going to get you into surgery , and then you 'll be good as new . ''

`` are you sure ? ''

she asked .

without hesitation , pesh replied , `` yes , but you have to stay with me . ''

the elevator 's doors slid open .

as megan helped pesh push the gurney inside , mary asked , `` did you turn on more lights ? ''

megan creased her brows in worry as she glanced over to pesh .

`` we 're getting in the elevator to take you to the or for surgery , '' she replied .

`` but it 's so bright , '' mary whispered before closing her eyes .

her head lolled to the side just as the alarms on the monitors began screeching in megan 's ears .

`` dammit , she 's crashing ! ''

pesh cried .

ice-cold fear pricked its way from the top of megan 's head all the way down her body .

a patient was crashing in the elevator without the crash cart .

what the hell were they supposed to do ?

`` lower the gurney , '' pesh ordered .

megan 's jerky hands fumbled with the lever .

once it was flat , pesh brought his hands to mary 's chest and began compressions .

without having to be told , megan leaned down , pinched mary 's nose , and began breathing into her mouth .

they worked in perfect synchronization .

`` stay with me , mary ! ''

pesh barked , as his hands pumped in a manic pace up and down on mary 's chest .

glancing up from her breathing , megan eyed the monitors .

`` no pulse . ''

when pesh did n't respond , she continued doing breathing cycles .

at the taste of something warm meeting her lips , she jerked back .

blood oozed out of mary 's mouth .

`` there 's more damage than the spleen .

she 's bleeding from the mouth . ''

pesh did n't even acknowledge her comment .

`` the seat belt and airbag could have caused an aortic tear as well .

there 's nothing we can do . ''

instead , he kept right on with his compressions .

the elevator doors opened , and megan met the expectant faces of the surgical team .

when one doctor stepped forward , she shook her head .

`` she 's gone . ''

pesh growled across from her .

`` no , she is n't .

we have to keep trying .

get a cart in here . ''

the doctor eyed the stats on the monitors .

`` i do n't think it will help . ''
