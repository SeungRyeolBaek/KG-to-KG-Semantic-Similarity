`` i always thought that at school , we could be more open .

no one really knows you 're my stepsister there .

i mean , allison would have found out then anyway , right ? ''

`` i guess so ... she just ... she called it 'gross . '

we 're not , are we ? ''

`` well , i certainly do n't think there 's anything gross about you . ''

`` it 's more than that , though .

i feel like we 're drifting apart a little , '' i reveal , swallowing a ball of hurt in my throat .

`` mm , '' he replies , considering .

`` like me and jackson , sort of .

well , maybe you wo n't be quite as close as you were , but there are still things you can enjoy about her . ''

`` when 'd you get so wise ? ''

i ask , nudging his feet next to me .

`` since i started hanging out with you .

you 're rubbing off on me . ''

before i have time to consider whether he 's being serious or not , we hear my mom call , `` dinner ! ''

from the kitchen , and are forced to put our conversation on hold .

pierce seems to be in an unusually good mood during the meal , for which i 'm grateful .

not for his sake , but for nate 's , because he 's much less likely to snap at his son when he 's feeling jovial .

`` well , we have n't made an official announcement , brynn , but thornhill and co. has just landed mark broadman as a client , '' he reveals eventually .

`` the hedge fund billionaire ? ''

`` that 's right .

he has several new holdings , and needs advice on some public policy matters . ''

`` wow , that 's huge .

congrats , dad , '' nate chimes in .

pierce nods at him in a self-satisfied manner .

`` i 'm glad it 's all-i 'm glad that 's happened , pierce , '' i correct myself .

i almost referenced the scandal earlier this summer , but managed to change course .

we never talk about it now , though i know that pierce was concerned that it would negatively impact his business .

but landing such a big client is a good sign that people have moved on , and are on pierce 's side .

after dinner , nate and i leave the dining room separately , while our parents remain there chatting .

we always make a show of going our separate ways , to keep up appearances .

i close my bedroom door knowing that he 'll come for me around midnight , as he has every night this past week .

my body quivers with excitement just thinking about it .

i consider writing an email to allison , but decide i want a little more time to think about what to say .

i turn to my purse and pull out the bag from victoria 's secret that i stuffed to the bottom .

i touch the black lace panties , a narrow diamond-shaped piece of fabric that just covers the essentials , with several thin strips , string , really , hooking around my hips and latching on to the back .

the bra is conservative by contrast , though pretty with its chantilly lace-covered cups .

i take a shower and then head downstairs for a cup of tea .

i 'm taking a mug down from the top cupboard when i feel nate come up behind me .

he wraps his hands around my waist and presses against me .

`` nate , not here ! ''

i whisper .

`` i know , i 'm sorry , '' he murmurs in my ear .

`` i just want you all the time . ''

`` i have a surprise for you tonight , '' i admit .

he grinds his erection into my ass in response , his hands reaching under my shirt .

`` you 're killing me , '' he moans , then sighs , and rests his head on mine before pulling away .

`` see you soon . ''

i lean against the counter as i hear him retreat , my skin tingling where he 's touched it .

i know that sneaking around wo n't work forever , but for now , there 's something so hot about it .

i take my decaf earl grey up to my room , and change into the lingerie as i drink it , carefully pulling out the tags .

i sink into bed with a yawn , pulling the sheet up over me .

these late night assignations , while i would n't give them up for anything , are wreaking havoc on my sleep schedule .

the next thing i know , i 'm being woken up by someone sinking into bed next to me .

i turn into the warmth of nate 's body and slowly open my eyes .

`` sorry , should i just let you sleep ? ''

he asks , kissing the top of my head .

`` no way , '' i reply drowsily .

`` you have to have your surprise . ''

`` where is it ? ''

he asks , looking around .

i lift my arm and point down at my body .

he grins , and pinches the top of the sheet in his fingers and begins to slowly pull it down .

i bite my lip as i hear his sharp intake of breath as he reveals my bra .

he pauses , looking up at my face .

`` there 's more , '' i promise him .
