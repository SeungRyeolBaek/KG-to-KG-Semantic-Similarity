if he could practically make her soak her panties with just a kiss , what the hell could he do with his dick ?

as she started to feel lightheaded and weak on her legs , they stumbled over to the couch before pesh collapsed back , taking her with him .

straddling his lap , she gazed at him momentarily before his mouth attacked hers again .

as his tongue once again invaded her mouth , she began to raise her h*ps and grind against him .

groaning , he broke the kiss by throwing his head back .

he gulped in long breaths of air like he was a dying man deprived of his last breath .

she felt the same way .

she kissed a trail over his chin and down his neck .

`` pesh , i want you , '' she murmured into his skin .

his chest heaved up and down with her declaration as if he was finding it hard to breathe .

she broke away to stare into his eyes .

`` please . ''

chapter five pesh could n't believe the delicious nightmare he found himself trapped in .

a beautiful , sexy blonde writhed against him .

the hem of megan 's dress had ridden up to her hips , and a tiny scrap of lace underwear was the only thing covering her core as she rubbed herself against his crotch .

her heat and her arousal scorched through the fabric of his pants to singe the skin of his growing erection .

he wanted nothing more than to flip her on her back , tear away the underwear , and plunge himself deep inside her .

it had been so , so long since he had been within the tight walls of a woman .

while his conscious railed against him for even entertaining the thought , his body was onboard .

`` please , '' megan whimpered , as she continued to rise and fall over his erection .

`` we ca n't ... we should n't . ''

she ran her hands up his chest before wrapping them around his neck .

`` but i could make you feel good . ''

`` i 'm sure you could . ''

`` and i know you could make me feel good , too .

i 'm already drenched just kissing you . ''

her fingers raked through his hair , tugging desperately on the strands .

`` i need this , and you need this . ''

his body was completely onboard with how much he needed her .

if she pressed any closer to him , she was going to set him off and make him do something he had n't since he was a teenager , which was come in his pants .

but his once hazy mind was starting to refocus and overpower the desire pumping through his body .

he could not and would not take her when she was drunk .

it was completely against his character .

he 'd never taken advantage of a woman , and he never would .

he gazed into her hooded eyes .

`` but it would be so very wrong . ''

her lip trembled .

`` do n't you want me ? ''

`` yes , without a doubt . ''

`` then why wo n't you have sex with me ? ''

`` because you 're inebriated . ''

she rolled her eyes in a huff .

`` you 're sooo proper , are n't you ?

a proper gentleman . ''

he cupped her face in his hands .

`` if not taking advantage of you in your state of intoxication makes me a gentleman , then i suppose i am .

what kind of man would i be to take you now only to have you wake up with regret and remorse ? ''

`` the kind of man who wants to get laid ! ''

her hand dipped between them to grasp his erection , causing him to hiss .

`` i feel you against me-i know you want this as much as i do . ''

although the devil on his shoulder raged at him , he quickly removed megan 's hand .

`` believe me when i say i wo n't have sex with you like this .

i would never disrespect you so much as to not make love to you like you deserve . ''

she blinked a few times as if she was having a hard time processing his words .

`` regardless of what you have going on in that head of yours , you are better than this .

you deserve a man who will take his time with you and show you what pleasure through making love really is . ''

`` i 've never had that , '' she whispered regretfully .

he gave her a sad smile .

`` i did n't think you had . ''

he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheek .

`` if i take you , i 'll be making love to you .

i 'll have you begging and pleading , but you 'll be coming so many times you 'll lose count .

you 'll understand the difference between a quick tumble and the all-consuming power of a physical connection fueled by an emotional one . ''

she rapidly blinked her blue eyes in disbelief while her cheeks flushed .

`` oh god , did you actually just say that ? ''

`` i did . ''

he gave her a teasing smile .

`` and you 'll be calling out my name more than his . ''

`` i ... '' she began before she quickly clamped her lips shut .

her eyes widened before she scrambled off of his lap .

before he could question her on what she was doing , she threw up all over the front of her dress .
