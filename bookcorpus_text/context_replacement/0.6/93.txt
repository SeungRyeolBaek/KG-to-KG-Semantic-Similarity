` ` that ' s my baby girl ! ' ' emma cried out , covering both his cheeks with kisses . megan rushed over to emma ' s side . ` ` come on , meggie . you and pesh come in here , ' ' aidan said . megan , don ' t argue with him . instead , she took pesh ' s hand and led aidan inside . emma looked down and shook her head . ` ` i ' m so sorry for ruining your wedding night . ' ' ` ` you # didn ' t ruin our night , ' ' pesh assured her . ` ` that ' s okay . we kept right on saying - you did ##n ' t ruin it at all , ' ' megan said . emma laughed . ` ` i ' m glad to hear that . ' ' megan smiled and jerked her head up at aidan , who sat in the corner with megan . ` ` congratulations on a new baby girl . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' emma said , and a huge smile lit up her face . ` ` are you feeling better ? ' ' pesh asked . emma nodded . ` ` it was a lot easier this time and a lot better . ' ' she turned to aidan . ` ` and this time i ' m' i have to admit that aidan might not like it . ' ' aidan sighed . ` ` emma , you just started yelling at me to drive home because you were just about to drop him on the side of the road . ' ' emma ' s cheeks flushed . ` ` i guess i was a little worried . ' ' pesh took megan ' s hand and squeezed it . ` ` we should go and let the others take a look , ' ' he said . ` ` do you want me to take him home with us ? ' ' since he was attached to his mother ' s chest , megan really wasn ' t really looking forward to having to move him . emma looked down at her son with tears shining in her eyes . ` ` no , i think he should stay here with us a while longer . i can get connor to take him home . i think he ' ll stay here until casey leaves . ' ' ` ` are you sure you wo don ' t want your son ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` fine , i ' ll hand him over to aidan and make sure i get plenty of sleep until baby caroline gets me , ' ' emma said , with a small smile . aidan could don ' t argue with her . he was perfectly happy to get himif it meant being loved by his wife and children . after exchanging a few hugs and kisses , she and pesh walked out into the hall and let the long day pass . as they walked down the hall hand in hand , pesh turned to her and smiled . ` ` you know , i never thought i would see the day i would be worthy of aidan stone . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' he heaved a sigh . ` ` seeing him with his family makes me happy . one day i hope that ' s you with my daughter in your arms . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she agreed . whether or not they would have children together had never yet been decided . it was always a possibility that they would , but it just didn ' t seem right to find out when and how soon . she wanted nothing more than to give pesh a family of his own . he was like the son she had never known . ` ` give me a year , ' ' she said softly . his brow furrowed in confusion . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` i ' d like a year for us to be happy as a married couple before we decide to have children . ' ' ` ` that just makes you an even better man , '' he chuckled . ` ` you ' ll be fine . you ' re pretty smart for your young age . ' ' he chuckled . ` ` i sure ' ne ' er want to put on a show at his or her high school graduation . ' ' she smacked his arm playfully . ` ` another year is not going to make that big a difference . ' ' ` ` fine . you win . we ' ll wait another year . ' ' when the elevator doors slid open , they stepped inside . smiling down at her , pesh said , ` ` i could ne ' er have found a more suitable father for my first child . ' ' ` ` well , i have to say that you are good , nadeen . very good , ' ' she teased . he cupped her face in his hands and gave her a passionate kiss that silenced all of her protests . when he pulled back , she grinned at him . ` ` keep kissing me like that , and i might have to wait even longer for the baby . you ' ll let me have you , your mouth , and your hands all to myself for as long as possible . ' ' ` ` and here i thought my kiss would get you in the mood for baby - making , ' ' pesh chuckled. megan sighed . ` ` either way , it ' s a win - win situation . so bring it on , nadeen . bring . it . on . ' ' chapter twenty - two although her stomach growled in order to eat her fork , megan could couldn ' t resist sucking down the first bite of hot chocolate into her mouth . as she chewed , she closed her eyes as the delicious flavors of chocolate and cinnamon slid across her taste buds . ` ` megan ? ' ' a voice asked from across the room . her eyes snapped open to take in pesh , her new husband of three months .
