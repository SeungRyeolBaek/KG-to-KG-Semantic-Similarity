i hear him make a sharp intake of breath and then his hand shakes as he tries to hold on against the chair . i push down hard . then he pulls his arm back and i barely manage to stop my fall in place . the chair does ##n ' t hit my leg . he turns to me and smiles , a wicked gleam in his eye . he is flirting with me , i realize . that ' s his way of getting revenge for me blowing him off in front of his parents ? what a total jerk ! i turn toward him with a fake smile plastered on my face . ` ` if you ' re that upset about something , take it up with your parents , and ##n ' t take it up on me . i will try to calm you down . ' ' i whisper into his ear . he turns to me with an equally fake smile . ` ` i ' ll do whatever the hell i want , babe . ' ' he says quietly so our parents can ##v ' t hear . the rest of the day passes without nate cracking a fake smile at me . the wheels in my head refuse to turn as i think about how i ' m going to be spending the whole summer , and all the four months , alone with this man . my life has beenso unlike me , and i need some time to process everything . when the waiter brings our $ ##s and nate takes care of the bill with a white business card , we stand up to say goodbye . they ' re going to fly back to seattle , since it takes about two hours . i hug nate first , then my mom . ` ` i know this is a lot to take in , honey . we ' ll figure everything out , i promise , ' ' she says softly , then kisses me on the cheek . i smile at her and start to stand up - i ' m so happy . nate surprises me by leaning in for a hug while our parents look on with a frown . ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' he says , then whispers , directly into my ear , ` ` oh , we ' ll never get another chance to have that conversation , babe . ' ' i smile as he kisses my back , and then pulls away . he knows . and now i can finally understand how important i am to him . i have a feeling i ' m never going to hear the end of it . chapter twelve ` ` i really don ' t want to ruin the breakup , it was just so sudden , ' ' i say to my mom .she drives me home from the airport . i almost never drive to and from school , but she does . my biggest fear was that nate and i would be on the same page , but thankfully his class started earlier than expected . i have as much time as possible to prepare myself for our date . ` ` okay , i get it , i really do , ' ' my mom tells me . ` ` you never tell me anything about yourself , about me and nate , and i wo ##n ' t get it . ' ' ` ` he treats you well ? ' ' ` ` he ' s wonderful . he ' s always surprising me with his gifts , gifts , whatever . i just don ' t know what i ' ve done to deserve him . ' ' ` ` well , i think you ' re pretty amazing . ' ' i reply honestly . ` ` no , ' ' don ' t mean it like that ! i just mean , he treats me like a princess . and the house is like a palace , ' ' she says , referring to her house . i stare at the huge driveway we ' re pulling into . ` ` hold on . that ' s his house ! ? it ' s huge ! ' ' ` ` i know , right ? ' ' my momsays with a smile . ` ` he has cook ' s quarters ! maybe you ' ll get used to them , eventually . ' ' ` ` he ' s a cook ? ' ' ` ` he used to have a housekeeper / cook who would cook for him , but now i do all of that myself . i like having someone else to cook for me . the cook only comes once a week , to do some really good things , ' ' she says as we pull through the wrought - iron gate into the driveway . ` ` are you still working at the salon ? ' ' she has to support herself as a waitress at the local diner down in our little town in southern maine . ` ` nope , not anymore . i ' m retired , though , and thinking of starting a charitable organization , ' ' she says proudly . my mom , the woman who cares , i think , shakes my head . i ca don ' t know if she can do that . my mom presses a button on the car ' s dashboard and one of the glass side doors opens . we slide in and i look around at the empty space as the door closes behind us . if i ' m this focused on something the end of the world , i ca don ' t .how i ' ll feel about the rest of the day . after the meal , which takes over an hour because the house is so large , my mother finally leads me to my room . my head is spinning at the thought of my new home . as we walk down the plushly appointed hallway , i ' m surprised to realize that i can still smell nate . he must be here somewhere . i ' ve been anticipating seeing him again and hoped we ' d have enough time to settle in for our next visit .
