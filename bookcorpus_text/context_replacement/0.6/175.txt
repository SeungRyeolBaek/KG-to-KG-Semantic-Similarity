` ` are you ready to drive home by yourself ? ' ' nate asks , rolling down the window . ` ` uh , yeah , sure , ' ' i reply , coming back to reality . i open the door and lift my right leg to get into the passenger seat . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' nate asks . ` ` yeah , everything ' s fine . ' ' when we arrive back at the house , nate baby - walks me away from the car into the kitchen , gently sitting me down in a chair in the breakfast room . he stands in front of me and examines my shoe , then takes it off and takes my sock off . ` ` can you move your feet ? ' ' i move them back and forth . ` ` and , please , move your left foot again . ' ' i wince as i do , and pain shoots straight up my leg . ` ` i broke my ankle playing football my freshman year , and i really don ' t think that ' s what this is . let ' s try and fix it and see how it looks tonight , or tomorrow . if it ' s still there , we ' ll take you to the hospital . ' ' ` ` you know how to do that ? ' ' ` ` hey, when it ' s all my own fault , i ' m pretty good at it . ' ' i watch him take out that little first aid kit from the cabinet and set it down on the table as he stands in front of me again . he quickly wraps athletic tape around my ankle and another around the bottom of my foot , twisting it around and around until my ankle is securely bound . ` ` now , let ' s get you into the house so we can protect you . ' ' i start to protest but he reaches down and picks me up easily , carrying me through the house to the small den . he sets me down on the couch and then leaves . i grab a pillow and tuck it behind my head as i stretch my legs out , surprised by the sudden emergence of nate ' s protective ##ness . he returns with a ziploc bag of dry ice and a bottle of water , setting the bag down on the table next to me and slipping the ice pack onto my foot . i nod as he sets me down , and he pulls the throw pillows from the back of the couch . he grabs one blanket and folds it , then sits on the edge of the couch next to me to lay it over me , kissing the end .kisses my neck . i become very aware of my own breathing as he leans over me . i feel his fingers as they find the edge of the blanket and wrap it around my shoulders . his other hand slides up from the blanket onto the bare skin of my neck . i hold my breath as he slowly runs his hand up onto my cheek , then down to my chin . with his thumb and finger , he gently tips my chin up until i look at him . he ' s staring at my lips , and he pauses for a moment before he looks down . ` ` please , don ' t , ' ' i beg . he ' s only inches away from kissing me . ` ` if you really don ' t want anything more , that ' s just fine . ' ' ` ` what if i do want something more ? ' ' he asks , his dark brown eyes flickering up to mine . ` ` but . . . ' ' i say , biting the words off my tongue . ` ` what kind of more ? ' ' ` ` i ' ve never felt about anyone the way i feel about you . i ' ve tried fighting that feeling , i ' ve tried fighting with myself , but it just keeps getting stronger . i want to give in - i want to .' i don ' t tell you i know exactly what this will be like . . . i ' ve never experienced anything like it . but i promise you that when i ' m with you , i ' ll be with only you . and i want you to be with only me . ' ' i look up at him . that ' s not a lot of promise , but i know that he ' s giving me everything he wants right now . because my heart is about to beat out of my chest , and my body is wearing out . ` ` thank you , ' ' i whisper , before reaching around his neck and pulling him toward me . our lips meet in an intense kiss , our tongues finding each other ' s and burning with our passion . he pushes me back against the couch , his hands grabbing my ass at the edge and then moving up and down my hips . i arch my back into him , wanting to feel him against me . . . feel him everywhere . ` ` you guys ready ? ' ' nate looks up when we hear my mom ' s voice from the kitchen . he takes a deep breath and then runs his hands through his hair before answering . ` ` we ' re in the kitchen ! ' ' he calls out , then turns to me .` ` soon , ' ' he promises , his eyes filled with promise . chapter twelve ` ` are you okay , brynn ? ' ' my mother asks me , concerned . ` ` yeah , i ' m fine , ' ' i reply , as i use my napkin to try to wipe the tomato sauce off my mouth where i ' ve almost swallowed it . nate ' s suggestion of an evening out has left me nervous and nervous during dinner .
