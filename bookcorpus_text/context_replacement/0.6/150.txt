` ` i know , ' ' he says . i look up again , but his eyes still isn ' t focused on my face . they ' re staring at my chest , which i now realize is completely exposed by my thin , white cotton dress . i completely forgot i was wearing it . there ' s a moment of silence , and i suddenly become very aware of every part of myself , and every inch of him . his beads of sweat , some of it still flowing down from his forehead , and the trail of hair between his legs . allison ' s face flashes through my mind , and i ' m reminded of what she said . ` ` i ' m done . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' he asks , his eyes coming back to mine . ` ` with your sister . i ' m done . ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' i grab a glass from the counter and pour him some water from the tap . ` ` so , you look sick because you ' re sick . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' he says . he reaches for the glass with his left hand , which moves slowly , and then stops and holds it up with his right . ` ` what was that ? ' ' i ask , and. ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` let me see your other arm , ' ' i say , reaching for him , but he pulls away . ` ` no , baby , it ' s fine . ' ' ` ` what for ? ' ' ` ` my arm . it ' s just a little sore . ' ' ` ` ' sore ? did your doctor tell you that ? ' ' ` ` not really . ' ' ` ` webmd ? ' ' i ask , raising my eyebrows . he nods , then frowns . ` ` you need to take better care of yourself . you need ##n ' t be pushing yourself so hard . ' ' he nods , and i don ' t respond . ` ` well , at least take some pills for the pain , ' ' i say as i pour the pills into my hand and begin to repack the first aid kit with the rest . ` ` that ' s all . ' ' i shake my head at him . ` ` this ' isn ' t going to help you heal any faster , ' ' i point out . ` ` okay , ' ' he says with a small smile . i watch as his fingers brush my arm as he takes the pills . ` ` okay . i guess i ' llgoing back to work . i ' m going to check out one of the smithsonian buildings tomorrow , and . . . ' ' i trail off , feeling exhausted again . ` ` okay , see you later , ' ' he says , heading toward the back door . i pause for a moment , then turn back toward the house . just like that , the only real relationship that my dad and i have ever had is over . i could almost hear him picking himself up at the door again . i climb the stairs and shut my bedroom door behind me . i feel more confused now than ever about our relationship . i really don ' t think it could be any better than that little show i gave him , but seeing this little piece of him makes things even more complicated . i close my eyes and try to go back to sleep , but when my alarm goes off at midnight , i ' m already wide awake . chapter twelve the fog is already starting to clear by the end of october , and it ' s a shame that i still haven ' t taken care of our clothes yet . the only thing i have is an old black one - piece , and i put it on dry in my closet . my mom keeps asking me if i want to go swimming ,' i ' haven ' t taken her up on it yet . ' her new clothes are nice but i know i ' ll be uncomfortable spending so much time by myself . i walk down the hall and almost run into nate as he enters his bedroom . i reflexively cross my arms over my chest , even though i know he ' s imagining me in them . ` ` hey , ' ' i say . ` ` hey , ' ' he replies . it ' s the same look we ' ve had ever since i met him in the kitchen that day . we never get into brief , but intense , conversations with each other again . if i had to choose between this and the mind games we start out with , i would choose the mind games . the doorbell rings and i have to walk past him to answer it . ` ` it ' s okay i ' ll answer it . it ' s my friend nate . ' ' he walks down the hall toward the kitchen . i follow behind him , and head toward the door . we ' re in the bathroom . i hear his footsteps coming in just as i open the french doors . there ' s a tub leaning against the wall with the nearest towels on it , so i grab one and set it on the table . the towel on thethe court is lined with stepping stones until gravel turns into sand , and lounge chairs and a table with an umbrella are strategically placed around it . i walk to the pool and step down onto the first step in the c ##s . it ' s dark - looking , but still cool after the hot summer sun . i slide down the rest of the way until the water is around my ankles , and i lean forward . i swim to the other side , where the water is darker and deeper , then push off and roll onto my back .
