` ` h - hi . nate . brynn . i ' m brynn , ' ' i say . nate looks over at me . ` ` brynn , nice to meet you , ' ' he says casually . shit , does he not even remember meeting me last night ? ` ` nate , scooch , brynn , so nate can sit , ' ' she says , waving him over with her hand . ` ` oh , hi , ' ' i say , moving over so that he can sit next to me . i stare straight ahead as he sits . i can feel my body betray me again . the heat from his body under the table is giving me heart ##burn . ` ` thought you ' weren ' t going to be able to make it , ' ' he says a little louder to his mom . ` ` sorry , i was in the library reading . i turned my phone off . ' ' ` ` sorry , you missed the big announcement . we were just telling brynn that you and i had gotten married . ' ' i glance at nate out of the corner of my eye . i see his eyes widen in surprise . ` ` what ? i thought you said you ' d never get married again . ' ' ` ` ', things changed . when i met her , i just knew . you ' ll see when you get to know her . she ' s a wonderful person . ' ' i watch my mom glow like a hundred watt bulb and can don ' t help but smile . it ' s been a while since i ' ve seen her this happy . ` ` well , i ' m . . . i ' m surprised . . . ' ' i watch him search for words just like i do . ` ` surprised . and happy . i ' m looking forward to getting to know you better , nate . ' ' wow , that is . . . wow . exactly what the girl i met last night would say . ` ` yeah , me too , nate , ' ' my mom says , sounding excited . ` ` and i ' m so excited for you and brynn to get to know each other ! ' ' ` ` two beautiful girls . . . ' ' he says enthusiastically . ` ` you ' ll have to learn to cook . ' ' my mom laughs and i join in too . ` ` you always wanted a sister , brynn ! and now you have one ! well , a step - sibling , but still . ' ' a step - sibling that i ' ve' such full of happy energy and . . . ` ` so , you two have never met , then ? ' ' my mom asks , looking between us . ` ` nate and i were so excited when we learned that our brothers are together now . ' ' ` ` uva is my alma mater , ' ' nate replies quickly . ` ` no , we ' ve never met , ' ' i cut in quickly . i watch nate study him for a moment and then shrugs . ` ` nope , never did , actually , ' ' he says . ` ` we thought it best not to tell you anything about it until we knew it would not last forever . we thought it would have not been so awkward for you guys if we ' d broken up and now you have to keep seeing each other around campus , ' ' my mom says . ` ` yeah , that would have been nice , ' ' nate replies quietly , and i know he ' s thinking that nothing could compare to my emotional reaction last night . the waiter comes over with the bottle of wine that nate ordered . dom perignon , i think . i look at the waiter . whoa , he must be loaded . my new stepdad must be loaded . she quickly pops the cork and serves us .an elegant bow , dropping the bottle into the wine rack next to the table . nate takes his glass and raises it . ` ` to a happy ending , ' ' he says , looking around the room . we all raise our glasses and raise them too . i manage to drink it without making eye contact with nate . the champagne burns my throat on the way down . i ' ve never wanted to drink a glass of champagne more in my entire life than at this moment , so i limit myself to a small sip . ` ` so , nate , you told me you had good news , right ? ' ' my mom asks , as she puts down her glass . ` ` well , yes , but i really don ' t think i can make that happen , ' ' i reply with a smile . ` ` wow ! you sounded excited on the phone , ' ' she tells me . ` ` well , we have a new chair , ' ' i reply . my dad nods in agreement , and i see him look over at his mom . ` ` i thought you said that they still haven ' t bought it yet , ' ' he says quietly . ` ` well . . . i knew you ' d be here . it was waitlisted . it looked great , but##gling , professional ##ism , ' business trip - ' ' nate begins . i glance at my watch and look between the two men . nate is staring down at the floor . ` ` i was hoping for the waiting list , nate , ' ' callie says , interrupting him and turning to me . ` ` it ' s an important trip . ' ' ` ` thank you . . . ' ' i say softly . nate looks completely lost . ` ` being waitlisted is important , callie . ' ' he looks up at me sharply , his eyes wide . shit . i feel that , too : shit .
