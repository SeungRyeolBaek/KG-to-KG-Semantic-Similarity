i am so grateful for the wonderful children you have left . ' ' lavani ' s blue eyes filled with tears , and she put a hand up to wipe her eyes . ` ` thank you , my dear . ' ' shveta ran into the bathroom , her face lit up with a huge smile . ` ` alpesh is back . ' ' hiking up the skirt of her dress , megan walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom . her heart leapt at the sight of him . she had never seen him in a - dress , as they were called . instead , it was a long , indian style dress that came to his knees . and he wore white fur - lined pants . and his shirt was white just like hers . it was gold in color and covered with diamonds and pearls . she really don ' t want to have to explain how much it meant . when she turned her eyes back to his , she blushed under his intense gaze . ` ` you are a woman of complete and utter beauty , ' ' he said . in a slow motion , the fabric of her dress fell around her . ` ` do you like it ? ' ' he asked . ` ` i love it . ' ' she smiled. ` ` i feel a little like a princess . ' ' you can scare the boys off in that dress , but you can ##v ' t take the fun out of the men ' s thing . ' ' ` ` i would ##n ' t have you any other way , ' ' he said , with a gruff , but sincere smile . ` ` thank you . ' ' megan eyed the black velvet box in his hands . ` ` here , let me see the necklace . ' ' with a bark of a laugh , pesh set one of the boxes down on the table while he opened the other . megan gasped as the diamond earrings stared up at her . where there was one gold chain , the others stood out in long waves that would almost reach her waist when she put them on . they had a gold chain , and on the others were diamonds and pearls that would match her eyes . ` ` this is why your mother and shveta wanted you to wear the black one ? ' ' she asked . pesh nodded . ` ` they ' re beautiful , ' ' she whispered . ` ` wait until you see the earrings , ' ' he said , with a smile . her shaking hand reached out to hisone of the diamonds . she carefully removed the clasp and pressed it to her neck . then she did the same . when they were so heavy she felt like they would weigh her down , she looked up at pesh and smiled . ` ` thank you . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome , my love . ' ' he reached for the jewelry box . megan ' s eyes widened as the diamonds and the blue sparkled in the light . she pulled the box out and fastened the clasp . he stood behind her and gently pulled the top over her head . she closed her eyes at the wonderful feeling of having his touch . ` ` good . ' you ' re mine . ' ' turning around to face him , she pressed her lips to his . ` ` i love you . ' ' his thumb gently stroked her cheek . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' from the doorway of the bathroom , lavani glared up at them . ` ` alpesh , stop teasing her , or you ' re going to mess up her makeup ! ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` i really thought i was helping her . ' ' she waved her hand dismissively . ` ` ' sorry .it ' s time we went home . ' ' as pesh held out his hand for her , megan linked hers with his . ` ` ` don ' t be nervous , ' ' he whispered into her ear . ` ` i ' m not , ' ' she lied . ` ` megan , i know you well enough by now that i know when you ' re nervous . you blush and bite your lip . ' ' ` ` sorry , ' ' she mumbled , as they stepped onto the elevator . though it was crowded with pesh ' s family , megan kept her mouth shut about her nerves . the last thing she wanted to do was to get anything right in front of them . when the doors opened , she took in a couple of deep breaths to calm her nerves . there was a whole lot of time and circumstance that she didn ' ' t quite understand and how they were all going to behave . she had hoped not to mess up the reception when she walked in with her parents . just like at a wedding reception , she and pesh sat at the table at the front of the room . of course , she had t ' not quite prepared herself for the two chairs that looked exactly like chairs . once everyone was seated , pesh ' s parents took theto you . ` ` we are so happy that you all could come with us this evening . we know that with megan ' s friends and family , as well as some of our sister ' s , there are a lot of you here with our family . we will need to explain to you what the arrangements are . ' ' on the table in front of them were beautiful flower arrangements that reminded her of the flowers that you would find in homes . they were all shades of white , pink , and purple . the lights hung over the red velvet chairs . she knew from what pesh had told her that they would be giving each other flowers , to celebrate their time together .
