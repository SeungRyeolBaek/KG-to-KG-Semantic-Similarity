as the sun beat down on us , i pushed her down to the hard floor and started f * * king her hard . ` ` this is f * * king amazing . ' ' is it because i ' d slept with her in my bed for two straight days and barely touched her ? i could ##n ' t think of a reason for this and that would ##n ' t be good . the longer i held her the more i wanted , and if we kept this shit up she ' d spend the next two days being sick . ' i had seen the f ##ness to her eyes and heard the little sounds of pleasure she made even as she urged me on to f * * k her . i was glad i was pinning her against the hard floor , the moans and cries she made were now barely audible , but she thrust her hips up against me riding my c * * k like a rocket as i did my best to pull her into her seat with me . this time when she came the sound was more of a growl as i thrust and pounded into her until she was screaming . ` ` that ' s it , we ' re getting out of here , so try to keep your damn hands to yourself shiane , my old man ' s dead .' not too much . ' ' she threw herself into my arms and squealed with joy and i felt my heart swell a little more . we finally made it out of the bathroom and the girls put on clothes and we went down to the kitchen . ` ` did you say you had dinner ? ' ' ` ` yep . ' ' she pointed to the pots and dishes on the counter and i furrowed my brow again . i guess i was kind of a ##type after all , i just hadn ' t expected the teen ##y girl to make her way into the kitchen . she ' d made a dinner of roast chicken , of all things , with garlic bread and steamed green beans . ` ` i hope you ' didn ' me miss it . ' ' ' right . ` ` nope , the chicken just ain ' t cooked yet , it ' s just put in the oven it ' ll take ten minutes to cook and the rest of the food will be done no problem . you just eat and i ' ll take care of everything , ' ' ` ` yes ma ' am . ' ' i opened a bottle of wine and poured her a glass , taking one for myself . i sat at the table and watched her move around myno . she did , too . it was strange to look at this complete stranger and realize that somehow i ' d come to know her so well . did she even notice that she ' d been humming ? she had hadn ' t done that since she ' d been here . you would ' ve thought that she spent every waking moment humming , but this was the first time since i ' d brought her here that i ' d heard her so much as humming . it was wasn ' t the hum from the other night , this one was low and soft , with a funny little quality to it that made me have to strain to hear the words since she was humming so loudly . ` ` well , now i ca ##t like you . ' ' she turned her eyes to me and looked down at her hands . ` ` i ' m not very good at that . ' ' ` ` go on . ' ' ` ` i think i ' ve learned how to control my voice , when i go out on stage , but i ca ##v ' t never sing in front of anyone else like that . ' ' ` ` ' how do you do it ? ' ' ' my mother taught me these things . . . ' ' i just don ' t like the sound of thata pill . ` ` what kind of pill ? ' ' i turned my head and looked at her . ` ` it ' s nothing really , just something to calm my nerves . ' ' ` ` is it a pill ? ' ' ` ` ' something like that , i never even asked him where he got them . . . ' ' ` ` do you have them with you though ? ' ' ` ` ' what ? ' ' she looked at me confused . ' ' ` ` i ' ll just have to take a look at them that ' s all , make sure they ' re fine . ' ' ` ` ' i ' m sure they ' re fine doug would never do anything to hurt me . ' ' ` ` do you have the pills back at your place ? ' ' ` ` no , doug has them with him , he gives me one for every show and sometimes when i want to go to one of those other shows . looked like i was gon # ##ry to have a talk with her though . she was so f * * king stubborn , i was sure it would never cross her mind to believe anything the doctor said . but i really don ' t know him personally , i ' m a lawyer and i know all about the bottom line .her voice was so pure honey , i ' m sure the real doug would do anything to see that nothing got in the way of her making them happy . that was something else i was gon # ##ught to get into as well . when i ' d made the decision to marry her , everything that she did was my business . there might be consequences , because i ' ve noticed that she has a bit of an independent streak , but i had no intention of letting that stop me . if i ' d planned it for another night , she was going to ruin the surprise for me . ` ` voila , dinner is ready .
