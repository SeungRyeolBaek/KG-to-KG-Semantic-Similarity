` ` yes and no , ' ' pesh said . ` ` what the hell does that mean ? ' ' she asked , raising her startled eyes to his . he nodded . ` ` is the black knob code for ' speed ' ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` look at it this way . you know when you ' re in a plane and you ' re going fast , you pick up speed ? ' ' megan nodded . ` ` it ' s the same as in a car . but if you pull on the black knob , it increases the speed , and there wo ##ll ' t be any increase in speed . ' ' with her hand on the black knob , megan asked , ` ` how far do i have to pull on it ? ' ' ` ` ` going in one - way . ' ' after pulling on the throttle , megan increased the speed . ` ` we ' re slowing down . ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` are we going ninety degrees ? ' ' megan looked around . ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` okay , now increase the throttle just a little more . that will give you a straight - up and a smooth descent . ' ' megan pulled on the steering wheel until the nose of the plane turned toward theover . ` ` ` put the landing gear in the right spot , ' ' pesh said . ` ` is that the one with the red dot on it ? ' ' ` ` yep , that ' s the one . ' ' megan pressed send . ` ` got it . ' ' ` ` grab the steering wheel , turn the plane a little to the right , and we ' re level ##ing up with the runway . ' ' megan jerked the steering wheel to the left a little too hard . ` ` oops , ' ' she said . ` ` it ' s okay . just take off again . you just need your own ground radar to be in the same exact spot behind the plane . ' ' as megan looked around , she realized how close they were getting to the runway , and in particular , the plane . and she really wasn ' t even sure if she could control the plane . she was one wheel in place , but it seemed like there was so much more that could go wrong when flying . ` ` p - uh , p - pesh , ' ' she stammered . ` ` what ? ' ' he asked her . ` ` i really don ' t think i can do this . ' ' she cut her eyes over to him . ` ` ' 'don ' t crash the plane . it ' s too dangerous . ' ' ` ` yes , you are . ' ' megan shook her head slowly back and forth . ` ` no way . you have to pull back the throttle . you could cause it to crash . ' ' ` ` ` i have faith in you . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` of course . i would ##n ' t let you do this if you were ##n ' t think you could . ' ' she stole a glance at him , taking in his earnest expression . yes , he really and truly believed in her . and it wasn ##n ' t except for the fact they were seeing each other every time they got together . still , he saw through to the real her . " taking a deep breath , she made herself to calm down . ` ` okay . i ' ll try , but i ' m not making any promises . ' ' ` ` that ' s my point , ' ' pesh said . ` ` what should i do now ? ' ' ` ` all right , but you need to move the seat all the way forward as well as pull back on the throttle to keep the plane from turning . ' ' clearing her throat that felt as dry as cotton , megan nodded .the power button was pressed on the steering wheel . it was a lot easier considering how sweaty her palms were . ` ` keep it up . you ' re doing great . ' ' as they got closer and closer to the runway , megan resisted the urge to close her eyes , but she knew that would not be the right thing to do . instead , she braced herself for the impact . the moment the plane hit the ground she gasped and clutched onto the steering wheel . ` ` ` no ' not feel the impact . we ' re fine . you ' re fine . ' ' they rolled down the runway . ` ` okay , now ease up on the throttle and push on the outside of the wheels to apply the brakes . ' ' without thinking , megan lifted her foot , causing the wheels to spin . ` ` good , ' ' pesh said . she took her hands off the wheel , and they began to roll . ` ` ' you ' re going to make it back into the air . ' ' ` ` oh , hell no ! i would end up falling off the end of the runway . the runway ! ' ' megan laughed . pesh ' s soft smile faded quickly at the death glare she gave him . ` ` megan , you 'll be fine . you just missed the plane . i think you can handle walking into a field . ' ' she smiled at him . ` ` fine . but when you decide to file a life insurance claim , i ' m going to . ' i told you so . ' ' ' ` ` we ' ll see , ' ' he said . she could tell he was holding back a smile the way he was biting down on his lip . ` ` turn right , make a left turn , ' ' she said , pointing to where the airport was . she turned the car to the left and was slamming her foot down on the accelerator when she saw the airport come into view .
