when she swayed on her feet like she was going to faint , pesh climbed onto the bed , reaching out for her . grabbing hold of her hands , he stopped her . she glanced down at her hands before looking up at him . pesh ' s heart broke at the sight of tears forming in her eyes . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' her voice trembled as big , fat tears rolled down her cheeks . ` ` oh god , ' ' she whispered . ` ` ` do don ' t cry . ' ' ` ` th - this is th - so wrong , ' ' she stammered . ` ` it ' s okay . you ' don ' me have to be sorry . ' ' sobbing , she covered her face with her hands . ` ` please , i made a fool out of myself coming on to you and now i ' ve cried in front of you like a drunk girl who just doesn ' t like her friends . ' ' ` ` stop beating yourself up . now , let ' s get you cleaned up . ' ' he wrapped his arm around her shoulders to support her on their way down the hall to the bedroom . she began to sob harder as they made their way into the bedroom . with his other arm, he turned on the water . ` ` can you get in the shower ? ' ' with a small smile , she said , ` ` i think so . ' ' ` ` if not , there ' s a ledge you can stand on . let me turn on the water for you , and i ' ll get you a towel . ' ' he backed her up against the wall before walking over to the bathroom . when he had the water at a good enough temperature , he then walked over to the closet . he pulled out a towel before returning to megan who had her head in her hands . with his other hand , he took one of her hands and pulled it away from her face . ` ` ` stop beating yourself up . i hate to see you so upset . ' ' ` ` ` ` don ' t do it . i ' m not a fool . ' ' ` ` well , if you ' re a fool , then so am i . we still love each other . ' ' ` ` ` i was drunk . . . i hardly get drunk anymore . ' ' ` ` it was an accident . things like that happen . ' ' he grabbed her face and forced her to look at him . ` ` you did one of the terrible things your mother keeps thinkingyou are now . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' her soft heart , along with her need for his touch , nearly overwhelmed him . he had to refrain from taking her in his arms . he knew if he did that , he would end up doing something he should never ' do with her . finally , she nodded . ` ` ' you still are , so go ahead and get in the shower . ' ' the corners of her mouth turned up in a small smile . ` ` do you have something i can change into ? and maybe a shirt ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` one moment . ' ' leaving her in the bathroom , he went back into the bedroom to his closet . he pulled out a pair of jeans he knew would be too tight and too small for her and then paired them with an emory university t - shirt . when he got back to the kitchen , megan was struggling with the zipper on the back of her dress . with a pained expression , she crossed her arms . ` ` could you please help me ? ' ' ` ` of course . ' ' he set the dress down on the counter . he slowly reached up to pull down the zipper . the back of the dress fell open , revealing her olive green bra and her blueher bra and panties . he closed his eyes to try and block out the erotic images flashing through his mind . his lips on her mouth , his tongue sliding along her neck , his hands sliding around her ribcage to cup her br * * sts . he forced himself to step back . clearing his throat , he said , ` ` thanks . ' ' glancing at him over her shoulder , megan gave him a small smile . ` ` thank you . ' ' she pulled out a paper towel from under the sink and placed it next to the one he ' d given her . ` ` let me know if you need anything else . ' ' ` ` thanks . ' ' turning around , he stormed out of the room . not wanting to go too far in case megan followed him , he began pacing toward the bathroom . he only paused when he heard the water turn on . he waited for her to return , but she would s ' pose . just as he was about to knock on the door , the soft click of the hairdryer sounded . he stopped his pacing as she washed her hair . then , he heard the hot water turn on as she brushed her teeth . when it was quiet once again in the bathroom , his heart stopped . he .staring at the closed door . when it opened , pesh ' s breath caught . so fresh - faced and beautiful , megan looked so young as she slowly stepped into the room . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' he asked . she blinked at his question . ` ` um , everything ' s fine . thank you again for the coffee and for letting me know . ' ' ` ` you ' re more than welcome . and there ' s no need to thank me . ' ' chewing on her lip , she looked from the door to him .
