he made it easy to open up to and approve of all the good and the bad in her life . he was such a good listener that she never felt like she was just hanging off and on him . he always seemed interested in everything she said . it was an amazing combination . ` ` you feeling okay out here ? ' ' pesh asked , pulling her out of her thoughts . she nodded . ` ` yeah . ' ' ` ` i wish you could see your face , ' ' he teased . ` ` do i have a funny face ? ' ' she laughed . ` ` it definitely ain ' t funny . it ' s wide - eyed , like a kid on christmas morning . ' ' ` ` yeah , i would definitely like that since this just sounds like a very exciting and very dangerous adventure . ' ' ` ` it ' s a wonderful thing to do . i ' m so glad to get to do this with you . ' ' he took one of her hands from the wheel and brought it to his mouth . when his lips brushed along her knuckles , she moaned . ` ` ' pull my hand away . ' ' don ' t feel like i have a good grip on the steering wheel like you think i should , ' ' shemr . pesh smiled and squeezed her hand . ` ` how i missed telling you that very thing , ' ' he said . she laughed . ` ` that ' s not going to try and distract me . i need to think , before we f ##n ' t talk . ' ' ` ` all right . i ' ll keep my thoughts to myself . . . for now . ' ' a thrill went through her at his words . at that moment if there was any reason not to just turn the plane and kiss him , she would have it . shaking her head , she tried convincing herself of her own thoughts . ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' she asked , pointing to a dark shape far off on the horizon . pesh leaned back in his seat , peering out the window . ` ` looks like a storm is moving in . ' ' ` ` we should head back now . ' ' he shrugged . ` ` i ' don ' t think it ' s going to bother us . ' ' ` ` yeah , well , i really don ' t like the idea of having to fly in a storm . ' ' ` ` ' we ' ll head back . ' ' ` ` which way should we turn the plane ? ' ' ` ` i '` ' a guess , ' ' pesh replied . megan shook her head and then turned the wheel at the same time she pressed on the left gas pedal with her foot . ` ` good . keep it steady . we ' re getting turned around . ' ' once they were facing the other way , pesh said , ` ` ` let ' s pick up the pace . ' ' she did as she was told and waited for him to give her some further instructions . ` ` we ' re good to go then . when we ' re about twenty minutes away from mccollum , you need to let the atc know we ' re coming back . ' ' ` ` okay . i can do that . ' ' ` ` do you have plans for this trip ? ' ' ` ` not that i know of . ' ' ` ` would you like to have dinner with me ? ' ' she chewed on her lower lip to keep from smiling at his question . ` ` i think so . can we get dessert first ? ' ' his body tensed beside her . ` ` are you suggesting that i ' m hungry , and that before we eat , i should make you dessert ? ' ' megan laughed . ` ` no , i want you for dessert . ' '` ` ' you can call him . tonight . ' ' smiling up at him , she said , ` ` i might have to ask for a to - do , since i ' m sure we ' ll have him with us . ' ' ` ` i ' don ' t mind . i like spending time with him . ' ' megan could couldn ' t keep the smile off her face at pesh ' s compliment . ` ` he really enjoys being with you , megan . i ' ve never seen him open up to a girl as much as he does to you . ' ' ` ` i ' m a good pilot , ' ' he replied . ` ` yes , you are , ' ' she agreed , trying not to let the out - of - control beat of her heart make her think more than she should about him . pesh interrupted her thoughts by moving to the controls . ` ` go ahead and start doing your landing checks . ' ' megan suddenly remembered what instruments and charts she had looked at before they took off . once she got through the landing checks with pesh ' s help , they started moving closer to mccollum . ` ` ` ' atc . ' ' ` ` um , yeah , ' ' megan replied , focusing on hersorry . " clearing his throat , megan glanced over at pesh . he pointed to the phone . ` ` uh , duh , ' ' she said . with her thumb , she pressed the push - to - talk button . ` ` this is cessna 172 coming in for landing . ' ' before she could ask pesh if she had heard him correctly , he sent a short message on his push - to - talk . the atc ' s voice came over her shoulder . ` ` cessna 172 , this is flight attendants , you are cleared to land . ' ' ` ` ` press on the button to start the engine , ' ' pesh instructed . as she did what she was told , her eyes focused on the screen . ` ` should we be picking up this wind speed ? ' '
