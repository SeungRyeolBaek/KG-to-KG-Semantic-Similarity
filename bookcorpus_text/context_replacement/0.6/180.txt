' the more i start to date , because we ' re breaking up now , i ' ll hate it when they get too clingy . ' ' a lump of emotion forms in my throat . ` ` so . . . ' ' ' you get clingy ? ' ' ` ` that ' e ' s a lie , ' ' he says , turning to me with a smile . ` ` well , i really don ' t think of you as clingy . you , either . ' ' ` ` gee , thanks , ' ' i say , rolling my eyes . ` ` so , how did it all happen ? lost your virginity ? ' ' he asks , turning to me and resting his chin on his hand . ` ` well , i guess it ' s not that bad . i ' ve never really dated . my first time was with this guy back in my junior year of high school . it was really long . and hot . his tongue just kind of slipped in and out of my mouth . and my sophomore year , and junior year of college , a few guys tried it out , but it never really went anywhere . i mean , they were nice , and i just wanted to get myself to school , and get a job and all that. ' ' ` ` did your mom put a lot of pressure on you to do anything in school ? ' ' i ask . ` ` the opposite , actually . she was always telling me to take my head out of a book and put on some lip gloss . which of course just made me want to put my head even deeper into a book . i just never wanted to end up like her . ' ' nate raises his eyebrows at me , and i shrug . ` ` i mean , hard on her . she never really knew how to do anything because she ' s so beautiful and smart and they would always do everything for her . but when i came around , they stopped being around so much , and she had to take care of herself all by herself . and then when they did , they ' d just leave , and she ' d be alone . sitting up in bed for hours , crying , trying to care for herself . . . ' ' ` ` and then you stopped taking care of her , ' ' he says . i nod . we settle back into the couch for a while . ` ` your mom should have known that not all men are created equal , though , ' ' nate says softly . ` ` some are created more so than others . ' ' ` `what ? ' ' i ask , with absolutely no idea what he ' s talking about . with a wicked grin , he leans over me and opens my bedside drawer . i gasp and slap his arm when i see his fingers hovering over my copy of lady chatterley ' s diary . then to my even more complete surprise , his hand stops my movements and returns to the drawer with my hot pink thong . ` ` oh my god , put that on ! ' ' he tells me , and studies me intently . my cheeks heat . ` ` ' i ' d like to see you put this on yourself , ' ' he says . my mouth drops open and he looks down at me , his eyes boring into mine . ` ` what do you think of that ? ' ' ` ` i . . . i really don ' t know , ' ' i reply . ` ` ' nothing , ' ' he tells me , putting the book in the drawer and turning back to me . ` ` okay , i ' ll do all the work . ' ' i gasp as i feel his fingers slide between my legs and brush against my clit . ` ` you have no idea how much it turns me on to be your partner for all of this . ' ' `` mmhm , ' ' i reply , and my eyelids flutter . no way can i focus on anything with his eyes right now . ` ` brynn , keep looking at me . ' ' ` ` why ? ' ' i ask . ` ` because i want to tease you , ' ' he replies simply . i bite my lip and turn my face up to him . his fingers stroke my swollen clit over and over again . ` ` i like it when you tease me around , ' ' i whisper , almost embarrassed to hear myself say such a thing out loud . his eyes narrow . ` ` you what ? ' ' ` ` ' in bed , ' ' i reply . i watch his pupils expand and his jaw muscles tense , as if he ' s fighting against a impending orgasm . he sucks in a breath of air and then blows it out of his mouth slowly . ` ` god , brynn , there are so many things i want to do to you . but we just don ' t always get from one to ten . ' ' i nod in agreement and then gasp when he slips a finger inside me . ` ` you ' re so wet already . you want round ten ? ' ' all i can do is nod in agreement . `` roll over , ' ' he orders me , and a wave of heat rushes through me . i comply , rolling over onto my right side so that my back ' s to him . he runs his hand over my stomach and then down between my legs and kisses me . i hear him fumble with his other hand and then the sound of his shirt being ripped open . ` ` lift your arms above your head , ' ' he orders me . i lift them over my head and onto the bed , bending my knees so that they ' won ' not touch the floor .
