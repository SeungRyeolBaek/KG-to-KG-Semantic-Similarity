we ' ve got a little surprise for you tonight . ' ' mason ' s eyes lit up . ` ` ` cweam ? ` ` ` yeah , there ' s tons of ice cream waiting for you . ' ' ` ` awesome ! ' ' aidan grinned . when they pulled up to mason ' s , megan did a double take at the sight of the large wooden boat sitting on the porch . mason , george , and georgie were all making good use of it . ` ` emma , the she - devil has arrived again , ' ' she announced . pesh grinned as they got out of the car . aidan continued to help her as she walked into the house . balloons and balloons decorated the kitchen and dining room . above the dining room table , there was a large uncle sam clock . when she got to the kitchen , she sucked in her breath at the sight of all the new equipment . ` ` emma rose , what have you done ? ' ' she asked . at the sound of megan ' s voice , emma jumped . clutching her stomach , she looked around . ` ` okay , so , i got a pretty good view of the crystal ball . oh , wow . ' ' megan crossed her arms over her chest . `` the what ? i thought you and my husband were friends . ' ' holding up a finger , emma said , ` ` ' williamson ##s bbq . nothing special . ' ' ` ` anything else i need to know about ? a celebrity or something coming out of a cave ? ' ' emma shrugged . ` ` nope . that ' s it . ' ' megan watched emma move around the table , picking up the plates and cups . ` ` um , is there anything i can do ? i mean , i feel pretty good . this is my sister ' s wedding day , ' ' megan said , with a smile . pink stained emma ' s cheeks . ` ` i ' m glad . ' ' megan wrapped her arms around emma and held her close . ` ` ' y ' all do good . you ' re going to do all of this for us . ' ' emma smiled . ` ` you ' re more than welcome . i ' m so happy for you and pesh and for us . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' when megan pulled away , emma said , ` ` now , there is something you should do . go tell aidan we ' re about to leave . he needs to wake her up from her nap . ' ' ` ` '. i ' ll be happy to . ' ' as megan walked down the long hallway , she stopped outside of aidan ' s old room . through the crack in the door , she could see him walking into the room , rolling around in his bed . at the sound of his voice , she had to suppress a laugh . aidan was many things , but a laugh ' wasn ' t one of them . ` ` sweet caroline , dum , dum , dum . your music never sounded so good , ' ' he sang off - key . when megan pushed open the door , aidan smiled . ` ` um , hey , ' ' he said , a blush on his cheeks . ` ` i never really knew you as a neil diamond fan , ' ' she said , with a smile . ` ` yeah , well , sweet caroline seemed like the right thing to say to her . ' ' aidan cleared his throat . ` ` what are you doing in here ? ' ' ` ` emma asked me to come get you . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she said . in his arms , she began to cry , her little arms shaking . ` ` shh , it ' s okay , sweet caroline . where am i ? ' ' ` `i ' ve been there , ' ' megan told him . ` ` good , ' ' aidan said , patting caroline ' s shoulder . when he came back out with the guitar , megan said , ` ` that ' s so sweet to treat her like that . ' ' as aidan looked at megan , caroline began to giggle . aidan ' s expression quickly turned serious . ` ` why ? she loves it when you talk to her . ' ' ` ` ' you ' n ' me do , ' ' megan said . aidan shrugged . ` ` it ' doesn ' t matter to her . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` she has a daddy with a terrible temper , and she refuses to talk to you ? ' ' with his trademark crooked grin , aidan said , ` ` what can i say ? all girls love you . ' ' with a roll of her eyes , megan said , ` ` give me a break . ' ' looking down at her , aidan asked in a sing - song voice , ` ` ' ' ' do you have the best , brightest , and most charming smile in the whole wide world ? ' ' caroline giggled at his words and kicked her feet . ` ` she ' s a smart girl because she knows how smart she is . ' ' `` you ' re beautiful , ' ' megan said , with a smile . aidan looked from his daughter back to megan . ` ` you want to make my own beautiful little girl ? ' ' ` ` i would love to . ' ' she held out her hand . aidan handed caroline to her . dressed in a deep purple dress and high heels , she looked like she could be modeling baby dolls . unlike caroline ' s long blond hair , hers was a dark brown . she had also inherited her mother ' s blue eyes . ` ` i have to say that you ' re a beautiful girl because you look just like your mother , ' ' megan said .
