as if he read her mind , pesh ' s mouth closed over hers . sticking her tongue out , she tried to taste his lips . when she did , he tasted like a combination of the wine and chocolate they ' d shared . his tongue came out to find her lips and his h * ps moved , pushing him against her . she followed his lead , pressing herself up against him to where her br * * sts were pressed against his chest . she moaned when he groaned into her mouth . his thumb rubbed back and forth between her shoulder blades , and she could couldn ' t help leaning into his touch . when he pulled back from their kiss , he kept his eyes locked on hers . she ' d never had a man look at her so intently . it was like he was trying to see through her to her very soul . it both excited and terrified her at the same time . it was all part of his usual seduction routine , and it was working . ` ` ' take me somewhere - somewhere we can be alone . ' ' his face grew serious . ` ` megan - ' ' she moved her hand from his chest to cover his mouth . ` ` please don ' t make me want to be with you again . ' ' shaking his head , he looked, ` ` ' ' can ' t resist you again , especially after having a taste of you . ' ' megan gasped at the intensity of both his words and the way he said them . taking her by the hand , he led her off the dance floor . they walked past the tables in the dining room until they reached the lobby . pushing through the crowd , they walked into the lobby that housed the inn . it was really more of a small bed and breakfast than a restaurant . as they approached the front desk , pesh released her hand to reach into his back pocket . when he found his keys , he walked over to the counter . ` ` i need a key please . ' ' ` ` credit card and cash please , ' ' the # ##keeper requested . as she sized him up , megan could couldn ' t help thinking he was incredibly handsome - the typical type of man who worked at a high - end hotel . ` ` would you like one of - ' ' ` ` a different size , ' ' pesh said through gritted teeth . ` ` do you need help with your luggage ? ' ' ` ` no , we ' don ' t have one . ' ' the clerk typed something into the computer . ` ` and how much isyou are coming with us ? ' ' ` ` as long as we live , ' ' pesh replied , drumming his fingers on the marble counter . megan watched as the man ' s eyes widened and a blush covered his cheeks . he quickly signed the check and handed pesh the credit card . ` ` we want you in one of our guest room suites . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' taking her by the hand , pesh led her out to the car . when megan turned to look over her shoulder , she saw the man staring down at them . as they stepped onto the sidewalk , megan could couldn ' t help the nervous giggle that escaped her lips . when pesh looked at her in surprise , she giggled even harder . ` ` what is it ? ' ' ` ` after the way that thing went down , he really thinks i ' m a prostitute . ' ' pesh ' s eyes widened . ` ` you really don ' t really believe that ? ' ' ` ` hmm , ` ` high - priced prostitute ? ' ' a chuckle came from deep in his chest . ` ` do not lower yourself like that . ' ' ` ` i ' m not lowering myself . think about it . we came here during the middle of the nightwith our parents , and we have a nice room with a king size bed . ' ' she tapped her lips with her finger . ` ` hmm , what could we possibly be doing ? ' ' the corners of his mouth turned up into a smile . ` ` i probably should care what the world thinks , but right now , i really ' don ' t give a shit . ' ' she laughed . ` ` me neither . ' ' the elevator chimed , signaling they had reached their floor . they stepped inside and followed the sign to find their room . when pesh opened the door , megan stepped inside . she took in the cozy feel of the room with its white walls , fireplace , and four - poster bed . going to a hotel could have been expensive , but this room had such a comfortable feel to it . when he came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist , she could couldn ' t help but feel better . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' he asked . ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' his breath blew against her ear . ` ` you shivered when i kissed you . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . i mean ##n ' i wanted to . i guess i ' m just tired . ' ' peshturned her back to face him . ` ` you really don ' t have anything to feel guilty about . if you r ##n ' t want to do this tonight , we ' don ' t have to . ' ' ` ` no , i want to do this , ' ' she told him . without another word , his hands went to her hair . when he released the strands , her hair fell down over her shoulders . an involuntary shudder went through her when he pressed his nose into the skin of her neck . from there he pulled out the knife at the small of her back .
