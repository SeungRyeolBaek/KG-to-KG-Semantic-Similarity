moving down his body , she moved her mouth to his cock and took him into her mouth . her tongue gently flicked over the tip . pesh ' s hands came to rest in her hair . she began slow moving up and down his length before taking him into her mouth . as she began moving up and down , pesh ' s groan echoed through the room . when she lifted her eyes up to him , he stared down at her with hooded eyes . ` ` so good , emma . so , so good , ' ' he groaned . when he started backing up , she let him slide out of her mouth . ` ` i want you to come for me , ' ' she whispered , as she crawled up his body . rising up on her knees , she guided pesh ' s hands to the elastic band of her panties . she slid them off her h * ps and down her legs . somehow she managed to pull them off and toss them to the floor beside the bed . taking off the condom , she brought his cock to her mouth . slowly , she went down on him , inch by inch . when he was buried deep inside her , she sat back on his hips . bending her knees , she propped both her feet up on the bed . fromthis time , she was giving pesh all the pleasure as she moved on and off of him . as the orgasm continued building inside her , the more frantic her movements became . harder and harder she came , the friction of skin meeting skin with moans and groans echoing around the room . when pesh ' s thumb began to rub her clit , she came again , crying out and collapsing onto his chest . he continued moving his h * ps to thrust into her until she came a few seconds later . pushing the hair out of her face , pesh looked down at megan with a dazed expression . she pressed her lips to his for a soft kiss . ` ` i love you , mr . nadeen . ' ' ` ` love you ? ' ' she shook her head . ` ` i love you and your talented hands and tongue , both of which give me incredible pleasure . ' ' he let out a laugh . ` ` i ' ve been such a beautiful woman , now haven ' t i ? ' ' ` ` yes , you have . ' ' ` ` i would s ' pose love you no other way , my love . ' ' megan smiled as he pulled out of her body . rolling her onto her back , pesh positioned himself over her , andhis lips brushed her hair . ` ` sleep well , ' ' he murmured , smiling . ` ` megan , you need your rest . i ' m going to see all of you in a little while . ' ' his words made her smile with happiness and anticipation . with the comfort of his arms wrapped around her , megan let her tired eyes close and drifted off to a deep sleep . chapter twenty - one as they sat in the courthouse waiting to be sworn in , megan touched aidan ' s black and white striped tie for the third time . ` ` megan , please , ' ' he begged . she pulled her hand away . ` ` i ' m sorry , baby . i ' ll leave you alone . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' he said , going back to his work on his paperwork . the problem was her nervous system seemed to be missing something . sensing her unease , pesh reached over and took her hand in his . ` ` relax . everything is going to be fine . ' ' megan wanted to believe him , but she could couldn ' t stop being nervous . she would won ' t be able to calm down until the ink had dried on the papers . her feet , clad in high heels , tapped impatiently on the floor. the final bell rang through the courtroom . as she looked at pesh and mason , megan had to smile . the two men in her life looked almost identical , with their dark suits and ties . of course mason ' s was much darker than pesh ' s . when the door opened and a clerk poked her head through the door , megan ' s heart started beating faster and faster . ` ` megan nadeen ? ' ' she stood from the chair . ` ` that ' s me . i mean , i ' m megan nadeen . ' ' the clerk smiled . ` ` you two can wait in here . ' ' taking a deep breath , megan reached for mason ' s hand . ` ` this is it , baby . ' ' she smiled and then looked up at pesh . ` ` you being my daddy today ? ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` yes , i ' m going to be your daddy for right now . ' ' they walked through the double doors of the courtroom . the judge , in his sleek black suit , looked down at them from his podium . ` ` good morning , ' ' he said , smiling . ` ` h - good morning , ' ' megan stammered . ` ` you know that we ' re here today to` for the adoption of the second child , mason and mckenzie ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' megan and pesh said . ` ` yes , we want to take you both in , ' ' the judge said . megan went through the motions of the hearing , trying hard to calm her nerves . when pesh had first suggested the idea of davis adopting mason , she too had been shocked and excited . but then she began to worry about whether davis would allow pesh to adopt mason or not .
