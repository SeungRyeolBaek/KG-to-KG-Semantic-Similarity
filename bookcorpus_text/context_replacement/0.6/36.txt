what followed was a two - year courtship and brief marriage . mia was accepted and loved by all of pesh ' s family . and then dev had gone and taken it all away by cheating on mia . despite her mistakes , mia had been true to pesh , and he wanted her to be happy more than anything else in the world . pesh would have liked to have been surprised by his brother ' s arrival , but ever since he had been able to see mia a few days ago , he had been expecting it . instead , he had been preparing himself for his brother ' s arrival . ` ` ' dev , ' ' he said , in a low voice . shaking his head slowly , dev said , ` ` i just got a f * * king messed up call from mia . when i tried calling her , to make she explain herself , she could ##n ' t answer because she was in california . with aj . ' ' ` ` yes , i ' m aware of that . ' ' dev ' s blue eyes widened at pesh ' s words . ` ` so it ' s true that you want to talk to her ? ' ' ` ` yes , it is . ' ' ` ` ' ' ##uld ' t do it . ' ' dev held up hishands in fists . ` ` i ' don ' t want to believe anything mia says , except that it was you who made her think that she should ' ' not give me a second chance and take me back - that she should make things right with aj . ' ' ` ` that ' s not true . you and i both know mia would never leave . ' ' ` ` ' how could you ? ' ' dev asked , in a low voice . ` ` i ' m sorry , but i tried to do what was best for mia . ' ' dev ' s eyebrows shot up . ` ` and what about me ? i ' m your f * * king friend . ' ' with a sigh , pesh said , ` ` i ' m sorry , my friend , but blood or not , i could ##n ' t stand by and let you hurt her again - she ' s been through so much . ' ' ` ` i love her ! ' ' dev shouted , which caused both of the men to turn around in surprise . ` ` this is neither the time nor the place to be having this conversation , ' ' pesh snapped . ` ` i ' m not going anywhere , so you better start explaining yourself before you two start a fight . ' ' pesh 'his brother . ` ` fine . you want the truth ? this is it . you both know you failed mia . you and i both know you could never be faithful to another woman . ' ' ` ` you could fall for mia . ' ' ` ` you already failed her once . she deserves better . ' ' dev rolled his eyes . ` ` what , are you f * * king her now ? ' ' aidan cringed at his brother ' s choice of harsh words . ` ` of course i ' m not . there ' s never been anything serious between mia and myself . now , she ' s sleeping with the man she loves - the father of her only child . ' ' ` ` ' you failed her , ' ' dev said , his voice taking on a hard tone . ` ` i ' m sorry , but i think it ' s best if you move on . first of all , little brother , i think you need to do a lot of soul searching and searching before you even think about getting into a relationship . ' ' dev ' s eyes widened . ` ` you . . . you f * * king bastard ! ' ' he shouted . pesh was considering calling security to arrest his older brother when he suddenly jerked on his heelsthen dev ' s right went to his jaw . he flew backward and crashed onto the floor . before dev could do something to catch him when he went down , megan appeared and put herself between them . ` ` i think you should leave before i call 911 , ' ' she said . pesh jumped to his feet as megan stepped into dev ' s line of vision . he could can ' t imagine if dev hurt her in his sleep or because she had stood up for him . dev looked down at megan with a smirk . ` ` so my brother has a good - sized pu * * y on him again ? ' to the wise , ' , ' no ' not wasting your time on him . he ' s obviously got a thing for his own wife . ' ' a low growl erupted from pesh ' s throat as he lunged for his brother . but he never made it . instead , megan ' s fist slammed into dev ' s jaw . the blow knocked ##n ' t ##le him off his feet , but he did stumble back . even as she whipped her head back and forth from the searing pain , megan still managed to say , ` ` get the hell out of here . now . ' ' dev stared at her in disbelief as he staredhis mother . ` ` ' fuck , ' ' he muttered , before turning away . when megan got to him , her angry expression changed to one of horror . ` ` you ' re bleeding ! ' ' she cried , reaching for him . his hand flew up to touch his cheek . relief filled him when he felt it . dev must ' ve hit him harder than he thought . he shook his hand back and forth , causing him to wince at the stinging sensation . ` ` come on , ' ' megan said , taking his hand . she started leading him off to one of the other rooms , but he pulled back . ` ` ' ' don ' t need all this blood .
