what do you think ? ' ' ` ` ' thanks , mom , ' ' i say half - heartedly . if she notices my emotional state , she ' doesn ' t show it , she just sends me off into the kitchen to show me the delicious meal she ' s spent the day preparing . when nate gets home a half an hour later , he immediately starts his meal , only to say that he has to make a quick call . my mom asks me to bring the stuffed animal over on a silver tray , and i decline , afraid she ' ll feel too guilty to get involved when she ' s spending so much money on the food . when i go back into the kitchen , pierce is whispering into my mom ' s ear while she eats , so i go back outside again . i see nate coming through the front door , and he walks into the living room just as i ' m sitting on the arm of my chair . ` ` hey , ' ' he says with a smile . ` ` i was worried about you - ' ' he breaks off when my mom and i walk in . nate grabs a bottle of wine and moves around filling up our wine glasses . i turn back to give him a small smile , and then wewe sit down and nate starts picking up his empty glass . ` ` so , ' ' he says . i feel his eye contact as we both raise our glasses . nate looks at me , and i know he can tell there ' s something wrong . ' hell , i do ##n ' t even think about talking to him again today . he can always tell when i ' m nervous , and i # don ' t know what i ' m going to say . ` ` brynn , did you send those letters like i asked ? ' ' he asks , turning to me . ` ` what ? ' ' i ask , surprised by his question . ` ` the envelope . i wanted to double check because you ' ve been so quiet lately , and they ' re so important . ' ' i stare at him . what the hell ? ` ` you do ##n ' t ask me to send anything else , pierce . ' ' ` ` brynn , ' ' he says in a low tone , setting down his empty glass . ` ` you fucking don ' t ! ' ' i say , a little more loudly than i meant to . i look at nate and see him raise his eyebrows at me . ` ` you know that i did . and it ' s' ` this is the first time this has happened , ' ' he says . ` ` maybe we should - ' ' my mother cuts in . ` ` no , mom , ' ' i say to her , holding up my hand . ` ` i really really don ' t know what you ' re talking about here . ' ' ` ` well , this ain ' t ' t the place to discuss this , but since you ' re with me , i ' ve heard from members of your extended family that you have y ' all being held responsible . ' ' ` ` what ? for what ? when ? ' ' ` ` ` the family don ' t give you birth dates , and they want to protect their privacy - ' ' ` ` wait . no , ' ' i say , setting down my fork . ` ` you are seriously making all this up , now aren ' t you ? ' ' ` ` brynn , calm down , ' ' nate says from across the table . ` ` calm down ? why ? he ' s dangerous ! ' ' ` ` he has no right to - ' ' nate says . ` ` he damn well does . he dragged me into his office , and down my pants , and i told him to back off , and` he ' s right . ' ' ` ` you know that ' s because i was wrong about those bruises on your face , brynn . please don ' t get upset . ' ' ` ` you ' re a liar , ' ' i snap . he slams his fist down on the table , causing me to jump . ` ` i will not be spoken to that way in my own home ! ' ' i look back and forth between my dad and nate , confused . are they really just going to sit there staring at me ? i stand up so fast that my chair almost falls with it . i do don ' t like being surrounded by this stupid bullshit . i walk slowly around the table and back to the front door , clenching my fists to try to contain my anger until i ' m done . when i slam the door behind me , i pick up my pace , walking quickly down the driveway and out of the house . the woods follow , thick and dark around me . tears of frustration and anger begin to stream down my face . ' ' don ' t care where i ' m going - i just want to get away from that house . ` ` hey ! hey ! ' ' i hear a man ' s voice call out behind me , but i keep walking . `` you ' re brynn , right ? ' ' i nod and take a deep breath before turning around . ` ` well , if you ' re a reporter or something , i ' m really not in the mood . ' ' i can almost see her blonde hair in the light as she takes a few steps forward . ` ` i ' m not a reporter . i ' m nate ' s sister , eileen . ' ' chapter twenty - two ` ` emma . . . are you okay ? ' ' she asks , taking a step toward me . ` ` i ' m , i ' m just - ' ' i break off as a sob escapes my throat .
