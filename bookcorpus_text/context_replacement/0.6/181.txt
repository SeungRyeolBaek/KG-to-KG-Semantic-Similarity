i feel his erection pressing hard against my ass , his long legs almost wrapping themselves around me , and pinning me to the bed . his other hand slips inside of me and pulls my hips back toward him . i start to tremble with anticipation , but i don ' t have to wait very long . i feel his fingers stretching my opening , pushing into me as he holds me in place . i cry out from pain and pleasure . he rubs the way he had the first time , but unlike that time , the sensation is more intense and intense . i feel his breath in my ear . ` ` you like that ? ' ' ` ` yes , oh god , yes , ' ' i whisper . he pushes into me again . ` ` it ' s so hard to hold back with you , ' ' he says , almost to himself . ` ` you really don ' t have to , ' ' i reply . i hear him grunt in pain and push into me again . then i feel myself being lifted up and spun around . before i know it , i ' m on my hands and knees without nate and i am losing it . i have to bite my lip to stop myself from crying out in pain as he pulls out and pushes back in . it ' sjust so deep inside , pressing hard against my g - spot with every thrust . my body starts to shake with my orgasm and this time , i let myself go with it . i feel nate ' s hands pull my hips up to meet his with every thrust as he comes with me . my walls shut down with the f ##ity of my orgasm , and nate collapses on top of me , gently kissing the side of my neck . ` ` fuck , brynn , i ' m sorry , ' ' he whispers , as he brushes my hair out of my face . ` ` sorry ? why are you sorry ? ' ' i ask , confused . ` ` you ' re right . . . i ' m so sorry . i was too rough , i went too far , i - ' ' he goes on , sounding breathless . my brain tries to catch up with him . ` ` no , no . it # didn ' t hurt . i did ##n ' t even know i was coming . everything was fine . ' ' his body stills against mine . ` ` i was just scared for a second there . i thought i lost you . ' ' ` ` no , no . . . ' ' i reach up to touch my face , and he ' s there - mythey were different . ` ` that ' s just it . this ' doesn ' t happen a lot ? ' ' he pushes himself up so he can look at me with an amused expression . ` ` i always try not to make you nervous , brynn . ' ' i smile . ` ` i ' m sorry , i just thought . . . i wondered if this happens to other people . i guess it just doesn ' t . . . . you know , letting go of things like that . all the other stuff . . . ' ' ` ` okay . ' as long as you ' re ok . ' ' ` ` i ' m more than ok , ' ' i tell him . ` ` really ? ' ' i ask . ` ` a little . ' ' ` ` i ' ll get you some water , ' ' he says , kissing the back of my neck before gently pulling out of me . he comes back from the bathroom with a water for me , and curls up in bed with me as i drink it . ` ` i wish you could be here , ' ' i say , resting my head on his chest . i am exhausted , exhausted . . . and happy . ` ` me too . ' ' chapter twenty - one the next morning , i wakestill waiting for nate , but he ' s gone . i roll over onto my side in bed . i thought that after we had sex my need for him would ease a little , become more intense , but it ' s even stronger now . even though i still feel a little heat and pressure between my legs , i want him to touch me again , and again , and again . i look at the clock and am surprised to see it ' s almost nine . well , i guess i did have a bad day today , after almost falling down that stairs and losing my cast . i crawl under the covers to the side of the bed and sit down on the edge . i stretch my shoulders and find that there ' s hardly any pain , but i know i should take the cast off for one more day just to be sure . i shower and pull on a pair of yoga pants and a t - shirt and go down to the kitchen and make myself some breakfast . my mother walks in just as i ' m sitting down at the breakfast bar . ` ` wow , that ' s a lot of food , brynn , ' ' she says , raising her eyebrows at the mess of eggs and bacon on my plate . ` ` thanks , ' ' i say , but only becausejust trying to shovel food into my mouth . ` ` i can see that . how ' s your head ? ' ' ` ` much better . ' ' i clear my throat . i have to stop acting weird . my mother must know something ' s up . i put down my fork . ` ` did you have a nice lunch with pierce today ? where ' d you go ? ' ' ` ` the restaurant , ' ' she says . ` ` it was great . pierce is a regular there and he has the best food . ' '
