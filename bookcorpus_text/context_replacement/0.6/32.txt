he loved aidan and emma ' s company , and he also loved being with them , even though they were six months apart . she grabbed him and his book bag and then made her way up the front steps . emma opened the door with noah on her heels . ` ` hey , i ' m so glad you could make it . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` you should know by now i have no plans except for school and work . ' ' ` ` i feel the same way too , ' ' emma said , as megan walked through the door . as she walked through the kitchen and down the hall to the kitchen , noah struggled to get up . after she set him on his feet , she walked into the living room . that ' s where aidan was sitting on the couch with beau on the floor next to him . ` ` aidan ! ' ' he exclaimed . he leaned over to pet the little dog . megan never had to worry about beau and aidan ; aidan was always a gentle giant when it came to dogs and children . beau flicked his tail happily at the dog . aidan looked up from the floor and smiled . ` ` hey , how are you ? ' ' she asked as she reached up to stroke his cheek . ` ` ' good .and you ? ' ' ` ` yep . looking forward to spending a week ' s time with the kids . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` well , with the kids around you , let ' s see how much fun you ' ll have . ' ' aidan grinned . ` ` it ' s good news for you when the next baby gets here . ' ' ` ` ready or not ? ' ' she asked . with his eyes wide , he quickly added , ` ` ' okay . that was fast , thank you . ' ' shaking her head , she then asked , ` ` and when is the ultrasound to confirm the first ##born child is on her own ? ' ' aidan asked exasperatedly . ` ` not for a few more days , smart - ass . ' ' she put her hand to her mouth in mock horror . ` ` it was just a joke . ' ' ` ` ' and since you ' ve been a father yourself , i ' m sure you know all too well exactly what exactly the sex change is . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i just think it ' s fitting that i ' ll be the oldest son , and she ' ll be the youngest . ' ' with a pained expression , aidan said , ` ` oh . ' ' she laughed##ffled his slightly swollen bald head gently . ` ` congratulations , mason . you ' re going to be an amazing father to that little girl . she ' ll probably have you wrapped around her waist before she ' s even out of the room . ' ' ` ` a man like you , or i guess i should say , a man like you used to be , does not need to bring his child into the world . ' ' ` ` life is a bitch , ' ' she teased . ` ` ' don ' t i know it , ' ' he muttered . emma came into the living room first . she handed one to aidan along with a beer . ` ` you sure you ' ll be all right here ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll be fine - we ' ll be fine . wo ##t ' t we promise ? ' ' he looked up from peeking around the corner of megan ' s couch . ` ` yes ! ' ' ` ` good . stop worrying . ' ' he gave emma a very serious look before saying , ` ` a promise is a promise after all . ' ' she blushed a little at his words , but she gave him a small smile . when he winked back at her , megan could couldn ' t help feeling her chest tighten .the truth . seeing her former man - whore husband as a loving , devoted husband and father was still so surreal . but deep down , it confirmed how much she had missed what aidan and emma had . love , passion , and passion from you . and something else to share with you . if you really wasn ' t so young you could probably have something more like aidan and emma had with pesh ! but seriously , you need to stop thinking that you ' re too young to get married . you ' re just taking away everything with your parents , because you ' re not . emma snapped her out of her self - righteous thoughts . ` ` ' what should we do today ? ' ' she asked , as they pulled into the driveway . ` ` draw and paint ? ' ' megan nodded . ` ` mmm , that sounds good . ' ' they both climbed into emma ' s car . as megan buckled up , emma turned to her . ` ` i hope you two don ' t mind that casey is joining us for dinner ? ' ' ` ` of course not . the more the better . besides , casey is a sweetheart . ' ' emma laughed and fired up the engine . ` ` that she is . ' ' before casey , they' going into starbucks to get some coffee for megan and something for emma . ' they walked around the corner to the hair salon . after some hair and makeup , they took the twenty minutes to meet casey at their small , italian restaurant that was set inside an old gas station . as they pulled up , they saw casey standing out on the street texting . ` ` hey casey ! ' ' emma said . casey waved to them before rising from the chair . ` ` oh , hi . ' ' a round of glances was exchanged between the two girls .
