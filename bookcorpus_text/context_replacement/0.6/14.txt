megan squeezed her eyes shut . the room was starting to spin around her a bit . as she put her hand to her head , she heard a crash across the room and aidan yelling , ` ` ow , dammit , ow ! ' ' ` ` that bottle is one hundred and fifty percent alcohol , aidan , ' ' emma said . ` ` sorry . i ' didn ' t know that . i just thought it was the right choice because it was straight alcohol . that ' s your drug of choice , not tequila . ' ' oh god , she was in so much pain . she ' d not consumed straight alcohol since she got pregnant and then died . but she ' d consumed a straight drink , and half a full bottle of straight tequila . a warm hand landed on her shoulder . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' pesh asked . she opened her eyes to see two different versions of him looking at her with concern . ` ` not really . ' ' ` ` would you like me to take you home ? ' ' ` ` yes , please . but i can barely walk . ' ' as she got out of her chair , she stumbled a bit in her seat . after taking two steps , aidan ' s concerned face appeared beside her . ` `i ' m sorry , meggie . ' ' ` ` it ' s not your fault . and you ' ll be fine . ' ' she crooked her finger at him . ` ` ' when i get busted for coming home late , i ' m not telling you it was your fault . ' ' he laughed . ` ` i ' ll just take the blame and risk angie ' s wrath . ' ' he leaned down to kiss her . ` ` thanks for everything - you know , for being mason ' s wife . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome . sorry for not asking you . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` i mean , thanks for asking me . ' ' okay , this was it . after exchanging hugs with emma and telling her at least three times that she would be fine and that she would need to go home , pesh walked megan to the front door . he wrapped a strong arm around her waist to steady her as they walked up the porch steps . as she walked to the door , she spoke . ` ` i ' n ' t go home tonight . not like this . ' ' she looked up into his eyes . ` ` ` ca ##uld ' t let you see me like this . ' ' she brushed a strand ofget out of her way . ` ` ` don ' t worry . i ' ll take you to my house tomorrow . ' ' ` ` ` so i can clean up ? ' ' she nodded , although she really did don ' t like it . she wanted to go to his house for a bit longer , especially after being so close to his well defined body . ` ` yes , of course . i ' ll make you some strong , hot tea . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' she said , trying to control the shaking of her hands . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ever the gentleman , pesh opened the door for her , and she slid onto the seat . once he was sure she was comfortable , he closed the door and walked around the front of the car . megan looked around at the spacious interior of the car with black leather seats and center console . as pesh slid into his car , he turned the key in the ignition and turned it . as they were pulling out of the driveway , she looked over at him . ` ` ' you have to come to the holy mother of god . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` you mean , who drinks hot tea ? ' ' she laughed . no , " she said##urring ? he cut his eyes over to her and frowned . he seemed to be trying very hard not to look at her . ` ` not really . but i ' m always happy to help a woman in distress . ' ' megan laughed . oh god , now she was laughing ? she actually was . she eyed pesh suspiciously . ` ` ' ' hero worship , huh ? wan na be every woman ' s knight in shining armor ? ' ' ` ` ' every woman ' s , ' ' she whispered . ` ` mmm , pesh , you wan na be my knight in shining armor ? ' ' as soon as the words left her mouth , she fought the urge to slap her hand over her mouth . he always had this effect on her - he left her feeling without a clue . pesh ' s jaw clenched , and he mouthed don ' t answer . leaning her upper body against the seat , she leaned as close to him as she could . ` ` you ? ##n ' ` answer my question . ' ' taking his eyes back from the road , he pinned her with his intense stare . ` ` i ' d be anything and everything you want me to be , if you would give me the chance . ' ' still stunned , she could only nodfuck him . ` ` ' god , ' ' she said , as she fell back onto the bed . the movement caused her to feel dizzy . then almost absently , she said , ` ` mmm , sexy as f * * k and anything you want . fuck you . ' ' ` ` i had a feeling you would ##n ' d have answered the same question if you were ' ' ' drunk . ' ' with a smile , she said , ` ` drunk or not that woulda been one helluva thing to hear from a woman . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad you think so . ' '
