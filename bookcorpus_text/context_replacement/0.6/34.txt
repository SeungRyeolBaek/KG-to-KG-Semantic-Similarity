` ` i ' d really hope so . ' ' ` ` ' what ' s wrong with having an early dinner and watching a movie ? ' ' casey shrugged . ` ` because that ' s not fair to him . you ' d just be leading him on , and i think we can both agree that he should . ' not want that . ' ' ` ` maybe , ' ' emma said . tilting her head , casey eyed megan warily . ` ` deep down , you like him , ' don ' t you ? ' ' megan rolled her eyes . ` ` of course i do . everyone likes him . ' ' ` ` no , you just like him . you find yourself thinking about him more than you should . and you ' re just glad you were ##n ' ing like a smart girl about dating him . because even though you ' d like to know how much he loves his wang , you ' re even more surprised by what being rejected by him would be like . ' ' stunned , megan could only stare at casey . she ' d just hit the nail on the head with her feelings . finally , she spoke . ` ` look , it ' s a no - strings situation . i ' m a college student . i just ##uld ' t get involved with anyoneno . it just would ##n ' t look good on my face . that ' s just one of the many reasons it would ##n ' t work for me . ' ' ` ` yeah . you just keep telling yourself that . ' ' ` ` can ' t ' t we talk about something else ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` who ' s up for a drink before we hit the road ? ' ' emma asked . megan bit her lip . ` ` well , i really don ' t know if i should have gone that far . i ' don ' t want to take advantage of casey ' s motives for helping us . ' ' emma shook her head . ` ` ` wo ##n ' t care . he ' s going to do it . ' ' when megan raised her eyebrows again , casey shrugged . ` ` ' i mean , you like him enough to ask him to make out a perfectly good movie to two kids who are only five . ' ' a warm flush warmed emma ' s cheeks . ` ` i really don ' t know what you ' re talking about . ' ' casey laughed . ` ` ' emma , you are so funny ! ' ' leaning forward , she leaned her elbows on the table and stared intently at emma . ` ` ' whatgot it ? green eyes ? a blow job ? or a b * * w j * b while wearing green clothes ? ' ' turning to meet casey ' s questioning gaze , emma quietly said , ` ` there was a b * * w j * b in the shower this morning , right ? ' ' casey nodded . ` ` i knew you had seen something . hmm , that was weird . it was like playing a little game of chance - it was emma in the shower with a blow job . ' ' megan threw her hands up to cover her mouth . ` ` umm , what ? that ' s my boyfriend you ' re talking about . ' ' ` ` oh , okay . i ' ll refrain from making any inappropriate comments about aidan and emma ' s sex life . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' megan and emma said in unison . ` ` ' and a date night ? ' ' casey asked . megan simply nodded . ` ` i ' ll just tell you later if he gets too pissy . ' ' casey laughed . ` ` ' ' emma . but you can take it out on her . . . . in the bedroom . ' ' ` ` i fucking hate you , ' ' emma said . laughing , the twothat , and the sex - related conversation was over . at least for the moment . chapter 8 rubbing his hand over his sweaty forehead , pesh leaned back against the glass wall of the waiting room . as the adrenaline was draining from his body , he had to lean against something hard for support . regardless of how emotionally drained he felt , he was still on cloud nine . a huge smile lit up his face as he stared across the room at the screen . on screen , a young woman was getting married with her first baby . she had been rushed home . fifteen minutes later , a car accident sent her into early labor . the doctors had put her through the rough stuff , but luckily , they had made it to the hospital in time . because her pregnancy was due early , they obviously hadn ' t been taking her directly to the labor and delivery room . instead , they ' d brought her in , and pesh had gone to her . it truly was an amazing experience . he ' d only seen three pregnant women in the course of his medical career . this one was an experience he enjoyed . the woman looked up at him and smiled . ` ` thank you so much , dr . nadeen . ' ' ` ` you ' re very welcome . theyshould be getting you up to bed in just a few minutes . ' ' as he stepped out of the elevator , he found himself greeted by kara , one of the other nurses . ` ` hey honey . how ' s the new doctor doing today ? ' ' the way she spoke was more of a question , which was a pretty apt description since she always acted like she was a cat in heat anytime he was around . he smiled as she ran her hand down his arm . ` ` everything ' s fine , thank you . how are you ? ' ' he asked her . ` ` i ' m better now that i ' ve seen you , ' ' she replied .
