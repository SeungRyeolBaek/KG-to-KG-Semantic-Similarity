` ` maybe , he did . i ' m not sure . but , he looked just like him when he was his age . ' ' i watch nate come out of the shower at my father ' s head and dry himself off . i force myself to look down at my feet as he walks over to the kitchen chair and sits down . ` ` what happened to nate ' s mother ? ' ' my mom asks . ` ` nothin ' . ' nothin ' really to talk about it - too much . anyway , she cheated on him and then left him and nate . they barely knew her . ' ' ` ` wow , that ' s awful , ' ' i say , trying to push away the wave of sympathy i feel for my own mother . ` ` i think that ' s one of the things that brought us together - raising a family by ourselves . ' ' my eyes dart to the door as nate pushes it open . he ' s put his shirt back on and has clung to his still tan skin , exposing his muscular chest and stomach . he drops his feet to the floor as he closes the door behind him . ` ` hey nate , ' ' my mom asks him . ` ` would you like a drink ? ' ' `` you do don ' t have to say that , ' ' he says , a little embarrassed . ` ` i would ##n ' t mean at all , ' ' she says , starting to move closer to the table . she smiles , and sits in her empty chair a little closer . ` ` it ' s so strange that you and brynn never spoke at all ! ' ' ` ` i thought there might have been a time - ' ' he begins , looking at me , that same mischievous gleam still in his eyes . i feel his knee come to rest against mine under the table , and i instinctively cross my legs . ` ` same time . we have been in a lot of the same classes together , ' ' i say , narrowing my eyes at him . ` ` we have ? ' ' he asks , genuinely surprised . my father carefully spreads cheese on a piece of bread on the kitchen table . ` ` yes , ' ' i say , embarrassed . of course he would ##n ' t mean any of the times we ' ve been in the same class - including the time when i approached him in the back of his classroom and then stopped myself . i sigh . i want to melt into this soft cushion and disappear . he smiles at me and shakes his head' and pretend to laugh at being asked . ` ` oh hi , nate , you ' ll start your classes on monday , right ? that ' ll give you a few days to settle in , ' ' my mom says as she places the sandwich in front of nate . ` ` sounds good , ' ' i reply , glancing at nate out of the corner of my eye . ` ` i ' m having her over for dinner tomorrow night , ' ' she says , smiling . ` ` oh , right . a friend from around here ? ' ' ` ` not a friend , no . a girl i met in high school , ' ' nate replies . i keep my eyes focused straight ahead . ` ` do you know if she has mental health problems ? ' ' my mom asks , immediately jumping into mom mode . ` ` we could set this up while my dad is out , and . . . ' ' i tune out as she discusses her options , and finish off my sandwich as quickly as possible so i can excuse myself and go home . i sigh as i close my bedroom door behind me . right now i want to have dinner with nate ' s ex - girlfriend . is this what the rest of the week is going to be like ? nate asked me forhis father ' s punishment for ignoring my attraction to him ? i ' d rather be back in the library , lost in a book . chapter twelve i push the fried chicken around my plate as i try not to watch nate throw his leg over the back of mom ' s chair . she ' s pretty . really pretty . and sweet . i wish she was wasn ' t so pretty so i could kiss her for some stupid reason . ` ` ' how long did you guys date ? ' ' my dad asks . ` ` well , it was on and off , but . . . hard to say . he probably went to school with one of my friends , ' ' she says , still eyeing nate , who at least has the grace to blush . ` ` nate . . . ' ' his dad says , shaking his head admonishingly . ` ` no , it ' s okay . he went with one of his friends , ' ' he says with a smile . ` ` i think we both know it probably wasn ' t meant to be . ' ' ` ` a lot of my friends had their dates in high school , ' ' my mom says , tapping her fork on her plate . ` ` ' i read an article once that saidthat ninety - five percent of them have their dates in vegas . ' ' she looks up at me and i stand up . ` ` i ' ll pass , ' ' i say . i have a feeling i know where this conversation is going and i need to stop it . ` ` why , thank you , brynn , ' ' nate says , as we place the plates on top of one another . ` ` no problem , ' ' i reply . ` ` i waited tables in high school . ' ' ` ` thanks , ' ' nate says , as i move in front of him to take his plate .
