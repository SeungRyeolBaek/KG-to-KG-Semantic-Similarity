` ` uh , sorry , i should ##a ' not everyone does that , ' ' megan muttered under her breath . ` ` my dad ? ' ' ` ` he ' s at the house with mom . we ' ll meet you there in the morning , ' ' she added . that comment caused noah ' s lip to quiver . before he could start crying , pesh jumped out of his seat . ` ` let ' s go look at all the new christmas decorations . ' ' megan smiled as she watched pesh take off from the room . her heart melted at his enthusiasm . she could don ' t believe there was ever a time when she doubted her feelings for him . he was ' ' ot no other man in the entire world , and the fact that he loved her was a wonderful gift . by the time pesh returned , noah had fallen asleep . he gently laid noah down beside her . ` ` hmm , ' ' she murmured , pulling off her wedding dress . she draped the material over him like a blanket . ` ` did i mention how much i love you in that blanket ? ' ' pesh asked , with a mischievous gleam in his eye . she glanced down to see the hem of her dress peeking out the side as well as the hemher purse was still full . ` ` i ' ll have to buy one more dress for you . ' ' ` ` i would love that . ' ' when her phone rang , she reached across the table and grabbed it . ` ` oh my god ! ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` that was aidan . the baby is right here . ' ' ` ` if it ' s a new baby , that probably ain ' t too bad . ' ' ` ` i have to call my uncle and aunt . ' ' julia nodded . ` ` come on . we ' re ready . ' ' megan looked at caroline sleeping peacefully against pesh ' s chest . ` ` be right back . ' ' she made her way over to her family ' s table . ` ` that was aidan . he was just here . ' ' a cheer went up around the table . ` ` is emma okay ? ' ' becky asked . megan nodded . ` ` he said you and emma are doing great . ' ' julia shook her head and smiled . ` ` aidan with a baby - now that ' s going to be something to see . ' ' they all laughed . ` ` that ' s not funny , ' ' megan said . becky .at the hospital . ` ` ' ' don ' t we go see them ? i mean , the hospital ' s ' not that far from here . ' ' angie nodded . ` ` sounds good to me . i ' d really like to see aidan in bed with his baby girl . ' ' with a smile , megan said , ` ` i would have loved to see him in the delivery room when she was first born . his face alone would have been amazing . ' ' ` ` i bet you would , ' ' liz said . ` ` oh yeah , he cried for hours , ' ' angie added , with a smile . as her sisters were packing up their things and telling their parents where they were going , megan said , ` ` i want to go home . ' ' before they could argue , she held up her hand . ` ` it ' s okay . the summer is pretty much over , and there ' s one party this weekend at one of pesh ' s friends ' house . besides , i want to see the new ' baby girl . ' ' her aunt nodded . ` ` are you sure ? ' ' ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' ` ` all right . you call pesh , and we ' ll get you athanks . ' ' she smiled as she walked over to their table . ` ` my uncle and i are going to the hospital to see aidan and emma . ' ' ` ` you want to come ? ' ' her heart melted at the fact that he already knew what she was thinking . ` ` do you mind ? ' ' he shook his head . ` ` of course not . can i come , or is this just a pity party just for the kids ? ' ' she laughed . ` ` no , you can go . ' ' pesh looked down at noah . ` ` he ' s going to hospital to see his uncle . ' ' ` ` oh god . i really don ' t think we could leave without him . ' ' when pesh got out of the car , noah stirred but he don ' t wake up . ` ` take aidan and emma ' s keys out of my pocket . ' ' she smiled and reached into his pants . when she gently stroked his cock through the fabric , he groaned . ` ` sorry about that , ' ' she said , as she pulled out the keys . ` ` no problem , ' ' he said through gritted teeth . they said a quick goodnight to pesh ' s parents and other guests who arrived . then they walkedthen to the hotel . after giving the driver aidan ' s address , they waited for the car to be brought around . when she saw her reflection in the glass doors of the elevator , she gasped . ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` the necklace ! ' ' can ' t go running off with this stupid necklace to the police ! ' ' she exclaimed . she took off the earrings and quickly began working on the necklace . ` ` i ' ll just go give it to your mother . ' ' ` ` if you insist , ' ' pesh said . she kicked off her shoes so she could work faster . the necklace and earrings fell from her neck .
