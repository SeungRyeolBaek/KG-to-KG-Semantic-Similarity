pesh laughed . ` ` i guess you are if you think that ' s mia ' s idea . ' ' ` ` that sounds pretty cool . i love that idea . ' ' ` ` i ' ll see if i can get you an audition . ' ' with a smile , megan said , ` ` really ? that would be great . ' ' ` ` anything for the girl who is willing to risk her life for you . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` it was fun . ' ' ` ` what about your face ? ' ' ` ` i ' m not going to lie . it hurt . i can remember what punching someone felt like . ' ' pesh could couldn ' t stop his eyebrows from rising in surprise . ` ` have you done a lot of boxing ? ' ' she asked . ` ` not exactly mma material , am i ? ' ' when he just shook his head , she added , ` ` i might have thrown a few punches in my early teenage ##d days when some guy crossed his bounds . ' ' with a smile , pesh said , ` ` good for you . ' ' ` ` yeah , my dad was really keen on teaching me self - defense techniques . you know , with him being ex - con. ' ' pesh could t ' not help admiring megan ' s beauty and charm . he ' hadn ' not met a lot of women like her . in his world , women were supposed to be sweet and innocent . even if she really ain ' t one , she would ' ve never thought of throwing a fight to help him against dev . but megan , she was so amazing with her ability to stand up for herself and others - to speak her mind whether it was good or bad . ` ` you would have made your father very happy too . ' ' ` ` thank you . i ' m sure later on , when my ribs are bruised , he ' ll want to know why . ' ' ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' he took her hand in his , bringing it to his lips . ` ` it ' s a medicine to make the pain go away . ' ' she gave him a small smile . ` ` is that the best medicine you can offer , dr . nadeen ? ' ' his mind was spinning with the possibilities of all the ` ` healing ' ' and ` ` love ' ' he could offer her . a simple medicine to ease her pain was all he could really offer . his phone went off .he could tell . ` ` i should go . ' ' he pushed off the bed and headed for the door . as his hand hovered over the knob , there were so many things he wanted to say to her . but instead , he just said , ` ` thanks again for taking care of me . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ` ` and you should probably wash your hands during your shift tomorrow . ' ' ` ` yes sir , ' ' she replied , with a mock salute . he shook his head at her with a smile before walking out the door . chapter 8 days turned into weeks as megan immersed herself in her clinicals . each day she had a new challenge to face . she hadn ' ' t realized how late it would be , or how tired she would be on time when she fell into bed . but it was a new challenge because she was doing what she did when she was supposed to do . each day , she spent more and more time with pesh . she loved working beside him on staff . he had the perfect bedside manner of all the nurses and doctors . everyone , both young and old , loved him . and the more she worked with him , the more megan came to love him as well . she hadjust outside the emergency room where they had talked a little girl into not letting them take the medicine they needed when kristi called her from down the hall . after agreeing to meet kristi , megan was immediately ushered into one of the waiting rooms . instantly , her entire body shifted nervously as she braced herself for what she would see . ` ` ambulance , ambulance , ambulance ##nal , ' ' the woman said , rattling off her name and other details . once megan had collected the information , she turned to the nurse . ` ` hi , i ' m megan . i ' m going to put your iv in . ' ' the nurse gave megan a warm smile . ` ` i ' m mary . ' ' ` ` i guess it would be fair to say it ' s nice to meet you , huh ? ' ' megan asked , trying to speak as softly as she could to put the patient at ease . ` ` yeah , i guess so , ' ' mary replied . when megan reached for mary ' s arm to find a place for the iv , she winced . ` ` ouch . ' ' as megan examined the wound , she shook her head . ` ` looks like you ' ve got a scar there . ' ' ` ` my name iswhy ? ' ' she asked in a whisper . ` ` we wo ##n ' t stop until we get you into x - rays . i ' m going to stick this needle deep into your vein . ' ' the needle went right into the vein , and megan started the machine . pesh appeared in the doorway again . he looked at mary on the bed . ` ` hi , mary , i ' m dr . nadeen . i understand you had a car accident today ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` this ball came out of nowhere and hit me square ##ly . ' ' ` ` i ' m so sorry . ` ' ' ' do we start with you showing us where it hit ? ' '
