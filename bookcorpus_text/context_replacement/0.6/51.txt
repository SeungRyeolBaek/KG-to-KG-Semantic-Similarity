lewis chuckled . ` ` you ' ve got the whole sex thing replaced with what it really is . ' ' megan pursed her lips at him as her mind raced with the possibilities . after all , if having sex with pesh was really as bad as his attempts at going down on her , she was a very lucky woman . ` ` i guess you ' ll just have to excuse me . ' ' they were greeted by an air traffic controller with a smile . ` ` hey , dr . nadeen , how was it ? ' ' ` ` great . thank you . everything ready to go , sir ? ' ' pesh asked , as he shook the man ' s hand . ` ` ' ' and checked in . we just got your flight cleared . ' ' pesh ' s eyes flickered to megan as he answered , ` ` we ' ll be flying into savannah / hilton international tonight . ' ' ` ` great . great , ' ' lewis said , as he disappeared back into the crowd . ` ` you ' re taking us to savannah ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` for dinner and drinks . we had originally planned on flying , but we had a delayed flight . ' ' ` ` this is crazy . you ' re crazy . ' 'he gave her a puzzled look . ` ` you really don ' t like it ? ' ' ` ` no , i love it . i just wanna take you two guys out for lunch . ' ' ` ` it ' s not that far by car . ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , she shook her head at him . ` ` you could ##n ' t just take me somewhere ? like savannah ? you want to take me on your private jet to the airport ? ' ' he laughed . ` ` why not ? ' ' although it was completely absurd , she could couldn ' t help responding with laughter . ` ` i ' m not going to sound a lot like the quote from that movie when she says she likes the hard part , that she ' s a sure thing . ' ' she grabbed her purse . ` ` i am a sure thing . you ' ' ' i have to go to all this trouble . ' ' his dark eyes narrowed . ` ` your way of thinking is exactly why i ' m doing what i do . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` you ' ve always been with men who are a sure thing - men who ' haven ' t even been able to have a relationship with you . whenthey leave at the end of the day . ' ' she sucked in a breath at his words . with his eyes blazing , he closed the distance between them . ` ` while you may not want anything from me , i want something more from you . i want your trust , but i also want you to know that you ' re capable of something more . and if it takes sex and sexy clothes to give it to you , then i ' m willing to take it . ' ' despite his words , megan sat there in stunned silence . how was it possible that he cared so much about her ? he was right about the fact that she settled for being the ' real thing ' for the men she dated in the past . she knew she really don ' t want to make those mistakes again , so why should ##n ' t she let him continue to wine and tease her ? ` ` fine . take me to california . ' ' he opened the passenger side door . ` ` here you go . make sure you buckle your seat belt . ' ' she smiled as she slid into the seat . pesh waited for her to adjust her seat before he closed the door . as he walked to the front of the plane , she was already securing the seat belt and putting the. once she was in , he handed her a helmet . ` ` this will help with the engine noise . ' ' ` ` it ' s going to mess my hair up , ' ' she warned . he chuckled . ` ` i never struck you as the kind of woman who worried about her hair . ' ' she laughed as she put the helmet on . ` ` ' you should . i worry about my hair , and you comb your hair out in the morning . ' ' he rolled his eyes at her and shifted in his seat . after putting his helmet on , he began flipping switches and flipping switches . the radio in the back of the plane began playing . ` ` ' what kind of aircraft is this ? ' ' she asked into the radio . holding up a finger , she spoke into the mic on the dash . ` ` clearance to ground , this is cessna 172 clearance to approach for approach . ' ' ' the voice of the pilot came over her shoulder . ` ` clearance for approach and landing , cessna 172 . ' ' ` ` roger that , ' ' pesh said . the plane lurched forward and then began heading toward the runway . ` ` hmm , i ' m flying a cessna 172 ? ' ' pesh asked. ` ` yes , it is . ' ' ` ` it ' s beautiful . i love it . ' ' ` ` i think you ' ll be seeing that once in a while . ' ' megan knew what he meant when the plane began to descend after the takeoff . just like when she was on a commercial flight , she was on the ground one second , and was in the air the next . they rose into the night sky , flying through thick , dark clouds . once they had gained enough altitude , pesh eased out of the throttle and looked down at her .
