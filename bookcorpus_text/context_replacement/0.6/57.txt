neither one of us has been with anybody for at least two years - we ' ve had time for the other . ' ' ` ` that ' s all well and good . what about you ? are you on the pill ? ' ' ` ` no . ' ' she chewed on her bottom lip nervously . ` ` ' a little , ' ' she said . in her head , she was counting down the days since her last orgasm . ` ` no . ' ' ` ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` i ' m on stage two , so we should be okay . ' ' ` ` i ' ll just pass out . ' ' ` ` if you say so , ' ' she said . gripping his shoulders , she allowed him to cover her completely with his body . she loved the feel of his chest hair brushing against her ni * * les . pesh spread her legs , and then he was inside her , stretching and stretching her out . it had been so long that she could couldn ' t help feeling a bit of a tingle . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' he groaned and lifted his hips , pushing back into her . this time they both groaned . setting up a rhythm , he began moving in and outof her . the rhythm was slow and steady , and while he was hitting all the right places , she wanted more . the entire time he moved in and out of her , he kept his eyes locked firmly on hers . his gaze was so filled with desire that she ' didn ' t ' look away . the longer she stared into his eyes , the more obsessed with him she became . the old saying was that the eyes were windows to the soul , and she was getting a very good glimpse into his . and that scared the hell out of her . wanting to make things less awkward , she gripped his shoulders . ` ` please , ' ' she whispered . still on his knees , he wrapped his hands around the backs of her knees . this allowed him to pull her flush against his powerful body . where their kiss at first had been so simple , this was more than passion and desire . she reached up and cupped his face in her hands , pulling his head down to hers . their lips and tongues met in passionate need . when he pulled out of her , megan moaned at the rush of sensation . he gently rolled her over onto her back . hands on her hips , he lifted her up onto her knees . when he reentered her , megan gasped . with everyinstead , he went deeper and deeper . her hands fisted the sheets as he leaned over her body , kissing a trail down her neck . she still don ' t understand how he was able to do so many things at once . while his tongue explored her mouth and neck leaving little marks , his hands kept caressing her shoulders and then slid under her to cup her br * * sts and tease her nipple . he was touching her so intimately that she could ##n ' t stand still . she moaned , whispered his name , and cried out as the skin of their heated bodies rubbed together . finally , she could ##n ' t stand it anymore . shaking her head , she sank into the mattress as she found her release . as her eyes were closing , she felt pesh withdraw from her . as he did , megan felt heat creep onto her thighs and bu * * ocks . never seeing him come before , she wished she could couldn ' t see his face . he was so beautiful when he was near her . when he left , she rolled over onto her back and tucked the pillow under her head . after a few minutes , pesh lay down beside her . she lifted her head and met his gaze . completely and completely sexually satisfied for the first time in her life , sheshe could manage to say only , ` ` yes . ' ' a slow smile spread across his face . ` ` you seem to forget that a man like you is all . ' ' she laughed . ` ` that ' s because you render me nearly speechless with your beauty . ' ' ` ` thank you . i could say the same about you . ' ' his eyes left her face and traveled over her na * * d body . ` ` we need to get you cleaned up . ' ' pulling her shoulder back , she said , ` ` i really like it . makes me feel special or something . ' ' he smiled down at her . ` ` i like the idea of touching you - making you mine . ' ' he wanted her to be his . she still don ' t know quite what to make of that idea . did she want to be his ? she certainly could ##n ' t admit it to anyone else . despite the strong physical connection they shared , she was surprised to feel such a strong attraction to him . looking up at him , she could couldn ' t help wondering what was going on in his mind . ` ` we ' ve always done it before , ` haven ' t we ? ' ' ` ` yes , we have . that is the way` ` ' ' ' that we just did , ' ' he said . she punched his arm playfully . ` ` that ' s not what i meant . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' he said . ` ` no matter what , this changes everything . ' ' ` ` for the future , you mean . ' ' ` ` i know . ' ' the truth was she ' d never really had casual sex before . there was one time her senior year that she hooked up with a guy from school .
