` ` i do . i really do . ' ' removing her seat ##belt , she leaned over to kiss him . when she tried to stop the kiss , he started to pull back . ` ` hey baby , you need to stop that or we ' re not going to make it to my house . ' ' she giggled and then slid back down into her seat . she decided to enjoy herself the next few minutes . when he pulled into his own driveway , he noticed it was already filled with people . the sight of so many people pissed megan off , and she began tapping her fingers impatiently on her knee . ` ` ready ? ' ' he asked , as he turned to her . ` ` as i ' ll ever be , ' ' she replied . he shook his head as he got out of the car . as always , he opened her car door and helped her out . as they walked down the sidewalk , megan noticed a lot of activity . she smoothed down her hair and then she straightened her dress . then she paused with her purse on her shoulder . ` ` stop that , ' ' pesh said , as he rang the doorbell . ` ` ' ' can ' t do that . i ' m sorry . ' ' he smiled widely .her . ` ` megan , they ' re going to love you . i promise . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` they ' re going to hate me because i ' m such a beautiful little girl . wait until they hear you have a child out of school . they ' ll be forced to hate you forever . ' ' the door swung open , cutting off the rest of their conversation . ` ` megan , it ' s so good to see you ! ' ' his brother - in - law , sanjay , exclaimed . as he greeted pesh , his eyes went to megan . his eyes widened , and he blinked in surprise . ` ` uh , hi . ' ' ` ` hi , ' ' megan said . sanjay gave pesh a questioning look . ` ` you ? ##n ' ` tell me you were expecting us . ' ' ` ` this is megan . ' ' with a self - satisfied grin , he said , ` ` she ' s my wife . ' ' ` ` really ? well , what was that ? ' ' sanjay gave megan a warm smile . ` ` we ' re so glad to see you . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' megan said . as sanjay turned to walk into the living room , megan and pe##sh ' s silence . ` ` you ? ' ' ` tell them you slept with me ? ' ' he shook his head . ` ` no , i prefer the element of surprise when it comes to my personal life . ' ' ` ` sh - what ? ' ' she laughed . ` ` it ' s better this way . trust me . ' ' before she could say anything else , pesh was taking off his shoes . wide - eyed , megan followed him . quickly , she stepped out of her shoes and tossed them in the chair next to his . ` ` what do you want to teach me ? ' ' she asked . he rubbed the small of her back . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' as they walked into the living room , pesh felt megan tense at his touch . he knew that it was strange walking into a house so full of people . his sister , shveta , walked in first . ` ` hi megan . you ' re so beautiful this morning . ' ' ` ` thank you . so thank you . ' ' he hugged her tightly . when he pulled away , she looked down at her pregnant belly . ` ` and how is the crown prince today ? ' ' shveta smiled and put her hand to herno . ` ` he ' s still kicking ass at the gym . ' ' when she saw megan watching him , she smiled . ` ` and who is this ? ' ' he sucked in a breath and looked at his family . ` ` before i go into this with each and every one of you , i might as well get this out of the way . i want to introduce you to someone very special , my wife , megan . ' ' stunned silence swept through the room at his announcement . his mother and father exchanged a look before looking back at pesh . megan tucked herself in close to his side . although public displays of affection between men and women were frowned upon in his world , he put his arm around her shoulders . ` ` mom , say something , ' ' he said . ` ` we ' re fine , dad . it ' s just you caught us off guard , ' ' his mother said . his father ' s dark brow furrowed . ` ` so you ' re still here , eh ? ' ' ` ` yes , i am . ' ' at his announcement , his father clapped his hands and smiled . ` ` that is so good to hear ! ' ' he stepped forward to hug megan . ` ` you are very welcome son .' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' she replied . ` ` i ' m charlie , ' ' his father said . ` ` megan , ' ' she added , with a warm smile . pesh looked past his father where his mother was biting her lip . he could tell she still wasn ' t too happy that a dark - haired , blue - eyed woman was standing beside her son . while shveta and arjan had both sought out other men to marry , megan and dev were considered the black sheep since they had hadn ' t wanted to settle down with members of their family . eventually , his mother ' s curiosity won out over anything else , and she stepped forward to shake megan ' s hand .
