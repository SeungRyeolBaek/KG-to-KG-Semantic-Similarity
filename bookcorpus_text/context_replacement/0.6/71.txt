` ` would it be okay if we stopped by ? ' ' a deep sigh escaped megan ' s lips . ` ` no , he deserves to be happy . my nana has been dead for ten years , so it ' s not like he freaked out the minute he was born and started chasing after me like that . ' ' pesh laughed at her comment . ` ` do you really like her ? ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , megan said , ` ` that ' s the funny thing . she was really nice . and patrick liked her . i think she ' s been there before when he was with her . ' ' without taking his place at the counter , pesh placed his hands on the granite counter and leaned in close to megan . ` ` it sounds to me like he finally found a good woman who loves him and his family . i just don ' t think you could ask for a better man . ' ' she stared into his eyes for a moment before she spoke . ` ` you ' re right . ' ' don ' t know why i am so upset about it all . ' ' ` ` because as much as you love your mother , you ' re very protective of your father ' s privacy . ' ' ` ` you 'business - wise , ' ' she teased . ` ` wisdom comes with consequences , ' ' he said , with a smile . ` ` exactly . ' ' he gave her a quick peck on the cheek before returning to the kitchen . ` ` so , kara ' s your best friend , what else happened to make you so upset ? ' ' when megan said don ' t answer , pesh turned around . ` ` what else is new ? ' ' ` ` you need to have a serious talk with kara . ' ' his eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` i do ? ' ' ` ` yes , you do . ' ' ` ` megan , you do realize that i ' m not in charge of anything . ' ' she rolled her eyes . ` ` yes , i realize that . but you are in charge of your business , are you not ? ' ' ` ` excuse me ? ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , megan said , ` ` kara seems to think that the two of you are an item . ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` ' that ' s right . we ' re best friends from work too . ' ' megan narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him . ` ` you ' ve never seen her outside of work ? ' ' this is one ofof course he really hadn ' t planned on ever having to face . the truth was something he really really don ' t want to admit to megan . carefully choosing his words , he said , ` ` we got together for sex a couple of weeks after graduation a few months ago . i would say that defined us as an ' item . ' ' ' ` ` that must be hard for her to think she can convince me that you ' re sleeping with her for sex . ' ' pesh shuddered at the thought . he would have never forgiven kara for loving someone who was lying . he set down the pan and turned off the stove . he knew he could couldn ' t move on without coming clean . ` ` megan , i still haven ' t been honest with you . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' she asked . ` ` i told you that kara and i have only had sex a couple of times . but that still ain ' t the whole truth . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` what are you saying ? ' ' finally , his shoulders slumped a little . ` ` after the news of kara ' s death , i could couldn ' t get you off my back . i had to admit to myself thati ' haven ' t been honest with you . so after having a couple of beers last night , kara and i went to my place and fooled around . ' ' ` ` you were flirting ? ' ' she gave a short laugh . ` ` that was what was so important to you ? what kara had told you ? ' ' ` ` did you think i would be mad at you for messing around with another woman when we really weren ' t together ? ' ' ` ` no , ' ' he said honestly . megan shook her head . ` ` what you did tonight was your fault . i mean , i ' m not surprised to hear that you messed around with her , especially since you would ##n ' t sleep with her when she asked you to . ' ' ` ` megan , don ' t you see the point ? she cared for you , and you cared deeply for her . we were only in the room five minutes if that tells you anything . ' ' the corners of her mouth turned up in a small smile . ` ` i really ' don ' t need the reminder of how much you ' didn ' t enjoy yourself . ' ' he shook his head . ` ` i ' m sorry . i should ##n ' t have said that . ' '` ` but at the same time , i ' m glad to know that you wo ##e ' ll be coming back for a repeat performance . ' ' bringing his eyes up to meet hers , he said , ` ` how could you say that . ' ' ` ` and you really were trying to get me off your back ? ' ' ` ` yes , i was . ' ' ` ` in a weird way , that ' s almost funny , ' ' she said . ` ` i ' m glad you think so , ' ' he replied . ` ` no , it ' s just the fact that she thought you were using her for sex that has her so upset . ' ' ` ` it ' s what ? ' '
