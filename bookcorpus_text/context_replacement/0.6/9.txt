he liked the feel of her against him a little too much . it made him want to pull her into his arms . . . and do other things that he should a ' not be doing when he was in the mood . looking over her shoulder at him , she said , ` ` jeez , you ' re like a ghost standing next to me . ' ' ` ` am i ? ' ' he really hadn ' t noticed the difference in their height - he ' d been focused on her too much . she laughed . ` ` ' a little taller . of course , ' ' doesn ' t take much for you to make me look perfect . ' ' ` ` you look perfect to me , ' ' she said softly . tilting her head back to look at him , she gave him a shy smile . ` ` do i ? are you flirting with me , dr . nadeen ? ' ' he looked down at his feet , trying to ignore the heat of her gaze . he tried to ignore the # ##ness he felt in his cheeks . ` ` good , now dance with the camera , ' ' the doctor said . smiling , pesh stepped away from megan . as the camera clicked off , covering hers and aidan ' s eyes , he closed his eyesnot her . as she focused on the camera , megan ' s blue eyes widened and she twisted her lips into a wide smile . noah ' s little fingers wrapped around some of the strands of her hair , causing megan to gasp in delight . ` ` easy there . you have to do that , ' ' she said to him . ` ` okay , that should teach you , ' ' the photographer said . ` ` hey baby , it ' s your turn , ' ' megan said , as she handed noah to him . by now , noah was sick of being hugged and tired of being buried under layers of blankets . he looked up at pesh , confused . ` ` i ' m sorry , little man , ' ' he said , trying to cradle noah in his arms . as noah continued to cry , pesh looked over at the camera . just as he was about to give up , megan leaned over and began waving her hands and making noises at him . the boy finally stopped crying . ` ` that ' s okay , noah . give him a minute , ' ' megan said , as she walked up to stand by the camera . she kept making the noises , and she finally got to throw some of the strands of her hair at him .finally , megan ' s thin lips curved into a smile . ` ` here we are , ' ' the photographer announced . pesh quickly plastered a smile on his face . after the flash went off , the photographer set up his camera . ` ` ' ##cha . ' ' both megan and pesh exhaled in relief . looking up at him , pesh said , ` ` so you ' re ready to go home and get rid of that dress , huh ? ' ' ` ` it ' s a dress , just a dress , ' ' megan said with a smile . he chuckled . ` ` regardless of what it ' s called , i ' don ' t think noah likes it very much . ' ' megan twisted some of the fabric around her fingers . ` ` seems a little uncomfortable for him . ' ' ` ` does your father wear this too ? ' ' ` ` no , this is aidan ' s dress . i wore my mother ' s , which my sisters and i always wear . ' ' ` ` i see . ' ' ` ` in your world do they do anything special like this for a wedding ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` we have the namakaran , or wedding ceremony . it ' s usually held in a church . and after this ,it ' s all about giving support to the baby - family and people coming together in support of the new baby . ' ' ` ` something like that . ' ' they were both interrupted by aidan and emma walking in . aidan immediately reached out for emma . ` ` like a mama ' s boy , ' ' aidan teased , which earned him a glare from emma . he then winked at her in return before walking down the hall . pesh watched megan ' s parents greet her with a smile . ` ` ' you have to go , ' ' he said . ` ` ' i ' ll see you at aidan and emma ' s , okay ? ' ' she asked . he swallowed hard . ` ` um , yeah , i ' ll be there . ' ' ` ` good , ' ' she replied , with an apologetic smile . she gave him a quick kiss before walking off to join her parents . shaking his head , he said , ` ` this is crazy . ' ' chapter twelve when megan arrived with her parents at aidan and emma ' s , she was surprised to see a pickup truck parked in the driveway . her excitement increased when she stepped inside the house . looking out into the yard , she saw where tables were set up in the driveway . the tables were coveredwith blue and white balloons and flashing blue and white lights . a low voice behind her caught megan ' s attention . turning around , she saw casey shaking her head . ` ` wow , this is an awesome wedding ceremony , ' ' she said . ` ` it ' s awesome . that ' s for sure , ' ' megan said . when emma walked into the room with casey in a more comfortable position , casey shook her head . ` ` oh , i was just wondering where the ice cream was ? ' ' pink stained emma ' s cheeks .
