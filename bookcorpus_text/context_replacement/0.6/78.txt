he bit down on his lip to keep from laughing at her . he could can ' t believe megan was so upset with his father ' s death . his heart melted at the thought . it had to . she really was falling in love with him . he brushed a stray lock of her hair out of her face . ` ` megan , you ' re not the first bad girl i ' ve brought home with me . ' ' ` ` no , i ' m well aware of that . i ' m well aware of the fact of how much your parents loved and respected you . they will never be the same way with me . ' ' she looked up at him . ` ` i ' m nothing like her , pesh . i ' m just kind and good - hearted . ' ' he shook his head . ` ` that ' s not true . you are good - hearted . i see that side of you each and every day . ' ' cupping her chin with his hand , he lifted her gaze to his . ` ` you are my father , dev . despite all of his lies and antics , my parents still love him very much . and i promise you there is nowhere you can point to where they wo ##n ' t find you or where you ' ll end uptrust me . okay ? ' ' she gave a small nod . ` ` okay . ' ' taking her by the hand , he led her off the porch . once he ' d helped her into the car , he turned around and slid into the driver ' s seat . when pesh started up the engine , megan blinked in surprise . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . she glanced to the clock on the dashboard . ` ` oh my god , we ' re going to be late . did i make a good first impression ? ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` maybe i should ask you a few questions , business stuff , so things can go a little faster . ' ' ` ` what does that have to do with us being late ? ' ' ` ` because it ' s not good business to be ten minutes late . ' ' ` ` oh ? ' ' ` ` oh . ' ' ` ` huh , you really don ' t mean that . ' ' ` ` no , how could you ? ' ' ` ` i was doing a little acting . i even watched the movie , ' ' she confessed . pesh chuckled . ` ` did you really ? ' ' ` ` no , it was pretty good . i just thought it ' s 'no more dance numbers and stuff . ' ' ` ` megan , i ' m pretty sure none of my family is going to break out into dance numbers from a disney movie tonight , ' ' he said , with laughter ringing in his voice . she rolled her eyes . ` ` ' ' ##n ' t want them to , smart - ass . ' ' he grinned at her . ` ` ' not funny . ' ' after taking a deep breath , she gave him an apologetic look . ` ` i ' m sorry i ' m being rude . ' ' ` ` you ' re being rude . ' ' ` ` and you ' re right . ' ' ` ` regardless of your out - of - character behavior , i know that my family is going to love you just as much as i do . ' ' the moment the words left his mouth he winced . it was the damn ##ed word . they just hadn ' t ' exchanged vows yet , and now he ' d have to get up and break them before she could find the right words . ` ` oh god , do you want to say that again ? when i ' m not here ? ! ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she said . burying her face in her hands , she. . ` ` this is . . . you know . . . crazy . . . ' ' ` ` megan , you can ' t - ' ' ` ` i love you , too ! ' ' she said from behind her hands . his hands tightened on the wheel , and he sent the car spinning onto the wrong road . when he slowed and put the car back into the proper lane , he forced himself to look over at her . she peeked at him through her lashes . ` ` i love you , pesh . i really f * * king do . ' ' ` ` ' megan , ' ' he whispered . pulling her hands away from her face , she gave him a soft smile . ` ` i love you more than any woman i ' ve ever known . ' ' ` ` i love you more - ' ' ' he found himself unable to speak . did he love her more than he had before ? he spent two years with jade and then another one with megan . if he did love megan more , what did that say about his relationship with jade ? she reached over and took one of his hands in hers . ` ` hey , you guys . ' you need to remember what you said . our lives are very different . ' ' he clenched and unclenchedhis heart . ` ` every woman has half a man ' s heart , ' ' she said . ` ` but i know this one ain ' t half your heart . and why would ##n ' i expected you to stop loving me just because i asked , so why would i expect you to do the same with me ? ' ' ` ` it ' s not fair to you , ' ' she said . ` ` it ' s not fair , either . you have to get used to that feeling . ' ' she took his hand . ` ` look , i know what i feel when i feel your love . there ' s no doubt about it . you love me with all your heart and soul . ' '
