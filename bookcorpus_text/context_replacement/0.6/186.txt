` ` i just thought that after that , we could be more friends . no one even knows you ' re my mom anymore . i mean , allison would have freaked out , too , right ? ' ' ` ` i guess so . . . she just . . . she called me ' mom . ' we ' re friends , are we ? ' ' ` ` no , i really really don ' t think there ' s anything special about you . ' ' ` ` it ' s more than that , though . i feel like we ' re being around a lot , ' ' i say , feeling a lump of emotion in my throat . ` ` yeah , ' ' he says , smiling . ` ` ' me and you , sort of . well , maybe you wo ##n ' t be nearly as close as you are , but there are some things you might like about her . ' ' ` ` when ' d you get so serious ? ' ' i ask , patting his hand next to mine . ` ` since i started hanging out with you . you ' re rubbing off on me . ' ' before i have time to wonder whether he ' s being serious or not , we hear my mom yell , ` ` dad ! ' ' from the kitchen , and ibest to put our conversation on hold . dad seems to be in an unusually good mood during the meal , for which i ' m grateful . not for his sake , but for nate ' s , because he ' s much less likely to snap at his son when he ' s really stressed . ` ` well , we ' haven ' t made an official announcement , brynn , but thornhill and co . has just signed mark broadman as a partner , ' ' dad says proudly . ` ` the hedge fund manager ? ' ' ` ` that ' s right . he has several other clients , and offers advice on various foreign policy issues . ' ' ` ` wow , that ' s great . congrats , dad , ' ' nate pipes in . dad smiles at him in a self - satisfied way . ` ` i ' m glad it ' s over - i ' m glad that ' s over , too , ' ' i correct myself . i had mentioned the deal earlier this week , but decided to change it . we can talk about it later , and i know that mark is worried that it would negatively affect his career . ` making you a new client is a good sign that you have moved on , and are on mark ' s side . after all ,nate and i leave the living room together , while our parents are outside chatting . we both make a point of going our separate ways , to keep up appearances . i close my bedroom door knowing that he ' ll come for me at midnight , like he has every night this past week . my heart jumps with excitement just thinking about it . i consider sending an email to allison , but decide i need a little more time to think about what to do . i walk to my dresser and pull out the bra from victoria ' s secret that i dropped to the floor . i remove the black lace bra , a tiny heart - shaped piece of lace that barely covers the bottom , with several thin straps , straps , straps , wrapping around my waist and hanging down to the bottom . the top is plain in contrast , but beautiful with the chantilly lace - covered bottom . i take a shower and then head downstairs for a cup of coffee . i ' m pulling a mug down from the kitchen counter when i feel nate come up behind me . he wraps his arms around my waist and presses against me . ` ` nate , not tonight ! ' ' i whisper . ` ` i know , i ' m sorry , ' ' he whispers in my ear . ` ` i just wantyou have the right . ' ' ` ` i have a surprise for you tonight , ' ' i whisper . he pushes his hips into my ass in response , his hands slipping under my dress . ` ` you ' re killing me , ' ' he says , then smiles , and rests his forehead against mine before walking away . ` ` see you tonight . ' ' i lean against the wall as i watch him go , my skin tingling where he ' s touched me . i know that getting out wo ##r ' will take long , but for me , there ' s something really good about it . i take my ' s ##obe ##r to my room , and dive into the water . i splash around , slowly letting out the bubbles . i climb into bed with a sigh , pulling the covers up over me . these late night dreams , though i would wouldn ' t give them credit for anything , are playing tricks on my sleep patterns . the next thing i know , i ' m being woken up by nate crawling into bed next to me . i relax into the warmth of nate ' s body and slowly close my eyes . ` ` so , should i just let you sleep ? ' ' he asks , kissing the top of my head . ` ` noplease , ' ' i say softly . ` ` you have to enjoy your dinner . ' ' ` ` where is it ? ' ' he asks , looking confused . i shake my head and look down at my lap . he smiles , and takes the edge of the bra in his hand and begins to slowly pull it down . i bite my lip . i hear his sharp intake of breath when he sees my breasts . he asks , looking down at my lap . ` ` there ' s nothing , ' ' i tell him .
