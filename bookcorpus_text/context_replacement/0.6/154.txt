and i really don ' t want to give nate the satisfaction of seeing me cry . chapter twelve i breathe in as deeply as possible and hold it , counting to ten and breathing as slowly as i can , trying to rid myself of the overwhelming feelings that followed me home from the hospital . it ' s a tactic i use to control my emotions , and to say that i ' m fine right now would be an lie . i can can ' t remember the last time i heard someone talk to me like that , but i know it ' s not my fault for it . i finally start to feel well enough to go to bed , and start to turn off my bedside lamp . a pair of footsteps on the stairs makes me jump . i sit up a little as they walk down the hall toward my bedroom . a moment later , my bedroom door swings open and nate walks in , his face red with anger . ` ` you ' re in here ? you ' ve got to be fucking kidding me . that was really stupid of you to take off without telling anyone , you know that ? ' ' he looks at me , then turns around and walks away . i ' m frozen in place for a second . what the fuck was that ? what theyou want to be mad at me for ? i jump out from under my covers and run out of my room just in time to stop him from opening his door . he turns around as i walk into his room . ` ` i ' m selfish ? you are just . . . you are just . . . ' ' i stumble over my words , trying to think of the right words . ` ` yeah , you ' re right , brynn ! i waited at that bar for you for ten minutes ! i thought you would have been there ! i almost called the cops ! ' ' ` ` wait . . . what ? ' ' i ask , completely confused . ` ` ever heard of a text message ? ' ' he asks , his voice dripping with sarcasm . ` ` no , i ' ve heard of a text message ! ' ' god , i wish i were better at this . ` ` hey , wait a minute , this is ' ' not about me , this is about you ! you ' re the one ! i heard what you were saying about me to me , i ' m not a buzzkill , and maybe i ' m not perfect , but i ' m not some kind of freak , either ! ' ' i blink back the tears forming in my eyes, more angry than i ' ve ever been in my life . well , that was him . he stands up and i take the opportunity to walk away . just as i ' m about to cross the room , he steps around me and closes the door in front of me . i stop walking and turn around slowly , about ready to punch him . he ' s standing so close to me i ' m practically pressed against the door . ` ` wait , what ? how ' d you do that ? you followed me there ? ' ' ` ` no , i followed you , ' ' i say , stumbling a little because i know i am wrong in that respect . ` ` i was there because you were just trying to stop me from sleeping with jackson , and i wanted to know why . ' ' i take a deep breath . ` ` i ... i . ##va ' t know what you think of me , and that ' s . . . well , that ' s fine , but i still don ' t understand why you have to be sharing your feelings with me . i mean , am i really that important to you ? ' ' to my surprise , my bottom lip begins to tremble . i do don ' t want to cry right now . i do don ' tholding back the tears any longer . ` ` no . . . no , that ' s not what . . . ' ' nate says , his eyes widening as a tear rolls down my cheek . i quickly wipe it away and nate stands up , running his hand through his dark hair . ` ` it ' s not that i do ##n ' t want jackson to date you , it ' s that i # n ' t want you to date me . ' ' ` ` what ? that ' doesn ' t make any sense , ' ' i say , trying to stop the flow of tears as i tug at my hair . ` ` jackson ' s track record with women is pretty bad . they ' re just strangers to him . ' ' i cross my arms and glare at him . ` ` that is really bad . i mean , the first night we met , you asked me to have a drink with you and you probably don ' t even know my name . ' ' a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth . ` ` well , that ' s okay . for the record , you just seemed so sweet , and i - i could ##n ' t lie . you ' re right , it ' s not like i have a bad track record .. i think the problem , in my case , is that i ' m honest about it . i ' ve never promised a guy a future . the girls i sleep with , they know that he ' s not going anywhere because i tell them that . he pulls them aside , promising them a future with him , and then as soon as he sleeps with them , he acts like they really don ' t care . ' ' ` ` ' you ' re friends with him . . . ' ' i point out . ` ` yeah , he ' s a good guy .
