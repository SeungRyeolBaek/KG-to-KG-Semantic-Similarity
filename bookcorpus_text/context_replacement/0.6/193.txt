` ` yes , i want to . not just for you , though . for nate . he needs you in his life . i can see that you ' re kind , and caring , and he needs someone like that to help him . please let me help you . ' ' ` ` i really don ' t want to put you in that position . . . . ' don ' t have to do anything . you and nate , you have a great friendship . ' ' ` ` um , yeah , well , he ' s a good guy , ' ' i say . ` ` brynn . . . it ' s okay . i know . ' ' i nod . ` ` but what ? ' ' ` ` when i saw you that day at the park , i could just tell . at first i thought you were his girlfriend , and then i realized who you were , and i saw the way you two looked at each other . you ' re in trouble , ' ' she says . i start to tug on my hair again . shit . shit . ` ` you ' ve acted on your feelings ? ' ' it ' s all i can think to answer . ` ` do your parents know ? ' ' i shake my head . ` ` brynn ,you ' don ' me need to be careful . it ' s dangerous . people find trouble wherever they go . besides , it ' s almost like you ' re breaking the rules . ' ' my tears begin to roll down my cheeks again , silently . ` ` ' ' don ' t think it ' s that bad . ' ' ` ` ' i just saw you two share an intimate moment . listen , honey , if nate and you are friends , i ' don ' t have to come with you . ' ' ` ` well , i ' d like him to meet you . i think it would do him some good . when he was asking me out earlier , ' ' didn ' t say anything . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' ` ` ` you ' ll go with him ? ' ' ` ` if you ' re sure that ' s okay with you . ' ' ` ` i ' m not sure how you ' ll set it up then , but write down your address for me , and i ' ll be in touch with you when i can . ' ' she nods and pulls a piece of paper from a small envelope in the back seat . as she hands it to me and i get out of the car , she looks up intothe doctor asks . ` ` brynn , if i could just give you a little privacy . . . i would avoid nate for the next few days . he might not ' t like it when you stand up to him . ' ' i turn and shut the door , walking slowly back to the house as i run my fingers over her phone number . i look in through the second story window , not wanting to walk right in on them , but it looks like they ' ve left and the dishes have already been cleaned . i push open the front door and head up the stairs to my room , closing my door behind me . i find eileen ' s phone number on my phone and am just about to change out of my clothes when i hear a soft knock on the door . ' nate never comes in here , so he probably knows that i ' m here with him . i walk over and unlock it , then open it a few inches . ` ` you still up ? ' ' he asks , looking around . ` ` i need to be alone right now , ' ' i say , as a lump forms in my throat at the thought of spending the whole night in this house without him . ` ` i . . . i . ##uld ' ` come with you , '' he nods . he looks so sad , and i catch a glimpse of the little boy that he once was , in his parents ' conversation . ` ` i know . ' ' ` ` they ' re going to a charity event this weekend . . . maybe we could spend some time together . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' i say , my eyes already moving in a different direction . he pauses , wondering if he should follow me . ` ` well , goodnight , ' ' he says , and walks down the hall to his room . i close and lock the door behind him , then grab my cell phone and punch in eileen ' s number . tomorrow morning , i text her . i ' ll let you know when my parents are home , and then you can call nate . chapter twenty - two i sigh as i sit on my bed , listening for the sound of my parents and nate talking . ' ' hadn ' t gone to sleep much at all last night . there were too many thoughts swirling around in my head . still , though , it was hard not to see nate . i craved his presence in my life with a constant hunger that ate away at me . then i hear their voices from the back of the house . i 'to my door and push it open , sticking my head out into the hall . i can just hear my mother saying something to them as they make their way to the kitchen . then i hear the car pulling out of the driveway and i glance at the clock . i ' ll give them ten minutes . i wait impatiently , and as soon as it ' s dark , i call eileen and head out to the car . ~ nate has been safely tucked in his room all day . i honestly don ' t know if he even showed up to work this morning , which is highly unusual for him .
