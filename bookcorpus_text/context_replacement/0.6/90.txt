looking down , she saw georgie staring up at her . ` ` what are you doing , noah ? ' ' she asked . he looked left and right as he spoke . ` ` she told me not to tell anybody , but she wants you to go up to her old room . ' ' ` ` okay . what for ? ' ' ` ` he ' s going crazy , aunt emma , and she thinks you ' re the only one that might be able to get him to calm down . ' ' ` ` ah , i see . ' ' when she turned back to pesh , he smiled . ` ` you ' and ' me ' need to talk . go ahead if you can stay . ' ' she leaned over and gave him a quick peck on the lips . ` ` thank you for being so sweet each and every second of the night . ' ' his lips brushed against her cheek . ` ` you ' re welcome , my love . ' ' ` ` be back as soon as you can . ' ' ` ` i ' m going to hold you to that . ' ' taking georgie ' s hand , she made her way across the dance floor and out of the club . after getting on one of the elevators , they descended to the dance floor . she and georgieall the way . she walked halfway down the hall and knocked on the door . by then , she ' didn ' t have to ask which room noah was in . she could hear his voice all the way upstairs . when becky pushed open the door , she waved megan inside with her hand . ` ` the others are ##n ' you wanted us to tell you , but we ' ve been trying the past hour to get him to calm down , and he ' s just not having it . ' ' megan found the chaos in the room almost comical . her parents , along with her sisters julia and liz , stood in a circle around one of the beds . wrapped in a thick , white feather blanket , noah lay in the middle of the bed , his hair tangled and streaked with tears and his eyes red from crying . ` ` what is the matter ? ' ' megan asked . everyone turned around to look at her . ` ` nothing . everything ' s fine . go back to your room , ' ' angie said , patting megan ' s shoulder . ` ` um , i think it ' s safe to say that . ' ' ' is fine . or at least , it ' s not fine . ' ' liz covered her face with her hands . ` ` ' '' ' the minute emma left the room , noah passed out . he woke up out of a deep sleep looking for his mother . the other baby - sister stayed there as long as she could before she finally found me . ' ' megan shook her head at him . ` ` ' noah . ' ' she released her son to hold out her arms . because he ' d spent so much time with her , noah instinctively reached for her , and megan pulled him into her arms . ` ` hey baby , you ' ve got to stop crying . ' ' noah was crying so hard his breath came in short gasps and his chest heaved . ` ` please . ' please , ' ' he begged softly . megan held him close to her chest . ` ` i know , noah . but she ' s in the bathroom with your baby sister . ' ' her concern obviously wasn ' t for him since he drew in a deep breath to avoid crying again . she looked at him . ` ` you can ##t go down to the bathroom ? ' ' he looked confused . ` ` pesh is there . you can ##na see him ? ' ' ` ` esh ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` yes , he ' s down there . ' ' `` ` esh , ' ' he said , shuffling his feet as if to encourage her to keep walking . ` ` okay . i ' ll take him , ' ' her mother said , reaching for him . noah nodded , wrapping his arms tightly around megan ' s waist . ` ` i think it ' s safe to say he ' s coming with us . ' ' ` ` but it ' s your birthday party , ' ' julia said . ` ` yes , and we ' ve been planning for the last few weeks . i just don ' t think seeing him is going to take away anything for me . ' ' as she walked toward the door , she asked , ` ` is mason here ? ' ' her mother nodded . ` ` thank god he ' s down the hall , or we ' d have the dogs running around at nine o ' clock . ' ' megan smiled as she walked down the hall . her smile and the pink dress seemed to be catching everyone ' s attention . ` ` mason , huh ? ' ' she asked , as they stepped into the elevator . ` ` yes , pwetty , ' ' he said . when she walked back downstairs , pesh was sitting at their table , talking to one of their friends . thewhen noah saw him , he reached out for pesh . ` ` ` hello , little brother . are you done here because you want to come to our table ? ' ' noah smiled at pesh with his teeth , which caused pesh to giggle . ` ` he looks so much like aidan when he does that , ' doesn ' t he ? ' ' ` ` yes , he does . i ' m sure he ' s going to use that cute little face to his advantage when he gets here , just like his father did . ' ' she slid into the booth beside them . after pulling out his chair , noah asked , ` ` what ? ' '
