` ` i ' m here because i went to the gym to work off stress . and if you put me on the spot , i ' d be a total jerk . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` that ' doesn ' t turn me on at all . i ' ve had my share of those . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' he asked . although she was trying to be casual about it , she knew he wanted to hear the full story . ` ` dating someone for fun was hard , and when i did date someone , i made sure to pick the guy at the top of their game . my first boyfriend ' s mistake caused me to ruin my career at high school . ' ' ` ` that ' s horrible . ' ' ` ` yes , it is . but what ' s more , i ' d ' er learn anything from my father because i fell for that one . ' ' with a wry smile , she said , ` ` at least i left you out of that one . ' ' pesh laced his fingers together . ` ` emma ' s father was a star athlete ? ' ' ` ` yeah , he played football for the team . ' ' ` ` you know i ' m not with the team ' .some medicine maybe . i could probably get something for him . maybe a little cold water for his mouth ? ' ' at the mischievous glint in pesh ' s eyes , megan burst out laughing . ` ` i do not believe , you of all people , in such a thing . ' ' with a smirk , pesh said , ` ` it ' s a stupid idea . ' ' ` ` i know that . it ' s just that i can ' t believe someone like you would even think of doing something like that . ' ' when he started to open his mouth to speak , she held up her hand . ` ` i know , i know . i ' ' a ' m you . ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' their main course arrived , and megan could couldn ' t resist digging into the delicious greek food . as they ate , the conversation became easier . that was one of the things she loved best about pesh - he was so easy to talk to . because he was tall , handsome , and a gentleman , she could have felt intimidated by him . but he never made her feel that way . he always seemed amused by every single thing she had to say , which was quite a difference from most of the men she dated . they were only comfortable listening toher mother glancing over her shoulder at the television to catch the evening news . after they ordered , the waitress took their order . ` ` so ? ' ' megan asked , as she downed the rest of her drink . pesh jerked his head toward the crowded dance floor . ` ` how about a dance tonight ? ' ' she wrinkled her nose . ` ` i ' m really not much of a dancer . ' ' he raised his eyebrows at her as if he knew she was lying . ` ` fine , fine , i used to dance all the time . in high school and college . ' ' ` ` ' dance with me . ' ' ` ` i ' m not good at just dancing . you ' ll probably be asking questions the second we get out there . ' ' pesh shoved a handful of cash into the manila envelope . ` ` as you would know , the devil never protesth too much . and i think i know the truth . ' ' ` ` oh , you do ? ' ' he teased . ` ` ' dancing is fun , and you ' don ' t seem to want to let yourself get intimate with me . ' ' ` ` you went down on me in the coat ##room . i think that ' s pretty hot , ' ' she teased .` ` that was just flirting . flirting just out of the body where our emotional connection is . flirting out of the heart . ' ' he held her gaze . ` ` we both know you ' ll let me into your body , into your heart . ' ' knowing he was right , she crossed her arms over her chest and stared at him . she ' didn ' t know if she still could ##n ' t get up and slow dance like he had earlier . she ' d already danced a few times at least . what was the problem now ? somewhere deep inside , she knew the answer to that question . ` ` if you ' don ' not want to dance , then let ' s go and see the show . ' ' not wanting to let him get the better of her , she slid out of her chair . ` ` fine . i ' ll dance with you . ' ' he smiled . ` ` ' ' ' not look too happy . ' ' as he stood up , he took her hand and led her out to the dance floor . she tried to wrap her arms around his neck like she was supposed to , but he placed one of her hands on his chest and then he took the other one in his . his other hand came up to rest on her lower back .the radio played the first verse of one song and then switched over to another . a soft beat pounded out the opening chords . the lead singer ' s husky voice filled the air , ` ` like a rose about to bloom . ' ' megan instantly recognized the song as norah jones ' turn me on . the heat between them intensified , and as megan looked up into pesh ' s eyes , she saw lust and desire warring in them . her gaze traveled down to his full lips , and she could couldn ' t help wanting him to kiss her .
