i take a few more swallows of my beer as i look around , feeling more comfortable now that i know jackson is not into me . ` ` hey , i ' m going to grab a beer , ' ' i tell him , as i finish up . he stands up . ` ` # ##n ' t worry about it . i ' ll get ' em , ' ' he says , heading off into the back room . i watch the ping - ball as it ' s bouncing back and forth across the table , and jackson is soon back with the beer . he launches into a story about this stupid party he went to back at school , and out of the corner of my eye i see a couple coming down the hall from the back of the bar , their hands all over each other , and feel a pang of guilt in my chest . i am so sick of being a virgin . it ' s certainly not on purpose that i ' m twenty - one and i still haven ' t had sex yet . i guess i always knew it would happen naturally , without my brain putting any thought into it , and i ' ve never brought it up . it ' s going to be some stupid teenage fantasy , though . i glance at jackson out of the corner of my eye as imake short work of my second drink . maybe nate was right - maybe i was being selfish and stupid . maybe it would be better if i just got it out of the way . and i think i would be good at that . like , really good at it . plus , he ' s a nice guy . ` ` . . . cool . ' do you think ? ' ' he asks me , leaning forward . ` ` yeah , cool , ' ' i reply , even though i spaced out and had no idea what he was talking about . my hair falls in front of my face as i take a sip of wine , and jackson reaches out and brushes it behind my ear . we make eye contact and he leans forward again , brushing a soft kiss across my cheek . ` ` ready to get out of here ? ' ' he whispers into my ear , sending a little shiver down my spine . ` ` my car is parked close by , and we ' ll both be able to hear ourselves talk . ' ' ` ` um , yeah , that sounds good , ' ' i reply , a little breathless . jackson smiles and offers me his hand . i place mine in his and he leads me back toward the bar . we pass nate on the sidewalk , with his arm wrapped aroundnatasha and his hands go into her back pockets . ` ` hey guys , we ' re taking off . you think you could call a cab ? ' ' jackson asks . ` ` what do you mean ? you ' re just leaving ? ' ' nate asks , confused . ` ` yup , we ' re going back to my place , actually , ' ' jackson replies . ` ` you cool for a minute ? ' ' ` ` yeah , just cool for a minute , ' ' nate says , his eyes darting back and forth between us . natasha takes nate ' s hand and leads him toward the screen door in the back . ` ` thank you , ' ' nate says to me , and i move to follow . i frown at his words . they head out , and i stare after them , my mouth open in shock and disbelief . i ' don ' t like the way nate speaks to me now . so dismissively . i share a small smile with natasha , who is still looking around the living room , clearly uncomfortable without nate . fuck nate . i ' ll do whatever the hell i want , and i want to know what he ' s doing . i push past natasha , push open the screen door and walk into the small , screened - in kitchen .there are fewer people in here , but there ' s still a crowd . i can almost hear nate and jackson talking in the living room . i push my way through the crowd , keeping my head down so they can ##n ' t hear me . i pull out my phone so i look like i ' m doing something other than talking , and slide into the corner next to them . i can barely hear what they ' re saying . ` ` what , do you like her nate ? ' ' nate asks me . my eyes widen . ` ` ' no , she ' s my type . she ' s just me , that ' s all . you know . she ' s not your type . ' ' i feel a pang of guilt at the sound of nate ' s voice . ` ` she ' s hot , ' ' i hear him say . ` ` you think she ' s hot ? ' ' nate asks , starting to laugh . ` ` what ? oh , come on . nate , she ' s a total # ##kill . ' ' i really don ' t want to hear any more . i can already feel the tears well up in my eyes . i ' m so confused . why do i keep giving nate the benefit of the doubt ,when he was so , such an ass ? i walk slowly back downstairs , through the living room , and out to the street . i turn toward the corner , where i can see a side street , and walk toward it . i know it ' s going to be a long car ride back to the apartment , and i feel like i ' m about to explode into a fit of rage .
