we never went for anything much , but we did hit the grocery store often enough . but i ' ' ' i want you to think . . . i mean , my mom , she really worked for me . ' ' ` ` i - i really don ' t think your mom ' s a gold digger . there have always been more of those things , and i can almost smell them at this point . i mean , maybe at first i was worried , but i ' m worried now . ' ' ` ` ' your mom - ' ' i say , feeling uncomfortable . ` ` i ' don ' t want to talk about her , ' ' he cuts me off , and throws a rock out onto the lake . it hits the bottom with a loud splash and disappears . ` ` sorry , ' ' i say . ` ` how ' s your head ? ' ' ` ` fine , ' ' he says softly . ` ` i ' ll see you down there , ' ' i say after a moment , since he ' s already finished with the water . ` ` hey , ' ' he calls after me as i climb the stairs . ` ` alec and his family are here . they ' re good people . they ' re on the guest list this weekend . '' ` ` got ##cha , mom , ' ' i say , slowly taking the rest of the glass . that was nice of him , and it was like he was telling me that he would e ' er kiss me himself . as i walk into the room , i can see that the other guests are starting to arrive . i wonder if now that i ' m nate ' s mother , i ' m going to have to put on the same song - and - dance routine as nate . maybe if i want to go to a party , like my dad ' s birthday party , i ' ll hang out for a while , and then go somewhere to read a book . my thoughts are confirmed when my mom leads me over to where she and pierce are talking with other guests . i ' m introduced to the guests , who turn out to be higher - ups for the marketing firm , and my feet are put down . they nod politely , and i begin to wonder if anyone could possibly be remotely interested in my self - righteous ##ness . as we leave , my mom turns around to greet the guests that are slowly filing in . i watch intently as nate walks away , charming with his wit and charm . maybe nate inherited that from his mother , even if heto show that it ' s a real date . i decide to pull away and head over to the crab table . like any good white crab , i do like it . as i hold my plate high , i feel a hand on the small of my back . i turn to see jackson smiling at me . with his warm , friendly smile , it ' s hard to keep in mind what nate told me about him , and what i want for myself . ` ` hey , brynn ! ' ' he says , pressing a kiss against my cheek . ` ` jackson , good to see you , ' ' i reply awkwardly . ` ` you left so abruptly the last time i saw you ! i was worried , ' ' he says . ` ` sorry about that , ' ' i reply , wondering if nate gave him a warning . ` ` we were going to go on that date ? ' ' i ' m startled by the sight of allison walking out onto the patio . ` ` could you excuse me for a minute ? my best friend just got here and she # n ' t notice anyone else , ' ' i say as i walk over . i wave at her as i pass , but she ' s looking around , and she ##n ' t notice my presence . ` ` allison !' ' i call out , stopping two feet from her . ` ` hi ! oh my gosh , i f ##n ' t know you , ' ' she says . i give her a smile as i stand up . ` ` this place is so beautiful ! and this place ! i know you said it was beautiful , but i still don ' t know it was this big . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' i reply . ` ` i ' ll give you a call , if you have a few minutes , ' ' i say quickly . ` ` come get something to eat with me - i was just picking up my car . i ' m so glad you ' re here . i ' haven ' t even seen anyone else , and none of the guys have shown up yet . ' ' ` ` the intern ? ' ' allison asks as we walk back over to the table , where i pick up my empty plate . ` ` yeah , him and all the guys from the university . ' ' ` ` wow , that was nice of him , ' ' allison says , picking up her empty plate . ` ` yeah , i think that he ' s the guy . . . the guy in the black leather jacket . ' ' i nodno . ` ` from dad , actually , ' ' i say . ` ` i think he and i were in congress at the same time . ' ' i start laughing and allison looks at me with a big smile . ` ` wow , ' ' # ##vin ' t think i ' m hearing about my dad being in congress . ' ' ` ` this is your real father ! ' ' allison says , excitedly . ` ` when do you think it ' ll come out ? ' ' ` ` good idea , ' ' i say as we walk toward a couple of chairs at one of the tables .
