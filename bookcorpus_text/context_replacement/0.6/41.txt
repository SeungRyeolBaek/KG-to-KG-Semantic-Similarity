he turned around in surprise . her heart stopped at the sight of the tears forming in his eyes . even in the dark , she could see the blood - red color of his eyes . his hand immediately came up to wipe away the tears from his face . ` ` sorry , ' ' he finally said in a hoarse voice . they stood in an awkward silence , staring each other down . finally , megan took a step forward to close the distance between them . ` ` how did you know i was coming here ? ' ' she asked . ` ` kristi told me . ' ' ` ` hmm . ' ' unable to stop herself , she reached out to touch his arm . ` ` i ' m so sorry , pesh . ' ' ` ` it s ##n ' t sad . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` yes , it is . you ' re in pain . . . you ' ve been through years . i ' can ' t help but feel sorry for what you ' re going through . ' ' his normally warm eyes took on a serious look . ` ` you are in that pain , megan . you have every right to be sad . but you should be more concerned with why you really aren ' t sad . ' ' ` ` ` ' 'please , ' ' she begged . ` ` ` don ' t what ? ' ' ` ` do don ' t try to hide your feelings by being something you ' re not , or pointing fingers at others . that is isn ' t you , and you just don ' t understand it . ' ' with a deep sigh , pesh ran his hand through his dark , wavy hair . ` ` i ' m sorry . that was completely uncalled for . ' ' ` ` it ' s okay . ' ' ` ` no , it ' s - ' ' she silenced him by bringing her hand up to cover his mouth . when she pulled her hand away , he frowned . ` ` listen to me , ' ' megan whispered . the sky above them opened up , allowing a light rain to fall . ` ` the life of a doctor is not easy . a doctor of medicine , any ability for that matter , must have compassion . and it is inevitable that the same pain you have will come back to haunt you - it may even kill you . when it comes , you can don ' t stop crying for the love that has been lost and for the love you left behind . ' ' his words trailed off , and megan pressed herself even closer to him .she sensed that his last words held deep pain for him . ` ` what really happened to your wife ? ' ' she asked softly . pesh ' s eyes softened . ` ` she had a blood pressure disorder . she was young , and she ' didn ' t remember anything else about her early life . she ' d never been in perfect health - she never even went to the hospital with the baby . and after we ' d been married for four years , we decided it was time to have a baby . ' ' when pesh remained silent , megan finally asked , ` ` did she die in childbirth ? ' ' he shook his head . ` ` no , we never got that far . we tried for over a year to get pregnant on our own , and it # ##n ' t work . so we were sent to a fertility clinic . when the iui tests proved didn ' t work , we tried ivf . ' ' a deep sigh came from deep within his chest . ` ` the whole thing was emotionally draining and ultimately emotionally gutting for both of us , but not for jade . ' ' he met her halfway . ` ` she blamed herself since the tests showed that everything was wrong with her . although we were listed as ' in- and then , ' she said that it was all her fault . ' ' ` ` ' her heart , ' ' megan whispered , and her heart went out to the man she ' d just met . getting pregnant had been so difficult for her . although she was hadn ' t ' t , she had never been pregnant in her life . and she knew what it did to a child when she saw pain in her husband ' s eyes . although her aunt was once the caring and loving mother of two young children , she knew the enormous pain that getting pregnant had meant . megan , herself , had probably been the cause of her aunt ' s greatest pain when she first discovered her pregnancy with mason . still without answers as to how she had felt , megan pressed pesh for answers . ` ` ' what happened with the ivf ? ' ' ` ` she became pregnant during the first month only to die two months later . we had just gone through the procedure when she died . ' ' pesh ' s adam ' s apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed hard . megan could only assume he was trying to keep his emotions in check . finally , he spoke up . ` ` she had an accident that had left herat the mayo clinic . i was in the kitchen making coffee when i heard a scream in the background . ' ' tears formed in his eyes . ` ` when i called her , and she said ##n ' t ' , i ran over to her . she was lying on the kitchen floor . after calling 911 , i tried her over and over again , but i could not reach her . ' ' ` ` ' pesh , ' ' megan whispered . the weight of his gaze was so heavy that even she found it difficult to breathe . without looking at her , he was staring straight ahead . ` ` from what the medical examiner said , i found great comfort in knowing she did don ' t scream - that she went willingly without any question or hesitation .
