she gave megan a pointed look . ` ` first of all , i did that for you , megan . ' ' megan wrinkled her nose . ` ` but i ' m just not ready for all of that yet . ' ' ` ` ` think long and hard before you decide to do anything with pesh . he is not very good , and in the end , you might lose your resolve not to let him come back here to hurt you . . . or him . ' ' megan held up her hands in surrender . ` ` okay , okay , i understand . ' ' emma sighed . ` ` nothing would make you happier than if you were to fall in love with pesh . ' ' with a laugh , megan said , ` ` did you not hear anything that i said ? i ' m in - laws . ' ' ` ` so is aidan . ' ' just as megan opened her mouth to speak , aidan walked into the room . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' ` ` yes . just finished bathing and changing him , ' ' emma . ` ` good . the elders are getting ready to welcome the new members of the tribe to the ceremony . ' ' aidan walked over to them and took his son into his arms . ` `you ready to go to the ranch , noah ? ' ' noah ' s response was to nod and reach for aidan ' s hand . with a smile , aidan said , ` ` i ' ll take that as a yes . ' ' he then leaned down to kiss emma ' s cheek . ` ` ' mrs . fitzgerald ? ' ' she asked , linking her arm through his . ` ` yes , mrs . fitzgerald , i am . ' ' megan and casey followed them out the door and down the hall . they entered a large room filled with family and friends . she left aidan and emma ' s room to seek out her parents to check on them . she approached her parents , but their arms were empty . in a whisper , she asked , ` ` where ' s mason ? ' ' her mother smiled and walked over to where a couple of her younger brothers sat . mason sat in the arms of her aunt becky ' s little brother , john . he was playing with what little john was holding on his lap . megan asked as she walked over to them . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' without taking his eyes off the boy , mason answered , ` ` we ' re fine . ' ' ` ` are you sure everything ' s okay with you ? '' what she ' wasn ' t sure was if he was still keeping an eye on her making calls on his phone . john spoke up . ` ` since i have two older brothers , i think i can trust him . plus , he ' s really into this stuff . ' ' ` ` okay then , ' ' megan said . she waved to john ' s brothers , casey and georgie , before making her way to the table . all her siblings were dying to know how her day was going and how mason was . she had just walked away from talking to her favorite aunt and uncle when someone brushed up against her shoulder . ` ` ' don ' t look now , but it ' s dr . mcdreamy , actor , ' ' casey whispered into her ear . without thinking , her eyes scanned the room . and then she saw him . someone was pulling him aside and making introductions . pesh was incredibly tall and wore a custom - tailored black suit . but beneath the layers of the suit , she could make out his bulging biceps and muscular shoulders . he obviously spent his time at work and working out . his thick , jet - black hair was cut short , and his blue eyes took in everything that he was wearing . and while she should have been in a dazetempted to step forward as his wife , she could couldn ' t help the ni * * les tightening and the delicious sensation of touching him . he was all the way across the room , and it had the same effect as if he were right by her side , pressed against her . ` ` see what i mean ? ' ' casey asked . megan licked her lips . ` ` oh my , ' ' she finally said . ` ` so you ' ' ' i want to give him a chance ? ' ' resisting the urge to cover herself , megan quickly added , ` ` i ' d like to give him many , many chances . ' ' chances at taking off my clothes , chances at kissing and touching him all over my body , chances at using his tongue , teeth , and the huge bulge in his pants to kiss me until i come . . . yep , many , many chances . as if she could read megan ' s mind , casey laughed . ` ` damn girl , this has you written all over it . ' ' chapter 8 pesh looked nervously around the inside of the church . the fact he was in a catholic church , wasn ' t the only reason he was out of his element . as he approached the large statue of mary , he noticedespecially with his godfather . although emma had thought aidan was happy with the idea of him being married , she was still a little nervous about seeing aidan again . the last time they ' d been together , pesh was the one flying aidan from north carolina to california just in time for emma ' s imminent arrival . but that was six months ago . the magic of the wedding had had time to fade , and to aidan , pesh could only be the man who had swept emma away . the front door opened , and aidan stepped out .
