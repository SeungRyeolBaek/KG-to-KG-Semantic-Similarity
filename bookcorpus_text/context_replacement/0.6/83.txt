it seems that with this , she ' s having first period morning sickness . i told her i would be here with her , but she insisted i stay for a quick meal . ' ' ` ` sure thing . we ' ll make her a plate for you to take back to her later tonight , ' ' megan said . aidan nodded . ` ` thanks . if she can make it , i think she ' ll be fine . ' ' he tapped his glass against his wine ##glass . ` ` is everyone all that ' s going to be eating ? ' ' a chorus of , ` ` yes , ' ' echoed through the room . ` ` good . let ' s say yes . ' ' pesh slowly nodded his head along with the others . when they finished , the drinks were passed around and dinner was served . it was all a little different than how his family did it , but aidan really enjoyed being with megan ' s family . while patrick ate from his plate , megan gave aidan a break from feeding her , or more accurately letting him wrap her in blankets like he fed himself . ` ` you ' re a sweetheart , ' ' megan said , into aidan ' s salt - and - pepper ##ed face . his response was to smile at her. ` ` i ' m sorry , megan , but that poor little boy just ain ' t going to cook for me . ' ' ` ` he ' s so stubborn , ' ' aidan said . ` ` ' ' stubborn ? i ' ve never heard of that , ' ' becky said across the table . aidan shook his head . ` ` i ' m serious . he refuses to let ' ' me feed him , and sometimes he ends up drinking more than he should . ' ' ` ` ' ' his mother , ' ' angie said . when aidan gave her an odd look , she added , ` ` you sound the exact same way . ' ` don ' t think you ate a thing until you spoke with that woman . ##n ' i want to finish you off before you eat . ' ' aidan laughed . ` ` ' don ' t tell her that either . she already blamed you two for emma ' s death . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` let ' s hope that this little one matches emma ' s temperament . ' ' ` ` ' she laughed . ' ' you , ' ' aidan said . ` ` ' more than you know , ' ' megan said . licking his lips , aidan seemed to be studying her thoughtfully . ` ` you 'to a friend , ' ' he added , with a wink . after everyone finished eating , the adults sat around the table talking and laughing while the kids filed into the living room . only megan and percy decided to stay with the older boys . ` ` can you keep an eye on them ? ' ' megan asked aidan . ` ` sure , ' ' percy replied . ` ` i love you , perce , ' ' aidan said , as he took the boy by the hand . as he sat with his arm draped over the back of megan ' s chair , pesh sat listening to the lively conversation around him . occasionally one of aidan ' s friends would ask him a question about his family . aidan had always been very quiet , and when he was in the middle of such a lively conversation , he tended to become even quieter . he knew if he was going to really fit in , he was going to have to grow up first . their conversation was interrupted by a crash that came from the living room followed by a loud crash . aidan was out of his chair in a flash . megan followed close on his heels . aidan came running into the living room . ` ` what happened ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` someone is hurt . ' ' aidan looked aroundthe dining room with noah in his arms . ` ` he ' s fine . he just fell asleep . ' ' taking noah ' s hand , aidan said , ` ` ` noah , put the booboos down , okay ? ' ' noah smiled and nodded his head . when aidan finished with his son , noah held out his hand . aidan nodded . ` ` okay . ' ' as aidan bent down to noah ' s hand and kissed it , he asked , ` ` are you daddy ' s boy ? ' ' ` ` uh - huh . ' ' angie laughed . ` ` that ' s not fair to ask that when emma ' s ' not here . ' ' as the others laughed , pesh glanced at mason . he was staring at aidan and angie with a stunned look on his face . never in a million years could he have imagined what he would say next . mason crawled up into his lap and patted pesh ' s head . ` ` esh daddy ' s boy . ' ##y ' ' boy . ' ' silence in the dining room continued . without even looking up , pesh felt his skin crawl from the attention of everyone staring at him and him . there was no way he could ignore the man when he had such an expression ofno . ` ` well , you ' re daddy ' s girl . ' ' her soft laugh caused him to shift his gaze from her back to megan . wide - eyed and open mouthed , she blinked a few times as if she were trying to confirm that what she was seeing was real . then without another word , she rose from her chair and left the room . pesh sat in a stunned silence for a few moments trying to decide what to do . leaning over , he whispered into megan ' s ear , ` ` ' you go ahead and sit with the others ? i need to check on her .
