she laughed . ` ` you just sound a little too romantic for me . ' ' he shook his head at her . ` ` what other romantic notions do you have for me ? ' ' ` ` not many , ' ' she admitted . despite her excitement , she could ##n ' t help thinking how she wanted to see him be happy just for her . she wondered what other tricks he might have up his sleeve . ` ` for some reason , i just don ' t think that . ' ' he crossed his arms over his broad chest . ` ` let me guess . you think that i ' m a ' normal ' man who drinks beer , would never think of sex or other inappropriate thoughts , and his underwear drawer , and that makes solving the infinity puzzle a fun saturday night ? ' ' megan could couldn ' t help smiling at his words . it was a good idea not to dwell on how he had other inappropriate thoughts and his underwear drawer . at the moment , she was having second thoughts about his underwear . . . and the contents inside . of course , she could ##n ' t help admiring him for not being the marrying type . ` ` no , that ' s not what i think of you . ' ' ` ` you would .no . i thought that since i ' m a little older than you - ' ' ` ` ' a little ? ' ' the corners of his mouth turned up . ` ` ' you think i ' m an old lady . ' ' ` ` no , i ' ' ' not , ' ' she snapped . ` ` how old do you think i am ? just tired of changing clothes and a shower ? ' ' she glared at him . ` ` i am not saying that at all . i think you ' re just referring to ankle ' s age . ' ' pesh ' s brow furrowed in confusion . ` ` what ? ' ' she paused before realizing where the question came from . ` ` i see . and just how old is she then ? ' ' ` ` thirty - seven . ' ' ` ` hmm , ' ' pesh said . ` ` are you older than that ? ' ' ` ` ' still . i ' m thirty - seven . ' ' actually , he was a little younger than her . thirty , to be exact . ` ` did i tell you ? ' ' he asked , with a teasing tone to his voice . she shook her head . ` ` i ' d hardly call thirty - seven old . ' ' ` `he ' s much older than you are , right ? ' ' ` ` i am , ' ' she said . he smiled at her as he leaned on the counter with his elbows . ` ` and just how old are you ? ' ' ` ` twenty - five - i ' ll be twenty - six in a few years . ' ' ` ` twenty - five going on twenty - six . ' ' ` ` oh . ' ' ` ` that must be very important to you . ' ' he held out his hand and shook it . ` ` you may have a bald spot or something . ' ' she slapped his hand away . ` ` shut up . twenty - five is too old . ' ' ` ` got any gray hairs ? ' ' she asked , reaching up to where his thick head of hair lay in front of her face . her fingers began to comb through the damp strands . her mind flashed back to the vivid memory of her fingers pulling at his hair as he went down on her , pulling it hard when he sucked and licked her until she screamed , and then brushing the wet strands away from his face as he rose up to cover her mouth with his . she cleared her throat that had gone dry . ` ` no , of course not . ' ' 'tilting his head up to look at her . ` ` ' let ' s hope for that too . ' ' ` ` i would hope so . ' ' aidan appeared then , placing all the drinks on a tray . ` ` i want a beer when you two arrive , ' ' he said . ` ` i ' ll take that , ' ' megan offered . then jerking his head toward the seat next to him , aidan said , ` ` ' ' won ' t you come sit over here with me ? ' ' she resisted the urge to slap him . she was enjoying having pesh to herself . ` ` um , okay . sure , ' ' she said , slowly sliding out of her seat . when they switched seats , she was happy to have pesh in the empty seat beside her , rather than across from her . once she was settled in , she thankfully wasn ' t enjoying her life way too much . between casey , and emma ' s new best friend , connor , the table was engulfed in constant chatter . it was like being with a group of friends . since she had gotten pregnant , she didn didn ' t have much in common with her older siblings anymore . even when she was a mother , she rarely saw anyone from her own family . her motherbut in an entirely different direction than theirs had . the conversation and laughter flowed as freely as the music . megan found herself halfway through her second drink when she started feeling dizzy . a blush stained her cheeks at the same time she felt sick . when aidan came back with the bottle , she asked , ` ` did you put something else in this one ? ' ' ` ` no , we ran out of the one we had for the night , so i gave my new one a double shot of the whiskey . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' megan asked . aidan ' s eyebrows rose at his handing her the bottle . after he drank , he asked , ` ` does it taste good ? ' '
