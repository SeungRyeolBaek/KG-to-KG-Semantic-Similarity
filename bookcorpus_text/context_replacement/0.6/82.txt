and if you can make it sound any worse , t ' s ' pose against the company policy to date each other . besides , we knew each other long before i started working at wellstar . ' ' ` ` is that so ? ' ' dev asked . ` ` yes , it is . ' ' a slow smile spread across his face . ` ` i like you , ' ' he said to megan . ` ` you have an interesting way of showing it . ' ' charlie sat at the head of the table . ` ` my , my , alpesh , why haven ' t you got a new boyfriend ? ' ' pesh glanced at megan , who nervously smoothed the white fabric of her dress . she gave charlie a shy smile . ` ` i have . ' ' with a wink , charlie replied , ` ` i really don ' t . it ' s just so nice to see you help dev into his well - deserved place . i bet you like him , too . ' ' when his mother gasped in horror , megan reached under the table for pesh ' s hand . he squeezed it gently . she shook her head . ` ` um , no , i ' m sorry to say that i did . ' ' ` ` ' megan 'in fact , i probably deserved it . i called alpesh and said some pretty awful things . ' ' ` ` dev ! ' ' lavani shrieked . in typical dev fashion , aidan rolled his eyes at his brother ' s outburst . ` ` we ' re here now . everyone calm down . ' ' dev met pesh ' s gaze . ` ` i ' m happy for you , aidan . you ' ve made a great team . ' ' dev cut his eyes over to megan . ` ` i think you two will be very happy together . ' ' pesh was taken aback by the sincerity in both dev ' s voice and his expression . ` ` thank you . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` yes , thank you . ' ' dev leaned back in his chair , folding his arms behind his head . ` ` and , to ensure that my happiness amidst the chaos brought on by the two of you , i ' d like to announce that i ' m getting married next week - ' ' lavani once again gasped in surprise . but dev was ne ' er prepared . ` ` and i ' m going to be a father . ' ' pesh ' s mouth dropped open as the room erupted into utter laughter . he wondered if his brotherprobably about to pass out . turning to megan , he saw her with her hand over her mouth . from the way her legs were bouncing up and down , he could tell she was crying . he leaned down to whisper in her ear . ` ` guess we ' re off the hook , huh ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` yeah , i guess we ' re off . ' ' ` ` i love you . ' ' ` ` i love you too . ' ' chapter 8 now that he and megan were an official couple and had said the ` ` yes ' ' sign , pesh no longer took time off where he had to learn how to pass the time . he wanted to spend every waking moment with her and with her , and she always made sure that they spent time together . becky found him at megan ' s house , sitting on the couch with all of megan ' s other family members . just like with his parents , the women were already busy in the kitchen , putting the finishing touches on their dinner . as soon as becky walked into the living room and announced it was time to sit down , there was a rush to the dining room . he followed along behind the others , searching for megan who he felt somehow was his place in the world . ` `where ' s aidan and emma ? they ' re at home , ' ' angie said , as she placed a large plate on the table . liz laughed . ` ` they have ##n ' s today . we could go out and get them , and then they can eat when they get home . ' ' she pulled out a chair . ` ` please . i ' m starving . ' ' becky rolled her eyes . ` ` you ' re all right . between you and me , we ' re about to get you out of here and home . ' ' pesh sat back as the others began taking their seats around the large dining table . regardless of how nice the montgomery ' s had been , he still could can ' t help feeling like an ass . megan walked in with a plate of food . as she set it on the table , her eyes scanned the room for him . when she saw him , she gave him the smile that always melted his heart , pointing her finger at him . as he started to approach her , mason came running over . ` ` get up , esh , ' ' he said , holding his arms out . pesh laughed as he bent down to pick mason up . ` ` are you okay ? ' ' pesh asked . ` `uh , huh . ' ' ` ` are you going to sit with me , pesh ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` esh , ' ' aidan replied . ` ` is that okay with you ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` we ' ll be fine . ' ' she motioned for him to have a seat . just as they sat down , aidan appeared in the doorway of the living room with noah in his arms . ` ` sorry we ' re late . ' ' ` ` where ' s emma ? ' ' megan asked , as she took noah from aidan . with a frown , aidan replied , ` ` she ' s ' not feeling well .
