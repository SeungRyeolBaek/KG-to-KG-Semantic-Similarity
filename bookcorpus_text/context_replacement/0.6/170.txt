nate asks , turning his head toward me but not making eye contact . ` ` yes , ' ' i whisper back , unsure of what else to do or say . ` ` okay , see you back here in ten minutes , ' ' nate replies , and walks away . i wait until i can hear him walking down the stairs before i respond . i ' ve never heard my father speak to his son like that before , and our old house is probably ' not ' full of loving homes . and the way nate ' s shoulders slumped when he finished talking to him , it looked like he agreed with what his father was saying to him . i run up the stairs to my room and change into my pajamas , before heading back downstairs to grab some breakfast - it actually makes me feel better . as soon as everyone ' s done eating , i go into the kitchen to wait for nate . should i tell my mom about what he just said ? would she even care ? she seems to have taken the alcohol kool - aid pretty well at this point . and now that he has been the target of the accusations , it will be even harder for her to think anything bad of him . i look up , startled , as nate walks in and sits down on the couch next to me .` ` i can tell by that look on your face that you want to talk , ' ' he smiles . i smile back , he knows me well . ` ` but the thing with my dad - that ' s off - limits , remember ? ' ' and i want to tell him that those things you said earlier weren ' t true . ` ` but - ' ' ` ` please , brynn . i just want us to be able to keep this out . but if you keep bringing it up . . . ' ' i sigh . ` ` fine . but wo ##uld ' t say anything . in fact , i . . . ' ' i gesture to the wall wall full of movie posters . ` ` no romantic comedies ! ' ' ` ` no romance , ' ' i say , pulling out the posters . ` ` is that a romantic comedy ? ' ' he asks , narrowing his eyes suspiciously . ` ` no , not really . there is sex in it , but it ' s not about the relationship , ' ' i say , ' not to mention the obvious father - daughter relationship . ` ` hey , you seem to have some benefits , ' ' i say with a smile . ` ` fine , fine , ' ' he says , rolling his eyes . 'grabs a handful of popcorn and leans against the back of the couch as i put the movie in . as i make myself comfortable on the other end , he grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and wraps it around my feet , because he knows that they are cold . i feel a pang in my chest at the simple gesture , but try to push it away . he ' s not being mean , just concerned . i look up at the blank tv screen as the sun comes up . i feel more comfortable with nate than i do with anyone else in my life right now , but i have to settle for being comfortable with him . maybe i could avoid him forever . chapter twelve ` ` you and nate go over there when we get ##n ' s on the schedule ! ' ' my mom reminds me . she has a weekend trip to go fishing on the reservation , but nate is still on the reservation between shifts , even though it ' s a weekend . ` ` i ' ll swing by and get him and meet you there . ' ' ` ` you sure ? ' ' ` ` yeah , he said he ' d just stay a little longer , ' ' she tells me . ` ` okay , ' ' i reply with a smile , and walk intothe other is the closet where nate is putting on his clothes . ` ` my dad said they ' re going to meet us there , ' ' i tell him . ` ` first off , let ' s switch cars , then . ' ' he grins . and then we go to his car , nate playing some god - awful metal music . ` ` how can you listen to this shit ? it sounds like a kid ' s playing with a trashcan . ' ' i shake my head . ` ` what ? this is metal , they ' re playing heavy metal , you have to love it . ' ' he smiles proudly . ` ` i would like to reign in blood for one of my classes . ' ' ` ` oh . ' ' i screw my face up in mock disappointment . he turns it up loud , nodding his head enthusiastically as the guitar chords turn into what i know is his favorite part of the song . it ' s nice to see him let loose like this , and even though i know his taste in music is bad , i have to admit i like to see him enjoying himself . luckily , the school is just a little ways up the road in the middle of the beach , and i ' m notback to school for a few more days . the temperature on this particular day is in the mid - twenties , and my body is intent upon having a little fun today . as we take a left onto the main road with an old sign pointing the way , i see an empty parking lot , and know most people are comfortable staying indoors with their air - conditioning on . after we park , nate goes over to the wood - burning shed to start the car , and i dig the keys out of my pocket .
