come back in a minute , and we ' ll do the dishes . ' ' megan resisted the urge to yell after kristi as she walked away . instead , she turned back to pesh who was staring down at her . ` ` you s ##n ' t exactly look happy to see me , ' ' pesh said . she shook her head slowly . ` ` how could i not ? the man , who i just made an ass out of myself in front of , is at the hospital where i ' m doing my clinicals . that s ##n ' t exactly make my day . ' ' ` ` for the last time , you have nothing to be happy about . ' ' ` ` okay , but that does not make me feel any better , ' ' she replied . ` ` what can i do to put you at ease about being with me ? ' ' rubbing her suddenly aching head , she said , ` ` i honestly don ' t know . if i thought it would wouldn ' t make you feel bad , i ' d suggest a drink . ' ' ` ` i know you that much ? ' ' pesh asked . when she looked up at him , his expression was serious . ` ` no , megan , you really don ' t know me .it ' s just that . . . ' ' she chewed nervously on her bottom lip before she spoke . after taking a deep breath , she said , ` ` it ' s just that for the last two years , i had too much control of my life . the night i was with you , i let all that control go . after getting drunk , i became someone else - someone i wanted to be . the girl , the woman , who would do anything to get a man ' s attention . i can ##n ' t remember that night very much , and i really don ' t ever want to go back there . seeing you tonight made me forget all of that . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help being amazed at how honest she ' d been able to be with him . pesh was silent for a moment . his dark eyes bore into hers . ` ` i am honored that you drank so much on the night we were together . for me , it was not caused by alcohol or you being drunk . i enjoyed spending time with you and getting to know you . ' ' megan swallowed hard . ` ` i enjoyed waking up with you . i would give anything for you to be able to look at me without having to feel sorry for yourself . ' ' `` you really enjoyed being with me that night ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` when i told you i wanted to see you again , i was shocked . ' ' she smiled . ` ` that ' s very sweet of you , but i ' haven ' t changed my mind about it . ' ' ` ` you mean haven ' t ? ' ' with a shake of her head , she said , ` ` i have too much going on in my life right now to get involved with anyone . it would wouldn ' t be fair to them . . . to you . especially since we both want very different things from each other . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' he whispered . megan saw the pain that filled his eyes . ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she whispered . ` ` you have nothing to forgive . the pain i ' m feeling is once again my own . ' ' he gave her a sad smile . ` ` i seem to be falling for people who obviously weren ' t meant for me . ' ' she sucked in a sharp breath at his words . ` ` what ? you mean . . . you are falling for me ? ' ' pesh opened his mouth to speak , but at the sound of kristi walking in from theshut up , he called it . closing the distance between them , he said , ` ` ` don ' t worry about that with me , megan . we ' ll just be friends , and i will respect your privacy and your privacy . ' ' for some reason , his words had the opposite effect they should have , and relief swept through her . somehow , she managed to say , ` ` thank you . i appreciate that . ' ' with a nod , he slowly turned and walked away . she heaved a deep sigh as kristi walked up to her . ` ` quite a gentleman , is isn ' t he ? ' ' ` ` yes , he is , ' ' megan agreed . ` ` not hard on the eyes though . ' ' a small laugh escaped megan ' s lips . ` ` no , he ' s not . ' ' ` ` i know that most of the women here in the city act like they ' re in love whenever he is around . ' ' kristi defended herself . ` ` i mean , that smile , those eyes , and those eyes . oh , if i were ain ' t a happily married woman , what i would ##n ' t want to do to that man ! ' ' megan knew exactly what kristi meant . ', she was never going to get the chance to do that for herself . somehow she ' d managed to marry the only man left in the world who would only ' ever engage in ' a physical relationship . unfortunately , pesh seemed to want more than she was willing to give . ` ` did you hear what i said ? ' ' kristi asked . megan lifted her gaze from pesh ' s sleeping form back to face kristi . ` ` i ' m saying what ? ' ' kristi asked . ` ` ' yeah , i ' m going to lose this man to dr . nadeen ' s disease , huh ? ' ' shaking her head slowly , megan said , ` ` no , no , we ' re just saying - ' ' don ' t want anything like that for him . ' '
