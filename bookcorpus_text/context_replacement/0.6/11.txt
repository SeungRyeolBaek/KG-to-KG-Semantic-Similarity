` ` ' ' people . you having to do that is bad enough . ' ' crossing his arms over his chest , aidan said , ` ` you came over here to see if we were going to go or not ? people are getting curious . i had no idea i was going to have such an interesting evening . of course , i do don ' t think i want to know why the two of you are discussing emma ' s and my sex life right now . ' ' emma waved her hand dismissively . ` ` we do don ' t . and anyway , we ' re going to go . let ' s round everyone up . ' ' as emma walked over to join them to sit down , aidan glanced at megan , saying , ` ` total freak . ' ' megan closed her eyes as if in pain . ` ` excuse me . please . ' ' ` ` ' go . because you never know if your sister will be a total freak tonight . ' ' and with a wink , he walked off to join emma , leaving megan to wonder why everyone was so concerned with hers and pesh ' s sex life . as the lights began fading , most of the other guests began to file out the door . by the time it got dark , it was only a matter of aidanand emma ' s best friend too . megan reluctantly let her mother take a tired emma home , but she wanted to stay to help emma clean up . the truth was she wanted to spend as much time as she could with pesh . instead , she found herself sitting next to him at one of the poolside tables . one they managed to set up by themselves after most of the other guests had left . leaning back in her chair , she asked , ` ` did you always want to be a doctor ? ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` for my sixteenth birthday , my father avoided the usual hospital doctor ' s questions by giving me a full medical kit with everything from the hospital . he asked everyone who would sit still long enough , even the family doctor . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i thought you were a good little girl . ' ' ` ` my father took some big risks , ' ' he said , with a chuckle . ` ` ' your father was also a doctor ? ' ' ` ` yes , he had a successful medical practice for many years . he just recently retired . ' ' ` ` does he want you to follow in his footsteps ? ' ' he asked . ` ` i ' m starting to feel like i ' m being tested . '' she smiled . ` ` i ' m sorry if you feel that way . i ' m just trying to get to know you . ' ' ` ` you ' re not a very nice woman , ' ' he said . ` ` i think you ' re avoiding the question by asking lies . ' ' ` ` there ' s lies and then there ' s the truth . ' ' shaking her head , she said , ` ` and then that ' s not really my question . ' ' he held up his hands in surrender . ` ` fine , fine . look , i did ##n ' t feel pressure to become a doctor . my parents would have never wanted me to have a career where i did ##n ' t feel pressure . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` so you ' ve always felt the need to help people ? ' ' ` ` pretty much . as the eldest , i always looked out for my two younger brothers and sisters . my mother has always called me an honest man . ' ' ` ` i can see that in you . ' ' leaning forward , he rested his elbows on the table . ` ` now it is my turn to be the judge . ' ' ` ` look , i really don ' t care .' ' ` ` what about you ? did you really choose nursing as your career ? ' ' ` ` yes and no . instead , i decided to become a doctor . ' ' his eyebrows shot up in surprise . ` ` really ? ' ' when she nodded , he asked , ` ` what changed ? ' ' there was no way she was going to tell him the truth about her past and why she had been unable to attend medical school . instead , she shrugged . ` ` i changed , i guess . i focused on the next best thing , which was you . ' ' pesh smiled down at her . ` ` was it your son ? ' ' ` ` why me ? ' ' ` ` was it your son who changed your mind about medical school ? ' ' she shook her head . ` ` no , it was because i wanted children . ' ' ` ` is that . . . are you . . . ? ' ' pesh shook his head . ` ` forgive me . i was being too blunt . ' ' ` ` oh , come on . i told you i was s ' pose going to answer your questions . ' ' she laughed . ` ` ' it ' s rude to ask , and it ' s not my business . ' ' ` ` 'answer your question , ' ' she demanded . after a long moment , she finally asked , ` ` are you divorced ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m not divorced . and i , ' ' and i ' didn ' t have anything to do with him . ' ' anger flashed in pesh ' s blue eyes . ` ` even though i know nothing of him , i know that he is still a man . a man does not abandon his children and his wife . ' ' ` ` you would be right . he ' s just a man playing at being a man , ' ' she said , sitting down at the table .
