how was it possible for her to remind him so easily of what he had become ? aidan frowned as he looked between the two of them . ` ` i want to introduce you to pesh nadeen , the doctor . ' ' holding out her hand , megan smiled up at him . ` ` it ' s very nice to finally meet you . ' ' aidan stared at her a moment before his good mood overcame his embarrassment . he took her hand in his and shook it . ` ` it ' s very nice meeting you , too . ' ' ` ` i ' ll leave you two to get to know each other , ' ' aidan said . before pesh could respond , aidan turned and disappeared into the crowd . aidan turned to megan and began clearing his throat of what felt like a lack of emotion . he knew he should try to make polite conversation , but he was just as shell - shocked by the way megan reacted . instead , she took pity on him . ` ` aidan , emma tells me you ' re a doctor . ' ' pesh smiled broadly . ` ` yes , i am . ' ' ` ` what kind of services ? ' ' ` ` medical services . ' ' megan ' s eyes lit up . ` ` oh , how wonderful .i ' m about to start medical school , and i ' ve applied for a residency at the hospital . ' ' pesh widened his eyes in surprise . aidan had forgotten to mention that they had the same interests in medicine . ` ` really ? ' ' megan nodded . ` ` i ' m going to be successful at grady , even though my parents would die a thousand deaths . ' ' he raised his eyebrows at her . ` ` i assume they ' re concerned for your safety ? ' ' ` ` no . they ' wouldn ' t be concerned about the safety . they just think i ' m an adult , rather than a child . ' ' ` ` what is it about grady that interests you ? ' ' ` ` ' the fact that it ' s well known for the neighborhood ? ' ' he asked . ` ` no , for the neighborhood . ' ' megan tilted her head in question . ` ` i think it ' s the fact i just like to feel like i ' m making a difference and saving lives . i knew that at grady i would be helping some of the worst people here , and in fact the people here wouldn ' t ' ' have a lot of choice . ' ' he was taken aback by her words and the ease with which she spokethem . although she had a slight body , she also seemed to have a greater strength of character than he had originally thought . he couldn ##n ' t ever meet women like her . most of the women at the hospital who threw themselves at him with only superficial charm . he really don ' t have to be with them very long to see their own flaws and self - centeredness . to them , he was a battle to be won . he could couldn ' t ever imagine megan feeling that way . she was wasn ' t the type of woman to worry about a new husband on her own - she wanted to make her own way in the world . ` ` it is so nice to hear you speak with such passion about yourself . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' she asked . ` ` we really need more people like you . i think i would like to work with someone who shares your passion . ' ' she smiled at his compliment . he could couldn ' t help noticing what a beautiful smile she had . the way it framed her heart shaped face made her look even more like megan than he had originally thought . ` ` thank you . maybe we ' ll end up together . ' ' she pursed her lips before saying , ` ` you know , at the same time. ' ' ` ` i would like that . but i ' m afraid that wellstar pale in comparison to grady . ' ' ` ` do the hills have some nice people ? ' ' ` ` they do . i ' ve lived here since my childhood , and i could ##v ' er be living anywhere else . after all , i would ##n ' er be sitting here talking with you if it were o ' er for wellstar and your family . ' ' ` ` that ' s true . ' ' tilting her head , she gave him a very genuine smile . ` ` and what a relief that would be if our paths weren ##n ' er crossed . ' ' he sucked in his breath at the honesty of her words . could she possibly be interested in him ? sure , it was common knowledge that aidan and others wanted them to be together , but he never suspected that she had even heard their plans . and while initially he had been put off by aidan ' s idea of breaking them up , he could couldn ' t help but be intrigued now . there was something so very appealing about megan , especially her obvious attraction to him . ` ` megan ! ' ' a female voice called . pesh glanced over megan ' s shoulder where a dark - haired girlcame running over . he wrapped his arms around megan ' s waist . she gave him an odd look before walking over . ` ` what ' s the matter , mason ? ' ' he looked up at her . ` ` thank you . ' ' with a smile , she walked over and picked him up . when he settled on her lap , she turned her attention back to pesh . ` ` this is my son , mason . ' ' pesh could couldn ' t help noticing how megan studied his face to see if there was any doubt or any surprise about her having a son .
