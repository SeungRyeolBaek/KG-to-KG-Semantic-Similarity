she asked . sean laughed as he nudged gavin . ` ` she ' s just jealous , dad . being jealous about some things never changes anything . ' ' megan opened her mouth to lay into her brother , but she found herself smiling , so she closed it all down . without another word to her brothers , she walked into the living room . she found her dad sitting in his chair with mason glued to his lap . when her dad looked up , he did a double take . ` ` ' they ' say you look beautiful , megan , ' ' he said . she leaned over and kissed his cheek . ` ` thanks , dad . ' ' he tore his eyes away from the screen to look at her . ` ` so , good - bye ? ' ' this was a question she really hadn ' t been asking . ` ` well , mason is going to go visit his friend tomorrow , and you ' re going to stay here with grammy and grammy . ' ' his dark brow furrowed . ` ` ' to grammy ? ' ' sadness swept through her . how could she miss one of her few happy days away from her family ? the doorbell rang , and she was scared out of her self - control to open the door . taking a deep breath , shedamn it . her heart did a funny little flip - flop at the sight of pesh on the doorstep . it was wasn ' t just how handsome he was in his black slacks , white button - up dress shirt , and black tie . it was also the fact he held a dozen red roses in his hands . ` ` hi , ' ' she said softly , and they both stared at each other for a few seconds . he smiled . ` ` hi . ' ' ` ` would you like to come in ? ' ' when he nodded , she stepped back to give him room to walk through the door . he turned back to her and held out the flowers . ` ` these are for you . ' ' as the words left his mouth , he frowned , as if what she had done embarrassed him . ` ` they ' re beautiful . thank you . ' ' ` ` good - bye again , emma ! ' ' he called from the living room . she looked back at pesh . ` ` i ' m sorry . i ' ll just be a minute . ' ' ` ` take your time . ' ' she walked through the foyer and into the living room . she tossed the flowers onto one of the chairs . ` ` i ' ll be rightno . you be a good boy , okay ? ' ' she said , when she returned to her son ' s side . she leaned over and kissed both of mason ' s cheeks . ` ` give me a hug . ' ' mason gave her a quick kiss on the cheek . ` ` goodnight , my love , ' ' megan said , before turning and walking out of the room . she ' d just reached pesh ' s door when he looked at her . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` i think we have a new problem , ' ' he said , with a smile . she turned around to see him standing in the doorway . ` ` what ' s wrong , baby ? ' ' ` ` no go , ' ' she said . she looked up at pesh . ` ` i ' m sorry . he just feels bad about you leaving him . ' ' she knelt down beside him . ` ` ` wo ##l ' ` be gone long , and you ' ll have much more fun playing with grammy and emma . pesh and i are just normal , boring family people . ' ' ` ` no go ! ' ' he cried , as the tears formed in his eyes . pesh knelt down beside her . ` ` heythen , ' don ' t worry . i ' m not going to take your mom away from you . ' ' ` ` ' ##y ? ' ' mason asked megan . megan shook her head . ` ` no , buddy , i told you that we were going to do some fun things together . ' ' ` ` that ' s true , ' ' pesh said . then he looked at megan . ` ` ` that ' ain ' t anything we do don ' t take a little time off . ' ' megan ' s widened her eyes in surprise . ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` we do don ' t we take mason to dinner at his favorite restaurant ? ' ' ` ` you really don ' t mean that , ' ' megan said . pesh slid his eyes over to her . ` ` yes , i do . we can make our plans . ' ' she could couldn ' t help staring at him in disbelief . how was it that he was so willing to change his plans just because he # ##n ' t wanted her to go ? she resisted the urge to reach out and touch his face to make sure it was real - it was just too good to be true at all . ` ` is that okay with you ? ' ' peshfor her . ` ` of course it ' s all okay with me . i was worried about it not being okay with you . ' ' ` ` i would ##n ' t have done it if you # n ' t want to . ' ' she reached over and stroked mason ' s head . ` ` all right , mason , where do you want to go for dinner ? ' ' ` ` cheese ! cheese ! ' ' mason exclaimed , as he jumped up and down . megan watched as pesh ' s expression grew serious . ` ` he wants to eat pizza ? ' ' she asked . ` ` no , he wants to go to chuck e . cheese - his parent ' s worst nightmare . ' ' pesh said as he got up from the bed .
