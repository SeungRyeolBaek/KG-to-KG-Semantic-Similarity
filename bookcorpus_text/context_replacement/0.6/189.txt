i feel him slide his fingers into my pussy and squeeze . i never realized how many nerve endings were in there . ` ` control yourself , ' ' he tells me , and begins to push himself into me . my hands reach for the edge of the blanket and i ' m barely able to grab it as he pushes in deeper than he ever has before . he slams into me again and again , hitting my g - spot harder each time . my second orgasm takes me by surprise , as if i were lying dormant until he filled me . my body shakes and shakes as i feel him pull out of me and the blanket covers my body . as my body shakes , i hear him go to the bathroom and see him rubbing a tissue over my eyes . ` ` i ' m sorry , i just don ' t know how you did that , ' ' he says . ` ` what ? did what ? ' ' i ask , reaching up to wipe the wet tissue from my eyes . ` ` i . . . i cried for you , ' ' he says , stopping his frantic efforts to look me in the eye . ` ` nate . . . it ' s okay . ' ' doesn ' t bother me , ' ' i assure him . ` ` '? ' ' he nods , visibly uncomfortable . ` ` i ' ve never done that before , i just . . . i just wanted to hear something from you , feel something . i ' m sorry . . . i know i pushed you too far . ' ' ` ` i like what we do together , ' ' i say , stretching my arms above my head . ` ` as far as i ' m concerned , we ' re going to do a lot more , so you better get used to it . ' ' ` ` is that so ? ' ' he says , with a smile . ` ` yep . now wake yourself up . if we ' re going to do this again tomorrow night , you need to get some sleep . ' ' chapter twenty - two the next day , thornhill and co . is thrilled with the official announcement of nate broadman as a new client . there ' s talk that other high - profile clients could follow suit , including some of broadman ' s friends in silicon valley . apparently the business giant is very effective in influencing public opinion . i ' m just glad that everyone is in such a good mood , because it helps me fit in . my conversation with nate , not to mention our upcoming lunch date , has me positively glowing . italking to me alone in our office , the memories of our first week of living together having almost melted away in the past hour . she turns in her chair and raises her eyebrows at me as greg walks in , giving me a small smile . ` ` so , what happened next ? ' ' she asks conspiratorially . ` ` it was awkward , ' ' i tell her , keeping my eyes on my desk , but i can see out of my peripheral that she ' s still staring at me . ` ` oh , come on . ' wo can ' t explain . but it ' s obvious . . . i mean , for a few weeks you two were hanging out a lot , and now he just dumped you . ' ' i shrug . ` ` we went on a few dates , and then we decided to break it off . we just keep it between us , okay ? ' ' ` ` mmhm , ' ' she says , turning back around . she can tell , even now , that i ' m not telling her the full story . greg reacted as badly as could be expected when i told him i really don ' t want to go on any more dates with him . i called the entire staff , and said i wantedno reason for me to be seen as the boss ' s daughter , but i think nate sees through that facade . at least he could never know the real me . and whenever i see him he ' s kind and understanding . i tap the side of my mouth , waiting to see if allison will send me a gchat response , but none comes . i ' ll give it a little more thought , and i call out to her . i really don ' t want to throw our whole relationship away for my relationship with nate - not that we really don ' t have some things to talk about . it ' s not that i need her , either , but i do need her to start talking . ` ` hi , ' ' she says , startling me . i look around and see several people making their way to the main dining table . it has had a ##eon for the whole staff to celebrate the new year . as we walk in , i see that the back door to the kitchen has been pushed open to make room for everyone . pierce and roderick , his business partner , stand at the table , quietly talking with their guests . pierce smiles at me as constance and i make our way over to get our lunch . ` ` roderick , you' ve met my friend brynn , right ? ' ' ` ` well , nice to see you again , brynn , ' ' roderick , a well - dressed man a little older than pierce says , and turns around to shake pierce ' s hand . he leans in . ` ` you look very beautiful tonight , brynn , ' ' he says . ` ` why , thank you , roderick , ' ' i reply , a little taken aback . pierce and i sit at the kitchen table for a while listening to the other conversations , everyone discussing their plans for when they go back to school , and the other students , including me , discussing what we ' ll do when we graduate .
