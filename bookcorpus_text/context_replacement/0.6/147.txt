` ` i do ##n ' t think . . . i mean , maybe he was just a guy , and things got blown out of proportion , you know ? ' ' ` ` i bet that ' s what it is , ' ' allison says , shaking her head slowly . ` ` who knows how stories like that can get around ? and when they ' re out there , you do ##n ' t believe them . ' ' ` ` i bet that ' s what it is . . . i just don ' t want to believe a woman ' s , any woman ' s , story , because that would be hard for me , too , and especially for my mom . she would be so upset if it were true . ' ' ` ` i would wouldn ' t lie about that . and that you said they were just stories , right ? ' ' ` ` right . ' ' ` ` and you said he treated your mom badly , but i think they ' re just just stories . ' ' ` ` yeah , right , ' ' i say , pushing the memory of allison ' s earlier comment to the back of my mind . ` ` how ' s the hotel you ' re staying at in town ? ' ' i ask , and she' i took advantage of a grant from the local university to give the school a low - cost place to stay in an extremely expensive neighborhood . ` ` that ' s great . my mom ' s pretty upset , though . how ' s your new place ? ' ' ` ` it ' s so big ! i just don ' t know why anyone would need that much money . i mean when my mom and i got married , it was built for two people . well , two , except the maid . ' ' ` ` there ' s no maid ? ! ' ' ` ` there is . she probably don ' t live there anymore . oh , and there ' s just this fence around it , and i thought it was stupid , but my mom said that nate had the house built about ten years ago . he must have spent a lot of money to build something so nice and lived - in . ' ' ` ` you ' re kidding , ' ' allison said . ` ` i know . ' ' ` ` how ' s the school ? i just don ' t know if i could deal with a dumb kid . ' ' ` ` no , nate ' s not dumb . i ' ve been in a few classes with him , and he ' s a good. he was even waitlisted for a hotel room . ' ' ` ` you ' re a little afraid of him , ' ' allison says , sipping her coffee . ` ` yeah , i guess so . i really don ' t know , though . he ' s always playing these weird mind games with me . ' ' ` ` mind games ? ' ' she asks , surprised . i push my food around my plate as i think about how much to tell her . i have a feeling it ' s not the kind of thing she ' d like , and i just really want to talk to her about what ' s been going on . ` ` so , you remember that i used to have a crush on him ? ' ' ` ` yeah , i remember you saying something about that other guy . ' ' ` ` well . . . i do have a crush on him . or i think i do . . . i just don ' t know . i ' m very attracted to him , and he ' s aware of the fact . he can be very charming , and then one day , he almost kissed me , and then . . . ' ' ` ` whoa , what ? i mean , brynn , he ' s your boyfriend . ' '` ` i know ! but only for the first few weeks , and - ' ' ` ` but . . . and what if you do that ? what then ? you ' d have to see him every day , because your mom and his dad are there . and besides , if you ' weren ' t living together , what about thanksgiving ? you ' d be eating the thanksgiving dinner and sitting across from the guy you ' d go out with . . . for every day . ' ' ` ` ugh , you ' re right , ' ' i say , shaking my head and covering my face with my hands . this is why i really didn ' t want to tell allison - she ' d see it in the face of my parents . but the truth is , she ' s right . i feel like a bucket of ice water has just been poured over my head . ` ` you ' re right , ' ' i say . ` ` i can ##n ' t believe i even let it get this far . ' ' i go back to the office after work and spend the rest of the day sitting in an awkward silence with allison . i try to get her to talk about us dating , but she only gives me one - word answers . later in the day i have to goand greg , a cute , sandy - blond guy who smiles when i look him in the eye . he seems like the kind of guy i should be able to date . i just wish i had that adrenaline rush that i do whenever i ' m around nate . i arrive home right after school in the black audi that was just parked in the thornhill ' s driveway . it ' s probably the most expensive car i ' ve ever driven , and it ' s hard to even let out the tires on the old part of the car on my way back to school . i park in the driveway and let myself in to the small bathroom off the kitchen , where i kick off my shoes . ` ` mom ? ' ' i call out , finally seeing her standing on the front porch , talking on the phone as the sun sets behind her .
