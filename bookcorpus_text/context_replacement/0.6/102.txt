without emma , he and megan never would have met . sara , which means ' beautiful ' , had taken her mother ' s maiden name , margaret , as her middle name . at the sound of megan ' s sleepy voice , he smiled . ` ` did you grow your hair out yet ? ' ' he asked her . she opened her little eyes . she wished she could talk to him . ` ` let ' s wake her up . ' ' as he brushed a piece of megan ' s long blonde hair out of her face , pesh leaned down to kiss her forehead . she groaned as her eyes fluttered open . ` ` hey , ' ' she said with a sleepy smile . ` ` hey , my love , ' ' he replied . ` ` how was your first day today ? ' ' she asked , as she stretched her arms above her head . he chuckled . ` ` ' great without you and the baby . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` we missed you , too . ' ' she tilted her head up at him . ` ` she cried for five minutes straight after you left . i think we have a little daddy ' s day on our hands . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' he asked , smiling down at her . " could s ' poseand the warm feeling that spread through his body at megan ' s touch . at only two months old , his children were already developing unique and unique personalities . maya was quiet and worked hard to stay awake to see what really was going on . he ' d grown up holding her tighter than sara , because maya always surprised megan by not going to sleep . sara , on the other hand , was also very sweet , and a good snuggler . she much preferred his more laid - back , mature side where she was supposed to be a little girl , just like her mother . she looked up at him , her blue eyes gazing down at him . ` ` did you miss me , my little boy ? ' ' a huge smile formed on her face . ` ` oh my god , she smiled at you ! ' ' megan exclaimed . ` ` she ... ' ' ' i slept with nothing until morning . it must be hormones or something , ' ' he joked . megan nudged his leg with her foot . ` ` she most definitely smiled at you , pesh . ' ' she rose from the bed to kiss maya ' s cheek . ` ` you smiled at your mother , ' ##n ' t you ? ' ' without taking her eyes off of pesh, she flashed a smile and waved her hand . the gesture caused tears to fill his eyes . he blinked rapidly , trying to control them . he ' didn ' t like being called that in front of megan . but he knew he was right the moment megan said , ` ` oh my . ' ' she wrapped her arms around his waist , rising up on her toes to press her face into his neck . ` ` do you know how much my love for you is because you just got upset about your parents ? ' ' he looked up at her in surprise . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' she gave him a soft kiss . ` ` ' adam , all i ever wanted was for my children to have a father who respected and loved them . ' ' she smiled . ` ` you make that dream come true every day . ' ' he pressed his lips to hers . his mind worked furiously to contain all that he was feeling - - the only love that he knew would come from him . ` ` i love you , ' ' he whispered against her lips . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' just as he started to kiss her again , a loud crash from the house broke them apart . megan rubbed his backall while planting a kiss on emma ' s cheek . she then jerked her head towards the house , and aidan followed her . aidan had just walked through the door with all the kids in tow . ` ` we ' re home ! ' ' he exclaimed , as they disappeared around the corner . four - year - old patrick and his two - year - old sister , caroline , made a grab for their parents . they were talking non - stop to emma as their shoulders shook with nervous laughter . pesh watched with amusement as emma ' s hand went to her mouth and she pointed her wooden spoon at them . ` ` you gave them ice cream , ' didn ' t you ? ' ' she accused . ` ` i ' m their mother . feeding them is what i ' m supposed to do . ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` yeah , and then you brought them home to me for my birthday . ' ' ` ` oh , you hungwy ! ' ' emma exclaimed , tapping her foot . with her blonde hair pulled back in waves and her blue eyes narrowed in anger , she looked just like her mother . only , her mother was like aidan . ` ` emma rose , you have an ice cream monster in you, and you are acting like you have no manners . we do not use our manners to get what we want . ' ' she looked thoughtful for a moment before saying , ` ` pwease ##y , ` vewy hungwy . ' ' emma nodded . ` ` go wash up and then have a seat at the table in the living room . ' ' ` ` come on in , ' ' noah said . at about six - and - a - half , he was easily the tallest of his two siblings . emma and i followed him into the living room off the kitchen .
