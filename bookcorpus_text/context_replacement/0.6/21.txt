she grabbed his arm . ` ` stop it , aidan ! it ' s not him , it ' s me . it ' s all my fault . okay ? ' ' he looked at her in confusion . ` ` what happened ? ' ' ` ` give me some time and a minute to calm down , and then i ' ll tell you everything . ' ' although his expression was grim , aidan nodded , and then turned to close the door . megan caught one last glimpse of pesh before his car started off down the street . she hoped for her sake and his safety was the last time she would have to see him . chapter 8 megan anxiously tapped her fingers on the steering wheel of her car . her nursing training had come through , and she was now on her way to make her presentation to her supervisor , the nurse who would train her . although she had initially been disappointed at not seeing grady , she was now thrilled to be making the last leg of the journey to become a nurse . she was also glad she had e ' er taken the day off that most of her fellow nursing students did . she would have never been able to see them if she had to study during the day and work at night . she pulled into the parking lot of the hospital##tar parked and pulled into the first building she saw . after turning off the engine , she grabbed her stack of papers along with her purse and went inside . she stopped at the reception desk . ` ` i ' m not a doctor . i ' m a registered nurse here to see kristi parkman . ' ' ` ` come on in , ' ' the woman said , as she pushed open the main hospital entrance door . walking through the doors of the er , megan could couldn ' t help feeling nervous . she could couldn ' t wait until she got her hair wet before dealing with them . looking around , she still wasn ' t quite sure how she was going to approach the er . she stopped at an office filled with nurses . ` ` can i help you ? ' ' one of them asked . ` ` yes , i ' m here to see kristi parkman . ' ' a tall blonde woman in her fifties walked up to her with a warm smile . ` ` you must be dr . mckenzie ? ' ' ` ` i am . ' ' ` ` it ' s very nice to meet you . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` it ' s nice meeting you , too . ' ' ` ` we ' re all so happy to see you. i ' ve had a look at your work , and it ' s very good . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' megan said . ` ` what don ' ' t i show you around first ? that way you ' ll be able to go with the doctor first . ' ' ` ` oh okay . ' ' with a smile , kristi led her through the maze of hallways . she pointed out where the emergency room was , the waiting room , and where she would find the emergency room . each time they passed a nurse or a doctor , kristi was quick to reassure megan . ` ` everyone seems very nice , ' ' megan said . ` ` it really is a nice place to work . now , i ' m not going to deny that some of the doctors can be real ass * * les . but we ' re very lucky to have a doctor who is such a gentleman . ' ' ` ` that ' s wonderful . ' ' ` ` yes , everyone knows dr . nadeen . ' ' megan ' s thoughts came to a halt . nadeen . no , it could ##n ' t be . surely there were other people with that same name . in her mind , she tried desperately to remember where he said he lived . ` ` yes ,, it ' s just down the hall . let me help you two . ' ' ` ` no , that ' s more ' n ' good enough , ' ' megan protested weakly . ignoring her , kristi said , ` ` dr . nadeen , to see our new cancer patient . ' ' the moment she turned around , megan felt like she was going to throw up . after spending two days trying hard to forget about her past relationship with pesh nadeen , now he was standing in front of her . she could couldn ' t help feeling the opening lines from his speech in her mind , ` ` ' of all the bad joints in all the hospitals , she had to check into yours . ' ' she had felt that way . of the hospitals she could have ever been assigned to , she had to be assigned to his . the shock and disappointment showed on his face as well . he was trying to hide it by looking down at her . ` ` hello again , megan . ' ' kristi ' s eyebrows shot up at the sound of pesh ' s voice . ` ` you know each other ? ' ' ` ` um , yes , ' ' megan stammered . how was she supposed to respond ? the last thing she wanted was to get started on the subjectnot with her coworkers . pesh laughed . ` ` she and i have a date . ' ' ` ` ' how sweet . ' ' kristi patted megan ' s arm . ` ` what happened for you , end up dropping out of all the classes ? ' ' ` ` oh , what luck , ' ' megan said . kristi smiled . ` ` sure , i ' ll let you two catch up for a minute or two . ' ' ` ` no , that ' s okay . you ' don ' t have to do that , ' ' megan said . waving her hand dismissively , kristi said , ` ` he gave me a chance to go grab a sandwich and something to eat .
