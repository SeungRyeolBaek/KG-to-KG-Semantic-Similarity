she hugged the first member of pesh ' s extended family she saw , which just happened to be dev . ` ` can you take these to your mom ? i ' ve got to go to the hospital . ' ' his blue eyes widened as he took the bags from her . ` ` are you okay ? ' ' ` ` i ' m fine . my friend ' s baby was just born . just don ' t let anything happen to that , okay ? ' ' dev nodded . ` ` yeah , we ' ll be doing this soon . the last thing i want is for my parents to be the ones to take the family jewels . ' ' with a wink , he added , ` ` they ' ll be taking my family jewels . ' ' megan laughed and then gave him a hug before running off . when she got back downstairs , aidan and emma ' s car had already turned around . noah began to fuss in pesh ' s arms . ` ` ' where we ' re going ? ' ' pesh asked , before dev could start laughing . ` ` where ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` well , we ' re taking you to your mommy and daddy and your baby sister . ' ' noah ' s eyes lit up at the news ,and he even let them help him into his car seat . following her father ' s directions , they made the trip with quite a number of people . when they got to the house , pesh stood aside to let her in . ` ` i ' ll go ahead and take him home . ' ' ` ` okay . i ' ll meet you guys up there . ' ' when she walked up to the second floor , there was a quite large family waiting for her , including emma ' s best friend , connor . ` ` does casey still feel like coming over ? ' ' megan asked , as she approached him . casey was only a few minutes shy of her very first time with the little girl . connor nodded . ` ` yeah , she ' s doing all right . she ' s been in labor herself . it looks like you and olivia are going to be her best friends after being here almost the entire time . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` that ' s good news . ' ' connor wrinkled his nose . ` ` i think casey will be feeling it a lot more when her pregnancy kicks in . she just wasn ' t very happy the last time i came over to see her . ' ' ` ` oh yeah , i remember that one night .' ' megan ' s phone buzzed , and she quickly read the text . ` ` aidan , we can come back later , ' ' she said to her sister . the girls made their way through the double doors and down the hall . when they reached emma ' s room , angie knocked on the door . after a few seconds , aidan appeared . ` ` hey girls , ' ' he said , with a big smile . ` ` the baby is already with ' em , so give me a minute . ' ' he disappeared back through the door only to return after a few seconds . this time he held a little girl wrapped in a blue blanket . ` ` there she is . ' ` rose rose . ' ' ' applause and cheers went up around the room as aidan held her up for them to see . she ' didn ' t seem either surprised or intimidated by them . she smiled and rolled her eyes . ` ` she ' s just perfect , ' ' megan said . ` ` she ' s something all right , ' ' aidan said . ` ` there she is ! we have a baby , ' ' becky said . aidan narrowed his eyes at his sister . ` ` let me guess . you made some kind of bet earlier about whether she '` what ? ' ' liz patted his arm . ` ` something like that . ' ' pesh looked concerned . the moment noah saw his sister he scrambled to get up . once he had his feet on the ground , he ran to aidan , throwing his arms around aidan ' s neck . ` ` hey noah . you ready to meet your mama ? ' ' bending down , aidan pulled noah to where he could get a good look at her . ` ` what ' s a cow ? ' ' noah asked . aidan nodded . ` ` noah , this is your little sister , caroline . ' ' noah regarded his sister with a puzzled frown , as if he were trying to figure her out . megan could only imagine what was going on in his head at the moment . he ' d spent the last few weeks at the center of his parents ' attention , and now there was something else to get the attention . when caroline screwed up her face and laughed , aidan patted her back . ` ` ' cwy , honey . ' ' ` ` aw , he ' s going to be a good big boy , ' ' angie said . aidan nodded . ` ` yeah , he ' ll be fine until he meets emma . then he ' s going to be able to beher to the hospital . ' ' the girls entered emma ' s room . ` ` you can go in there . ' ' as she looked around the room , she shook her head . ` ` no , all of you can go in . ' ' jumping up on the bed , aidan grabbed noah ' s hand . ` ` come on , noah . mama wants to see you . ' ' megan ' ' ' aidan were calling for aidan . he burst through the door . ` ` mama ! mama ! ' ' he screamed . megan laughed as she watched him jump up on emma ' s bed .
