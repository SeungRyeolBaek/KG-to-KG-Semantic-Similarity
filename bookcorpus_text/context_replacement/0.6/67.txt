but he was already walking such a fine line with her that he just don ' t want to come on too strong and scare her off . ` ` i ' m not sure your mother feels up to it . ' ' megan frowned . ` ` if you ' ' don ' t mind us , we ' d love to help you . ' ' ` ` are you sure ? ' ' ` ` sure . ' ' ` ` okay then . ' ' she took his hand and led him to the door . pesh took in the sparse furnishings of the small apartment . on one side , megan ' s books and papers were scattered everywhere , and on the other it looked like a tornado had swept through the living room with all the books scattered everywhere . when he met her eyes , she smiled . ` ` ' it ' s just a mess . ' ' ` ` it ' s fine . ' ' ` ` are you hungry ? ' ' she asked . ` ` no , i ' m fine , ' ' he said , as his stomach growled . megan shook her head and gave him a look . ` ` sit down and let me fix you something . ' ' ` ` not with you so sick . ' ' ` ` although i wish i could fix you something , i 'i ' m down to get some of the pizza we ordered earlier , and there are some fresh ones i made last night , ' ' she said , as she opened the fridge . ` ` that would be great . ' ' she smiled and pulled out a small plate . ` ` you hungry , mason ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm , ' ' he replied , before glancing up at his mother from one of his books . after pulling out two large plates each , complete with cream cheese , she put them in the microwave . she then motioned for him to take a seat at the table . ` ` you ' ' ' aidan have to wait for me . ' ' ` ` ` shut up and let me take care of you for two days . ' ' her words reminded him of when she had tended his wounds after dev ' s attack . no matter what the circumstances , she was always there to be there for him and take care of him . the microwave chimed and snapped him out of his thoughts . he walked over to the table and sat down beside pesh in his favorite chair . when megan set down the two plates , he reached for her hand and squeezed it . ` ` thank you . ' ' .a moment passed through her eyes before she nodded . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ` ` wo don ' t you come with me ? ' ' she asked . ` ` actually , i would like to take a quick shower . you know , to see if it would help relax my muscles . ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` i ' ll be sure to keep an eye on you while you do that . ' ' ` ` you ' don ' t mind ? ' ' ` ` of course i ' don ' t . ' ' ` ` thanks . i really appreciate it . ' ' she kissed the top of mason ' s head , and then kissed his cheek . she turned to walk into the bedroom before turning back around . he dropped his hand at the look on her face . placing her hands on his shoulders , she leaned forward and planted a soft kiss on him . he could couldn ' t contain his smile . when she pulled back , she laughed at his reaction . ` ` ` wo ##n ' t be late , ' ' she said . when the bedroom door closed behind her , pesh looked down at her . ` ` what do you want to do when we finish dinner ? ' ' ` ` hmm , ' ' she said with alots of food . pesh furrowed his brow in confusion . ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' jumping up from his chair , mason walked over to the couch . when he returned , he had a dvd player in his hand . he pointed to an animated movie on the screen . ` ` minions . ' ' ` ` ah , i see . you want to watch this . ' ' mason shook his head . ` ` is it your favorite ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` uh , huh , ' ' mason answered . ` ` ' i guess we should watch it so we can enjoy ourselves . ' ' seeing mason ' s shy smile , pesh felt a strange pang in his chest . even though he should shouldn ' t , he still had strong feelings for the other guy . from almost the moment they ' d met , he had welcomed pesh into his heart . the sound of a fork scraping on a plate startled pesh out of his thoughts . ` ` hey ! ' ' he shouted , jumping out of his chair . although pesh was ne ' er ##ed , mason grabbed his arm and pulled him from the room . instead of arguing with him , pesh just let himself be led over to the television . as he watched the screentogether , they sat down on the couch . aidan could don ' t help the warmth that spread through his body when megan came up to his side . instead , he just embraced the man and let him replace the pain that was inside his head . under the soothing , warm stream of the jacuzzi water , megan ' s tension began to ease . of course , as much as she wanted to relax , it was really nice knowing that pesh was in her living room . she could can ' t believe that he had shown up out of the blue to check on her . just when she thought she could ##n ' t feel any happier or more relieved , he did something like that .
