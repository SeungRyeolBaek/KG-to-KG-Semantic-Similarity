i pause for a moment , taking in the rest of the room for the first time , before walking over to my desk and opening the top drawer . i reach my hand all the way to the drawer and pull out the small slip of paper i have there . i walk out and down the hall . nate ' s bedroom door is wide open and i can tell from the light that he ' s not asleep . i push it open all the way and walk to his bed . i run my hand over his pillow and breathe in his scent . i pull back the sheet and place the slip of paper on top of his pillow , then pull the sheet back down over it . i really just don ' t want him to find the slip of paper where eileen left her phone number . i ' m about to leave when something makes me look over to his balcony overlooking the river . my eye catches on a flash of movement on the lower deck : nate standing on the bottom step of the steps leading down to the opposite shore . he is standing there , his white t - shirt stretched across his bare chest . i resist the urge to ask what he ' ll do now - it ' s really none of my business anyway . i hurry back over to the river andwith my mom sitting in the passenger seat . i open the driver ' s door and see that she ' s placed the bag on the seat . i get in without a word and turn the engine on and pull away from the curb . i glance in the rearview mirror to get one last glimpse of her before i back the car out of the driveway . my mom is silent on our way back to our old house , just staring out the window . we get on the road that takes us farther away from the house , closer to our much more populated neighborhood . the seed of doubt that ' s been growing inside of me all day , or maybe ever , finally takes root . i glance over at her sad face . ` ` you have t ' t ' looked at me all night , ' ' i finally say , gripping the steering wheel with white - tipped fingers . ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' she asks me , still not speaking to me . ` ` you have t ' ' looked at my face , ' ' i say . ` ` brynn . . . ' ' she pauses . ` ` well , it ' s true . your dad called you last night and you never even bothered to check on me . and now you wo . '` look at the pictures . ' ' ` ` brynn , i ' ve been so worried . ' ' ` ` and you # n ' t ? he beats me up , hurts me , and you have ##n ' t asked me if i ' m okay . ' ' ` ` it ' s not my fault that he did those things ! ' ' she says , suddenly angry . ` ` look , i ' m not blaming you for his death , okay ? but you ' re my mother . you should have told me - you should have taken care of me . i ' ve been taking care of you for years , and this time , i need you . ' ' my mother nods slowly , reaching up to cover her mouth with her hand . ` ` i wanted to tell you , brynn , i really did , ' ' she finally says . ` ` i just knew that if i did , everything would fall apart , and it all seemed so real . ' ' ` ` but it really wasn ' t . ' ' ` ` no , it was wasn ' t . ' ' i feel her hand reach up , to touch my cheek , and her fingers brush against the small cut at the corner of my eye . ` ` oh , i ' m so sorry ,my dad . does that bother you ? ' ' ` ` not at all , ' ' i reply , fighting the tears that have sprung up at her words . ` ` i never knew . . . about you and nate , i mean , ' ' she says . ` ` that ' s sad , mom , ' ' i reply , as my emotions threaten to choke me . ` ` ah , ' ' is all she says . ` ` well , i know that might not be the kind of thing you would want to talk about with your dad , but i ' m curious . you talk to him a lot ? ' ' ` ` sometimes , ' ' i reply , my voice thick with suppressed emotion . ` ` ' i guess you want to get a job ? ' ' i ask , changing the subject . ` ` oh , yeah . i guess so , ' ' she says . ` ` i think i ' ll be able to get my old job at the hospital back , at least . i talked to anita and she said the new assistant they hired was good . ' ' ` ` did you get a pre - nup ? ' ' i ask , thinking of eileen . i guess i ' ll have to fill my mother in on what i know about hergood , because it would probably be too much for her right now . ` ` yes , ' ' she answers . ` ` he - man . ' ' chapter twenty - two i close the door behind me and set my newly - packed suitcase on my bed ##roll , then sit up to find my favorite chair . it ' s not much to look at , with its sparse furnishings and lack of bathroom facilities , but it does have a framed photo of every student that ' s lived there , dating back to uva ' s very first year .
