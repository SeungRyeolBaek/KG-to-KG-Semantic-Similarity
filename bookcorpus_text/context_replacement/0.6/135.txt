i recognize him from the basketball team . not that i ' ve seen their # ##s or anything . . . ` ` ha , ha , ha , ' ' cara replies , rolling her eyes , but something about the look in her eyes tells me she knows the answer . ` ` can i get you two a drink ? ' ' foster asks , gesturing to the table behind him . ` ` yes , please , ' ' cara replies . ` ` hey , foster , this is my best friend brynn . this is her sixteenth birthday party . treat her nice . ' ' ` ` i ' m always nice ! ' ' he says proudly , then stops in front of me and extends his hand . ` ` ' ' lady , ' ' he says , and i put my hand in his and bring it to his lips . marie and rachel nod and then head off to another table while he hands them their drinks . cara and i follow him over to an old , mostly empty , table in the corner . we weave around the black clad co - workers , and for the first time in my life , i feel like one of the rich kids . i sit down on the # ##thest , and cara sits next to me , with rachel on her other side . iwhile sipping my beer , foster whispers in her ear . i ' ve drunk beer before , even gotten drunk a few times with allison and miriam when we just turned twenty - one and checked out the wine tasting . i just want to make sure i ' don ' t drink ' , and end up like that guy we met on the way here . ` ` where ' s nate now ? ' ' my head snaps up when i hear cara ask foster the question . my heart stops for a second . i have to admit i ' ll be disappointed if he ' s not in here . ` ` he ' s wandering around , probably getting lost with a bunch of people , ' ' foster rolls his eyes , and cara laughs . i drink half my beer . i can n ' t help how uncomfortable it makes me feel , i ' ve never even met the guy . cara and foster continue talking , and although cara makes an effort to encourage me , i ' m still too uncomfortable to contribute anything to the conversation . by the time i finish my beer , i really need to pee . ` ` be right back , ' ' i say to cara , and go straight for the stairs . i push through the sweaty crowd to a stop at the bottom . i find a smallof the kitchen . of what i think is the kitchen , and with a sigh , i go into the front room . the door opens and a guy jumps in front of the startled girl . ` ` hey ! ' ' she yells . ` ` emergency ! ! ! ' ' he yells , and slams the door behind him . i step back a little and look up the stairs . there are some girls hanging out on the landing , but it ' s still dark up here , and i ' m guessing there ' s more than one bathroom in this house . with my lips pressed together , i turn around and walk up the stairs . i pass the first two rooms with open doors and head to a few closed ones . i can see a room at the end of the hall that looks like a gym , with a pool table in the center of the room . one of these other rooms must be the bathroom . i walk toward the other door and press my ear against it . i still don ' t hear anything . i knock again and wait for a second , and when i ' don ' t hear anything , i slowly turn the knob and unlock the door . i gasp when it ' s pulled back and out of my reach . my eyes fly open and then i see that natenate asks behind me . ` ` i . . . i . . . ' ' i whisper . his eyes widen and he looks at me with confusion . i let my eyes travel down his body . he ' s naked except for a pair of navy blue boxers . good lord , his body is perfect . the skin next to his six - pack looks like it was carved in stone . it ' s suddenly very hard to breathe . ` ` see anything you like ? ' ' he asks softly . i tilt my head back slightly . a dark lock of hair hangs down under one of his eyes . i clear my throat as i try to think of something to say . i watch his eyes travel down my body , my insides melting under his gaze . heat begins to rise in my cheeks . ` ` um , no , i just - ' ' ` ` you were ##a with me ? ' ' he asks , pushing the door open a little wider . i look over his shoulder and see a little girl in bed covered in white sheets . ` ` nate ! ' ' the girl says with a giggle , and pulls the sheet up over her head . ` ` come on . if you ' hadn ' t been here , i ' d think you were .' with your boyfriend , ' ' luke says next to me . i feel my cheeks turn red . ` ` gee , thanks , ' ' i reply , rolling my eyes and walking down the hallway to the kitchen . i hear the guys burst into laughter behind me . i run back out of the front door and down the porch steps , pausing on the landing to process what ' s just happened .
