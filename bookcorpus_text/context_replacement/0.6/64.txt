i ' ll be back in just a minute . ' ' after pesh nodded and slid into the passenger seat , megan hurried to get her pants on . once she had them on and dry , she smoothed down her hair that managed to look like she had just been f * * ked against the leather seat . she slid into the passenger seat to see that pesh had opened the driver ' s door and was talking to trace . trace ' s eyes left pesh ' s and returned to hers . it took only a few seconds for him to put two and two together of what had just been going on . he then started walking away from the car . ` ` okay , well , you two have a good night then , ' ' he said . ` ` same to you , ' ' megan replied , trying not to start laughing again . pesh shook his head as he stepped back out of the car . ` ` come on . let ' s go before we get in any more trouble . ' ' ` ` ` getting in trouble is too much trouble , ' ' megan said , as she opened her door . he grinned at her as he walked around to face her . ` ` you , my dear , are a very good liar . ' ' he folded his armsgrabbing her hand , pulling her closer to him . ` ` ` i ' m grateful for every moment i have with you . ' ' ` ` mmm , you know exactly how to kiss a girl , ' ' she murmured , still kissing him . after a few more kisses , pesh pulled away . ` ` if this place has hidden cameras , let ' s not exactly give them all our attention ##s . ' ' megan gasped and covered her mouth . ` ` did they . . . did they . . . ? ' ' ` ` not in the least . ' ' she sighed with relief . ` ` thank you . ' ' he grinned . ` ` come on , little one . let ' s go get something to eat . ' ' ` ` sounds good to me . ' ' with a wink , she added , ` ` see if there ' s food ! ' ' chapter twelve a few days after her dance lesson and her entrance into the mile high club , megan had decided to take a few minutes to the hospital when she was grabbed by the nurse and dragged into the emergency room . ` ` what the ? ' ' she asked , but the door suddenly opened behind her . instead of pesh behind her , it was kristi . ` ` i need tohave a seat with you . ' ' panic rose in megan ' s throat , and she had to take a few deep breaths before she could speak . ` ` have i done something wrong with my patient ? ' ' kristi shook her head . ` ` ` no , this has everything to do with dr . nadeen . ' ' megan ' s eyebrows shot up in surprise . ` ` pesh ? what ' s wrong with him ? ' ' ` ` it ' s not what is wrong with him . it ' s what is wrong with you . ' ' megan frowned . ` ` what ? ' ' kristi laughed . ` ` i do like you , megan , but i am afraid that you are just like him . this is wrong . he just don ' t like you . ' ' ` ` i do don ' t know what you mean . ' ' ` ` i just don ' t play games . not only do i have two friends about your age , but i ' ve spent enough time dealing with them to have a pretty good insight into the male psyche . so , i ' ll ask you again , what are you doing ? ' ' megan stiffened under the weight of kristi ' s words . if anyone found out that she and kris##sh ##t ' up , this could be very important for her future career . ` ` we ' re family . he ' s my son ' s father . ' ' kristi rolled her eyes . ` ` fine . let me speak as loud as i can since you insist on coming along . i really don ' t give two shit if you and pesh are bleeding all over this place - ' ' megan was unable to contain her own laughter . ` ` excuse me , but i - ' ' ' it was kristi ' s turn to laugh . she held up her hand . ` ` let me handle this . ' ' ` ` fine , ' ' megan snapped . ` ` i know that deep down he ' s just a man , and after going a long time without sex , it is just a little difficult for him to give in to having a real relationship with you . but i ' ve been by his side for ten years , and i have a pretty good handle on what he ' s really feeling . ' ' ` ` ' really ? ' ' megan asked , unable to stop herself from being snarky . ` ` yes , i do . that man loves you with every fiber of his being . ' ' those words pierced megan ' s stubborn ##nessto him . she could couldn ' t help rising a little to her feet . she knew that pesh loved her - i mean , any woman could see that . but why ? ` ` he - he does ? ' ' ` ` ` yes , he does . he ' s been carrying a torch for you since the moment you walked in here . i felt it the first time i saw you here . ' ' don ' t know what has changed since that day , but i know something has changed for you , emma . ' ' ` ` it ' s just that i care about him . he ' s the most wonderful man i ' ve ever met . ' '
