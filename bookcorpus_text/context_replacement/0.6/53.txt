` ` ' good , ma ' am , ' ' the waiter said . ` ` i ' ll have the same , ' ' pesh said , handing the waiter his wine . when megan looked at him , his brows rose . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` i ' m not surprised to hear you like something as simple as steak and chicken . ' ' he winked at her . ` ` when did you learn that you can always trust me on one side or the other ? ' ' she laughed . ` ` well , i think that you ' re proving me wrong and the opposite . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` ' i feel like people want to do the same thing to me . they make their own assumptions about women and guys who get knocked up . i guess i can prove them wrong . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure you can . ' ' after taking a sip of his wine , he cocked his head at her . ` ` prove me wrong on this one . does ' # ##er ? you like southern food ? ' ' ` ` ' yeah , i love it . ' ' his blue eyes lit up . ` ` what ' s your favorite food ? ' ' ` ` hmm , i love it ., but i ' m not a fan of pav bahaji . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . emma has never had any real food , and i really don ' t think i made a good impression on her . ' ' pesh ' s laughter died away , and he visibly relaxed at the mention of emma ' s name . sensing that they were circling around the giant elephant in the room , megan reached across the table and took his hand . ` ` it ' s obvious that you ' re talking about emma . ' ' ` ` talking of your friends or women you ' ve met while you ' re with another woman is not a good idea . ' ' ` ` this is different . emma is my friend . ' ' she swirled the wine around in her glass . ` ` i ' ve heard her side of the story , but i really don ' t think i ' ve heard yours . ' ' ` ` you said very little when you were there the night of noah ' s ark . ' ' ' it was megan ' s turn to frown . ` ` i really would like to know . ' ' pesh drew in a deep breath . when the waitress arrived with their drinks , it appeared that they would avoid the subject entirely . instead hethey were laughing together , he said . ` ` emma came along at a time when i was under great pressure from family and friends to move on from my past and find someone . there was no point to it - i knew that at the time , as well as when i was in college . emma seemed to think that about a month went by on the road that meant i was happy with my life . then one night , while she was in the hospital . she was scared out of her mind by your mother . so i just stayed with her through her grief and pain . ' ' he wiped his mouth with his napkin . ` ` she reminded me so much of you that it was hard to try to pretend that what i was feeling for her was real . we just haven ' t been together in so long that i wanted to hurt her , just like i did to you . ' ' ` ` and aidan got to you ? ' ' ` ` in a way , both emma and i did . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` let ' s just say , during our most special time together , she was with aidan , and i was with jade . ' ' megan was surprised by his words . ` ` ' '. ' ' there was one thing about the pesh and emma relationship she had always wondered about . ` ` you ' ##n ' ' ' that she was dead ? ' ' shaking his head , pesh said , ` ` it just made her even more attractive to me . she ' d been through so much already that i thought i was attracted to her because she had life living inside her . ' ' ` ` that ' s so sweet , ' ' megan said . he gave her a sad smile . ` ` one of my favorite character traits is having a hero trait . i think that ' s one of the reasons i became a hero . i loved emma , and i tried to save her . when she needed to go home to california , i volunteered to be her knight in shining armor . ' ' ` ` being a hero is not always a bad character trait . ' ' ` ` it is when you ' don ' t love ' , and you have to go live with the consequences . ' ' megan ' s heart ached at the pain on his face . knowing she needed to break the mood , she said , ` ` i ' m sorry to hear you still have a bad character trait . i mean , you were a little too nice to me . '' a hint of a smile played on his lips . ` ` did i mention i ' m a good cook ? ' ' ` ` you ? yes , ' ' she said . ` ` oh my . if i ' didn ' t have a body , i ' m pretty sure i would end up on america ' s worst list . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i find that hard to believe . ' ' ` ` it ' s the truth . i actually have no physical attributes whatsoever . ' ' after chewing thoughtfully on her piece of bread , megan said , ` ` but you ' re built like a football player . ' '
