i ' ve heard that some things in life do ##n ' t live up to how i ' ve made them up in my head , but that has far surpassed any other . i can feel my body trembling at just the thought of his lips on mine again . but is he right ? is it wrong of me to think that ? steam is creeping up the front of my face by the time i manage to fall asleep , and i still have don ' t time to form an answer . chapter twelve nate and i spend the next few days as if we ' re being held by an invisible force field . whenever one of us enters a room , the other is thrown out of it . we ' re only allowed into close quarters with each other when we have a family dinner , and my mom has been breaking those between us more often in an effort to bond . if she only knew . tonight , however , nate ' s and my presence is required for the same thing : the thornhill ' s annual fourth of july party . it ' s in our very own backyard , starting in the morning with a crab dinner and continuing into the evening festivities . tonight we ' ll have a good view of the country club ' s annual fireworks display from across the street . my mom has always guaranteed thatbought me a white dress for the party , and she went into the dressing room with me to make sure i was right . the white dress is not really my style , but i ' ve worn it on plenty of occasions at home . i ' m not worried about the tomato stain on the soft white fabric . i put on my favorite pair of high heels , and head downstairs to see if my mom needs any help . i ' m taken aback by the amount of people here . when i step inside , i realize i ' ve exaggerated the size of this party . when i heard ` ` wedding cakes , ' ' i was expecting a few small tables with red and white candles , but this is definitely a large party . there are large round tables everywhere , with white chairs and colorful cushions on top of them . the food is served in large bowls , and candles light the tables . i hear my mom talking in low , hushed tones to one of the servers , and walk over . ` ` oh , brynn , you look beautiful ! that dress suits you so well , ' ' she says . ` ` so . . . do you need any help ? ' ' ` ` mmm , yes .i think we ' re ready . the guests should be arriving in about ten minutes . oh , and grab the freedom martini over by the bar and tell me what you think . i ' m afraid it ' s a little too hot . ' ' ` ` the freedom martini ? ' ' ` ` the special drink we make for this party , ' ' the girl next to her cuts in with a wide smile . ` ` ah , of course , ' ' i reply , heading for the bar . the bartender hands me a dark amber drink and i take a sip . ' not bad - it ' s sweet , cool and refreshing . ' the party really wasn ' t too bad , though . the weather has managed to stay above ninety degrees for the party . i decide to go down to the pool since i ' ll probably be all the way where they ' re lined up . i walk down to the back deck and cross the river . when i reach the water , i hit the soft surface hard with my feet . a movement on the other side of the swimming pool catches my attention . i walk toward it and look down . nate ' s standing there , moving around with a surprisingly fluid grace . i pause , studying his body , and realize it ' s histo just get back up to the house before he sees me . he ' s made it clear he ' s ' not want to talk to me . i turn , and as i do my foot catches on a rock . i gasp as i fall down , and feel his strong hands catch me under my arms to keep me steady . ` ` whoa , baby , ' ' he says as he pulls me up . ` ` thanks , ' ' i say as i turn to him and tuck my hair back behind my ear . ` ` you come from the circus , right ? ' ' ` ` no . i just don ' t really like these events . ' ' ` ` really ? you ' re not . . . ' ' i trail off . ` ` what ? ' ' he asks with a grin . i shrug . ` ` sorry . i was going to say ' whatever , ' okay ? ' ' ` ` i get it , ' ' he says calmly . ` ` well , any fear you might be feeling has been developed over the years of traveling . my father has been taking me to these types of events for years . i know the routine . smile , shake hands , tell the kind of jokes that don ##n ' t make anyone laugh too hard . ' '` ` yeah . . . boring . but at least there ' s a lot of free time . ' ' he gives me a sideways glance . ` ` yeah . and i think i ' d ' you have to worry about that , anymore . ' ' ` ` you were , um , pretty well - off before our marriage - ' ' he narrows his gaze . ` ` i ' d say we were poor . but that was just the way i grew up .
