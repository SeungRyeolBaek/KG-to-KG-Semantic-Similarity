he licked his lips and took a step toward her . ` ` ' a place where you could live your life with me in it ? ' ' megan stared at him , her expression uncertain . for a brief moment , pesh thought from her expression that she had changed her mind about him . but then she shook her head . ` ` how many times are you going to let me hurt you with this ? you ' re too young for me , pesh . we both know that . i ' ll remind you now of all of the reasons i ' m not the man for you . i ' m twenty - one , and you ' re twenty - two . you need a man , and i ' m not ready to be one . ' ' her words cut into his heart the same way if she had taken a razor blade to him . she would have tried to defend herself this time , but he knew the truth of her words . and then an idea hit him so hard that he smiled - a combined moment of moment and joy . there was only one way he was going to get to know his beautiful megan , and that was if he gave himself to her . he would have to find someone else for her , even if it was just fora little more . he could provide her with everything that she both wanted and needed , but at the same time , he would make her fall in love with him . it could work . it had to . shaking his head at her , he said , ` ` ' let me get this straight once and for all . you would let me . . . ' ' he paused , losing the battle within himself to say what he had to . he drew in a deep breath . ` ` you would let me f * * k you and ... love you ? ' ' her eyes widened at his word choice . ` ` what ' s gotten into you ? ' ' he shrugged again , looking slightly uncomfortable in the dr . jekyll and mr . hyde way . ` ` i just asked a simple question . ' ' she sighed exasperatedly . ` ` yes , but . . . ' ' she swallowed hard . ` ` love , of all things . ' ' ` ` no . ' ' megan shook her head slowly back and forth . ` ` i can hardly believe that you say the words , least of all you say that . ' ' ` ` you ' can ' t say that - ' ' she held up her hand . ` ` you ' re not the oneof wanting to f * * k , ' ' she said . crossing his arms over his chest , he said , ` ` ` me ? i ' m that much of a man ? ' ' ` ` something like that . ' ' ` ` i am a man , megan . we all have needs . is it ' you f * * king all of them ? ' ' her voice shook violently at his words . she licked her lips before saying , ` ` no - i - that i - it - isn ' t you . ' ' ` ` so , f * * king you isn ' t it ? then you ' ll tell me you think i ' m an idiot - that you ' don ' t want me f * * king another woman . . . just you . ' ' he stepped even closer to her . ` ` we both know for a fact that you wanted nothing more than to f * * k me the night of tony ' s funeral . under the circumstances right now , you ' d let me take off your clothes and f * * k you up against the medicine cabinet . ' ' as her chest heaved up and down , she took a step away from him , leaning against the wall . ` ` but you said don ' tkeep it at that . you ' re right . you ' re a gentleman , ' ' she whispered . ` ` it may have been a mistake , but even a gentleman like you likes f * * king . ' ' he closed the distance between them . ` ` what are you doing ? ' ' she asked . ` ` i ' m giving you what you want . ' ' ` ` you ' re giving me ? ' ' ` ` sure , why not ? ' ' as he lowered his head , his lips hovered over hers . ` ` if you really want me to kiss you , then kiss me . ' ' without a moment ' s hesitation , megan pressed her lips against his . the kiss was desperate and desperately seeking release . as his tongue swept into her mouth , his hand moved to her breast . gently , he cupped the breast , letting the nipple brush his palm . disappointed with the lack of contact , he pulled his hand away and slipped it under megan ' s shirt . beneath her bra , he cupped her breast again , feeling her nipple harden beneath his palm . he felt his desire grow at the sound of her voice . he wanted nothing more than to strip off all her clothes and explore every inch of her body . megan ' s body .one of his , and she looked up at him with wide eyes . ` ` what about someone seeing us ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll lock the door , ' ' she said . reluctantly , he pulled away from her to walk her over to the door . before he turned the lock , he made sure to place his card in front of her as well . they would have some privacy if anyone decided to try to use their card to get in . with his hands on her hips , he pushed her toward one of the floor - to - ceiling windows , placing them even further from any suspicious eyes . ` ` ' where are we ? ' ' he asked , with a smile . she laughed and wrapped her arms around his neck .
