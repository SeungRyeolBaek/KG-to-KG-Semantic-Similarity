` ` ` get ready to be on your toes again . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` okay , sounds good . ' ' as they began making their way through patients , it started to get into dangerous territory for megan . kristi seemed to be thinking the same thing since the tops of her breasts had a sheen of sweat glistening on them . the moment they finished with each patient and left the room , that patient was able to leave first . megan stood behind kristi as she tried to get her head in to the waiting room . ` ` hey janet , could you please call anyone else in ? we ' re so busy . ' ' janet shook her head . ` ` it ' s just so crowded here in the waiting room . and we ' re all busy . ' ' kristi rolled her eyes . ` ` sorry . it ' s almost the full moon , which makes it almost impossible . ' ' she turned back to megan . ` ` well , since we ' re so busy , can you take the patient to room 101 ? ' ' megan could couldn ' t stop her eyes from rolling . ` ` me ? on my toes ? ' ' kristi laughed , grabbing megan ' s arm . ` ` '' ve seen you in person the whole time . i have faith in you . ' ' ` ` well , if you ' re sure . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' megan could couldn ' t contain her smile . ` ` thank you . ' ' grabbing her ipad , she scanned through the brief form of the doctor before her . when she pushed open the door , she saw the man on the exam table . ` ` good morning mr . stone , i ' m megan . what - ' ' before she could even get to the question ` ` what seems to be the matter ? ' ' immediately , the doctor began shaking his head frantically . ` ` no , sir . i wo ##n ' t ' you stop me . i need a doctor . a male doctor . you understand ? ' ' ` ` yes , i understand , but you have to follow orders , which is to address your issues before the doctor comes in . you see on the monitor that you ' re experiencing some minor issues ? ' ' he refused to meet her eyes . instead , he looked up at the doctor , holding up a hand to her . ` ` i meant what i said . i want to see a male doctor . ' ' ` ` okay , then we ' re' high temperature this morning . i ' m not sure how long it will be before you are able to see a doctor , least of all a male doctor . ' ' when it seemed the man ' s resolve was weakening a little , megan took a tentative step forward . ` ` now , if you would please let me take a look at your abdomen . ' ' ` ` it is ? ' ' my abdomen , ' ' he said . ` ` then what is it ? ' ' when he refused . ' ' answer , she sighed with relief . ` ` mr . stone , you should never have any pain . it can result from health issues and have serious consequences . ' ' he shifted uncomfortably on the bed . just when she thought she was making progress with him , he threw his head back and began screaming at the top of his lungs . ` ` get me a male doctor ! ' ' megan rolled her eyes . the last time she had the opportunity to see a doctor on her own , and it happened to be a stark ##y one . deciding to lay into him and admit defeat , she walked over to him . she was going to break his stubborn attitude if it was the last thing she did . ` ` stop screaming , and i ' ll" no , ' ' she said , ripping the condom off him . his voice trailed off to a whisper as he reached for the phone , but the damage was done . she had done more than enough . ` ` oh . my . god , ' ' she said . she stared wide - eyed and open - mouthed at what appeared to be the only medical device to go along with the warning labels on condoms and pills for modern - day women . ` ` that ' s going to have to be done . ' ' ` ` excuse me ? ' ' he asked . she shook her head at him . ` ` the excess fluid in your penis ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` it ' s not just going to go off on its own . it has to be done , which means bleeding out . ' ' dr . white swallowed hard . ` ` ' with a needle ? ' ' ` ` yes , with a very small needle . ' ' when he started to protest , she held her hand up . ` ` unfortunately for you , i will not perform the procedure - it has to be done - by a doctor . ' ' ` ` a doctor ? ' ' ` ` if it leads to your penis exploding from the tube while waiting for' ' emma , would you really be that stupid ? ' ' his blue eyes widened in surprise . ` ` yes , i think so . i ' ll be back . ' ' when she walked out of the room , she ran smack into the last person she wanted to have to deal with at the moment . ` ` i ' m so sorry . are you all right ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' he smiled down at her . ` ` doing your job well on your own ? that ' s wonderful . ' ' ` ` um , well , yes and no . ' ' his brow furrowed in confusion .
