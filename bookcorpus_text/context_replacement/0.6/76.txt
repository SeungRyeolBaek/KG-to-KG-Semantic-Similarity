` ` yes , i think i can do that . ' ' tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously . ` ` ' do you think i would have to be at my house for that ? ' ' ` ` ' wo won ' t just be my sister and her husband . all of my family will be there , including my parents . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` you want to introduce me to your family ? ' ' ` ` yes , i would . ' ' she chewed on her lower lip as she was known to do when she was nervous . ` ` ' that would mean we ' re very close , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' he said , with absolute confidence . moving to the edge of the bed , she adjusted her silk robe as best she could . she looked up at him . ` ` you ' re not the least bit worried what they ' re going to think about you and me ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m not . ' ' the corners of her mouth turned up in a smile . ` ` ' i ' ll go , ' ' she said softly . ` ` okay ? ' ' when she shook her head , he walked over to take her in his arms . ` ` 'you , my love . you ' ve made me so happy . ' ' ` ` you make me happy every day . it ' s the least i can do . ' ' with her face buried in pesh ' s chest , she was finally able to make the smile she had plastered on turn into a frown . while she should have been happy that pesh wanted to introduce her to his family , she could couldn ' t help feeling worried . what if they hated her ? what if their hatred caused pesh to never want to see her again ? she didn ##n ' t want to think about what it would be like not having him in her life . at the same time , it was hard considering all the emotions that pesh ' s family made her feel . he had never bothered to introduce her to his family . she met them by chance during one of his visits . now she had a husband who wanted nothing more than to share all aspects of his life with her . it was hard to wait . in the end , she could only hope that everything went well . chapter 8 the next morning at dawn when pesh noticed the gap in line , he walked into the nurses ' station . while he said hello to some of the other men and some of the hospital staff, he found a new way of talking to megan . when he found her at the desk where she was doing paperwork , she looked like someone had tasered her . ` ` go away , ' ' megan said . he chuckled . ` ` you know , i think i can be polite standing here at the nurses ' station without raising any suspicion . after all , i could be sharing a room with you . ' ' ` ` ` you should start thinking about dress code very soon . ' ' ` ` i wanted to know if it would be all right to pick you up at seven on friday night ? ' ' when megan lifted her head from the paperwork she was working on , her blue eyes widened in surprise at him . in a low voice , she said , ` ` i do not believe you were thinking about our date tonight at seven . do you know anything about my dress ? ' ' he held his hands up helplessly . ` ` i ' m sorry . i really don ' t know what i was thinking about the fact that i saw you and wanted to talk to you . ' ' megan ' s face softened . ` ` i ' m sorry , but we can ##uld ' t talk that way anymore . ' ' pesh opened his mouth to speak when shesomeone behind them cut him off . ` ` ` ' ' mind you , get out , ' ' kara said . pesh turned around to see kara staring at them with tears burning in her eyes . ` ` excuse me , but i need to get this patient off the floor , ' ' megan said , with her chin dropped to her chest . she turned to leave , but kara reached out and grabbed her arm . ` ` if you do ##n ' ' kara , ' room two needs a clean - up . ' ' ` ` kristi is the only one allowed to give the orders around here , ' ' megan snapped . kara pursed her bright red lips . ` ` drinking and sleeping with a patient - you both have a serious death wish , # ##n ' mind you ? ' ' megan turned to leave , but pesh stopped her . looking at kara , he said , ` ` i need to talk to you . alone . ' ' after giving megan a dirty look , kara let pesh lead her out of the nurses ' station and down the hallway . ` ` what in the hell do you think you ' re doing ? ' ' kara demanded . ` ` stopping you from making a huge mistake . you ' can ' t trust a woman like that - youfind a man to take care of you . ' ' when her hands started to move up to his shoulders , pesh stopped them . ` ` ` don ' t touch me ! ' ' he warned . a slow smile spread across her face . ` ` you did when i kissed you earlier . ' ' ` ` that was one mistake - a stupid mistake that i make often , and i never plan on doing again . ' ' she narrowed her eyes at him . ` ` ' you ' re pushing me away for a beautiful woman ? ' '
