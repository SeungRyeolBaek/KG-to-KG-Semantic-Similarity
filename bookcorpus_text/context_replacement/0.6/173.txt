i grab the cold bottle of water from by my bed and take a long drink . ` ` drink ? ' ' i ask nate , turning to hand it to him . he takes it , brushing my hand with his as he wraps his warm fingers around mine . my fingers glow . . . more of a glow . i see a house very much like ours perched on a hill in the distance . ` ` where ' d you live in the past then ? ' ' ` ` townhouse in georgetown . ' ' he laughs . ` ` it was more of a mansion . had many rooms . ' ' ` ` the house just ain ' t your thing ? ' ' ` ` it was too big for wealthy people , and it still looks grand , even for me . but what i really ' don ' t like is that it ' s got all these weird architectural elements to it , and none of them are good . ' ' ` ` belongs to a history professor . ' ' ` ` yeah . i always pictured myself in a small house , like a small church or something . . . but that was never built in the time period it looks like it was built in . or even older than georgetown . . . it ' s so quiet . . .. i want my kids to grow up more quickly than you do . ' ' ` ` you want kids ? ' ' i ask , confused . ` ` you ' ' ' what ? ' ' ` ` no , i just . . . i ' m just curious . you said that having kids would mean being in a relationship with a man for longer than you ' re supposed to . ' ' he laughs . ` ` i ' ' ' ' never thought of that . i always just found myself with someone . is that it ? ' ' ` ` yes ! ' ' i reply , before reaching out and launching myself up at him . ` ` hey ! ' ' he says , and grabs the side of the boat , beginning to rock it back and forth . ` ` you ' ll tip this thing over , ' ' he says , with a laugh . ` ` nate ! ' ' i say , shoving him . he laughs , and stops me for a second . ` ` i think your dad had the best day of the year , ' ' he says . ` ` want to go back ? ' ' i ask , hoping he ' ll say something . he nods . ` ` maybe we should . ' ' i smile , slightly embarrassed , andusing my weight on the boat to help him steady the boat . now that we ' re moving with the current , it takes us much less time to make the short walk back to the boat house . ` ` how ' s your leg ? ' ' i ask . ` ` it ' s better , actually , ' ' he says quietly , ` ` thanks for asking . ' ' i feel a lump in my throat as we head into the open water . nate steps onto the dock first , and offers me his hand to help me climb out of the small boat . ` ` ' better than the water , ' ' he says , pointing to the narrow trail that runs through the woods behind the boat house . i look at him curiously . ` ` we walk before we go swimming ? ' ' i nod and smile , trying not to look too happy . chapter twelve ` ` you ' ve got some patience for someone who ' doesn ' t use it , ' ' nate comments as our ` ` long hike ' ' slips into its second day . ` ` i ' ve been swimming in the water more often , but that ' s all , ' ' i reply , but honestly i think it ' s that the day just hasn ' t ended .we ' re just past the mississippi river , on a dirt trail that winds around large trees . nate is right - it is cooler under the trees , but it ' s still just as hot . ` ` is that bad ? ' ' i ask , pointing to a green - tinged plant at the base of the tree . after telling nate that he used to grow poison ivy every other year , he ' s made it his mission to show me how to identify the disease - and the symptoms . ` ` not bad anymore . by this time of the year , it ' ll be all yellow and green - tinged . and the edges of the leaves are more yellow , ' ' he says as he leans over to look at it . a group of other girls joins us on the trail , from the opposite direction . i watch them take in nate ' s shirtless , sweaty body and whisper to each other . as they approach , they smile up at him , and he just barely smiles back before turning to me . ` ` you ' re good at so many things , including catching infectious diseases . . . ' ' he says in a mock - serious tone as he shakes his head . ` ` hey , if that ' s my job , i ' ll beintimacy , ' ' i reply with a grin . ` ` yep , my ivy , that ' s your kryptonite , ' ' he informs me . ` ` what ' s yours ? intimacy ? ' ' ` ` intimacy ? how dare you ! that ' s commitment . complete commitment . ' ' ` ` well , duh , of course . my ivy , ' ' i reply , wishing we could talk about this sort of thing . ` ` there , there ! ' ' i say , pointing to the flower growing on a tree branch on the other side of the trail . ` ` where ? i think you ' ll like it , ' ' nate says , stretching his neck . ` ` there ! ' ' i say , pointing off the trail and into the woods .
