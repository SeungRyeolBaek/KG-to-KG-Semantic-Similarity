megan shook her head . ` ` we need to get you cleaned up . ' ' reluctantly , he followed her into the room . for the first time in a long time , he found himself on the other side of duty . he sank down onto the exam table . ` ` no , megan , this really ain ' t necessary . ' ' as she busy herself putting on bandages , cotton balls , and bandages , she said , ` ` quit your bitchin ' . ' ' she looked over her shoulder at him . at what must have been his confused look at her word choice , she laughed . ` ` that ' s it . ' shut up and let me take care of you . ' ' ` ` when you put it like that , how could i not ? ' ' he smiled . her smile melted his heart . deep down , he was glad to see her so kind to him . she obviously really cared about him if she insisted on cleaning him up . or was she just mad because she was a good doctor ? and then there was the time she attacked dev for hurting him . of course , that was probably true . did that mean she threatened his sanity since he ' couldn ' t go hand - to -sleeping with his sister ? oh , what she must think of him now . as he allowed megan to tend his wounds , his thoughts returned to dev ' s earlier verbal abuse . he wondered about dev ' s reaction to the fact he was in love with another woman . was that what kept megan from seeing his reaction to her ? was she still hiding her own issues or her fear that he was still madly in love with his sister ? his thoughts gave him pause when megan asked , ` ` are you angry ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m not . ' ' when she gave him a questioning look , he explained , ` ` it ' s more the fact that i ' m emotionally than i am , physically . ' ' ` ` ' what exactly was all that about ? ' ' she asked , as she applied the medication on his jawline . he winced when the needle touched the tender skin . ` ` my brother was sleeping with you . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` holy shit . ' ' she held the cotton ball up as she eyed him closely . ` ` what i ' m wondering is what got him so worked up that he would go into the bathroom , beat you up , and then hit you ? you know the onenowhere on earth i would remember him in a relationship . ' ' ` ` the answer is so obvious , ' ' he muttered . ` ` tell me , ' ' she demanded . ` ` he ' s a spoiled brat who ' s ' ever gotten his way - he ' s lashed out at me because he thinks it ' s all my fault . ' ' ` ` i hate the name mia . was it all about the girl ? ' ' ` ` yes , that ' s why i called her mia . ' ' he sucked in a deep breath , filling megan in on what exactly had happened between him , dev , and mia . ` ` well , ' ' she said , when he finished . ` ` i guess that is all you can say about the girl . ' ' ` ` you were too young to take advantage of her like you did - i mean , with both her ... ex - boyfriend and dev . ' ' he paused . ` ` what else was i supposed to do ? i cared for her , and i wanted to make her happy . ' ' at the pain that flashed in megan ' s eyes , he quickly added , ` ` there was no real relationship between us . i was still young at the time, and she desperately needs you to be there for her . ' ' megan cupped his smooth cheek in her hand . ` ` you truly are the most wonderful man i ' ve ever met . ' ' ` ` i hope ' ' you know about that , ' ' he whispered . ` ` you really are . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` no wonder women are so crazy about you . it ' s one thing for you to be so good - looking and a good guy , but , when you factor in the fact of how sweet , caring , and loving you are , it ' s like you ' re a double agent . ' ' she paused to toss the cotton rag into the trash can . his heart grew louder and louder at her words as he stood silent and waited . part of him wanted to yell at her for not seeing him like all the other women did . if she only knew what others thought , then she would want to marry him , would ##n ' t she ? but could ##n ' t she see how good he could be for her ? when megan met his questioning gaze , she stepped back and then laughed , dropping the roll of paper in her hand . she quickly tossed the cotton rag into the trashand i need a drummer . ` ` so this mia girl , she ' s going out with a band , huh ? ' ' she asked , obviously trying to change the subject and change the mood in the room . ` ` not just any drummer . a good one at that . ' ' ` ` band ? what band ? ' ' pesh ' s scratched his head as he thought again . ` ` something train . ' ' megan frowned . ` ` ' something train ? ' ' he snapped his fingers . ` ` that ' s it . ' ' pressing her hand to her chest , megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` you mean , who is aj resendiz ? ' '
