pesh nudged megan ' s leg under the table . she cut her eyes over to him and smiled . once the food had been passed around and everyone seated , they began to eat . ` ` mmm , the food is delicious , ' ' megan said . ` ` thank you , ' ' lavani said , with a small smile . when his mother turned her attention to shveta , pesh shook his head and spoke in a low voice to megan . ` ` ' i tried poking him with dog food . ' ' she nodded . ` ` you did ? how ? ' ' ` ` he was at aidan ' s house spying on emma when she was on bed rest . i guess you could say he really don ' t like being on his own . ' ' ` ` would he ever take food from you ? ' ' ` ` no , he saw it , smelled it , and seemed to enjoy it . but he didn t ' t make any noise that time . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` good for you . ' ' pesh raised his eyebrows . ` ` you ' re dealing with the devil ? ' ' ` ` in that sense , no . i was just protecting emma and aidan . ' ' ` ` i know . ' ' 'her glaring at him , she added , ` ` besides , ' ' don ' t imagine a situation where you and emma are anything more than friends . ' ' ` ` i was there in a professional capacity , ' ' he replied . she pointed her finger at him . ` ` you brought emma with you . that fact alone means you were there for more than just family reasons . ' ' when she finally put her finger down , she gave him a look that was a cross between amused and annoyed . ` ` are you trying to insult me ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m just helping you save emma . we really don ' t care - it ' s just us . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` you ' ve said something else before now ? ' ' ` ` you ' re right . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` next time , you better plan on giving me a crash course in family medicine before you even think about accepting me into your family . ' ' across the table from them , shveta cleared her throat . when pesh and megan looked at her , she smiled . ` ` you ' re doing great , megan . now , don ' t think about breaking all the rules of our family . wei really don ' t want you to . ' ' megan returned shveta ' s smile . ` ` thank you . i would never dream of doing anything to hurt you . ' ' ` ` of course you would ##n ' t , ' ' charlie said . pesh paused ##n ' t to get a peek at his mother . after all , she was the one who kept the traditions and values of their family . his father had tried to distance himself as much as possible , right down to saying his name . charlie wiped the corner of his mouth with his napkin . ` ` i see you have a son , megan . ' ' she nodded . ` ` yes , he is absolutely perfect . he ' s my whole world . ' ' ` ` you should have brought him with you this time . we would have loved to see him , ' ' shveta said . ` ` maybe next time . of course , once you see how much talent he has , you might change your mind . ' ' as the girls talked , she glanced over at pesh . ` ` he really loves pesh , and pesh is very patient with him . his patience is legendary . ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` he ' s a good boy . ' 'spend time with him . ' ' ` ` so it ' s over between you two ? ' ' lavani asked . ` ` uh , i - ' ' megan started when she was interrupted by the doorbell . sanjay jumped out of his chair . ` ` that would be dev . ' ' ` ` how come that he ' s so handsome ? ' ' shveta asked with a giggle . pesh almost laughed at the shocked look on megan ' s face at the mention of dev . ` ` you ' ? ' ' tell me he was going to be here ! ' ' she exclaimed . ` ` i was . ' ' ' if he was coming or not . but ' don ' t worry . things are over between us now . ' ' megan gave him a questioning look as dev walked into the living room . ` ` hey everybody , ' ' dev said , standing up a little . at the sight of megan standing next to pesh , dev ' s eyes widened . ` ` well , hello , if it is . ' ' miss right hook , ' ' he said with a grin . ` ` it ' s miss left hook , dev , ' ' she teased . dev grinned . ` ` good to know . ' ' ` ` you ' ve met megan , dev? ' ' lavani corrected him . ` ` we had the pleasure of meeting each other that day when i came to the hospital to see alpesh . ' ' at megan ' s sharp intake of breath , dev winked at her . he then sat down across from them and began putting food on his plate . ` ` so you two were together and now you ' re married , huh ? ' ' ` ` yep , ' ' pesh answered . after taking a bite of his food , dev looked between them as he chewed . ` ` alpesh is kind of your friend , right ? ' ' pesh could see megan ' s eyebrows rise . ` ` no , no it ' ' ' not . i have a nurse , the head nurse , who is my superior .
