she probably wasn ' t that good , but it would have to do . as much of a dick as i was , the idea of fucking one woman and dancing with another , just did ##n ' t for me . after the phone call , i ' d sat back and watched the other women clothe - themselves as they walked up and down the stage . there was definitely a buzz about the hot blonde , who ' d just taken the stage , and i smiled softly to myself when i heard the guy behind me tell his girlfriend that he was ready to make his move . the girl said she had one more date before the end of the night , so i sat patiently and waited . when she came out the first time , i immediately sat up in my seat . my dick was wasn ' t the only thing that was on there . while i didn n ' t like the stares from the other men around me that night , i had to admit that she was f * * king gorgeous , every one of them i knew . she was dressed very much like one of the models ; and she ' d covered the panties and the ##s with a see - through black fabric that did ##n ' t leave much to the imagination . shefuck everyone there and it seemed that she still had a body . she was all smooth skin , and her legs , i could barely see , stretched between them as i f * * ked her . whether by chance , or fate , whatever you ' d call it , our eyes met , and in that split second i knew everything i needed to know . i did t ' t think anyone else saw the slight step in her step , or heard the tremble in her voice , but so much love did i , that i did ##n ' t miss a beat . chapter three i waited until her song was over and the next song for the band came over the pa . then i made my way to my girlfriend , who thankfully , was deep in a conversation with the guy on her other side who was wasn ' t paying me any attention , and therefore she wasn ' t in my way . ` ` i ' ll be right back then , there ' s something i need to take care of . i made my way back the way i did most nights ; like i owned the place . passing bikini - models and their girlfriends , i ignored their curious stares . i kept my eyes peeled for that waterfall of blonde hair . she was close to the# ##lined by a group of guys who were trying to get her through the door to the back . i made my way towards them and grabbed her arm . she looked down and smiled and in her eyes i saw fear . she turned to the other guy next to her and said something about leaving soon . she really don ' t really have a choice . i had no intention of releasing my hold on her . as soon as we reached the back door , which turned out to be some sort of storage room , i did something i could don ' t remember having ever done before , but had been wanting to for that last hour or so . pushing her up against the wall to keep them apart , i held her there as i lowered my mouth to hers . kissing across her lips , i found the taste of her so delicious . i slid my leg over hers and pulled her body even closer as i gave her my mouth . ` ` ` you ' re mine . ' ' i kissed from her neck to her ear . ` ` you ' re coming home with me . ' ' ` ` ' ' ##uld ' ` . . . . ' ' i put my hands in her hair , pulling her head back . ` ` so it is that you '` sorry to say wo don ' t make a sound . feel this . ' ' she pressed her chest against her rapidly beating heart . ` ` ' feel this . ' ' releasing her i pressed my c * * k into the inside of her thigh where i could feel her wet pu * * y through the fabric of her dress . ` ` do you understand that ? that means that no one and nothing is going to stand in the way of me and you . we probably don ' t have to f * * k anymore , but you ' re staying in my bed . ' ' she was relieved by my words and laid her head against my chest . i took the opportunity to call my driver and make my excuses . ` ` well , i ' m sending a car for you , something came up and i have to go . ' ' we said our goodbye and i called my driver who was taking an hour off since he ' d brought my car home earlier . he had no problem with the last phone call since he knew he ' d be well compensated for the call . ` ` let ' s get out of here . ' ' i still don ' t know how we escaped the worst of the lights that night , but somehow we did . ' 'i covered her jean clad body with my leather jacket and tucked her under my arm . we made our way to the underground parking where they ' d drive my bugatti home in less than twenty minutes . i held her tightly all the way to my apartment in the city . there were no words spoken between us in the fifteen minutes or so it had taken for us to get there . i could hear the pounding of her heart and see the fear in her eyes . when i got her out of the car in the underground parking , i pushed her up against the wall and kissed her once more .
