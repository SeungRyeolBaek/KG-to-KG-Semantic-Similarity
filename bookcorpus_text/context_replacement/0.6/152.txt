` ` what ? you look like you ' re getting in shape . ' ' ` ` oh , thanks , ' ' i say , trying to not smile a little . from anyone else it would have seemed like a ham - fisted effort , but he has such a relaxed , relaxed air about him . ` ` you going to this party in town tonight ? ' ' he asks , dipping his head down into the water , and brushing back his hair with a towel . ` ` what party ? ' ' ` ` oh , i thought nate told you . ' ' ` ` tell her what ? ' ' nate asks , standing next to him . ` ` ' ' chris ' s party , ' ' jackson replies casually . nate ' s jaw muscles tighten . ` ` the ##n ' s in town , ' ' he replies casually . ` ` well , you should know , ' ' he says , turning back to me . ` ` she ' s not going to invite anyone , and i think it ' s not gon ' be a big party , ' ' nate says . ` ` well , chris refuses to invite anyone . they ' ve got the whole townhouse . it ' s gon na be big . ' ' ` ` i know - ' ' nateagain , ' i bite my lip . ' i thought we were all getting along great , under the circumstances , and now he ' s going out of his way to hurt me . ` ` if you ' re worried about being a third wheel , go ask something or other , ' ' he says , and even when he ' s angry , he still don ' t seem to have a care in the world . ` ` so , what do you think ? ' ' nate asks me . ` ` pretty great , actually , ' ' i say , looking at nate , feeling a little guilty when he glares at me . it feels good to tease him a little , since he so obviously does don ' t want me to go . ` ` good . okay then . we can head out - i ' ll pick you guys up at seven , ' ' nate says , before climbing on top of nate and trying to kick him under the table . i roll my eyes as they fight . for the first time in a while , i wish i had something else to wear . chapter twelve in the end , i decide to go with the little black dress i wore to that final cut . it ' s probably my only decent fit for the date , i think . unfortunately , nate' s the only one who ' s seen me do it , and i know he has . my mom just waves back as nate and i head out to jackson ' s black jeep . she is so excited that i finally have a normal life that it ' s comical . jackson opens up the front passenger door for me and nate climbs in first . ` ` we picked up someone ? ' ' he asks as we pull away . ` ` it ' s natasha tonight . and she ' s meeting us there , ' ' nate says from the passenger seat . i hope i ' m right , because i really don ' t think i could look her in the eye after seeing her and nate having sex by the pool . ` ` oh , yes , natasha , of course , ' ' nate says , sighing and gripping the steering wheel . i laugh a little . i guess that ' s par for the course for my mom . nate takes up most of the time in the conversation , and the conversation does the rest . i ' m completely distracted and lost in my thoughts , unsure of what we should do , while nate gets every word back from the phone . i ' m relieved when we find a parking spot on the street by the pool . as we walk toward the cartownhouse , i ' m surprised the neighbors here haven ' t already called the police . people are streaming out the front door and i can hear the music from across the street . there ' s a pretty dark - skinned girl standing on the porch who turns her head when nate calls out , ` ` natasha ! ' ' she smiles broadly as we walk by . nate grabs her in a very playful way and plants a kiss on her cheek as she breaks out into giggles . ` ` come on , ' ' he says , draping his arm around my shoulders , and escorting me inside . we high - five a few people as we walk in , and nate guides me to a table in the middle of the living room , which is decorated with tiny white christmas lights . there ' s an awkward silence between us . somehow he manages to get me a drink , and before i know it i ' m on my first break of the night . with his hand at the small of my back , we walk into the town house . the dining room table is already set for a ping ball game , and nate and i take a seat on the couch together . ` ` you ' re amazing , you know that ? ' 'he whispers in my ear . i ' m startled and nearly spit out my drink . ` ` oh . . . ' ' i look away , embarrassed , ` ` i mean , that ' s nice of you to offer . ' ' ` ` i ' d like to see you again after work . maybe we could have dinner this evening , ' ' he offers . ` ` oh , sure , ' ' i reply , feeling awkward . i mean , it might be a little . . . dated , or something , but i ' ve heard so many stories about people just wanting to hook up , that it ' s nice to be going out on an old - fashioned date .
