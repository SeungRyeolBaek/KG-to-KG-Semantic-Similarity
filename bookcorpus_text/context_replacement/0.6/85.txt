when a smile lit up megan ' s face , he shook his head . ` ` ` not just yet . not until i put a ring on your finger . ' ' ` ` ' i ' don ' t need that to know i ' m engaged to you and that we ' re getting married . ' ' ` ` thank you ' ' ' not , but i will . ' ' she rolled her eyes . ` ` fine , fine . i ' ll let you buy me a ring . a really big one , right ? ' ' he grinned . ` ` i want to make a fortune . ' ' ` ` you know i would be happy to buy your ring even if it was a potato ring . ' ' ` ` i know you would . but i want to marry my beautiful little bride . ' ' she laughed . ` ` well , i wo ##n ' t be with you . ' ' pesh lowered his mouth to hers . as their lips moved against each other , he could couldn ' t believe how happy he was . megan was his - she was always going to be his for the rest of his life . when she slid her tongue against his , he groaned into her mouth . once they were at megan ' s with some of her friends across the street , hemaybe the last thing on his mind should ' ve been rolling her over onto her back and pounding into her . but he ' didn ' t care . he wanted inside her again . he had finally made it into her body , mind , and soul , and he once again wanted to be inside her again . when megan rolled him onto his back , pesh raised his eyebrows at her . ` ` mmm , i think my future wife is getting ahead of herself . ` the wedding , after the wedding , before the wedding , ' ' he teased . ` ` i think we ' ve done things in the last few weeks where it really don ' t count . ' ' ` ` i think you ' re right . ' ' as she rubbed her core against his growing erection , she said , ` ` looks like i ' m not the only one with issues on the outside . ' ' ` ` you should know that has a mind of its own . ' ' she smiled up at him . ` ` well , right now i think we ' re both of the same mind . ' ' as she continued to grind against him , his hands moved to her br * * sts . he cupped and caressed the tips of her nipples . 'the sound of the door opening , pesh tried to pull away , but he did t ' quite make it in time . ` ` bloody f * * king hell ! ' ' aidan ' s voice came from the doorway . megan quickly rolled off pesh , and they both sat up , trying to straighten their clothes and hair . with a confused expression , aidan said , ` ` what ? this is my hotel room ! ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` i ' m sorry , but you of all people should know that when the shit happens , you act like it . ' ' megan smacked his arm playfully . ` ` that is not exactly what happened . ' ' holding up one of his hands , aidan said , ` ` look , i really don ' t even want to know what happened . i only came in here to make sure megan was all right . next time , i ' ll make sure someone else is , and i really don ' t need a ##liner to wipe that out of my eyes . ` ` ` ` ha , ha , very funny , ' ' megan said , as she rolled off the bed . ` ` we were just joking , ' ' pesh said . aidan squeezed his eyes shut . ` ` i ' don ' t think i 'good to know what you are doing . ' ' ` ` our turn , man , ' ' megan said . aidan ' s blue eyes widened . ` ` holy shit , you two are married ? ' ' pesh said as he hopped off the stage and shook megan ' s hand . ` ` yes , we are . but , i mean , i had to go to her parents and personally ask for her blessing . and there ' s the fact she ... ' ' not have a father . ' ' shaking his head in disbelief , aidan said , ` ` that ' s . . . awesome . i ' m so happy for you two . ' ' ` ` thank you . and i really mean that . if it was weren ' t for you and emma , i never would have met megan , ' ' pesh said . aidan laughed as he slapped pesh on the back . ` ` you ' re more than welcome , man . i ' m just so glad you two finally realized how good you are for each other . ' ' he turned back to the others before joining them . ` ` come on , let ' s go join the others . i know this calls for a celebration , but definitely not the one that you two are interested in . ' ' meganshook her head . ` ` we are ain ' t ready to tell anybody yet . ' ' pesh said . ` ` she ' doesn ' t even have a ring . ' ' aidan laughed . ` ` do you really think anyone out there is going to give a shit about whether or not you have a ring ? ' ' ` ` we just have to do this the right way , ' ' pesh said . holding up his hands in surrender , aidan said , ` ` all right , i ' m not going to argue with you guys . but i will admit that there is no right way . but , look at you and aidan . in the end , you have to go with the flow and do the things that matter more than you could ever imagine .
