mason felt none of those things . he had to admit he was a little surprised . aidan had forgotten to mention that , as well . not to mention , she was excited to be a doctor , and she was just starting her clinicals . ` ` it ' s nice to meet you , mason . ' ' ` ` will you tell pesh everything ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` yes , esh , ' ' mason replied , with a grin . pesh could couldn ' t help himself , and he was glad that megan could as well . ` ` how old are you ? ' ' he held up two fingers to which megan shook her head . ` ` he ' s nine now . ' ' pesh smiled . ` ` you must be so proud of him . ' ' ` ` i am . ' ' she hugged him against her chest . ` ` he ' s the first and only son i could ever ask for . ' ' ` ` you ' re so sweet . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' they were interrupted by aidan ' s mother , angie , whom pesh had met earlier . ` ` looks like it ' s time to go . come on in . mommy wants to go see aidan ' s mother first . ' 'he then returned to his room . ` ` ' good for grammy , ' ' megan said . as angie walked out with megan , the other band members began filing out of the room . pesh turned to megan and gave her a reassuring smile . ` ` i must admit that even though i have a future with emma , i ' m a little unsure of what i ' m going to do . ' ' ` ` it ' s okay . just follow my lead , and you ' ll be fine . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' when it was just the three of them and aidan and emma in the room , aidan waited for them . a priest in flowing white robes stood by the door with a large organ in his hands . pesh tried not to be intimidated by the large crowd out in the room . music rang out from the organ , and the priest motioned for them to enter . as they walked through the door , emma looked over at aidan . ` ` please , aidan , do not go in there and act like a spoiled brat . like the child i raised you to be . ' ' he acknowledged her gesture by sticking his chin out and crossing his arms . aidan laughed at emma ' s expression . ` ` please , aidan . ifhe feels you are so excited , he ' s going to get excited . ' ' emma laughed . ` ` he ' s not excited . he was fine until we put him in the dress . ' ' ` ` i think he thinks that wearing that dress is getting to his ego , ' ' aidan said with a grin . when emma shot aidan a death glare , megan and pesh could ' ' not stop laughing at the two of them . aidan winked at emma before walking out the door . at megan ' s nod , pesh started down the aisle . when they reached the marble floor , the music stopped , and the priest began speaking . he informed the congregation of what was about to take place and the importance of all the religious education noah was going to receive . aidan and emma made the sign of the cross on noah ' s forehead . megan came forward to do the same . when megan joined him , pesh bent down to quickly follow their instructions . when he finished , he glanced at megan . she smiled and said , ` ` good morning . ' ' he returned her smile . they sat through the rest of the service while aidan and emma prepared to marry noah in the morning . when it was time for him and megan to go toand with us as well . the priest took a sleeping noah from emma ' s arms . when the first drop of water reached the top of noah ' s head , he screamed and shook his arms and legs . emma was relieved at how he ' wasn ' not ' like a normal man like she had assumed . ` ` thank god noah got his wish , ' ' aidan murmured beside pesh . when the blessing ceremony was over , the priest gave a small bow , and then it was over . just as pesh sighed with relief and was looking forward to making a quick exit , aidan grabbed his arm . ` ` please don ' t go anywhere . we have to do this . ' ' reluctantly , aidan nodded . he wanted , and desperately needed , a moment alone to collect his thoughts . everything had been so surreal - being in his own home , meeting all of aidan ' s family , and then having the help of megan step in as well . finally , they stepped back as a photographer stepped forward and began to take several pictures of aidan , emma , and noah . now it was either aidan and noah or emma and noah . ` ` okay , you have the picture now . ' ' pesh smoothed down his hair and took theand to include him in the final picture . when they finished with the two of them , he was going to megan for pictures with just the two . as the photographer tucked megan up against pesh ' s chest , he looked down at her . her radiant smile caused his heart to swell . for the first time , he inhaled the sweet scent of her hair . the soft , silky strands brushed against him . he could almost make out the warm scent of her skin .
