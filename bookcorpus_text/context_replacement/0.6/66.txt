kristi laughed . ` ` you know exactly what i mean . ' ' ` ` it is rare that we see each other outside of the hospital , but when we ' re in the office , our relationship is strictly professional . ' ' ` ` i never mentioned it . ' ' not . ' ' still looking at the nearly empty parking lot , he shook his head . ` ` what you ' re referring to ? you and megan ? nothing good can come of those kinds of rumors . ' ' touching his arm , kristi smiled . ` ` there are no rumors - just an opinion from someone who knows and loves you . ' ' his eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` you agree don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` of course not . i think megan ' s the perfect match for both you and her . ' ' he was silent for a few moments , considering her words . ` ` ' you should call and check on her . ' ' ` ` i think that would be a very good idea . ' ' she pulled her phone out of her pocket and glanced at the honda they were parked in front of . ` ` yes , this is it . ' ' ` ` have a good night , kristi . ' ' ` ` ' toyou , dr . nadeen . and good luck . ' ' he smiled . ` ` thank you . i appreciate that . ' ' when he got to his car , he reached inside and pulled his phone out . he searched through his contacts to find megan ' s number . before he answered , he impatiently tapped his fingers on the steering wheel . the call went to her house , leaving him with a sinking feeling . although he knew it probably would . ' not the best idea in the world , he decided to go to her house to check on her . the moment he rang her parents ' , he immediately was on a conference call . one of her older brothers answered . ` ` hey , what ' s up ? ' ' he asked . ` ` nothing . i ' m dr . nadeen . i live with megan . ' ' snapping his fingers , he looked at pesh . ` ` yeah , i know you . ' ' ' are you megan ' s brother ? ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` yeah , i am . ' ' ` ` good . hold up , megan ' s home . if you go around the side of the house , she locks her bedroom door . ' ' ` ` i know . thank you again . ' ' ` `no problem . ' ' when the door opened , pesh considered going up to his room . but he knew it would be even worse if her mother told her he had been sick and that he just left without telling her . with a deep sigh , he walked across the lawn . he followed the path around the house to where it curved around the corner . reaching the front door , he knocked softly . when the door swung open , megan stared at him with a mixture of both surprise and confusion . ` ` what are you doing here ? ' ' she asked . pesh shoved his hands in his pockets . ` ` you called in sick again . i was worried . ' ' ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' he resisted the urge to add that with her haggard appearance and dark circles under her eyes , she most certainly did didn ' t look fine . ` ` i tried calling you , but you said ##n ' d answer . kristi and i were worried about you . ' ' her face softened a little . ` ` i ' m sorry . i must ' ve forgotten to answer my phone . ' ' ` ` can i get you something to eat ? some soup maybe ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m fine . ' ' ` ` 'you look really pale . will you let me do an exam ? you know the flu is - ' ' ` ` i do don ' t have the flu . ' ' ` ` how can you look pale if you ' d ' ve been sick ? did you get the flu while at the hospital ? maybe it can give you a little headache . ' ' she shook her head and sighed . ` ` i really don ' t have the flu . since you ' re going to go on and on , i ' m going to go ahead and tell you . i had some ... issues with my pregnancy . normally , i can manage them with birth control , but when i started clinicals and started working , i could couldn ' t use the birth control without my husband . and it really wasn ' t like i was ha * * ng s * x anymore . ' ' while he appreciated her concern , he was still slightly disappointed . ` ` ah , i see . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry to have bothered you , ' ' megan said . he waved his hand dismissively . ` ` well , when you go to work tomorrow , there will be a prescription for you for birth control . i just don ' t like the idea of you in the, but i really don ' t want this to happen next week . ' ' ` ` ' the medication , ' ' she protested . mason shook his head . ` ` it will be available at the clinic tomorrow . ' ' ` ` thank you , pesh . that ' s a very kind thing for you to do . ' ' a young woman appeared behind megan . ` ` ' esh . you okay ? ' ' she looked at mason . ` ` i came to check on your wife . ' ' mason lifted his head to look down at megan . ` ` her stomach hurts . she cannot eat . you understand ? ' ' ` ` um , i . . . ' ' she wanted nothing more than to spend time with mason , and by the same token , with megan as well .
