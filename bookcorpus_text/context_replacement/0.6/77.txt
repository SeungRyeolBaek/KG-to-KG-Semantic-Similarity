` ` do not speak that way to megan ever again . do you understand me ? ' ' ` ` and do you really believe that she thinks you ' re worth throwing her life away for ? ' ' pesh closed the distance between them . towering over kara , his entire body vibrated with anger . ` ` listen to me when i say that if you try to hurt megan one more time , i will make it a living hell for you . as the senior officer on the case , i will have you shipped off to a hospital far from here . ' ' he glared down at her . ` ` do you understand me ? ' ' she slowly shook her head as the realization that there was something between them finally dawned on her . ` ` if you ' ll excuse me , i need to go to my dinner table . ' ' as she walked past him , pesh exhaled a sigh of relief . he never used that tone of voice with women , or men for that matter , unless he was being forced to do so . but kara ' s strange behavior and the way she ' d acted earlier had forced him to accept what he was s ' pose . at the sound of a tap on his shoulder , he turned around . megan gave him a weak smile . ` ` myno ! ' ' he chuckled at her tone and smiled . ` ` you really don ' t need to worry about her or you or anyone for that matter . i took care of it . ' ' ` ` i told you . ' ' he grinned . ` ` you did ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` it was amazing . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad you think so . ' ' ` ` i ' ve never had a woman take over for me like that before . ' ' pesh shook his head . ` ` that ' s a lie . ' ' ` ` if we really weren ' t in the middle of the club ' s floor , i ' d ask you to show my appreciation . ' ' she laughed . ` ` i ' ll just take a rain check . ' ' ` ` ` you would ? that ' s good to know . ' ' lowering his voice , he said , ` ` we ' ll have that kiss later , when we ' re alone . and i really don ' t even want it on the floor . ' ' his eyebrows rose . ` ` i want it in other places on my body . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i think that can be arranged . ' ' ` ` i ' ll be going .to you . ' ' ` ` dr . nadeen ? ' ' a voice called from the end of the hall . ` ` yes ? ' ' ` ` you ' re staying in rxam until twelve . ' ' ` ` as soon as i pick this baby up , i ' ll be there , ' ' he lied . at his obvious lie , megan covered her mouth to hide her smile . ` ` i have to go . ` can you come over tonight ? ' ' ` ` yep . let me get you fed and settled , and then i ' m yours . ' ' ` ` see you then . ' ' he winked at her before he turned and walked down the hall . a few minutes later pesh found himself walking down the quiet streets of megan ' s hometown . his phone buzzed yet again . glancing down , he waited a moment to make sure it was wasn ' t the police . he also wasn ' t too surprised to see it was a text from megan . he could tell from the way she had been constantly texting him that afternoon and evening that she was nervous , which was completely foreign to him . she was so strong and confident that it was hard for him to imagine her ever being nervous . but he knew that was megan 'never had she had a reason to be acting as if he were introducing her to his family . when he picked her up , they were going to his aunt , shveta ' s , house for dinner . his parents , along with at least one of his brothers , would be there . although megan had spent a lot of time with her family , it still hadn ' t exactly been the same thing as her spending time with his . he did ##n ' t know if her feelings stemmed from her meeting his family or if they stemmed from the realization of how far their relationship had progressed in the last few days . he pulled into the driveway at just before nine . he didn t ' t even get to the front porch step before the door swung open , and megan stepped out . her slender legs swayed a little in the black high heels she was wearing . she wore black jeans , and a tight black top that had a lot of lace . it reminded him of the dress , a dress that women from his past wore . he wondered if she had chosen it for that reason . ` ` you look beautiful , ' ' pesh said , leaning down to kiss her cheek . when she said don ' t respond to his kiss , he smiled down at her .` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' rolling her eyes , she shrugged . ` ` duh , i ' m just worried . ' ' ` ` you ' re really that worried about my family ' s treatment of you ? ' ' she held up her hands . ` ` of course , i am . your family is very important to you . i do n ' not want . . . ' ' she tore her eyes from his . ` ` you do n ' not want what ? ' ' he shrugged . ` ` i do n ' not want to bring them to you . ' '
