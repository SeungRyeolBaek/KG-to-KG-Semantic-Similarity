` ` you know what i think ? ' ' he asks , stepping toward me . i back away slowly , feeling one of the posts of my bed against my back . ` ` i think you want me . i think you can barely contain yourself . ' ' ` ` that ' s very sweet of you , ' ' i reply . i begin to tug the ends of my hair again . ` ` why are you doing that ? ' ' he asks , frowning . ` ` it ' s just a nervous habit , ' ' i reply with a smile , and drop my head . ` ` do i make you nervous ? ' ' ` ` no , ' ' i reply quickly . ` ` about you being in control . . . ' ' ` ` i ' m just asking if i ' m wrong . ' ' ` ` wrong about what ? ' ' i resist the urge to tug my hair , but i don ' t want to give him the satisfaction . ` ` wrong about you wanting me . let ' s give you a reason - ' ' he raises his eyebrows , studying me . ` ` i ' m going to kiss you again , and all you have to do is tell me to stop . ' ' ` ` what ? that ' s it . not to kiss youyou fucked me , and now you want me to fuck you ? ' ' i nod , and he leans toward me . i try to move , but i ' m still pressed against my door . heat pools low in my belly as his eyes lock onto mine . ` ` if it ' s okay , just tell me to stop , ' ' he says softly , and leans closer . his clean scent fills my nostrils and my mind begins to wander . i feel sweat trickle down my back as he wraps his arms around me , gripping the door with his hands on my lower back . he ' s so close to me . i can feel heat radiating from him . his shoulders and chest press against mine and he lowers his face toward mine . just a few inches between nate thornhill ' s face and mine . just an inch . ' just breathe . . . i can feel his warm breath against my slightly parted lips . . . ` ` nate . ' ' i whisper . he nods but he don ' t pull away , as if he ca ##ws ' t believe what he ' s just heard . deep inside , i ' m surprised at my own reaction . i can feel his erection against my thigh - i know he wants me ,please . " i can play him at his own game . i lean forward slightly , allowing my lips to brush against his as i whisper , ` ` unless you ca don ' t want to . ' ' his eyes , which were focused on my mouth , flick back up to meet mine . i force myself to remain calm even though i ' m overwhelmed by the intensity in his gaze . he stares at me for a moment , then pushes off the wall and steps back . he opens his mouth , about to say something , but nothing comes out . i remain pressed against the wall as he turns and walks toward the door . without looking back , he closes it behind him . i lean back and take a deep breath . it ' s like he sucked all the air out of the room and i still don ' t breathe when he ' s near . i ca n ' t . i just rejected him . i ' m sorry , but i still feel like giving myself a standing trial . i just rejected the advances of nate thornhill , my boyfriend of almost two years . i should win a grammy award . i know that if i ' d let him kiss me , i would completely lose that kind of control over our relationship . i ' d be treated like anotherthe woman who fell for his charm . of course , the truth is that i ' m more turned on than i ' ve ever been in my life , and i ' m obsessed with my record collection . i sigh and flop back onto my bed . i have a feeling that whatever is happening between me and my husband , i ' haven ' t heard the end of it yet . chapter twelve ` ` i ' m so glad there ' s a lawyer in here ! ' ' olivia says , bouncing around in her desk chair . she ' s my new office assistant , and one of only a handful of female employees at thornhill and smith . ` ` ah , yes . my head is crystal clear , ' ' i say , checking the pa system on my phone . ` ` ' they ' ll need you to sign an nda and everything , but first , want to go to lunch ? ' ' she asks . ` ` what ' s the nda ? ' ' i turn to face her . ` ` non - disclosure agreement . there are a lot of lawyers and other political figures who work in here , and you can ne ' er meet anyone . nothing personal , ' ' she says in hushed tones . she seems genuinely happy that she 'i got this new job , which is probably why i still haven ' t told her that i ' m the mayor ' s assistant . i ' ve never heard from it before , and it seems strange and strange to me now . ` ` okay . so i ' d like to have dinner later this week , and i ' m having lunch with my friend allison today . we went to uva together , and she ' s doing an internship at this nice college there called georgetown , so i ' m going to meet up with her . ' ' ` ` great . georgetown has some good schools .
