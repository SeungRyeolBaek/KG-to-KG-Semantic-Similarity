` ` all right then . chuck e . cheese it is . ' ' ` ` go get your shoes , ' ' megan said . when he walked back into the living room , megan stood up . ` ` you really really don ' t have to do this . ' ' ` ` no , i ' don ' t care . we can go have breakfast with mason , and then we can start our day . i ' m sure he ' ll be passed out and ready for a nap when we get back , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , we will . ' ' ` ` good . then he wo ##n ' t have any reason to bother you if he ' s tired . ' ' she smiled at his words . ` ` thank you . i really appreciate that . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' he reached out and touched her cheek . when he started to lean in to kiss her , she ran back into the kitchen with his shoes . pesh immediately pulled away . to avoid the kiss , megan occupied herself with putting mason ' s shoes on . when she finished , she walked over to pesh and grabbed his hand . ` ` go ! go ! ' ' pesh smiled at megan ' s enthusiasm . he extended his other handnot for megan . she slipped her hand into his and together they walked to the door . as megan walked through the door of their new chuck e . cheese , she winced slightly from both the ear - piercing sound and the stomach - turning smell . she barely contained her smile at the attention she and pesh were getting for their overly protective behavior . ` ` i think we ' re a little off , ' ' she teased . he held up his index finger and winked , pulling them closer together . ` ` maybe a little off . ' ' tugging on pesh ' s hand , she led him over to the seating area of seats . megan quickly dug through her purse for the receipts for tickets . when she found them , she walked over to pesh . ` ` i ' ll go get us some pizza . ' ' she tossed the tickets at him . ` ` if these are sold , he ' s done . ' ' ` ` i really don ' t mind giving him one . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` trust me . he ' s done . ' ' ` ` okay then , ' ' mason said good - naturedly . megan was more at ease with pesh to watch them . she handed them a couple of boxes ofmason ' s brother , mason , arrived with his pizza and megan made her way over to the booth next to the pool table . when she caught pesh ' s eye , she waved them over . after several awkward moments , he was finally able to convince her to leave the # ##room to sit and eat . as he shifted around in his seat , megan thought she would feel so lucky to get two slices of pizza from him that she was ready to go home again . she just had a feeling that she , pesh , and the rest of them were going to start wearing red lipstick before this was all said and done . ` ` this place is really nice , ' ' pesh said , as he looked around . megan nodded . ` ` have you ever had the flu ? ' ' ` ` ` no . my brother , arjan ' s , and his wife live in town , but i ' ve just never had a chance to visit . ' ' ` ` you ' ve dodged a bullet here . that ' s for sure . ' ' he paused before taking a bite of his pizza . his expression was so serious that megan could couldn ' t stop smiling . ` ` this is wonderful , ' ' she said . ` ` i should have told you .to humor you . it always seems funny to little kids who are hopped up on candy . ' ' he took a long drink from his bottle and swirled the juice around like he was trying to rid himself of the taste . when he noticed her staring at him , he put on a fake smile . ` ` mmm , that ' s good stuff . you should finish yours before i leave . ' ' ` ` ' thanks , ' ' she murmured . mason winked at her as he slid his pizza onto his plate . she could don ' t stop when her heart melted at his smile . it was so hard to believe that she could be doing something for him in the form of chuck e . cheese . ` ` okay . go eat , ' ' he said , pulling her out of her thoughts . she shook her head . ` ` ' ' don ' t think so . you need to eat something . ' ' he winked at her before taking a bite and popping it into his mouth . mason managed to finish his pizza with a little help from pesh . then the two of them headed back out to the # ##room . as megan watched them , the familiar ache in her chest began to ease . pesh was , head down , lookingshe knew where he could go , and enjoyed catching him when he fell off the bench . he seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with her . most people would have slept with her just to be on her good side . but pesh could ##n ' t have an agenda when it came to her , unless it was to make her consider the possibility of a relationship with him . when the first roll was done , she slid into her chair . ` ` okay , time to go . ' ' mason ' s eyes lit up , and it looked like at any moment he might give a fight to her .
