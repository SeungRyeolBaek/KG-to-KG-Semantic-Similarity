when pesh took her hand in his , she jerked her head up in surprise . in a low voice that dripped with emotion , he said , ` ` he hurt you so badly , # n ' t you ? ' ' as she shifted in her seat , she was breaking the silence by pointing her index finger at pesh . ` ` ` you ' re always putting the wrong questions on me , ' ##n ' t you ? ' ' he reluctantly released her hand . ` ` i know . ' ' she sighed . ` ` no , it ' s okay . ' ' she ran her fingers through her hair as she began wondering if she was ever going to be alone with pesh . looking into his eyes , she could didn ' t see any judgment or judgment - there was only love . ` ` yes , he hurt me . he continues to hurt me every time i look at him and see what he ' s been through . ' ' she turned her head over to where aidan held a sleeping mason in his arms . while the others talked and laughed at him , aidan gazed down at his son with such love in his eyes and concern on his face that it opened a gaping hole in megan ' s heart . her lips trembled as she whispered , `` i did that for my mother . ' ' pesh ' s blue eyes filled with tears as he once again took her hands in his . ` ` i ' s ' pose the same thing , but i also know how you feel . i feel it every time i see my husband and wife in a warm embrace . it drives me what i do not understand . . . what i have lost . ' ' megan wiped her eyes with the back of her hand . ` ` emma told me about your mother . i ' m so sorry . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' he murmured . biting her bottom lip , megan very carefully asked , ` ` what was she like ? ' ' at his raised eyebrows , pesh seemed surprised by her question . megan knew she had hadn ' t stepped over the line of conversation . he leaned back in his chair and drew in an audible breath . ` ` she was my everything - the sun , the moon , and the stars . ' ' he held her questioning gaze , waiting to see if she really wanted him to continue . when she gave a small nod , he began to explain . he told her how they had met and about the unique qualities that she had that made her unique . as megan listened to himfilled with the passion and love of his late wife , she could don ' t remember being even a little bit jealous . she ' d never had a man have such deep feelings for her . she could don ' t remember ever being loved so deeply by a man that not even she could change his mind . ` ` what you felt with her , what you still feel for her , it ' s so real , ' ' she said when he paused . pesh ran a hand through his dark hair . ` ` it ' s strange to hear you say that . i think most women are turned off by what they think of a man who did ##n ' t let go of his late wife . ' ' megan shook her head . ` ` i really don ' t think so . who would ##n ' t be turned off by a man who cared so much that he # ##n ' t stopped loving his wife just because she died ? ' ' pesh ' s eyes widened at her words , and he sucked in a deep breath . ` ` most women ' don ' t want to hurt your feelings , ' ' he said softly . ` ` but they ' re all wrong . some of us have the capacity to love others in different ways . i love my wife with amy heart and soul , and there will always be room for another . . . . forever . ' ' he stared at her for a moment , intense and intense . ` ` i have to say that i find your words ... charming . ' ' ` ` you do ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' the intensity of his gaze caused her to laugh softly . ` ` i really don ' t think any man has ever told me that . ' ' ` ` that ' s a shame . ' ' before she could consider changing the subject , aidan returned to their table with aidan in his arms . ` ` after you put him down , i ' m going to grab some dinner . emma wants some of her own . you hungry ? ' ' he asked megan . she nodded . a meal would certainly help cool her off after the night she ' d been having with pesh . ` ` yes . i really don ' t think i ' ve had one in years . ' ' ` ` neither has she . i will be hanging her from the ceiling soon , ' ' he teased . megan laughed . ` ` you have really got to stop with the teasing . you are my husband , and it is rude and embarrassing to me to speak ofyou in that case . ' ' ` ` i am so very sorry for hurting your tender feelings . ' ' smiling , aidan turned to pesh . ` ` that okay with you , or would you like something else , too ? ' ' ` ` i ' m going with a beer , ' ' pesh said . aidan shook his head . ` ` be right back . ' ' as aidan walked into the kitchen , pesh caught her staring at him . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` just that you need a drink , that ' s all . ' ' ` ` and why is that ? ' '
