` ` you did not , ' ' i say , before he can finish . he looks over at me and raises his eyebrows , his smile hidden behind them . he nods . ` ` it ' s true . ' ' ` ` my mom says honesty is the best way to build relationships , ' ' nate says casually . ` ` true , ' ' i reply , smiling as i make my way through the back door into the kitchen . i set the paper down next to the plate and climb onto the counter . suddenly , i feel like i ' can ' t do anything ' with nate . my mind asks , but my body is focused on responding . ` ` so , are you expecting anyone at all , brynn ? ' ' he asks . fuck him . ` ` not right now , ' ' i reply , sitting back down . ` ` who were you expecting ? have you met him , ' ' nate says , his dark eyes looking at the pattern on the plate ' s white paper . my mom spent all day making it . ` ` probably not , ' ' i reply quickly , putting a fake smile on my face . he really knows how to get under my skin . the truth is , i ' ve never really dated anyone, just like my mom told me , and as much as i ' m embarrassed by the question . ` ` who wants dessert ? ' ' i try to avoid any more questions by laying out the main course , but then i ' m forced to think about the fact that nate and dana are probably going to have to go out somewhere like this and have sex . i hope it ' s not in nate ' s room . what if i can hear them through the walls ? my mom insists on carrying the dessert tray , and nate and i get up . she and nate start talking again , and dana walks over to me . ` ` you look so beautiful . ' ' she smiles . ` ` i wanted to ask : what did you put in your hair ? ' ' ` ` w - what ? um , soap ? ' ' ' wow , she really makes it hard to resist her . ` ` soap ? oh . . . soap ? oh my god , i have this weird feeling , ' ' she says , almost to herself . ` ` oh , okay . i guess i ' ll be seeing you later tonight ? ' ' i nod , and she looks confused . ` ` because you and nate are dating . ' ' ` ` we ' re not really dating , '' she turns to me . ` ` he ' s not the one , and i gave up two years ago . but now look at him - can you blame me for coming here ? ' ' she replies with a laugh , and her eyes widen . ` ` oh my gosh - wow ! i thought for a second that he ' s your brother ! ' ' ` ` half - brother , ' ' i correct her . ` ` well , i ' ll gon go ##z ##in . it was very nice to meet you , emma . ' ' ` ` you , too , ' ' she replies , turning around to join her and nate ' s group . i step into the house but at the last second decide not to go inside . i need some air . i find myself walking down the stairs and to the french doors of the wood - framed house . they open onto the backyard and i step inside with nate , closing the door behind us . the cool breeze from the ocean takes me outside and i walk slowly toward it . i walk around the swimming pool to the lower end of the yard , and then over to a grassy area with a soccer field set up at one end . the concrete steps leading to the sandy beach are located on the other side , andit took me a while to get them into the house . as i walk down the steps , i see the ocean spread out in front of me . the river flows right by , lit only by the sparsely furnished houses on the hill above it . as i step onto the shore , i can feel the sand pressing up against my feet , and boulders cast long , dark shadows on either side of me . this is no white - sand beach . the river runs so deep it rains , and there are only white - sand pools in front of me . i look up at the steps behind me and then back out at the ocean . i feel so out of place here . even though our old house doesn ' ' t really feel like home anymore , i wish i were there now , sprawled out on the big old couch , with my mom in her pajamas , watching something on our old tv . i ' n ' never know if i ' ll ever be able to feel like i belong here . i ' ll always feel like a guest in someone ' s house . i walk down closer to the shore until i can feel the sand getting wet beneath my feet . i ' don ' t want my feet to get wet . i jump when a branch breaks free of a branch overhead .. i can just see it as it flies off , its wings a long black shadow against the night sky . i wish i could see it . i turn and walk back toward the steps , feeling as alone as i ' ve ever felt . i shake my head at myself as i climb the wooden steps . my past is gone , and i ' m happy to be in a place like this .
