aidan shook his head and stood up . ` ` you need to be on your feet . you said yourself you ' ain ' t feeling very well when we left . ' ' emma shot him a dirty look . ` ` sorry for saying that in front of pesh and megan . ' ' aidan gave them a crooked smile . ` ` sorry guys . i hope it ' didn ' t ruin your whole day or that emma , now six months pregnant and three days , still ain ' t feeling well . ' ' megan laughed . pesh shook his head . ` ` emma , if you want to go back upstairs and lie down , we wo ##n ' t ' me . just remember how long it was long ago , ' ' megan offered . ` ` no , i ' m fine . i want to sleep , ' ' emma said . when aidan motioned for her to take a seat , she shook her head . ` ` i need to go to the bathroom . ' ' ` ` you want me to go check on him ? ' ' emma asked . ` ` i ' m sure he ' s fine or the guys would have texted me . i ' m just being silly . ' ' aidan gave her a quick hug . ` ` thank you , emma. ' ' she winked at him . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' as she disappeared through the door to the kitchen , aidan began telling pesh some ridiculous stories from childhood that had pesh doubled over with laughter . when emma finished , she did don ' t sit back down . instead , she rocked back and forth on her heels next to her husband . ` ` aidan , ' ' she said in a low voice . megan could couldn ' t help wondering how emma had calmed down since her trip to the bathroom just a few minutes ago . aidan held out his hand . ` ` one sec , emma . i need to finish telling pesh this story . ' ' ` ` ' my water please . ' ' without taking his eyes off pesh , aidan slid his glass of water over to her . ` ` please drink this . ' ' if the situation outside hadn ' t been dire , megan would have laughed at how nervous aidan was . pesh leaned forward in his seat . ` ` um , aidan , i thought - ' ' he did don ' t get a chance to finish . suddenly , water splashed against the back of aidan ' s head . he jumped out of his seat , turning back to emma . ` ` what the hell ,please ? ' ' ` ` my . . . please , ' ' she said through gritted teeth . ` ` ` no , ' ' aidan said . after tossing his napkin down on the table , he held up his hand . ` ` no , it ' s okay . no need to worry . we ' re not that far from the hospital - ' ' ` ` ' ten minutes , ' ' emma said . aidan ' s hands went to her shoulders . ` ` it ' ll be okay , em . i promise . ' ' emma let out a few deep breaths as she considered his words . then her fierce expression returned . ` ` okay . ' ' aidan nodded as he turned back to pesh and megan . ` ` i hate to cut and run , but it looks like little emma is a big fat liar who deserves all the attention tonight . ' ' megan shot out of her seat . ` ` ` s ' pose you worry about her a bit . since she ' s a week old , i ' m going to let her have this one without accusing her of trying to steal the baby . ' ' ` ` can we do anything ? ' ' pesh asked . when aidan shook his head , emma added , ` ` just making sure everything is okay . '' angie jumped out of her chair . ` ` i ' ll go check on him right away . ' ' emma nodded . ` ` okay . ' ' aidan fished around in his pocket . when he produced a set of keys , he handed them to pesh . ` ` since we left after dinner , emma and becky are in both rooms . whoever brought noah here will need our help to get him to the hospital safely . ' ' pesh nodded . megan said , ` ` good night . i ' m not sure if emma is with him or becky . ' ' at emma ' s obviously mistaken assumption that there really wasn ' t a rescue plan in place for noah , megan added , ` ` he ' ll be fine . i promise . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she said , a little relieved . slipping his arm around emma ' s shoulders , aidan said , ` ` come on , baby . we have to go . ' ' at the feel of pesh ' s hand on her shoulder , megan smiled up at him . ` ` good night for them , eh ? ' ' ` ` yes , it was . ' ' ` ` how about letting me join you for a dance on the dance floor ? ' ' ` ` i ' d lovethat . ' ' as an upbeat rock song rang out from the speakers , megan wrapped her arms around pesh ' s neck . this time he said don ' t start dancing around wildly like he did with her . instead , he wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her tight against him . closing her eyes , she rested her head on his bare chest , feeling the steady beat of his heart through his shirt . when the song ended , they did don ' t dance . they just waited for the next song . thankfully , it was a slow song . halfway through , she felt a tug on the hem of her shirt .
