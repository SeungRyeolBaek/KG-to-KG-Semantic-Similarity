it ' s time to meet my mother and her new husband , and share their good news . i look around as i enter reception . the decor is rich and dark , a mix of rich colors and dark wood . i ' ve never been here before - way out of my price range . i ' m about to thank the staff when i spot my mother taking a window seat in the corner . i walk toward her past a row of chairs , ignoring the low murmur of voices and the rattle of wine glasses behind her . her eyes light up and she smiles when she sees me approach . she looks even more beautiful than usual . her dark hair , a little longer than usual , falls in a long braid down to her shoulders , and her white teeth shine from beneath her bright red lips . ` ` brynn ! i ' ve missed you , too , ' ' she says , wrapping me in a hug . ` ` you look beautiful . ' s ' pose this dress a little much for you , dear ? ' ' she asks , looking at the soft material . ` ` you know i like this kind of dress , ' ' i reply , allowing only the slightest hint of sarcasm to enter my voice . this is a normal day with mom . she just doesntry to be a little more formal , a little ... ` ` form - fitting ' ' as she puts it . ` ` oh , i ' m so excited for you to meet him . he ' s standing in the doorway - oh ! there he is . ' ' i follow her gaze to an appropriately dressed man with salt - and - pepper hair and blue eyes who ' s greeting us with a warm smile . ` ` well , i ' d swear this is your father if i ' didn ' t know any better , ' ' he says , and my mom nods . ` ` brynn , i ' m honored . your mother has told me many wonderful things about you , ' ' he says as we shake hands . ` ` hi , ' ' i say awkwardly , but the truth is that she ' s told me almost everything . ` ` please , let ' s sit . i ordered us some food for the party . it should be over soon . ' ' we all all sit , me on one side of the black leather sofa , and my mom and dad on the other . ` ` so , brynn , you ' re starting your senior year ? ' ' ` ` yeah , that ' s - ' ' i break off , myshe reaches for her hand , and i notice a ring on her left hand . not an engagement ring , really . a promise ring . ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' i ask curiously . ` ` oh , ' ' my heart sinks . ` ` well , we were going to wait until my dad called , but - ' ' ` ` we ' re engaged ! ' ' my dad says excitedly . my mouth drops open . ` ` what ? ' ' i ask . ` ` i mean , i thought maybe you ' d know , but ... ? ' ' ` ` you ' re engaged ? ' ' my dad asks curiously . ` ` no , not really . . . ' ' i struggle to put my thoughts into the right order . i suddenly feel the need to protect my mom from what i ' m really thinking . she ' s always been more understanding than me . ` ` just friends , that ' s all . i mean , how long have you known each other ? ' ' ` ` well , we met six months ago , ' ' my mom begins . ` ` and then he took me on a fishing trip to the turks and caicos last summer , and everything was just ... perfect . . . ' ' she trails off , turning to himfor us . ` ` it really was , brynn . and it felt so right . we wished you guys could have been there , but we both knew that we had to have the wedding . it was in this beautiful room on the beach , with amazing views of the ocean , and the crew of the yacht that was docked at the beach . . . . ' ' ` ` it was wedding , engagement , and all in all ! we just wish you and nate could have been there . that would have made it even more special . ' ' i try to keep up with all the questions they ' re throwing at me . ` ` so , where ' s nate ? ' ' ` ` well , nate ' s my brother . he goes to school here , too . we tried to get a hold of him so we could get you home , but - oh ! there he is ! ' ' he jumps out of the bed to run to his father . nate . " nate . . . ` ` what ' s nate ' s last name ? ' ' i whisper back to my mother . ` ` thornhill , ' ' she whispers back quickly , walking over to stand next to me . " my god . nate thornhill is nate . nate thornhill .finally catching up to me . nate thornhill , my ... . . . boyfriend , i realize in horror . beads of sweat form at my temples and i ' ve completely lost my mind . chapter twelve as nate fades into my thoughts , i watch in slow motion as he hugs his dad and shakes hands with my dad . i can hardly believe this is happening . like i ' m in the middle of some weird dream and will wake up soon . i wish i ' d never have to see him again after last night . ` ` brynn , honey , this is nate , dad ' s son , ' ' my mom says , cutting through the fog of confusion in my mind .
