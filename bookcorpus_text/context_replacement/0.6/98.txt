although it had absolutely nothing to do with his family , he still hadn ' t shown any hint of enthusiasm for the idea . the closer they got to the court hearing , the more megan worried that he would bolt . ` ` dr . nadeen , i understand that you wish to adopt the biological child of your own ? ' ' pesh nodded slowly . ` ` yes , your honor , i would . ' ' ` ` i understand that you and your wife have been married less than two years , and that you ' ve only known her a month . ' ' the judge adjusted his glasses that had slid down his pointy nose . ` ` do you think it wise to permanently attach yourself to this child in such a short time ? ' ' megan resisted the urge to storm over to the courtroom and confront the judge . instead , she took deep breaths and tried to rein in her anger . she glanced over at pesh who just stared back at the judge . ` ` your honor , i know that on occasion it may seem as though i am rushing into something . however , i ' ve never been more sure of anything in my life than i am of my love for megan and in particular , my love for you . i ' ve waited a long time to be a father ,and i certainly don ' t want to have to wait another day . ' ' ` ` i see . ' ' the judge scanned the p ##s before him . ` ` i believe the biological father has had no contact with the child . ' ' ` ` that ' s correct , ' ' megan said . ` ` he has not given his parental consent so that dr . nadeen can see his child . ' ' megan released a relieved breath that she had signed the papers . ` ` i ' m glad to hear that , your honor , ' ' she said . ` ` do you believe that your husband would be a good father for your son ? ' ' ` ` i never would have met , least of all with him , if i truly don ' t believe that pesh would be a good and loving father to mason . ' ' ` ` and the fact that he is a married man has nothing to do with it ? ' ' ` ` how dare you ! ' ' megan shouted . when pesh grabbed her arm to stop her , she pushed him away . ` ` you ' ve interrupted me for five minutes and you ' re making assumptions about me , my husband , and my son ? if this was about mason , you could have sued his mother for child support .he is a successful nfl executive . and i would have given everything to see that my son received a college education ! ' ' ` ` mrs . nadeen , i will see that you behave yourself , or i will continue to hold you in contempt , ' ' the judge said firmly . pesh wrapped his arms around her waist , pulling her against him . ` ` okay , ' ' he said . although she hated to admit it , she said , ` ` i ' m sorry , your honor . ' ' when he looked at her , she blinked in surprise . ` ` and i am sorry for misleading you , mrs . nadeen . i never say or do these things to hide the true nature of the people who stand before me . ' ' ` ` you mean , you said that to get a reaction from me ? ' ' ` ` yes , i did . and you also came to my defense . i can see that you are very concerned with the welfare of your son . ' ' still reeling from the judge ' s words , megan said , ` ` thank you . ' ' leaning forward over the table , the judge addressed mason . ` ` mason , do you know why you ' re here today ? ' '` ` ' gettin ' ' dopted , ' ' mason said . the judge laughed . ` ` yes , you are . do you want pesh to be your daddy ? ' ' ` ` uh , huh . ' ' ` ` do you want anyone else to be your daddy ? ' ' ` ` no , ' ' mason answered quickly , shaking his head back and forth . ` ` ` come over here while i sign the papers . ' ' mason slowly walked around the side of the bench to the bench . he climbed up onto the judge ' s lap . after signing two pages of paperwork , the judge handed mason his briefcase . ` ` if you sign that thing , pesh is not your daddy , and you are not nadeen . ' ' with a small smile , mason set the case down . tears filled megan ' s eyes , and she finally let pesh pull her into his arms . ` ` thank you , thank you , thank you , ' ' she whispered . ` ` i love you , ' ' he said , hugging her back . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' their attention was drawn to where mason was banging the case . the judge sighed . ` ` okay , i think that is enough . i doncan ' t you listen to your mommy and daddy talk ? ' ' ` ` tell the judge thank you , ' ' megan said . ` ` thank you , ' ' mason said , as he jumped off the judge ' s lap and came over to them . ` ` ' ' dopted ! ' ' dopted ! ' ' pesh bent down to pick him up . ` ` that ' s it , mason . you ' re my daddy for now and forever . ' ' megan smiled and rubbed mason ' s back as they walked out of the courtroom . ` ` come on . let ' s go to grandma ' s .
