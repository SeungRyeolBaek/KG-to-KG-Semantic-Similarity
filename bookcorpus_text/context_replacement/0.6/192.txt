` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' ` ` it ' s okay . i ' ve got some stuff in my car - i ' ' ' ' you can sit down for a moment . ' ' i nod . at a different time , i would have preferred the idea of getting into this strange woman ' s car , but this is not a sane situation . she puts her arm around my shoulders and leads me to the passenger side of her black car , parked directly across the street from the front of the school . she puts me down , walks around to the driver ' s side and gets in . ` ` here you go , ' ' she says , grabbing a box of tissues from the back of the back seat . ` ` thanks , ' ' i say , awkwardly . she turns on the car ' s interior light . ` ` oh ! ' ' i gasp . ` ` you ' re the girl from the school parking lot . ' ' she smiles again . ` ` i know you saw him that night . i ' m not a stalker or anything . it ' s just , ' i want to catch a glimpse of him , that ' s all . see what he looks like , how he ' s acting . ' ' `` i know . ' ' ` ` ' what ' s it to you ? is there anything i can do ? ' ' ` ` it ' s pierce , ' ' i say as the tears fall from my eyes at the mention of his name . ` ` what ' s he like now ? ' ' ` ` well . . . he made a pass at me at dinner . i mean , i still ' don ' t think that ' s what it was like then , but then , he got on my nerves , something i probably shouldn ' t ever have , and that ' s when i knew for sure . ' ' ` ` oh , honey , i ' m sorry , ' ' she says , patting my hand . ` ` pierce has a bad case of depression . he thinks that anything with a conscience is fair game , on his own , it seems . ' ' ` ` i mean , i already knew he was an asshole from the way he treated nate , but i just ... hadn ' t seen it directed at me before . ' ' she nods . ` ` ' ' ##n ' he treat nate well ? ' ' she asks softly . ` ` oh , honey , i ' m sorry , ' ' i say , looking at her .his father . ` ` he ' s . . . he ' s so hard on nate . he calls him arrogant , arrogant , when people think those are the things he knows deep down are true about himself . ' ' ` ` my poor nate , ' ' she whispers to herself . ` ` but he ' s not . . . nate is a good person , you should know that . and , to be honest , at first i thought he was just like you , but that ' s just my guess . whether it ' s that maybe his genes match yours , or that his parents raised him to be a better person than he was himself , i wonder . ' you know . but he ' s smart , funny , and . . . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' she says , squeezing my hand . ` ` i ' m sorry you had to go through this . did you tell your mom ? ' ' ` ` she freaked out at first , and . . . ' ' i shake my head . ` ` she ' s completely under nate ' s skin . she gets all that from men , and i ' ve never seen her look so fond of one like him . she looks a lot like you , though , ' ' i say, says her pale , slightly flushed face . ` ` he really has a point , ' ' she says with a small smile . ` ` there ' s one thing you should know . . . about nate . . . i found out when you left : you said you left because he was too good for you , because he was a bad boy , too . i tried to talk to him about it , too , but he would ##n ' t let me . ' ' ` ` nate was a good boy , and even if he ' d been the father himself , i still would ##n ' t have left him . ' ' ` ` yeah , i figured as much . you said that the night before you left , you and i had a big fight over him , because he left , and that ' s why you left the next night . ' ' ` ` oh , god , ' ' she says , burying her face in her hands . ` ` i must have been so lost , so lost . i . . . i remember that night , because it was our night . we ' d gone to a house party that night , and we ' d met this guy , who was at our house at the time . i thought he ' d left me ,' he promised her he ' d behave , and here at this moment , i could just tell by the way they looked at each other that they were sleeping together . i asked him about it at school , and he never even managed to deny it . i kept yelling at him , about what kind of example he was setting for his son . i just . . . i never thought that would be one of the last times i ' d see nate . i never thought that was even a possibility . ' ' ` ` i need to see you , ' ' i say softly . ` ` what ? no . you have too much going on here , ' ' eileen says , shaking her head sadly .
