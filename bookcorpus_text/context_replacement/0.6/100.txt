aidan laughed . ` ` well , she is a little un - emma , now isn ' t she ? ' ' ` ` she is . besides , she ' s going to give you nightmares when she ' s a baby , ' ' megan said . ` ` i know . believe me , i know . ' ' when caroline looked up at her , megan could couldn ' t help herself . ` ` you ' re a beautiful girl , caroline . you make me want to have a baby . ' ' ` ` is that a bad thing ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` no , it ' s just . . . ' ' ` ` ' what ? ' ' ` ` i asked pesh to give me a bit of time before we start dating . i know he ' s married by now , but i just want this time with him . you know , just the two of us . ' ' ` ` that ' s sweet . ' ' ` ` ' tell her . . . ' ' megan shook her head . ` ` you ' re too bad for me , aunt caroline . ' ' aidan laughed . ` ` tell me about it . whenever i see her , aidan , i think how much i ' m going to miss them when they ' re not around anymore .it eats at me sometimes that you think i ' ll be happy if we have kids . ' ' ` ` ' ' on the side ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` not really . ' still figuring things out though . and as long as you and i know , you ' ll know when the time is right . and if anyone is wise and understanding , it ' s pesh . ' ' ` ` that ' s true , ' ' megan agreed . mason appeared in the doorway again . ` ` ' hey , mason . ' ice cweam ! ' ' megan exclaimed . ` ` here , let me bring your ' bad ' back to you , ' ' she said , handing it to aidan . she then took caroline ' s hand and headed out of the room . ` ` he said you need ice cweam too . ' ' ` ` did he ? ' ' megan asked , indicating she wanted to follow pesh . ` ` uh huh . ' ` he ' s my ' doption now . ' ' when she caught pesh ' s eye , she raised her eyebrows . instead , his cheeks flushed . ` ` spoiled him rotten today , ' didn ' t you ? ' ' she said in a teasing voice . ` ` 'could ##n ' t do that . it ' s a special day . ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm , and when this special day turns into an all nighter because he ' s cheating on you , you ' re going to sleep with him . ' ' pesh grinned . ` ` i will . i promise . ' ' megan leaned up to kiss him . ` ` you ' re too stubborn for your own good . you ' re not going to have trouble playing good cop when it comes to me . ' ' ` ` but you love me anyway , right ? ' ' he whispered against her lips . ` ` how much i was so willing to change our relationship to when we ' re as a couple . ' ' his eyes softened at her words . it took him a few moments to respond . ` ` that means a lot that you would say that , but deep down i know how you really feel . so , i ' m going to be patient and just wait five more minutes before getting your birth certificate . ' ' ` ` it ' s a deal , ' ' she whispered , before kissing him again . ` as soon as he finished with his pregnancy test , pesh practically ran from the exam room . he hadinto the doctors ' office , trying hard to keep his head down and not draw any attention to himself . he wanted to be able to get out the door without anyone calling him in for a visit or to work a double shift . once he had gathered his things , he headed for the parking lot . ` ` dr . nadeen ! ' ' kristi called . inwardly , he groaned . ` ` what ? ' ' he asked , as he turned around . ` ` you ' weren ' t there , were you ? ' ' she asked . he released a long breath . ` ` i was working on something . does someone need me to wait for them ? ' ' kristi grinned at him . ` ` ' you were only there for a minute , ' ' ' were you ? ' ' a deep sigh escaped his lips . ` ` i was . ' ' she smiled . ` ` i have something for megan . ' ' ` ` ' kristi , you ' don ' t have to do anything else for me . ' ' waving her hand dismissively , she handed a brown paper bag to him . ` ` i have to take this . ' ' after stepping inside , pesh smiled as he bent down to kiss kristi . ` ` thank you . i ' m` she ' ll love it . ' ' ` ` you tell her we need her back here . ' ' ` ` i will . ' ' she patted his shoulder . ` ` you go on home to your family . ' ' he nodded and she walked out the door . it had been his first day back after taking a maternity leave and one of his many long sick days . as he settled into the backseat of his car , he felt a wave of regret at how he had almost gotten killed on the way to work that morning after seeing megan . it had been the worst day of his entire life . he knew he would never get home before he could get back to her . even so , the entire thirty - minute drive home seemed to take an eternity .
