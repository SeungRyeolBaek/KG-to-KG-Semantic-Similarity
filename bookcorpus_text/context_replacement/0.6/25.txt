a slight flush stained aidan ' s cheeks . ` ` um , no , i ' haven ' t even mentioned it to her . ' ' ` ` you sure ? ' you think your mother needs to know about such a life - altering event ? ' ' ` ` well , of course i ' d tell her if i went home for the night . ' ' as pesh crossed his arms over his chest , he could couldn ' t help thinking about how badly aidan had been hit in the head . ` ` you better not still be standing there like that . ' ' aidan stared at pesh for a moment before he spoke . ` ` oh god , i ' m being a big , bad father in this , now aren ' t i ? ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` pretty much . ' ' aidan rubbed his hand over his face . ` ` it ' s just . . . being a father is f * * king hard sometimes . i think about her constantly , and now there ' s another baby in the making . unfortunately , another baby means more time spent away from emma . ' ' aidan offered a weak smile . ` ` i miss her so much . but . . . i ' m ##n ' t get rid of her , and i ' m ' cahas to be . ' ' ` ` i think that ' s a damn good reason . ' ' aidan shook his head . ` ` it makes me feel like a selfish bastard . i mean , who is jealous of their father for stealing their mother ' s money ? ' ' ` ` a lot of people . so stop beating yourself up about what you ' re doing . first of all , ' ' ' not screw it up . talk to emma . ' ' aidan ' s blue eyes widened as he shook his head slowly back and forth . ` ` ` ` no , ' ' don ' t want her thinking less of me . ' ' ` ` she wo ##l ' understand . emma never says that . ' ' ` ` about me being jealous of her relationship with our father ? i ' m pretty sure she would not appreciate me being honest about that . ' ' ` ` what has emma ever said about the most important thing in a relationship ? ' ' ` ` nothing . ' ' pesh sighed . ` ` ' how are you earning her trust by talking to her about your father ? ' ' aidan ' s dark brows furrowed . ` ` maybe i should just tell her i ' m afraid of losing her and that i want her to enjoy our time together ? ' '` ` i would hope so . ' ' don ' t think a woman could be happier hearing her husband say how much he loves her and wants to be with her . ' ' aidan looked thoughtful . ` ` i think you ' re right . ' ' pesh nodded as he patted aidan ' s arm gently . ` ` you ' re doing a great job as a father . i ' m sure you ' ll do just as well with a daughter and maybe even a third child . ' ' at the mention of a third child , aidan swallowed hard , his adam ' s apple moving up and down . ` ` i ' don ' t want a third child . . . but not now . not in a couple of years . ' ' aidan looked up and smiled at pesh . ` ` ' thanks for the vote of confidence in me as a father . ' ' ` ` i will call you when i see it . ' ' ` ` i appreciate that . ' ' ` ` how about i check on your head first ? ' ' aidan nodded . ` ` okay . ' ' pesh began checking for the bruises and bumps on aidan ' s head . ` ` hmm , i really don ' t see anything yet . but just to be on the safe side, i want you to get a ct scan to rule out concussion or other brain damage . ' ' ` ` so , i could keep all of that from me in my head ? ' ' ` ` you would be right . let me just get in the ambulance , and they ' ll just take you home . but you wo ##n ' t have too long to wait . we ' re usually here during the day when the doctors ' offices and medical staff are busy . ' ' as he started for the door , aidan stopped him . ` ` hey , man , with all the excitement , i almost forgot to ask how is megan doing with her surgery ? ' ' pesh ' didn ' t have to think twice before answering , ` ` she is going to be an amazing doctor . ' ' aidan grinned . ` ` i ' m glad to hear it . not that i ever told her before . it ' s always nice to hear her praises sung by a doctor . ' ' poking pesh in the shoulder blade with his elbow , aidan asked , ` ` how ' s it going with you and megan ? ' ' pesh almost laughed out loud at aidan ' s question . it was not in his nature to be so blunt , and with megan ,him being here again , he still wasn ' t quite sure how to respond . ` ` i really like and respect megan . ' ' aidan thought that the most appropriate way to answer her friend ' s question . but was happy that he finally had earned his friend ' s trust , he would wouldn ' t say anything negative about megan in front of him . it was her business whether she said or did or ' t say . ` ` that ' s not what i meant . ' ' ` ` i really don ' t think it is . ' ' aidan eyed him before saying , ` ` ` i know you got off to a bad start , but it ' s not over . are you planning on asking her out ? ' ' ` ` you ' re not letting this go , are you ? ' '
