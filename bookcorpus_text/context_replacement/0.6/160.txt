my mom does know how to throw a good party . i grab another beer as the day turns into night and we start heading down to the lower levels to get a better view of the fireworks . with a loud boom , the party ends . there are a few shouts of joy and some cheers as the crowd turns to look up at the display of light . i ' m making my way toward the front of the crowd when i feel a hand on the small of my back . i know before i can turn around that it ' s nate . ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' he asks me , and i turn to face him . ` ` it ' s nothing . my mom just ' doesn ' t sleep well , ' ' i reply . ` ` you ' re pulling at your hair , ' ' he points out , and i drop my head , feeling embarrassed . the crowd cheers as an enormous blue light goes off behind us . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` i can read you like a book , brynn , ' ' he says , leaning in . i can feel his breath on my neck and pull back , slightly embarrassed . ` ` i just think there ' s something that your mom should tell you , ' ' hepause , and think back to the moment , when i feel his hand on my shoulder . ` ` would you please tell me ? you and my dad are both acting weird , and now your dad is . . . i really want to know . ' ' ` ` and here i thought i was ... lying , ' ' i say , stall for time . ` ` maybe to other people , but not to you . ' ' i stare at him for a moment . his features are illuminated by the light of one of my tiny , heart - shaped candles . ` ` there ' s a reporter . . . she ' s going to go on the air , and say that your dad sexually assaulted her . ' ' ` ` that ' s bullshit , ' ' he snaps at me . ` ` i ' m just the reporter - you know i trust you - ' ' i say , taken aback by his words . ` ` my dad , he ' s a good guy . he ' s a pillar of the community - ' ' ` ` a pillar of the community ? ' ' ` ` what ? he is ! ' ' ` ` it ' s just , by the way you talk about him . . . he ' s not here , nate . ' ' `` you do ##n ' t know anything about him . when my mother left me , he took care of me all by himself . he ' s always been there for me . ' ' ` ` fine , i ' ll just - ' ' ` nate storms off back to the crowd . i stand in silence for a moment . i knew that conversation probably wasn ' t going to be easy , but i do ##n ' t think he ' d hit on me like that , as if i were hudson pierce , or something . i turn back toward the crowd just as the song ends and the arena lights up . i look at the people around me , their faces relaxed , their eyes happy . maybe it was wrong of me to look out to everyone else . because now i know that soon , it will be up to the four of us , in the arena - and the time machine . my eyes land on nate and i realize he ' s looking at me . he turns away when he sees that i ' m looking at him , and leads the way as the last flag goes down . chapter twelve i was half - expecting that the plan was for the four of us to watch the fireworks show together , but apparently there ' s no such thing . or at least ,i ' haven ' t been part of it . it ' s the first time in a while my l ' n ' t is on a family dinner . she ' s been locked up in her room most of the time , and nate gets away from his work in his office . i decide to grab some more food from the kitchen to eat in my room , and peek into nate ' s room before i go . no sign of him . i close my door behind me and grab my laptop to check out some of the articles online . i feel better as i read the reporter ' s article , and am relieved that she probably isn ' t accusing me of some kind of crime . she talked smack about sexual harassment , back slapping , and being dumped by pierce when she left . i finish eating and click around the kitchen for a while , getting bored . when i finally don ' t enjoy my food any longer , i grab my plate and head back out to the kitchen and put it in the sink . the phone on the counter rings as i ' m walking toward it . i pause for a moment , waiting to see if anyone else is going to answer it . what if it ' s the reporter ? should i just say ' hello ', ' like they do on tv ? on the third ring , i decide to bite the bullet . ` ` hello ? ' ' ` ` hi , is nate there ? ' ' a female voice asks softly . ah , secret agent . ` ` no , i really don ' t think he is , ' ' i reply quickly . ` ` may i take a call ? ' ' there ' s a long pause . ` ` is this sarah ? ' ' ` ` yes , this is her sister , brynn . may i ask who ' s calling ? ' '
