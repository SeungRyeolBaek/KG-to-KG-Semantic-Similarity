pierce ' s lawyer offered you a settlement . the settlement ! and it also included payment of your tuition . ' ' ` ` ' ' my tuition ? ' ' i ask , my mind racing . ` ` yes ! as soon as i asked , the offer was turned down . ' ' ` ` but . . . ' so , was it a fair hearing ? i mean , did you have a lawyer look it over ? ' ' ` ` no , it was the same lawyer who told me i ' d get expelled because of the pre - nup i made . he was completely understanding , and told me i ' d better go before he changed his mind . ' ' ` ` but . . . why ? i mean , it was totally out of character for him . ' ' ` ` i know ! i can hardly believe it though . it ' s incredible ! we ' ll be able to pay off the mortgage on the house and have a lot left over . i mean , we ' re not rich or anything , but we have a lot of money left . ' ' ` ` prove it , you mean , ' she says , ' did you testify ? ' ' ` ` i doubt it . the lawyer said that there ' s much more a lawyer than a lawyertrying to forget her ex - boyfriend , and i really don ' t even think she would be worried about me going to the dance with him or anything - not that i ' d want to do that anyway . ' look , it ' s over now . it ' s all done . we just don ' t have to worry about him anymore . ' ' ` ` well , i ' m happy that you ' re going with him . if you ' re happy i ' m happy . so , this is the first good time we ' ve had in a while , huh ? ' ' i rub my eyes with my fingers , wondering when the last time i smiled was . ` ` have you seen him yet ? ' ' my mom asks me . she ' hasn ' t bothered to mention that she ' s talking to nate . ` ` not yet , ' ' i reply . ` ` but i ' ve convinced myself that the dark - haired guy i ' ve seen from the street is him . ' ' ` ` that ' s true , ' ' my mom tells me . ` ` you ' ll see him again for a while . but that will be soon , my dear . i promise . ' ' chapter twenty - two while i still have the day off , itake a deep breath and call allison . i ' m still in a rush , but i want to share my good news with her and miriam . allison and i have haven ' t spoken since our visit over the weekend , and i ' m grateful when she accepts my call on behalf of both of them . i find a really nice restaurant , and tell her that it ' s my treat . half an hour later , i ' m walking out of my room in a light blue dress - the weather here in chicago is always warm , even though it ' s november . i walk slowly across the quad to the on - campus restaurant , trying not to work up a sweat . i watch a group of freshman girls dance as they go out for a party ##ie . in dorm ##s , no less . i remember how nervous i was my first day here , knowing that i would won ' t make any more friends than i did in high school . my insides twist as i remember the restaurant where i first met nate on the street , only a few weeks into my freshman year . i shake my head at myself . i need to forget him . when i reach the restaurant , an upscale mexican restaurant known for fruit ##y food , i ' m surprised to hear the music on the. the hostess smiles at me warmly and i spot allison sitting in a booth by herself . she turns with a shy smile and i walk over . ` ` i hope you ' don ' t mind , ' ' she says as we sit down . ` ` i kind of lied to miriam and told her you brought me closer for ten minutes so we ' d have a chance to talk . ' ' a short bark of laughter escapes my throat . ` ` ' ' don ' t mind if i ' ve never heard you apologize before . ' ' to my surprise , she smiles as we sit down across from each other . ` ` well , i ' ve been thinking about what you said . . . about my being a . . . and how i am a bit of , you know , a ##y two - shoes . maybe i need to loosen up a little . what i ' m trying to say is , i ' m sorry for what i did . ' ' i reach over and place my hand over hers . ` ` thanks . it means a lot to hear you say that . i ' ve hated not talking to you . ' ' ` ` me too , ' ' she whispers . i see her glance over my shoulder . ` ` and here i thought i washey ! ' ' i hear miriam say . i get up to give her a hug . ` ` i heard you two finally cleared your schedules , being in the same room together all day ! ugh , i was so worried ! ' ' she sits down with a heavy sigh in the chair next to allison , her long red hair falling onto her shoulders . ` ` okay . catch me up on everything that ' s been happening . ' ' to my horror , i start to tear up . ` ` oh , sorry , miriam , ' ' i say , reaching for a tissue .
