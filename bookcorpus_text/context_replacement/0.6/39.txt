` ` my head , ' ' she said , with a smile . pesh pulled back the shower curtain . ` ` are you wearing your seat belt ? ' ' ` ` yes , i still am . ' ' ` ` from the blood in your hair , do i assume the airbag broke ? ' ' ` ` yes , it did . ' ' ` ` is this where it started ? ' ' he asked , running his finger through her bright red hair . it started at her neck and ran down her back . most of it was caused by the electrical shock coming from the heart monitor . ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` it looks like the seat belt and the airbag did a number on you . ' ' she laughed . ` ` i thought they were supposed to heal you , not hurt you . ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` trust me . you ' re much better off with a head wound than if you ' haven ' t gone through it . ' ' after checking the machines mary was hooked up to , he turned to megan . ` ` her pulse is good . let ' s get some blood in to check it . ' ' megan nodded . after checking mary ' s chest for her blood pressure , she grabbed a bag of blood from theno . exchanging glances with pesh , she placed the needle in the crook of mary ' s left arm . ` ` ' your stomach , are you hurt anywhere else ? ' ' pesh asked , after he finished attending to her pulse and breathing . ` ` my stomach . ' ' megan ' s breath caught . it was never unusual for a car accident victim to have stomach pain . that usually meant shock , which could only explain the high blood pressure . focusing on mary ' s stomach , pesh asked , ` ` does this hurt ? ' ' ` ` no . ' ' ` ` where ? ' ' ` ` here . ' ' ` ` what happened here ? ' ' a voice came from the room . pesh ' s brows furrowed with concern . ` ` i ' m going to do a quick exam , mary . i want to know what ' s causing the pain . ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' megan pulled the stool closer to the bed . she poured the fluid onto mary ' s stomach , and then pesh began running the needle over the wound . ` ` i ' m feeling a little dizzy , too , ' ' mary said , in a small voice . pesh and megan exchanged a worried look .he pushed the empty plate away . turning to kristi , he said , ` ` call the doctor . she ' s got a swollen appendix . ' ' after checking the blood in the machine , pesh pushed megan out of the exam room and headed down the hall . ` ` go with him , ' ' kristi said , as she climbed onto the gurney . megan hurried down the hall to catch up with pesh . he pressed the button on the elevator before looking over at her . ` ` stay with me , okay ? we ' re going to get you into surgery , and then you ' ll be good as new . ' ' ` ` are you sure ? ' ' she asked . without hesitation , pesh answered , ` ` yes , but you have to come with me . ' ' the elevator ' s doors slid open . as megan helped pesh push the gurney inside , she asked , ` ` can you turn on the lights ? ' ' megan furrowed her brow in confusion as she looked over to pesh . ` ` we ' re getting in the elevator to take you to the hospital for surgery , ' ' she explained . ` ` but it ' s too dark , ' ' mary said , closing her eyes . her head droppedto the left , all the numbers on the monitor were ringing in megan ' s ears . ` ` dammit , she ' s dead ! ' ' pesh shouted . ice - cold fear worked its way from the top of megan ' s head all the way down her spine . a man was coming down the stairs without the wheeled gurney . what the hell were they going to do ? ` ` push the lever , ' ' pesh ordered . megan ' s shaking hands fumbled with the lever . when it was released , pesh brought his hands to mary ' s chest and began pushing . without waiting to be told , megan leaned forward , grabbed mary ' s neck , and began breathing into her mouth . they worked in perfect unison . ` ` stay with me , mary ! ' ' pesh ordered , as his hands moved at a steady pace up and down on mary ' s chest . looking up from her monitor , megan eyed the woman . ` ` no time . ' ' when pesh ' hadn ' t moved , she checked her breathing again . with the taste of something sour on her tongue , she pulled away . blood poured out of mary ' s nose . ` ` there ' s more here than the blood .she ' s bleeding from the head . ' ' pesh . ##n ' t even acknowledge her injury . ` ` the seat belt and airbag could have caused an internal bleeding as well . there ' s nothing we can do . ' ' regardless , he went straight ahead with his story . the elevator doors opened , and megan saw the concerned faces of the medical staff . when the doctor stepped forward , she shook her head . ` ` she ' s dead . ' ' pesh sat across from her . ` ` no , she really isn ' t . we have to keep going . get a doctor in here . ' ' the doctor checked the stats on the monitor . ` ` i ' don ' t think that will work . ' '
