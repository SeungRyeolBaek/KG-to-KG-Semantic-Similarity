` ` i texted my mom to tell her i was spending the night at emma ' s . ' ' before he could say anything , she quickly added , ` ` thank you for putting my stuff in the car . that was very nice of you . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' he replied . then he thought of her question . ` ` ' you ' re staying at aidan and emma ' s ? ' ' after all , the last thing he wanted was to see her there - a reminder of what he could ' ' not have . it would be enough to drive any woman crazy . megan shook her head . ` ` would you mind if i stayed here tonight ? ' ' when he went to open his door , she shook her head . ` ` i said no funny business . i just really don ' t want to go home yet . if you ' d ' aidan want to have to stay , you can take me to emma ' s . ' ' ` ` of course you can stay . ' ' ` ` i can sleep on the couch or in the living room . ' ' he shook his head . ` ` you ' ll sleep in here . ' ' he walked over to his large king - size bed . he turned down the television . henot to her . ` ` come on . maybe some sleep will make you feel better . ' ' she eyed him warily . ` ` i really do can ' t share your bed . that would be rude . ' ' ` ` ` ` don ' t go . i promise . ' ' ` ` ' if you ' re sure ? ' ' ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' slowly , she began walking over to him , her eyes never leaving his . she sank down onto the bed , slipping under the covers . when she was naked , he picked her up . when he started to rise , she reached out to grab his arm . ` ` no , ' ` n ' t go . do don ' t leave me here . ' ' his eyebrows shot up in surprise . ` ` you want me to stay with you ? ' ' ` ` yes , please . ' ' ` ` in this bed . . . with you ? ' ' when she nodded , he took a deep breath . ` ` megan , i do don ' t think that ' s a good idea . ' ' ` ` do don ' t overthink it ; ` stay with me . ' ' although his brain was at war with him to make the logical and rational decision , he said ,` ` give me a few minutes . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she said quietly . reluctantly , he went into the bathroom . he decided t ' even bother looking in the mirror because he was pretty sure he would t ' not like what he saw . quickly , he took off his jacket and tie . although he probably should have put on some clothes , he left his tie on and grabbed a clean shirt from the closet . after pulling it over his head , he walked back out into the bedroom . megan lay on her side on the bed , her face turned toward the ceiling . her eyes were closed , but they flew open the moment he entered the room . without a word to her , he walked to the other side of the bed and climbed in . lying on his back , he stretched one arm over his head . his other hand rested on his stomach . he dug his fingers into the fabric of his shirt over his head . maybe he needed to stop the heart beat . just when he thought she might be asleep , megan rolled over to face him . ` ` you ' re pretty far gone , ' ' she said . ` ` i thought it was for the best . ' ' the corners of her mouth slowly turned up into a smile . then she lookednot to him . he sucked in a breath and tried not to smile when he felt her head rest against his chest . before he could stop her , she had wrapped her arm around him . still , she didn ##n ' t say anything else . and after a few minutes , her steady breathing signaled she had fallen asleep . pesh stared up at the ceiling and allowed himself to be able to drift to sleep as well . then , as megan ' s soft sigh vibrated against his chest , his eyelids grew heavy . for the first time in ten years , he fell asleep with her in his arms . chapter seven sunlight streamed across megan ' s face , forcing her to squeeze her eyes tightly shut against the blinding glare . she was warm and safe , and she didn ##n ' t want to wake up . but the illusion of her sleep was shattered when a deep voice came from beside her . it was far too familiar to be one of aidan ' s . alarm worked its way up her spine . where am i ? her eyes quickly scanned the room . overwhelmed by the familiar feel and scent , she realized she was in a man ' s house , and more than one man ' s bed . she certainly hadn ' t woken up this morningand ever since she woke up for the last time . she could couldn ' t even remember what time it was . this was bad . very , very bad . she had to get out of here and get back to nick . what kind of person was she to wake up in a strange man ' s bed ? when she tried to roll over , she found herself stopped by a strong arm wrapped around her waist . her gaze slid down to the lean , muscular body .
