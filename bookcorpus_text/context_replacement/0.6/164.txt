i go over to my bed and grab my pillow and throw it down as hard as i can onto the floor . no . i don ' t . have . i . ever . had . feelings . for . that . guy . i swear . i throw the pillow down again and again until i ' m out of bed . it ' s finally time for me to move on . chapter twelve ` ` you look great , ' ' my mother says as i enter the kitchen , giving her a hug . ` ` oh . . . ' ' i say , rolling my eyes . ` ` yeah , you too ! where are you two going tonight ? ' ' ` ` ' mirabelle . ' ' ` ` wow - how romantic ! ' ' ` ` it ' s not our first date , right ? so don ' t get too excited . ' ' i watch as nate and pierce emerge from the living room . ` ` i just have a bad feeling about this guy , that ' s all . ' ' she says , handing him a glass of wine , ` ` and he ' s picking you up , right ? ' ' ` ` so , do you have a date tonight , brynn ? ' ' nate asks , raising his eyebrows at my mother . ` ` no ,' ' i nod , not wanting to make a big deal out of it . ` ` greg ! the guy from your office , ' ' my mom introduces him . ` ` oh , yeah . you know , i remember seeing you two working together in the conference room last week , and thinking to myself , ' those two would make a great couple . ' ' ' i smile and my mom nods again . it ' s amazing how quickly things have gone back to normal since that video was on youtube . for over a week , a group of people waited just outside the door , but they all left when the crowd died down . greg told them he has been working to discover the killer ' s identity , and that everything will go back to normal . except for nate and i . . . ` ` ' it ' ll just be the two of us for dinner tonight , ' ' my mom says . ` ` yes , please . i ' m going out tonight , as usual , ' ' nate says quickly . i have to resist the urge to glare at him . ` ` why ? ' ' my mom asks . ` ` nate , you should ' ve let me know about your plans . how many times have i had this conversation with you ? responsibility , responsibility ,sorry , ' ' he says as he walks to the door . i glance at my mom , but she ' s looking down at her clip ##board . ` ` thanks , dad , ' ' nate says quietly . ` ` it ' s nothing , nate , ' ' my mom says quietly . finally , the doorbell rings and i quickly excuse myself . angry as i am at nate , i really don t ' not want to hear his dad speak to him in such a harsh tone . i walk down the stairs to the foyer , and find my mom and dad watching me . i smile . i was hoping i ' d get to the door without them even noticing - without nate , actually . i look at greg as i open the door . he ' s wearing a blue shirt and tie , and looks a little nervous . ` ` hey , greg , ' ' i greet him . ` ` greg ! it ' s so nice to meet you , ' ' my mom says from behind me , forcing me to open the door all the way . ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' he says , extending his hand . ` ` mrs . thornhill , ' ' greg replies politely . i see nate standing at the door to the living room, leaning back against the door and saying nothing . he glances at me when i catch his eye . i glare at him and turn away . ` ` have her home by midnight , ' ' pierce tells greg . ` ` yes , sir , ' ' greg replies . pierce taps him on the shoulder just as i ' m about to leave . ` ` ' don ' t worry , greg , i ' m just giving you a little advice . ' ' ` ` well , you had me for a minute there , ' ' greg says , sighing in relief . ` ` well , we should get going , ' ' i lean in so that he ' s ' i have the chance to make any more dirty comments . ` ` see you later ! ' ' i say , pulling the door shut behind me . i barely catch nate ' s concerned look as i close the door . ` ` you okay ? ' ' greg asks as we walk to his car . i force a smile and shake my head . ` ` yeah , sorry ! my mind wandered for a minute . so , have you ever been to this place before ? ' ' greg chose a really nice italian restaurant for our dinner , it ' s a nice , well lit restaurant up in the mountainsof course . the entire staff is very excited about their work , and eager to have a young woman on a table that they can talk to . ` ` so , how is it going for your stepdad ? ' ' greg asks with a smile . ` ` you know , it ' s not that bad . i hardly ever think much about it , though . he ' s all the way at the top of the company , and i ' m all the way at the bottom , so we just talk on a day - to - day basis .
