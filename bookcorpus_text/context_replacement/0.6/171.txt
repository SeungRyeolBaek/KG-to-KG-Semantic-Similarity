when nate comes back out , he smiles when he sees me struggling to fit it in between the straps of my sports bra . ` ` want some more ? ' he asks . ` ` . . . please , ' ' i reply , pretending i ' m anything but . the thought of nate ' s hands on me , when i know nothing else is going to happen , is like torture . i might only be getting a third - degree burn , but he ' s already taking the bottle from me and pouring half of it out into his hand . ` ` um , just pull the bottom of your shirt up , ' ' he tells me . i do as he says , pulling it up to my chest . i feel his warm - up fingers slip under the straps of my bra , and am surprised he ' doesn ' t notice the blush that quickly spreads across my cheeks . i take a deep breath , trying to keep my raging hormones at bay , as his fingers move to the base of my ribcage . ` ` now you tell me , ' ' he says , as i remove my bra . ` ` that ' s what she said , ' ' i reply . ` ` ha ! ' ' nate laughs , a loud , hard .of course . ` ` i know ##n ' i know you do , brynn , ' ' he says , smiling down at me . ` ` there ' s a lot you probably don ' t know about me . ' ' i pause , unable to meet his eyes for a long moment . i clear my throat and take the bottle of water from him , forcing myself to keep my hands steady . he nods , then turns around and pulls off his shirt . i groan inwardly at the sight of his bare , muscular chest . where are our clothes ? i need some sort of distance between us . but there are no signs of any cars pulling into the parking lot anytime soon , so i slowly rub the soap onto my hand and then begin to spread it across his chest . i slowly spread it all the way up to his neck , between his shoulder blades - to the thick cords of muscle there , down his back , and then down to the waistband of his boxer shorts , my hand slipping up to his waistband . i hear him suck in a little breath of air , and feel the hard length of his erection through his jeans . he ' s working hard to hold back , i can tell . ` ` well , well well ! ' ' i say .smile , and i hand him the phone . nate slips his hand into the back of his jeans and begins to rub it on his face . i keep my eyes fixed on the night sky . ` ` they said how long they were going to stay ? ' ' ` ` nope , my mom just called - ' ' i break off when i hear my phone start to ring in my pocket on the front porch . ` ` i think that ' s her number . hey , mom , ' ' i tell her as i answer the call . ` ` hey , mom . ' ' ` ` what ' s up ? ' ' i ask , immediately hearing concern in her voice . ` ` oh , it ' s nothing , but i wo ##n ' ve been able to get out of the house long enough to go out tonight . i ' m just going to head down to the beach now , so at least you and i can have lunch together . ' ' ` ` so , should we - ' ' ` ` no , you guys go ahead and have lunch , okay ? we ' ll see you later for dinner . ' ' ` ` yeah , okay , if you ' re sure , ' ' i say , smiling . i feel nate beside me , hishis paddle is in the water . ` ` your dad is caught up in work today , and my mom ' s going to go meet him at the restaurant for dinner , but they ' re not here . they said we should all come if we wanted , ' ' i say as i stand up . ` ` since we ' re here , ' ' nate says with a smile . ` ` you ever been out here before ? ' ' ` ` never been here at all . ' ' ` ` well , you ' ll love it , ' ' he says , starting up his paddle . ` ` ' the power of the uva boat today . ' ' i laugh . in short order , we ' re up on the beach in a giant wave . with nate ' s expert paddle skills , we easily cross the shallow , clear water and head toward the open water . ` ` you ' ll get the hang of it , ' ' nate tells me , and i turn around to look back at him . ` ` i think i ' m just getting you started , nate , ' ' i say , trying to get the hang of how to get the paddle in the water at the same time . ` ` well , i have a lot more experience than you' a river , ' ' he explains . ` ` we used to boat for fun on the river in high school , but we were a lot closer then to the ocean . we ' d see downtown , the city and . . . you ' d be amazed at the things you could see out there , though , ' ' he tells me as he pulls us out and into the potomac . ` ` i was so far away from everything , ' ' i say as the sounds of traffic are completely swallowed up by the trees growing on either side of us .
