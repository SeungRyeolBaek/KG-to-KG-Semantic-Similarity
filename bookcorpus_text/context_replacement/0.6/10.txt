` ` i just got carried away . with you not working anymore , the old pr and pr side of me let go . and with my help , i was able to get everything completely organized . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` everything was great . you waited so long to throw this party that it made sense you might go a little crazy . ' ' emma wrinkled her nose . ` ` i never wanted to be one of those girls who threw the over - the - top party . ' ' when casey started to open her mouth , megan held her back . ` ` it ' s all done with you , right ? ' ' emma nodded . ` ` they do the catering , too . ' ' ` ` ' i guess you ' re far from being a momzilla - girl . . . for now . ' ' casey nodded . ` ` i ' ll still be at mason ' s eighteenth birthday party . ' ' with a sigh , emma said , ` ` okay . ' ' when she didn ' ' t see mason , megan quickly excused herself and went outside . she really don ' t like the idea of him being invited to the house . but with everyone around , it was far too quiet for her comfort . just then her head began to hurt, she joined him on her father ' s arm . the two of them sat at one of the tables under the shade of a palm tree . several of her three older brothers sat around them , playing on their psps and other hand - held instruments . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' she asked . ` ` we ' re fine , mama , ' ' papa replied . ` ` let me know if it gets to be too much . ' ' shaking his head , he asked , ` ` are you trying to say i ' m boring or something ? ' ' ` ` no , not at all . he ' s not boy enough for me . ' ' papa waved her off with a hand wrinkled with age and wisdom . ` ` go ahead and enjoy yourself . i ' ll keep an eye on him . ' ' she smiled and leaned over to kiss his bearded cheek . ` ` thanks , papa . ' ' he returned her kiss . ` ` you know , if you ' re enjoying yourself , you might wanna spend a little time with the boys . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . was papa going to set her up with pesh like he had with emma ? he gave her a warm smile . ` ` ' good for both of you . ' '` ` um , okay . okay , then , ' ' she said , as she turned around . although she hated to admit it , she had been looking forward to talking to pesh tonight . she had tried to convince herself that she really hadn ' t just been scanning the crowd for him when she was taking in all of emma ' s friends . when she did finally catch sight of him , her own heart skipped a beat . she ' didn ' t know if her body gave a damn , but it pissed her off that her heart was affected by him as well . he ' d removed his suit jacket along with his tie . with the top button of his shirt undone , she could see a hint of dark chest hair . she bit her lip at the sight . she was a sucker for chest hair . her gaze dropped down to take in how the sleeves of his dress shirt had been rolled up to his elbows , giving her a glimpse of his bulging biceps . casey had been so right - he was built like a freaking shithouse . megan wanted nothing more than to become better acquainted with his body , especially with the clothes on him . at the sound of emma ' s voice behind her , she turned . ` ` ready to go ? ' ' emma asked . `` um , okay . ' ' emma gave her a puzzled look before looking in pesh ' s direction . ` ` ` ' ##n ' t you want pesh to meet you at aidan ' s and my place ? he ' ' ' i know a lot of people , and i would hate to see him hook up with the girls . ' ' megan furrowed her brow in confusion . ` ` are you sure ? ' ' ` ` why would ##n ' t i be ? ' ' with a smile , megan replied , ` ` i really don ' t know . ' because you do . ' not at the expense of you getting to know him . ' ' emma shook her head . ` ` i never said i did don ' t want you getting to get to know each other - never said i did don ' t want you asking him for a date . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help rolling her eyes . ` ` the night out ain ' t over yet . i could always call on my powers of persuasion and force pesh into a night of raw passion . ' ' emma looked at her in confusion before bursting out laughing . ` ` raw sex ? those girls and pesh would never , ever go together in the same sentence . ' ' `` are you saying that you and aidan have never had a relationship ? ' ' ` ` aidan and pesh are not in the same category of men . i like aidan , but he ' s not really a man . pesh is . ' ' ` ` yeah , but you ' re a man , ' ' megan teased . ` ` only in the bedroom , but she ' s one hell of a woman in the bedroom , ' ' aidan whispered to them . emma laughed , turning around to face him . ` ` i could see you , ' ' she teased . while aidan laughed , megan shook her head .
