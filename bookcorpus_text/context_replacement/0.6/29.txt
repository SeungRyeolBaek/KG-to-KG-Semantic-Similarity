when pesh finished , he placed the empty vial in the plastic bag and then looked over at mr . robertson . ` ` if the swelling still hasn ' t started to fade in the next ten to fifteen minutes , we ' re going to have to take another course of action . ' ' ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' mr . robertson asked , with a frown . ` ` ' the rest of the body . ' ' mr . robertson shuddered visibly . ` ` ` yeah , she said that . ' ' she said the man she called megan was a piece of work . pesh turned to look at megan . ` ` ' she made a phone call . ' ' he quickly checked his phone that was turned off . ` ` keep an eye on him . i ' ll be back in ten . ' ' ` ` yes , you will . ' ' time went by very slowly as she checked on megan and kept an eye on mr . robertson . every few minutes , he was pulling up the sheet to reveal his arm . every time he moved , megan saw that the iv was wasn ' t working and the swelling still hadn ' t gone down . when pesh entered the room again , he wasfrom her to mr . mckenzie . ` ` ' how are we doing ? ' ' she shook her head . ` ` things change . ' ' ` ` i see . ' ' she walked over to a cabinet and dug through it , finding a very large vial with a very long needle . ` ` i ' m sorry , mr . robertson , but it looks like this is our only chance . ' ' mr . robertson visibly relaxed for the first time that day . ` ` mr . mckenzie , may i ask you to help me ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` of course . ' ' ` ` i need you to physically lift him . i want him to be as gentle as possible . ' ' megan resisted the urge to roll her eyes at his words . mr . robertson had to lift her by a hundred pounds , not to mention that when you got your blood pumping , you got even stronger . so she did as she was told . when pesh pressed the needle to mr . mckenzie ' s skin , she pressed her hands hard into his chest . when the needle pierced the skin , it took everything in her to keep him on the ground . clenching her teeth , she held her breath . finally , when the last of the blood had gonefinally , she was able to loosen her grip . pesh dropped the pills into the plastic bag and then turned around . ` ` i suggest you take some pills for easing the pain and for the anti - inflammatory effect . i would also recommend a day or two of putting an ice pack on your head . it would be my best recommendation that you not take any sexual dysfunction medication until you can take it . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' mr . robertson said , climbing back onto the bed . ` ` give him about thirty minutes , and then he needs to go straight home . we ' ll use the waiting room , ' ' pesh said . ` ` yes , we will . ' ' he gave her a reassuring smile before leaving the room . after thirty minutes , she followed mr . robertson to the front of the hospital . when she walked into the exam room , she shook her head . ` ` megan , ' ' kristi said . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` go home and take your bed right now . ' ' ` ` are you sure ? i mean , you can sleep on it since we ' re so busy . ' ' kristi shook her head . ` ` we ' re busy . ', you ' re going to need all your strength . things are just going to get even worse when the sun goes down . ' ' megan tried not to be depressed by the thought . instead , she went into the living room to grab her purse . when she came out , pesh was waiting for her . ` ` where are you going ? ' ' ` ` oh , it ' s my lunch date . ' ' pesh offered an apologetic smile . ` ` how sweet . it ' s just ... well . ' ' realizing what he was doing , she quickly shook her head back and forth . ` ` ' oh . ' ' still crossing his arms over his chest , pesh asked , ` ` and how would it make any difference if we were to go to the restaurant at the same time and eat at the same table ? ' ' ` ` you ' re losing me , and you know it . ' ' ` ` after what we have just shared , how can you deny me the pleasure of eating your food ? ' ' a mischievous light appeared in his dark eyes - one she still wasn ' t used to seeing from him . for some reason , she found it completely irresistible . ` ` megan , how can i not have you on my mind when ito hold a man ' s heart in my hand ? ' ' her eyes widened in shock at his words . ` ` wait - did you really just do that ? ' ' ` ` yes , i think i did . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` ' i don ' t understand you guys . ' ' ` ` ' don ' t try to see me as one way or the other . just see me as i am , ' ' pesh said . ` ` i ' ll try . ' ' as they walked to the elevator , megan bit her lip with apprehension . turning to pesh she asked , ` ` what will they think if they see the two of us together ? ' '
