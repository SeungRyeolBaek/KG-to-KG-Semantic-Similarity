i look out the window next to the door and see eileen walking up the steps . ` ` hi , ' ' i say quietly . she descends the steps and i close the door . ` ` hi , ' ' she says quietly , smoothing her hair . ` ` do i look okay ? ' ' ` ` you look great , ' ' i tell her . i can ##uld ' t imagine how she must feel , finally seeing her mother face - to - face after all these years . she looks around the house . ` ` wow , this place is even bigger than it looks from here . ' ' ` ` i know . it ' s beautiful , ' ' i say , and lead her into the den . ` ` she and my mom are having a late dinner , but they ' ll be gone for a while , ' ' i tell her . she bites her lip , and takes a seat on the couch . ` ` i ' ll send nate up , okay ? i still haven ' t told him anything . . . i ' don ' t think he would think that . ' ' she nods , and i go to the den . ` ` hey , nate ? ' ' i knock , and hear his bedroom door open . ` ` you ' ll come down to the den? ' ' i feel a stab of fear when he replies quickly , ` ` yes ! be right back , ' ' and i hear him moving away . i really don ' t like the idea of setting a trap and talking to him , but i know that it ' s in the name of a higher purpose , that of the true nature of his parents ' relationship , and his father ' s death . we walk back into the house , and stand quietly next to the couch where eileen ' s sitting . she turns when we hear nate coming up the stairs , and then he turns the corner and sees us . his face is a mask as he surveys the scene before him . he takes a step forward , looking like he ' s going to say something , and then steps back . ` ` nate , it ' s me , your father , ' ' eileen says . ` ` i know who you are , ' ' nate says quietly . he turns to me . ` ` you hear this ? ' ' ` ` i think you should hear what she has to say . please , can you just listen for a minute ? ' ' nate ' s face twists into a grimace - an expression i really haven ' t seen in years . ` ` you ' re right , '' he growls at me , and storms out the front door , slamming it behind him . eileen breaks off with a loud scream , and i run after him . ` ` nate ! ' ' i yell as i slam the door behind me and run up the porch steps . he ' s coming around the side of the house , obviously heading for the garage and his car to make his escape . ` ` would you just listen to me for a minute ? ' ' ` ` why ? so you can try to turn my mom against my parents even more ? ' ' he asks , turning back . ` ` i ' m going to tell you the truth about him ! eileen can help you - ' ' ` ` okay , so this is all about you ! you can try to use this as a good way of getting a mother and daughter to talk , but no , this is all about getting me to believe your lies , ' ' he spins around and starts to walk back across the yard . ` ` no ! that ' s not true ! ' ' i shout , following him . ` ` your mom is a good person - i want to protect her , and you . ' ' ` ` you ' re crazy , you know that ? ' ' he asks , turning around again .` ` stop teasing me . whatever plans we had together this morning , it ' s over . ' ' ` ` what ? nate , i - ' ' i feel like someone just punched me in the stomach . how could this all go so wrong ? ` ` i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i ' ve dated , but you ' re different , okay ? from now on , let ' s just look at each other , from across the room at social functions , like our stepsiblings do . ' ' ` ` no , nate ! we were friends , we are . ' ' ` ` you ' re only friends because i was your girlfriend . ' don ' t worry about it , you ' ll get over it eventually . you are nothing compared to me , brynn , ' ' he says and walks to the driver ' s side door . i watch in horror as i hear the front door swing open and his car come back around . i watch him walk down the driveway , then disappear around the corner . i hear the front door slam behind me , and eileen hugs me . ` ` i ' m so sorry , brynn , this is all my fault . ' ' ` ` no , it ' s not , ' ' i say ,biting my lip to keep from crying . she wraps her arms around me . ` ` he ' s just stubborn . he ' ll come to his senses . ' ' ` ` no , he ' s just as stubborn as i am . he ' s so sad . ' ' i lean against her , burying my face in her shoulder as i begin to cry . ` ` ' it always gets the better , ' ' she says as she strokes my hair . ` ` come on - your dad wo ##ll ' t be home for a while . i ' ll make you some tea .
