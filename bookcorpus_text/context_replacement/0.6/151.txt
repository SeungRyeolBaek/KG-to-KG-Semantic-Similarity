i open my eyes . i wipe the water off me with my hands and look back toward the house squinting against the sun on my face . a flash of light from the second story window catches my attention . there ' s a figure standing there , pulling the curtain back . at first i think it ' s nate - it ' s his brother , i think - but then i see a flash of dark hair . must be his brother jackson . i roll onto my back and dive back under the water . i want nate to be the one with me . i was never really into sports , but i ' ve always wondered if i ' d be any good at them . i float off for the next few seconds and then pull my body up from the deep end , gasping for air . i take the towel back out of the water and walk over to my bedroom and peel off my shirt , then toss it onto the bed and sit down on it . i can feel the towel clinging to my skin , and water collecting in my belly button . i hear the door to the house open behind me and shield my eyes from the sun as i turn around to see who it is . nate walks out of the house , his face split in a wide grin . ` ` hey , youplease meet brynn . i ' m jackson , one of nate ' s best friends . ' ' ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' i say as we shake hands . i see nate from behind , standing just inside the door and getting ready to step a foot toward the pool . ` ` come on , nate , let ' s go in . i ' ve been thinking about this girl for weeks . ' ' ` ` we should ##n ' t bother her , she needs to be happy , ' ' nate says quietly . he takes off his shirt , and i look down at my crossed fingers in my lap . he ' s got a great body . maybe not as good as nate ' s , but whose better ? he takes off his flip - flop and walks in , his feet barely touching mine . nate slowly walks toward the pool across from me , and takes off his shirt . i watch his chest muscles flex as he pulls it over his shoulders . ` ` nate and i grew up playing pool together , ' ' he says , walking to the edge of the pool and leaning his elbows onto the railing in front of him . ` ` really ? wow , ' ' i say , as nate sits on the deep end . ` ` are youyou go to school here ? ' ' ` ` yup . uva - i mean , of course you know that . ' ' ` ` which school are you from ? ' ' he asks , pushing his dark hair out of his eyes . ` ` i ' m sorry . it ' s late , and i ' m just pretty busy with work . um , where do you live ? ' ' nate steps up next to him . they are quite a pair , nate with his blue eyes and alec with his dark brown hair . ` ` you and ##a got any food yet ? ' ' nate asks . ` ` ' we just got here . remember , you ' re not supposed to eat for thirty minutes after you swim . ' ' ` ` yeah , ' ' nate and i both join in . we look at each other as he speaks . ` ` you ' re not supposed to eat for thirty minutes either . ' would ##n ' t it be okay to eat after you swim ? ' ' ` ` i dunno , ' ' he says , giving me a blindingly bright smile . ` ` i thought that was the point . ' ' i find myself smiling back at him . he has this natural charm that ' s infectious . ` ` i ' m pretty hungrythat ' s a story they made up so they ' d have time to eat their own food without the kids eating theirs . ' ' i nod . ` ` ah that makes perfect sense . you grew up around here ? ' ' he asks me . ` ` yeah , on the north shore . ' ' ` ` oh , yeah . my dad has a beach house there . i love being out there . swimming in the ocean and everything . you go there a lot ? ' ' ` ` um , not really , ' ' i reply . nate gets off the board and starts to walk back and forth with me . i think he ' s trying not to make it easy on his injured leg . ` ` we should go out more . go swim with him , ' ' he says , looking around him . ` ` sounds good . ' ' ` ` he is , though isn ' t he ? ' ' it feels good to be able to talk about nate with someone who knows him . and he can swim . ` ` was he always like that ? ' ' ` ` oh god , yeah . we ' re like , ten years old , playing soccer for our school team , and i was always trying to warn him off during . ' ' he was always sofull on , full out . ' ' alec and i laugh together . i see nate engage in his conversation , but i ' don ' t think he can hear us . ` ` do you still play lacrosse ? ' ' ` ` naw , i ' haven ' t really got the energy to keep up with it . it was great in high school , but you have to be able to do it in college . what sport do you play ? ' ' ` ` uh , lacrosse . ' '
