when he finished , pesh gently pushed him back down on the chair . as he walked out of the dining room , pesh nervously glanced at the others . ` ` excuse me , ' ' he said , slowly getting out of his chair . he made his way down the hall . he didn ' ' t have to look around for megan - she was in the master bedroom with the door closed . he knocked softly on the door . when she said don ' t answer , he walked over and opened the door . he found her sitting on the edge of the bed with her head in her hands . he walked over and sat down next to her . gently , he placed his hand on her shoulder . ` ` i ' m sorry for not setting him straight and telling him i really ain ' t his mother . he was so upset , and ' ' didn ' t want to upset him . ' ' with her elbows resting on her knees , megan turned her head to look at him . tears streamed down her cheeks . ` ` you think i ' m upset with you ? ' ' he shook his head . she stifled a laugh . ` ` oh pesh , you ' re so sweet sometimes ! ' ' he pulled back at her tears . ` ` tell me? ' ' ` ` just when you think i ' don ' t love you enough , you go and say something like that . ' ' before he could process her words , she launched herself at him , kissing his cheek and neck . she left his lap and pressed her lips to his neck . ` ` you really love him , ` don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` of course i do . ' ' ` ` you could see yourself more as a father to him ? ' ' ` ` yes , i could . but what - ' ' she silenced him with a kiss . it was one that was filled with conflicting emotions . he wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her close to him . just as he was about to end the kiss , she pulled back . ` ` you love me enough , ` don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` you should have no hesitation on that score . ' ' ` ` you love me enough to be a father to him ? ' ' her question caused him to suck in a sharp breath . he felt like he had been punched in the stomach . ` ` yes , i could - i would have . ' ' she shook her head at him and smiled . ` ` ` marry me . ' ' ` ` 'please ? ' ' pressing her mouth to his , she whispered against his lips , ` ` marry me . make me your husband . ' ' at that moment , he thanked god he was sitting up because if he ' e ' er were , he was pretty sure he would ' ve done something incredibly stupid like that . he suddenly doubted both his sanity and his sanity . had megan just spoken to him ? no , he was confused . ` ` did you just ask me to marry you ? ' ' he asked her . smiling , megan shook her head . ` ` i wish you could see your face right now . i should be mad . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . it ' s just you and me . ' ' she cupped his face in her hands . ` ` i ' m afraid i ' n ' er have a ring , and i should ne ' er get down on one knee , ' ' she playfully teased . he brought his hands up to clasp hers . ` ` you ' re getting married ? ' ' ` ` yes , i am . ' ' lowering his head , he gently kissed the back of her hand . ` ` i love you so much , megan , and i want nothing more than to give you myplease . ' ' ` ` ` is that a problem ? ' ' ` ` i just want to make sure you know what you ' re doing . one minute you ' re in the living room , laughing with your friends , and then the next you ' re in bed , and come running to me . and let ' s not forget how upset you have been the whole time i ' ve told you about being too young to get married . ' ' megan ' s mouth turned down into a frown . ` ` ` can ' t a woman change her mind ? ' ' ` ` yes , of course , but i just want to make sure this is really what you want . ' ' tears sparkled in her blue eyes . ` ` you are everything i could ever want in a woman . you love me , you watch out for me , you want the best for me . if that would be enough to make me want to hate you , you love my son . you watch out for him and you want the best for him . i could ##n ' t ever imagine loving anyone more than i love you . i just don ' t imagine wanting to be anyone else ' s wife except you . ' ' she paused . ` ` i was so alone for so long . i couldcouldn ' t believe that someone like me could ever love someone like you . but you never gave up on me . if you give me the chance , i ' ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy . ' ' pesh could couldn ' t stop the pounding of his heart . he was sure that his heart rate and blood pressure were off the charts at this point . he cupped her face . ` ` nothing in the world would make me happier than for us to be married . ' ' ` ` ` we ' re married ? ' ' ` ` yes , we are . ' '
