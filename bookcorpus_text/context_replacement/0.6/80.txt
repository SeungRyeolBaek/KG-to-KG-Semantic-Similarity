` ` i ' m lavani . it ' s nice to meet you . ' ' ` ` nice meeting you , too , ' ' megan said . the room immediately fell into an awkward silence . pesh looked around , for someone to say something . his mother cleared her throat . ` ` i ' ll go and clean up here . ' ' as she walked into the kitchen , shveta followed her , along with arjan ' s mother . since it was necessary for her to be in the kitchen , pesh thought it to be best megan was with the family . ' ' couldn ' t happen without her , mom . ` ` should i stay and try to help ? ' ' she asked , in a whisper . ` ` sure . that would be great . ' ' her eyes told him that she really did ' ' not want to leave his side , but she left anyway . once she was out of sight , pesh felt everyone ' s eyes on him . ` ` what ? ' ' charlie asked . ` ` you really want to ask , my man ? ' ' ` ` ' ask your mother and get it over with before megan comes back in here , ' ' he said , as he sank onto the couch . he had a lot of questions fromwhere they were , how long they had been seeing each other , and how bad was it . he used as much patience as he could to tell them everything . when he was done , the men sat there in stunned silence . ` ` i never thought i would see the day , ' ' his father said . sanjay shook his head . ` ` no , i knew the day would come . i knew that when i was dancing with emma . ' ' charlie ' s brow furrowed . ` ` emma ? ' ' pesh squeezed his eyes shut and wished his brother - in - law didn ' ' t have such a vague answer . ` ` just a friend . ' ' with a sigh , sanjay said , ` ` you never ' ##n ' ever look at her like she was a whore , even if she was pregnant . ' ' ` ` you danced with a pregnant woman ? ' ' charlie asked . ` ` alpesh how could you ? ' ' his mother asked from the couch . ` ` how could i what ? ' ' pesh asked . lavani ' s face was horror stricken . ` ` bring a man . . . into the living room . ' ' pesh jumped off the couch . he looked from his mother to where megan stood . ` ` you' but . . . ? ' ' he could ##n ' t even say the word . megan ' s face turned bright red . ` ` no ! of course , i ' m not ! ' ' lavani gave him a stern look . ` ` ' her , ' ' she repeated , looking at megan . ` ` this emma that sanjay spoke of . ' ' putting his hand to his forehead , he rubbed it to try to ward off the headache that was starting to form in his temples . everything was just going to happen so fast . ` ` first of all , emma and i were never together . she was dumped by the guy she is now married to . sure , i took her to the beach with sanjay and shveta , but there was nothing sexual between us . ' ' he shook his head and could couldn ' t help wondering if he would ever have to stop remembering what had happened between him and emma . ` ` second of all , could everyone please back off for a minute ? i mean , you ' re not exactly giving megan a very good idea of our relationship . ' ' a nervous giggle escaped from megan ' s lips . she covered her mouth with her hand , trying to hide her smile . he looked at her , and she put her hand to herdamn him . ` ` okay , then . now that we ' ve cleared all that up , what ' ' ' do we eat ? ' ' lavani said . ` ` that sounds good , ' ' charlie said . as they made their way into the dining room , pesh came to megan ' s side . ` ` you free today ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` i ' m hanging in there . i just need a drink when we eat . ' ' ` ` ` ' ' ##ware for you , ' ' he said . without the others hearing her , megan touched his arm . ` ` sorry , ' ' she muttered under her breath . he smiled as he pulled out the chair for megan . ` ` thank you , ' ' she said , sitting down . he quickly slid in beside her . as the others were making their way to the table , he felt megan beside him . when he looked at her in confusion , she asked , ` ` where is the food ? ' ' ` ` we eat with our hands . ' ' ` ` seriously ? ' ' ` ` seriously . ' ' he leaned down to whisper in her ear . ` ` ' ' ' ' you use your left hand because it ' s so rude . ' ' she whispered back to hiswide - eyed at him . ` ` i ' m going out , ' ' she said . he resisted the urge to look at her again . he could tell that she would rather die than do something to hurt him in front of his family . ` ` you ' ll be fine . they wo ##n ' t get too much out of you since you ' re here . ' ' ` ` alpesh , what is it that you ' re talking about ? ' ' lavani asked , narrowing her eyes at him . ` ` i was just telling megan what a great cook you are . she loves italian food , so i ' m sure she ' s up for a treat . ' '
