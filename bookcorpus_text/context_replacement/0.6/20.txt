she ' d made a complete fool out of herself the night before , and he still wanted to date her ? ` ` you ' ll ' ' be serious . ' ' ` ` i promise . ' ' she gave a slight shake of her head . ` ` i ' ##n ' t think that is a good idea . ' ' ` ` ' why ? ' ' he asked softly . with a slight shrug , she said , ` ` ' ##n ' is it obvious ? ' ' ` ` if you ' re referring to the fact you both got drunk last night and then fell unconscious , that has no relevance to me . things happen , and i ' m mature enough to accept that . ' ' he closed the distance between them . ` ` i enjoyed being with you tonight . ' ' remembering what emma had said , megan could couldn ' t resist asking , ` ` you want to kiss me , ' don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` ` of course . what else would you want to do ? ' ' when she said , ` ` have sex , ' ' a blush stained his cheeks . ` ` that is not what i meant . ' ' ` ` and that ' s a lie . ' ' his brows rose . ` ` what do you mean ? '' ` ` you and i . . . we want different things . you want to date and get married someday , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , that is something i want very much . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` ` i ' don ' t want to be in a serious relationship right now with you or anyone for that matter . i ' m certainly not going to get married anytime soon . i just want to have some time with you . ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` i ' didn ' t think you would . ' ' ` ` what i want from you is the same thing you wanted last night . just sex , ' ' she answered honestly . ` ` you . ##n ' ` want to date and . . . you ' want to have sex with me ? ' ' if the situation outside hadn ' t been so dire , megan would ' ve laughed at the shocked look on pesh ' s face . he looked so shocked that she could even think of not using him as a sex toy . then , when she pulled herself together , she shook her head . ` ` i ' m sorry , but that ' s the way i feel . ' ' she braced herself for some kind of reaction out of him . maybe a slap . whathe really was even more beautiful . he gave her a sad smile . ` ` and i ' m glad you feel that way because i would have really enjoyed getting to know you better . ' ' without another word , he opened the door . ever the gentleman , he gestured for her to get in first . lowering her chin to her chest , she allowed him to walk to the car . once inside , he moved to open the passenger door for her . ` ` thank you , ' ' she whispered . he nodded before walking around the front of the car . without another word to her , pesh buckled up , and they began walking down the driveway . the drive to aidan and emma ' s took only ten minutes , but it seemed to take an eternity . the heavy silence settled heavy over her . pesh didn ' ' t look at her . instead , he kept his eyes focused on the road ahead of them . when they pulled into aidan and emma ' s driveway , megan felt her heart break . she wished there was some way to make things right between them . but she had a feeling she had gone too far and said too much . when he put the car in park , he turned to look at her . ` ` thank you for the ride , ' ' she whispered. ` ` you ' re welcome . it was my pleasure . ' ' ` ` first of all , i want to thank you for taking care of me last night . you really are above and beyond . i could never thank you enough . ' ' ` ` you ' ' ' you have to believe me . i ' m glad i was able to help you . ' ' chewing on her bottom lip , she finally allowed herself to reveal what she was holding back inside . ` ` i wish things could be different , ' ' she said quietly . when she forced herself to look at him , she found him staring down at her . ` ` i ' m sorry , aidan . take care of yourself . okay ? ' ' she shook her head . ` ` the same to you . ' ' with shaking hands , she reached for the door handle . when she was finally able to open the door , she stepped out onto the porch . as she made her way up the steps , she could feel pesh ' s eyes on her . the car was silent as she climbed the porch steps and rang the doorbell . she saw that megan was already there , and she definitely wasn ' t expecting the baby . aidan threw open the door . ` ` megan ? what the hell ? ' 'he asked . his question and answer caused her to burst into tears . ` ` why are you crying ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` it ' s a long story . ' ' he looked from her to the window to pesh ' s house . his eyes softened . ` ` did pesh hurt you ? ' ' ` ` no ! of course not . ' ' ` ` if he ' s making you cry , ' ' don ' t care whether he ' s aidan ' s father or not . i ' ll blow his brains out ! ' '
