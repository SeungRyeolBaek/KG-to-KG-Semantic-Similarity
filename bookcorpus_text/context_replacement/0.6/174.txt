` ` brynn , be careful ! and i really don ' t think that ' s poison gas , either . ' ' ` ` no , no ! no , it ' s just - ' ' i break off as i feel the ground beneath me give way . what i thought was solid ground is only an inch of rock . my heart leaps into my throat and i start to fall , the ground quickly becoming a blur . i kick and scream , desperately grabbing onto the rocks and branches below . ` ` brynn ! ' ' nate yells , and jumps into the darkness with me . i feel him grab my hand as i try to get a grip on the hard rock beneath me . my fingers frantically search for purchase and i start to panic . ` ` it ' s ok , it ' s ok , i ' ve got you , ' ' nate says . the calm in his voice forces me to look up at him . he ' s looking straight down at me , his eyes calm and steady . i take a deep breath and reach my right hand out . he takes it and starts to pull me up . ` ` on your right foot , there ' s a rock , ' ' he says , peering over the edge . ` ` ' don ' tlook up , and look for yourself . move an inch to your left . keep looking at me . ' ' the look in his eyes puzzles me , and i hesitate for a moment , then slowly begin to move my foot to the right . no . i hear my foot brush against something , and push my foot up and onto it . ` ` okay , you can push , and i ' ll pull you up . one , two , three ! ' ' i put my foot down and he laughs and pulls me up and over onto him . i land right on top of him , shaking with fear and excitement . i feel his arms wrap around me and squeeze , nearly knocking the rest of the air out of me . ` ` hey , brynn , ' ' he whispers in my ear . ` ` are you ok ? ' ' i ask , once he ' s back on his feet . ` ` am i okay ? are you ? ' ' he asks , sounding concerned . ` ` um , i think so , but it ' s hard to tell right now . ' ' ` ` oh , good . now , stand up , ' ' he says , and i move to the side of him . he stands , and offers me his hands . i take them andthen , groaning as i put weight on my right foot . ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' ` ` my ankle , i think . ' ' ` ` let ' s get back on the trail where you can look at it . ' ' he takes my arm and puts it over his shoulder . i feel his arm around my waist and i ' m almost lifted off my feet as he carries me out onto the trail . he helps me up to a sitting position and i lean back on my elbows as he gently picks up my right foot . ` ` it ' s a little swollen , ' ' he says , ` ` but i ' ' ' i think it ' s okay - not a bad one . ' you ' re going to fall again if i push you ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' ll be fine , ' ' i tell him . he helps me sit up and wraps my arm around his waist . i take a deep breath as we take our very first step back toward the trail , and i think i ' m ready for a good minute of being pressed up against him . ` ` you ' re all sweaty , you know that ? ' ' i say with a smile . ` ` hey , you better be careful . ' '" my turn , ' ' he says . ` ` how high up is that ? ' ' ` ` ` try not to think about it . ' ' ` ` that ' s pretty impressive . ' ' ` ` well , i ' m glad you ' re okay . . . . . ' ' i honestly don ' t know if it ' s the adrenaline from the falling , or if we ' re both just nervous , but the short ride still takes us in awkward silence . i wish i could think of something to say to break the silence , but having his shirtless body pressed up against mine is too much . i can feel our breaths mixing , and our breath echoing along with the beat of our hearts . when we finally reach the parking lot , he stops and stands in front of me , then leans down , looking up at me intently . i nod and swing my right leg up onto him , and then stand up as he carries me the rest of the way . he walks with me on his back until we reach the car , then drops me down next to the passenger side door . as he walks around to the driver ' s side , i turn to look around the parking lot . there are really quite a few cars around , and all theit is a black car with a woman wearing sunglasses behind the wheel . i stare at her for a moment , because with her red hair , i thought for a moment that she was my sister . when we make eye contact she quickly looks away , and i hear the engine start for a car . maybe she was just looking for nate like the other people we saw today . or maybe she ' s a stalker . . . i told the police that there could still be a stalker hanging around .
