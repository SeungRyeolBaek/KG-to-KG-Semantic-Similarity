we ' d had an argument of sorts that morning , and i would wouldn ' t call it an argument , but there was definitely some tension . we were joking around at lunch , our usual routine , which was something the doctor had told her was good for her health . i was going over to get her some orange juice when she stopped me . ` ` so , we gon ' get married ? ' ' she caught me off guard with that question , coming out of the bathroom like that and i guess i just ain ' t handling the situation to her satisfaction . ` ` what ' t ' t we talk about this afternoon when you ' re done with the wedding ? ' ' it was the best i could come up with on such short notice . for some reason my silence pissed her off . she ' d been losing her temper a lot lately , and she realized i was ain ' t the type to raise my fist and punch her in the face just for fun . so she told me that she got real quiet for the rest of the day and when she really wasn ' t talking all over the room she was ignoring me . i decided to leave her to her thoughts and do some work in my office . two days after she was ready to leave i gother in the bathroom and f * * ked her against the wall although she ' d tried to push me away at first . ` ` well , you just don ' t call me that , no matter how f * * king hot you are . ' ' i had my hand on her open mouth when i heard that and pulled it down to enter her mouth . as much of a noise as she ' d made by the time i had her pinned to the bed , her legs were wrapped around my waist and her nails were digging into my back as i f * * ked her to within an inch of her orgasm . she ' d sucked my c * * k up after i ' d f ##ed on her the first time and we ' d cleaned each other up again . i was under the impression that she was taking her time . but she pulled this f * * king shit . we ' d had a few arguments about the way she dressed on stage and when she let it be known that she still wasn ' t very comfortable with some of the clothes , but her other parts liked them , i ' d put my foot down . her clothes did ##n ' t have any limits . i did don ' t want her to look like a whore on stage . i didni wanted her to show her ass to the world , especially when that ass was now the sole property of trace mckenzie . i waited until the curtain was up at the end and she would be going home for a quick change . i grabbed her as soon as she stepped off the stage and while her friends were trying to help her out i took her back to the dressing room and slammed the door . ` ` your next move had better be something more sexy shiane , or i swear to f * * k , i will drag your ass off that f * * king stage and take you home . ' ' ` ` ' don ' t tell me how to do my job baby , i was planning this before we left and if you ' don ' t like it . . . ' ' my hand came up and went to her neck and i pulled her face down to mine . ` ` ' what the f * * k you did to me little girl , i ' m hanging onto my control by a thread , so unless you want me to clean up your sorry ass when we get home you ' d better leave while you ' re here . ' ' ` ` ' ' wo don ' t like going home with you . ' ' she was laughing and was obviously doing itmaybe because of me , she would ' ve been more comfortable . i yelled in her face . ` ` damn it , you ' aren ' not a piece of shit big enough to hide your ass . and if you let another one of these f * * kers in here to help you hide from me i will kill the f * * k . ' ' i slapped her hard enough to split her lips before leaving her alone . i knew what she wanted . she was just going to have to wait . i ' m a man and for a man there ' s always the right time and the right place to do it . i slid back into my seat and that ' s when she finally did leave . i knew i ' d made my point when i saw the black dress with the slit in the back . just then one of the other guys came up behind her and put his arm around her from behind . she sang to him and they did some sorta two - step thing . then he hit something with his foot and the dress fell at her feet . she kicked it out of the way and the crowd went wild . she had the nerve to look at me as she sang and danced and shook her head at the crowd . i knew there was going to be a fight .we stood there for the rest of the show until she left the stage for the last time . by then my anger was a barely contained volcano building inside me . i said , as we walked to where everyone was cheering her on her performance . ` ` let ' s go . ' ' i reached over and took her hand . ' ' ` ` ' i want to . . . ' ' one look at my face had her changing course . she swallowed hard and i could see from her eyes that she was finally aware that she ' d gone too far .
