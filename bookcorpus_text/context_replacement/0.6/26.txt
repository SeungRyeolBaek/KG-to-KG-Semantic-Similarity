` ` nope . not a date . ' ' pesh shoved his hands into his suit pockets . ` ` i have asked megan to join me on a date , but at this point , we are at a disadvantage . besides , i am not planning on showing up anytime soon . does that satisfy your curiosity ? ' ' aidan nodded , but then his brow furrowed . ` ` what do you mean ? you two looked so happy and relaxed together when we came in . ' ' with a slight shake of his head , pesh said , ` ` she ' ' ' she came to see me . ' ' ` ` i call bullshit . you may have been shot in the head , but no one could see the way she was looking at you . and if you - ' ' although it was against his nature , he let his anger cloud his better judgment . ` ` she asked me for lunch , not for a date , right ? ' ' aidan ' s mouth dropped open . ` ` you mean , she ' s not a . . . a girlfriend ? ' ' ` ` if you mean that she has pretty much refused to go to dinner with me or any other social event that a man and woman can participate in on a date , and yet , shewould they have a more serious relationship , ? the answer is yes . ' ' ` ` my god , it ' s like she ' s turning into the old emma , ' ' aidan said . he ran his hands over his face as he looked at pesh intently . ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' with a sigh , pesh said , ` ` she ' s still too young . i think in her mind , she ' s been kind of wasted the last few years . this is a chance for her to make up for that . see if we accept or reject her . ' ' ` ` okay , i will brief you on the whole thing . ' ' aidan gave pesh a long , hard look . ` ` you have to keep trying , no matter what . ' ' ` ` i did n ' er say i was giving up , did i ? ' ' ` ` no , but i know from personal experience how hard it is to keep trying when it feels like you are n ' er failing . ' ' ` ` what happened with you and emma was very different than with megan and me . ' ' ` ` you still have to try . ' ' aidan slid off the coffee table and stood for a moment on shaky legs . `` megan has been hurt before , and i still don ' t think she fully understands what it means to be loved . or even where her feelings are going . besides , she was only twenty - one when she got knocked up . i want her to find someone who will love her , aidan . i want my girl cared for . ' ' aidan patted pesh ' s shoulder . ` ` i wish that someone could be you . ' ' ` ` we ' ll see . ' ' when aidan started to argue , pesh shook his head . ` ` not to worry about your girl . ' ' ` ` fine , ' ' aidan muttered . when pesh opened the door for aidan , emma and megan stared down at them . ` ` ' what ' s the news ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` i think he ' s going to be just fine , but to be on the safe side , i ' ve given him a ct scan . ' ' emma ' s eyes widened in shock . ` ` you think he has some brain damage from the accident ? ' ' she asked in a small voice . pesh turned to her and put her at ease . ` ` i ' don ' t think there ' s anything serious . a nasty bump on the head, but i want to make sure there is nothing wrong with him . ' ' ` ` okay then , ' ' emma said . an orderly appeared with a wheelchair to take aidan to his room . as they sat down , aidan leaned over to kiss emma . ` ` i ' m sorry , emma . stop worrying . this really ain ' t good for you or the baby . ' ' she gave him a weak smile . ` ` i ' ll try hard not to . ' ' he winked at her before leaning back in the chair . ` ` nothing can make you happy - you should know that by now . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` at least we know the doctor . ##n ' t do anything to your baby . ' ' ` ` of course not , ' ' emma replied . kristi poked her head out of one of the waiting rooms . ` ` dr . nadeen , we need you . ' ' aidan hesitated before turning to megan . ` ` ' can t ' t you take emma to one of the other waiting rooms ? ' ' ` ` sure , ' ' megan replied . emma walked over to hug him . ` ` thanks for taking care of aidan . ' ' ` ` it was my pleasure . ' ' she gave them a quick squeeze before disappearing intothe next one ' s waiting . " after talking to aidan , he suddenly had a little # # ##ness in his step . chapter twelve two weeks later when megan came in for her morning run , she found the hospital room in a state of chaos . ` ` whoa , what happened ? ' ' she asked kristi , after she ' d walked in and put away her things . kristi rolled her eyes . ` ` every week or so we seem to have a period where everything goes wrong from start to finish . you can never fix it - you always just have to go with the flow . ' ' she looked at megan .
