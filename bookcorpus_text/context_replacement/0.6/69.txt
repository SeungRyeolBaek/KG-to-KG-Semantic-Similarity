running her fingers through his dark hair , she shook her head . ` ` i think we need to talk about our future . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` you coming over here has made me realize something very important . what we ' ve been doing has been amazing , and i ' ve loved every second of it . but - - ' ' pesh ' s blue eyes snapped open , and the lines on his face looked as if he were in pain . ` ` no . you ' don ' me have to do this . i ' ll just go . ' ' ` ` ` i ' don ' t want you to go , ' ' she whispered . ` ` ' what are you trying to say ? ' ' ` ` that i want you in my life , and i want more . ' ' his eyebrows shot up . ` ` more ? as in more of us together ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' he sucked in a breath . ` ` you want us to be an official couple ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` yes , i do . well , everything will change . ' ' ` ` i ' can ' t do it , ' ' he whispered . ` ` this just ain ' t exactly the reaction i expectedyou would be , ' ' she whispered . ` ` no , i ' m not . trust me . i ' m just nervous , that ' s all . ' ' she pressed her lips to his and gave him a soft kiss . against his lips , she whispered , ` ` can you ever forgive me for being so selfish and so stupid ? ' ' ` ` i can try . but i think you ' re going to have to try very hard to make it up to me . ' ' ` ` do i ? ' ' he asked . ` ` very , very hard . ' ' ` ` why do i get the distinct feeling that your idea of ' making it up to you is very different than mine ? ' ' ` ` no more waiting for you . no more . ' ' ` ` i can see that . ' ' a wicked gleam appeared in pesh ' s eyes . ` ` the first date will be to the opera to see the opera . ' ' she laughed . ` ` you ' don ' t play fair . ' ' he ran his hands up her arms , causing her to gasp . ` ` i would like to say that you ' haven ' t been playing fair all night . now it ' s my turn . ' ' ` ` thank you' to punish me ? ' ' she asked in a whisper . ` ` mmm , hmm , so , lots of sex and lots of time alone together . ' ' he arched a brow at her . ` ` ' living hell on earth . ' ' she could couldn ' t stop smiling . ` ` i ' ll be a good boy and punish you . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad to hear it . ' ' as they fell into silence , megan ' s fingers ran through the hair at the nape of his neck . ` ` do you want to spend the night with me ? ' ' pesh ' s brow furrowed as if anxiously awaiting her answer . ` ` do you - ' ' ` ` no sex . just sex . ' ' ` ` you think that ' s a good idea with him ? ' ' ` ` we ' re a couple now . he ' s going to be seeing a lot of you . ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` yes , it is . ' ' looking into his eyes , she asked , ` ` ' you ' ll stay ? ' ' ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' without another word , she slid off his lap . when she got up from the bed , she took him by the hand andfollowing him to her bedroom . as she sat on the edge of the bed , she watched as pesh stripped down to his boxer briefs . when he was done , he walked back over to her . ` ` i ' m glad we ' didn ' t do anything else . ' ' he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheek . ` ` i said ##n ' t ' . i ' m happy just to be with you . ' ' in her heart , she was happy as well and not just for him or the night . happy for how everything between them had turned out . ` ` so am i , ' ' she whispered , lying back on the bed . ` ` so am i . ' ' chapter ten for megan , the next few days flew by . she still don ' t know if it was because she was so busy with work , or it was because she was so busy being with pesh . she liked to think it was the latter . or maybe it was that she was happy being with pesh . between her work schedule and his , they spent every night together . most nights , he came to her house . they made love , then they went out . although her parents would ##n ' t ' approve , they came out as well . whatthey didn ##n ' t know then that anyone or anything had ever happened between them . aside from the day ' s events , they just enjoyed being in each other ' s arms . as she walked out of the men ' s room , she looked up to see pesh standing across the room talking to the nurse . for just a moment , his eyes met hers , and although no one else could have possibly seen it , she saw the warmth and the love . she gave him a small smile before heading over to the nurses ' station . since they had become a couple , their day at work had been like a week of trying to pretend there was nothing going on between them .
