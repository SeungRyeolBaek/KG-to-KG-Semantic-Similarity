and there are quite a few things i ' d like to pick out for myself . i meet her at the anthropologie - owned store , and we start going through the clothes together as we line up . when she ' s done looking , i toss a few pairs of jeans and some underwear into my bag . i want to pick something a little different for nate , but i ' don ' t want to see allison ' s horrified reaction if she sees what i ' ve picked up . we both make our way to the dressing room and start trying on our clothes . i finally settle on the black lace pair of jeans and panties . i check myself in the mirror . the dress is a bright pink , and way too revealing - it ' s anthropologie , not victoria ' s secret , after all . ` ` what do you think ? ' ' allison asks me , pulling the curtain aside and walking into the dressing room with me . she ' s wearing a black cocktail dress and pauses for a moment when she sees what i ' m wearing . her eyebrows rise . ` ` whoa . ' ' ` ` allison , ' ' i say , pulling one of the more revealing pieces of clothing off the rack to cover myself .` ` you know , i had a feeling something was up with you , ' ' she says , trying to smile . ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` yup . and i was wrong . i really thought you two would make a great couple . ' ' ` ` what ? that ' s not what you said . ' ' ` ` no , i really meant it ! ' ' ` ` no , you just warned me against the whole thing , ' ' i reply , confused and even more confused . ` ` greg , ' ' she says with a frown , ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' ` ` greg , i . . . ' ' ` ` oh , sorry . ' ' ` ` brynn . . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' i ask confused . ` ` if it ' s not greg , who did you think i was talking about ? ' ' she asks , her smile fading . ` ` it ' s not nate , right ? ' ' i reply , confused . ` ` brynn , please . please tell me it ' s not nate . no . i mean , it ' s your brother . it ' s . . . it ' s nate .' ' ` ` thanks a lot , allison . ' exactly what i need to hear right now , ' ' i say , turning my back to her to take off the dress . ` ` um , no it ' s not what you need to hear right now . i mean , what ' s with you ? you ' re accepting a perfectly nice invitation to go out with some jock like nate . ' ' ` ` well , first of all , it ' s none of your business . second of all , you ' re not completely wrong about greg . nate is ' perfectly nice . ' there ' s no question at all . no . third of all , nate ' s not ' some jock . ' he ' s just nice , and funny , and funny . and with him ? sparks fly ! ' ' ` ` look , brynn , i ' m just trying to look out for you . you ' re making some really bad decisions . ' ' i take a deep breath , not wanting to raise my voice in this public place . ` ` no , allison , you ' re not trying to look out for me . what you ' re doing is ignoring me . completely wrong . and you really ' really ' really mean it . ' ' i start pulling up my dressand i put my shoes on . i grab my purse and walk quickly out of the dressing room . i walk quickly out of the building and toward the entrance to the parking lot , my face burning with embarrassment , but i still feel a little like crying . i ' ve never had a big conversation like that with allison before , and i really don ' t like it . i stop at the door just as i ' m about to reach the lobby . victoria ' s secret . my relationship with nate . ' ' ' ` ` no . ' ' there ' s something wrong with what we ' re doing . if anything , my conversation with allison has made me want to get into my relationship with nate , not out of it . i walk out and go to the fashion store i find . when i get there , i hear my mom and dad talking in the kitchen , and the voices from the bedroom . i walk in , and sigh with relief at the sight of nate with his feet up on the table . he kicks his feet , and i sit down . ` ` hi , ' ' i say with a smile . ` ` hi , ' ' he replies . ` ` what ' s up ? ' ' i smile at him , and he reaches up to his mouth, or laughing at something . i stare at him for a moment , realizing he ' s noticed my earlier habit of pulling at my hair . i sigh and drop my head . ` ` it ' s allison . we had an argument , ' ' i say . ` ` she . . . she stormed out . ' ' he shakes his head and then lets out a low whistle when he realizes what he said . ` ` well , i guess it ' s not that bad . i mean , i just thought . . . ' ' he lowers his voice , looking off toward the kitchen where our parents are still talking .
