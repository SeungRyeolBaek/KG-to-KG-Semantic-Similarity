stop feeling sorry for yourself , brynn . as i walk across the back deck , i glance up and see my mom and dad ' s bedroom lights are on . i guess they ' re coming home early tonight . i walk back toward the house and pause when i hear a noise . the lights here are all off except those in the kitchen , and the pool ' s just above the pool . my eyes look up and focus on two naked men in a poolside lounge ##r . nate and dana . i watch as nate takes off his own shirt and then dana ' s . i know i should , but i ' don ' t . the dim pool lights glow against his back , as he slowly removes dana ' s bra and takes off her pants and shirt . stop , you two ! my mind tells me , but my body remains firmly planted in place , even as it pulses with desire . one of nate ' s hands cups dana ' s soft breasts , and the other moves against her . she cries out , and i almost feel myself , as though his fingers are pressing against me . i can almost feel his mouth on me , his hot breath against my ear as his long fingers slide inside me . . . nate groans and moves againsther . she tries to control herself as he pushes himself in and out of her . oh my god - what am i doing ! ? i step back with a gasp as if i ' m coming out of a trance and nearly knock over the rose bush next to me in my haste to get away . i walk as quickly and quietly as i can around the side of the house and to the door . i hear the front door and know that nate is going to show up soon . i hear the knob turn and push the door open with ease . i run up the spiral staircase and down the hall into my bedroom , kicking off my shoes , throwing myself onto my bed and burying my face in the pillow . i can feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment at what i just did and the overwhelming attraction i felt . i ' ve had feelings before , but nothing like my feelings with nate . and even after just meeting him , only to have him kiss me and push my buttons , i still feel so incredibly attracted to him . i pull my head out of the pillow and go to the nightstand , pulling my dog - sized copy of lady chatterley ' s diary out of the top drawer . just as i ' m opening it to the7 - up inside , there ' s a soft knock at my door . i drop my book on the bed and go to it , hoping and praying it ' s just nate . i almost jump when i push open the door and nate ' s face appears , dark against the darkness of the room . he steps forward , leaning his shoulder against the door . i step back slightly . his dark hair is very dark , and his lips are curved into a half smile . ` ` strictly speaking , does the shooting range have to be outside , not inside ? or does the rule only apply if two , or all three , people are watching ? ' ' he asks , amused , tilting his head back slightly as he studies me . ` ` i . . . ' ' wasn ' t . . . ' ' i say , feeling heat creep up the back of my neck . ` ` you . . . startled me , ' ' he tells me , narrowing his eyes . ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' didn ' t mean to . i just . . . i was looking at the woods . . . how did you . . . ? ' ' ` ` i heard a branch snap and saw you running around like a madsorry . ' ' ` ` did you - ? ' ' ` ` yes , and i # ##n ' t see her . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' ` ` really ? what do you mean ? ' ' he asks . ` ` oh , i ' m so sorry , alec . i ' m so sorry , ' ' i go on . it strikes me that this is the first conversation i ' ve ever had with my new boyfriend . and it ' s about how i ' m a jerk . . . ` ` ' are you seeing her ? ' ' he asks , stepping further into my space . i take a step away from him . ` ` um , no . . . i # n ' t know . it just kind of happened . i # ##n ' t want to . ' ' ` ` asshole , ' ' he says softly . ` ` asshole . ' ' it comes out before i can stop myself . he shakes his head slowly . ` ` asshole , ' ' he agrees with me . i look down . ` i am a jerk , but i # n ' t want to be . ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' he asks . when i look back up at him , i seehim looking past me , to my bag on the floor . ` ` no , just a book , ' ' i say , but he ' s looking past me toward bed . i call after him . he reaches the bed before me and picks up the book . ` ` what ? ' ' i say again . ` ` i know what lady chatterley ' s diary is about , ' ' he says , looking at me with a wicked smile . 1 . ` ` maybe not such a secret after all , ' ' he says , running his eyes up and down my body . i swallow hard .
