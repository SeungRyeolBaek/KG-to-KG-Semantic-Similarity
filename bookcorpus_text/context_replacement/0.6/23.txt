kristi laughed . ` ` yeah , you keep telling yourself that , too . ' ' chapter twelve when pesh entered one of the exam rooms , he saw megan sitting on a stool behind the counter , working on a chart . when the door closed behind him , she snapped her head up and caught him staring . he cleared his throat and walked over to her . ` ` hi , ' ' she said , smiling . ` ` hi . ' ' ` ` so , are you settling in ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` everyone has been very helpful and helpful . ' ' ` ` good . i ' m glad to hear that . we still have very good success rates with our clinical trials . ' ' megan smiled as her head dropped back down to work on the chart . sighing , he rubbed the back of his neck . things were going along with them enough that he knew he should don ' t want to rock the boat . after all , he had promised her he would keep his word . but he could ##n ' t help himself . in the two weeks since their last meeting , he had hadn ' t stopped thinking about her . now that she had shown back up in his life , out of the blue , he could couldn ' t help feeling that something was wrong .take her to dinner , his mind screamed . he bit down on his lip to stop the question he was about to ask from escaping his lips . instead , he blurted out before he could stop himself . ` ` ' why don ' t you let me buy you dinner after work ? ' ' megan ' s pink pen tapped on the paper . she looked up and shook her head at him . ` ` dinner implies a date , and i thought we were clear on that . ' ' he gave her a wry smile . ` ` actually , i was just eating some more delicious chinese food . i hardly think that constitutes a date . ' ' ` ` in my state of self health , every time you sit down at a table , eating and drinking coffee , dinner implies a date . ' ' crossing his arms over his chest , he said , ` ` if that were true , it would mean you were seeing your sister and brother every time you sat down together . i know your family is close , but i really don ' t think they ' re that close . ' ' megan ' s eyebrows rose . ` ` ah , is the good news making sense here ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' the corners of megan ' s mouth turned up . ` ` ' what` would you consider a date ? ' ' pesh leaned back against the counter , causing her to jump . ` ` a mutually agreed upon one . ' ' ` ` you ' re so funny , ' ' megan teased . he rolled his eyes at her , something he never did until he started spending more and more time in her company . ` ` and you ' re stating the obvious now . ' ' megan set down the pen and paper and crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` so , if you could take me on a date , where would we go ? ' ' pesh scratched his chin in thought . ` ` well , if would happen to be something you would like to do , then i would agree with that . ' ' when she started to protest , he held up his hand . ` ` somewhere that was filled with candles and soft music - or a place where we could talk in between kisses . ' ' staring at him in disbelief , megan asked , ` ` you ' re serious ? ' ' ` ` of course . ' ' she slowly shook her head back and forth . ` ` okay , go on . ' ' ` ` after we have dinner and dessert , i would really like to take you somewhere you ' ve never been - '' ` ` ' your home ? ' ' megan asked with a smile . ` ` i do believe you ' ve only been there once . ' ' the smile faded from megan ' s face , and a blush stained her cheeks . ` ` may i ask ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' she replied . ` ` i would love to go with you to experience something you never had before - an art gallery , an orchestra , a theater . anything that would bring joy and excitement to your life . ' ' he gave her a warm smile . ` ` and it would help all the more that i am here to share it with you . ' ' he watched with a genuine interest as she considered his words . most likely she had never had a man talk to her the way he did , and it was obviously affecting her . feeling like it was time to go in for the kill , he asked her again , ` ` so , will you have dinner with me ? ' ' pesh leaned forward just as megan opened her mouth . they were interrupted by the sound of emma ' s voice . ` ` oh my god . i ' m so glad you finally caught me . ' ' her excited voice was the only thing that could have stopped pesh ' s heartthis from megan . he looked from emma to aidan , who was moaning and rubbing his head . ` ` what happened ? ' ' emma replied , ` ` he fell and hit his head , ' ' at the same time aidan replied , ` ` nothing . ' ' megan stepped back and walked over to aidan . she smiled as she saw him . ` ` wow , your eyes are blue ! ' ' pesh pulled his keys out of his back pocket and turned to aidan .
