i have just finished picking up the glass of water i left on the table when i scrape a piece of chicken off my fork and onto my plate . ` ` ' you could ##n ' t make it worse , nate , ' ' nate says . ` ` looks like you could have used some good food . nate should ##a ' not have sent you on such dangerous adventures . ' ' ` ` no , it was wasn ' t dangerous , ' ' i come to nate ' s defense . ` ` he was going to teach me how to shoot poisoned darts , nate , and i ran right off the bridge . it could ##n ' t hurt how close i got to the ground and the ground just gave way beneath me . it was all my fault . he was the one who pulled me back up and broke my leg . ' ' ` ` well , it could ##n ' t hurt to have it looked at by a doctor on monday , ' ' my dad points out . ` ` i think it ' ll be okay , dad , ' ' i reply . ` ` anyone want some ? ' ' my dad asks . ` ` no , thanks , ' ' nate and i both reply at the same time . i bite my lip to keep from laughing . ` ` what ' s so funny? ' ' he asks , looking at his mom , his voice still quiet . ` ` get out , ' ' i reply quietly . ` ` i ' ll help you with the dishes , mom . ' ' we both stand and grab a few plates and head into the kitchen . as soon as the front door closes behind us , i hear pierce ' s voice . even though his words are quiet , i can tell by his tone that he ' s blaming nate for something . i look at my mom . she turns off the water and starts washing up the dishes and putting them into the sink . ` ` is it okay with you that he talks to nate like that ? ' ' ` ` it ' s just the two of them , ' ' my mom replies , without looking back at me . i feel anger course through me . ` ` you keep trying to make them a deal , and then you wo ##n ' t get involved in their business . you wo don ' t have it both ways . ' ' before she can respond , i turn back around and into the living room . she walks out just as i enter the kitchen , and i quickly clear the table of the dishes before heading back to my room . i take a deep breath .i close my bedroom door behind me . i just don ' t want to have this night ruined by my anger at my parents and nate . i go into the bathroom and turn on my shower . i still have ##n ' t had a chance to wash off the sweat from our kayaking and fishing trip today , and i want to smell like a flower garden . my skin heats with anticipation as i peel off my shirt and shorts . i look down at my bare skin , wondering if it ' s going to get wet . probably not . i peel off my sports bra and shorts and then check myself in the mirror , running my hands over my breasts and then down my stomach . nate ' s never seen me naked , i tell myself , as butterflies leap up from my stomach . and i already know he wants me . everything will be okay . i stand under the hot stream of water and take my time washing my hair . as the sun rises , i stretch my legs and my tank top , going a little bit farther than i would like . i know that a lot of girls at school are always naked , but i ' don ' t allow myself to go that far . i turn off the water and dry myself off , then tie my hair down the middle and let itair conditioning . i grab a pair of black tank tops and matching bra from my closet and put them on . i ' m not sure if that ' s wise or wrong , but i ' m trying not to overthink it . i ' m probably not succeeding , but i keep trying . i walk over to my bed and sit down . i know that nate will probably wait for our mom to go to bed before he does anything , so i ' ve got a couple of hours to kill at least . i try to look at the screen , but i ' m not able to interest myself in anything . i keep wondering what ' s going to happen next . i ' don ' t want to get my hopes up , but i think i have an idea . or at least , i know what i want to do . i finally decide to watch some mindless tv on hulu , and go back in my room . ` ` goodnight , brynn ! ' ' i can hear my mom call as she heads up to the second floor . i smile . ` ` goodnight ! ' ' i call back , and i start tugging on the ends of my hair . i continue watching tv until i hear her go upstairs , too , then i close my eyes andgo into the bathroom , groaning as i put too much weight on my injured leg . i run my fingers through my hair and decide i should brush my teeth . just as i ' m putting my hair back up , i hear a soft knock on my door . my heart jumps in my throat . i walk back into my room just in time to see the door open and nate poke his head out .
