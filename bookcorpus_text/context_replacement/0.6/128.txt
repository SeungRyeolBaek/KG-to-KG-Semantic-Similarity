the crowd seemed to read something else into it , and it seemed that she was playing hard to get , dropping his outstretched hand and walking away as she kept playing , only to be interrupted by him again and again . every time our eyes met i kept my face blank , i did don ' t want to interrupt her , and like i said if this was part of her show then so be it . but what it did kinda ' felt good , the way i managed to get her off the stage when it had nothing to do with their music . and don ' t ask me how she handled those guys so well . i was into her , for sure , but every time it happened she ' d give me a look and it would piss me off . i really ain ' t mad at her anymore , not anymore , but him i ' d like to throw into the f * * king fire . i left my seat and went outside just as the first song started . i just followed the rest of the crowd as she kissed them goodnight for the last time , giving them the kiss they ' d asked for . i was in the back corner of , behind this big shit plant , when she came out followed by the rest of the band , andthe ass * * le . ` ` hey i ' m talking to you . ' ' he reached out to touch her arm and she pulled it out of his grasp . ` ` the show is over donnie we have nothing more to say to each other for the rest of the night . ' ' ` ` that ' s what you said . where did you get this ? ' ' i started rubbing the mark i ' d made on her arm . she slapped her hand against mine and stood up . ` ` that ' s none of your business . ' ' ` ` nothing is my business when my woman is getting a kiss from some other guy . ' ' ` ` your face , are you insane ? we ' ve been together for years . would you please get out of my way ? ' ' she was wrapped around him and by this point i ' d seen everything i needed to . he stepped forward and before i could stop them he ' d reached out and grabbed her and was about to kiss her . the reason this was that there were others still around and no one seemed to notice the sexual activity that was taking place right in front of them . that could be because their voices had been so low during this entire thing . as soon as his hand fisted in her hair ,turn on him . ` ` get the f * * k off her ass * * le . ' ' i knocked his hand away and stepped between the two of them . you could tell he was angry but unable to control it . i was no longer worried about the guy touching her , i knew that was just him and that the situation could be a very well choreographed dance floor , that ' s all that it was . but this was something else , this was more and this i would not allow . ` ` who the f * * k are you , shiane who ' s this ass * * le ? is this about sadie ? tell him who i am or i kick his ass . ' ' ` ` ' you little shit , if you go anywhere near her , i ' ll break every bone in your f * * king body . ' ' he looked at her wide eyed when he realized i heard every word . but he just reached out for her again , grabbing her hand this time and i saw stars . i punched him in the face until blood poured from his nose . only the fact that he was so much bigger than me , kept me from following him . i grabbed her arm and pulled her from him , mad as hell . ' ' didn ' t youno blanket to cover her this time but thankfully she was still curled up . ` ` did you have anything in there that you needed ? ' ' i asked her as we got in the back of the car on the way home . she called one of her friends to get her things . that night i f * * ked her like a madman , there just wasn ' t a part of her body that i could ##n ' t touch , or bite . at one point she ' d cried because it was too much . i fucked her sweet pu * * y until the pain was gone and i slid back into her . we were both spent by the time i pulled away from her and the sun was setting . pulling her into my arms i held her as we slept . the next day i was all over the f * * king front lawn , getting what i needed . some people had been there taking pictures of the whole thing and the story spread . that ' s how we all found out and since that day we could ##n ' t leave the house for days without a camera in our hands . things calmed down when they realized they could ##n ' t gon get ##b anything back from us and my dad was really good at answering their questions . they had no reason tomy own underground parking lot and since i had a whole lot of cars to choose from they never knew which way we were or if i felt like taking my friends out for dinner . since we ' n ' t exactly the kind of places that belonged to the elite or that were people who ' d tipped them off to us being there , we were left there in silence until the chaos had died down . three brooke it ' s the night of the homecoming dance and she keeps blowing me off .
