` ` this land used to belong to a native american tribe in the - ' ' ` ` piscataway , ' ' i say reflexively . ` ` yeah , i keep forgetting my dad was a historian , ' ' he says , and i can tell from his voice that he ' s amused . ` ` ' wo don ' t dare try to impress you with my passion for american history , though . ' ' ` ` oh , come on , tell me , ' ' i tell him . ` ` ' i don ' t have a secret , ' ' he admits wryly . ` ` you get better grades than me . ' ' ` ` yeah , well , put me on three different schools and i think those grades might help a little . i ' don ' t know how you do it . my friends allison and miriam tell me i spend too much time at the school - i never have enough time for them . not to mention , i ' m not athletically good at school , ' ' i say , turning to my friend miriam . ` ` but you ' ve got friends there . ' ' ` ` you met allison on the playground , remember ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` and miriam ? ' '` ` she ' s back home in california for the summer . she ' s my only real friend ; she and allison live together . ' ' ` ` why ' don ' t you live with them ? ' ' he asks , and i turn to listen to his feet splash down into the water . ` ` well , never mind about that , but i hate being alone . my mom can be . . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' he asks softly . ` ` i ' m trying to think of a more appropriate word for it . ' ' ` ` you can say that if you want . i wo ##l ' you know . ' ' ` ` yeah , she ' s pretty damn cool , ' ' i say , feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders . i hardly ever talk about the more intimate aspects of my relationship with my mom . ` ` well , a little more so since she ' s dating someone , too . sometimes i just feel like i ' m - ' ' ` ` her friend , ' ' he finishes for me . i turn to face him , raising my eyebrows . ` ` is that true ? ' ' i ask cautiously . ` ` i ... don ' t mean to sound rude . ' '` ` you ' re free to do whatever you want for her , ' ' he says with a small smile , and i turn back around . ` ` at first i thought you were fragile , ' ' he says after a moment . ` ` that if i pushed you , you ' d break . i think that ' s why . . . that ' s why i wanted to push you a little . ' ' ` ` you mean when you stood me up at lunch with our mother sitting across from me ? ' ' he asks . ` ` ` i don ' t think i did that , and i certainly don ' t think i ' ve ever tried . ' ' ` ` no , you . ##n ' no , baby . ' ' ` ` i am now . ' ' ` ` so , you really don ' t think i ' m weak anymore ? ' ' ` ` no . i think you ' re one of the strongest people i ' ve ever met . look ! ' ' he says excitedly . i turn back toward him and see where ' s he ' s pointing . ` ` the great blue heron , ' ' he says . i see the huge bird with its wings spread , sitting on a rock in the middle of the lake . ` ` that ' show they wash their bodies before they hunt for food . ' ' it stops moving for a moment and we watch it . then it pulls its wings back , pulls itself into a ball , and flies into the sky . we watch it disappear into the dark clouds and we start rowing down the river again . ` ` ' are you interested in me ? ' ' i ask him . ` ` i like knowing that people behave the way they do , ' ' he replies quietly . i resist the urge to ask how this relates to his personal life , try to understand the boundaries he ' s set up . ` ` how ' s greg ? ' ' he asks quietly . i turn around and narrow my eyes at him . ` ` what ? that ' s a stupid question , ' ' he says with a sly grin . ` ` i . . . i ' don ' t want to talk about greg , ' ' i reply , a little more loudly than i meant to . ` ` okay . . . so that either sounds really good or really bad . ' ' ` ` it ' s not really bad , ' ' i reply . ` ` uh - huh . ' ' i reply . ` ` it ' s just , it ' s nothing . . . you know. . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` nothing . i want to help him - - i ' don ' t want him to get hurt . not that i think i ' m breaking his heart or anything - ' ' ` ` i saw the way he looked at you . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` he ' s too young . i ' ll kill him if he goes any further . ' ' ` ` i think you ' re right . ' ' ` ` trust me . ' ' we fall back into a comfortable silence as i think about his words . the silence of the water , broken only by the gentle breeze blowing through the trees , seems to calm my nerves about the conversation i have to have with greg . the sound of ` ` ' ' ' seems to come from me , or maybe it ' s the oppressive heat , which feels like it ' s going to sink my feet into the bottom of the ocean .
