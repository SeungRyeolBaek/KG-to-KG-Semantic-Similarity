it had seemed too big to her for just an engagement party - it was more like a wedding . ` ` it ' s show - stopping , ' ' pesh whispered in her ear as he stood up . she eagerly followed his lead . he grabbed one of the flower arrangements from the table and placed it on her head . he made sure to arrange her hair so it fell over the top . when he was done , she did the same , although it was a little difficult for her to reach it over his head . then he took one of the platinum rings and placed it on her ring finger . ` ` i love you so damn much , megan . there ' s not another person in the world i could love . i love you , ' ' he whispered to reassure her . ` ` i love you so much , too . ' ' she gently placed the ring on his finger . when she was done , lights went up in the ballroom , and pesh pulled her to him for a kiss . ` ` ` what shall we do ? ' ' she asked . he grinned at her . ` ` we dance . ' ' after releasing the breath she had been holding , megan took pesh ' s hand and let him lead her to the dance floor . the moment sheshe never wanted before in her life music to come from the piano . ` ` ' what were you thinking when you came to the wedding ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` something simple . ' ' his eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` what ? i was hoping you would want to go all out . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` we just wanted something simple with our close friends and family . we just don ' t want to do something just to make them nervous . ' ' he chuckled . ` ` you know that anything ' simple ' is not going to sit well with my parents . ' ' megan sighed . ` ` well , they ' re just going to have to accept it . ' ' ` ` we could always run away and get married in a church in vegas , ' ' he suggested . ` ` that idea has merit , but i think as my parents ' only child , they would enjoy themselves if they just ##n ' t have to do something . ' ' his eyes grew serious . ` ` i # n ' t want them to have to wait any longer . ' ' ` ` i know . i want to get married in the next couple of weeks . ' ' she nodded . ` ` good . i ' m glad to hear that. ' ' as megan looked up to see her husband dancing with his best friend , an idea popped into her head . ` ` what if we get married in grandma ' s rose garden ? ' ' ` ` ` sounds like a great idea , but is there enough room ? ' ' ` ` with our closest friends and family , right ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` it could work . ' ' ` ` do you like the idea ? ' ' ` ` i do . ' ' with a grin , he said , ` ` it makes sense . you proposed to me on valentine ' s day . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` that ' s right . it does . ' ' ` ` so we can do it all together in six months ? ' ' ` ` i ' don ' t see why not . ' ' he pressed his warm lips to hers , and megan shivered in spite of the heat of the dance floor . ` ` i ' m ' t ready to make you my wife , ' ' he whispered against her lips . ` ` i ' m ready to make an honest woman out of you , megan . ' ' pesh threw his head back and laughed . ` ` only you would say something like that . ' ' ` ` hey , the wedding isthe best . ' ' the service ended , and pesh led her back to their table . after they left with the check from pesh ' s father , dessert was served . megan could t ' not eat all the food that was ordered for her . she lost count of how many plates of traditional chinese food she ate . by the time the food came out , she was completely starved and could t ' t eat anymore . ` ` let ' s go eat , ' ' she said when pesh politely set down her dessert . ` ` sounds good to me , ' ' he replied , slowly rising out of his seat . they made their way through the maze of tables , talking to family and friends . megan was introduced to so many of pesh ' s friends that she was sure she would never be able to meet them all . when they finally got to the other table filled with her cousins and cousins and uncles , she was surprised when pesh took a seat across from aidan and emma . after they had been seated for a while , emma asked aidan . ` ` do you think he ' s okay ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` i ' m sure he ' s fine , emma . the doctor was very concerned . ' ' although emma washer friend , megan could tell that she wasn wasn ' t happy . both mason and emma were alone in the suite with someone outside of their family for the first time in their entire lives . megan understood a little of emma ' s anxiety , but when she finally dropped mason off at the hotel , he seemed to get along with the staff they had hired . ` ` she should just go check in on him . you know , make sure she gets him to talk , ' ' emma said , getting out of her car .
