for the past week , i ' ve just been living in our old house , trying my best to help my mom with getting her old job back and becoming a tutor , but there really is ain ' t much for me to do . i felt both relief and fear when it was finally time to go back home to charlottesville . relief because i ' ll have something to occupy my time , and fear because i might run into nate on campus . honestly , i had hoped that he would try to get in touch with me after my mom and i left here , but he said ##n ' t . that really was stupid of me . i told him that i loved him , and he did n ' t say anything back . simple as that . even if he was lying , there must have been some truth to his words when he told me i still wasn ' t talking to him . i glance at the clock . just after nine - almost time for my morning shift in the cafeteria to be over . i change into my work clothes and head downstairs . at least i know i wo ##n ' t run into nate again - the schools all have a separate dining hall with much better and more delicious food . i open my door to the cafeteria , smiling .##ly sees a new girl a few doors down . she enters her classroom at the same time . i walk away , keeping my head down , not really wanting to deal with anyone i know . i leave the dining hall and walk over to the back door , out into the hallway . ` ` hi , brynn ! ' ' roberta , my teacher , waves to me from the desk by the door , where she ' s doing some homework . i wave back and walk over . ` ` there ' s been an issue with your work - schedule , ' ' she tells me , as i approach her . ` ` what problem ? ' ' i ask her . ` ` do you know what it is ? ' ' ` ` something related to your classes - that ' s what the principal ' s office told me when they called . ' ' i rub my forehead in frustration . this is the last thing i want . ` ` if you go over to them right now , you might be able to talk to someone who knows more than you do . ' ' i nod . ` ` okay , ' ' she says , before continuing with her work . i walk out of the dining hall and follow roberta ' s directions to see if i can find any more information , but i know she 'look what happened . my mom has been so upset lately , i think she wants to make a bid for the portion of the scholarship that we still have . i explain the situation to the receptionist in charge , who directs me toward the person in charge of the work - study program . a man in his early thirties stands to greet me as i walk through the glass door of his office . ` ` francis delton , ' ' he introduces himself , shaking my hand . ` ` how can i help you ? ' ' ` ` well , i was told there ' s an issue with my work - study program , or with my grades , or something , ' ' i reply , trying to tug at my hair and finding it ' s pulled back into a ponytail . ` ` so , your name ? ' ' he asks , sitting down and pulling me into the chair across from him . ` ` brynn atwell , ' ' i reply , spelling it out for him . he types my name into his computer and then looks around for a moment . ` ` ah , this is very interesting , ' ' he says , raising his eyebrows at his assistant . ` ` yes . . . ' ' i respond quickly . ` ` you will no longer be in the work - studyalso , because your tuition has been paid in full . ' ' i stare at him . ` ` you mean , for this semester ? ' ' ` ` no , i took all of your classes . ' ' i shake my head , unable to answer him . ` ` for this semester ? no . . . i mean , not at all ? ' ' he nods . ` ` ' right . ' ' ` ` ' that ' s . . . that ' s great . how ? why ? ' ' i ask . ` ` i have no idea . i can only assume that you ' re eligible for the scholarship . ' ' ` ` ok , ok , ' ' i say , trying to gather my thoughts . ` ` thank you . thank you so much . ' ' i walk out of his office and out onto the balcony . with dad and my mom recently divorced , i knew i ' d have the same thing to deal with later , and i took it in stride . i was used to the pressure , though . what the hell ' s going on ? i reach into my back pocket and call my mom . i have no idea if she ' ll answer yet , but i can at least tell her the good news . ` ` hey , brynn ! bryn##n , i was just calling to tell you ! ' ' she says when she picks up . ` ` let me guess , is this about my tuition ? ' ' i ask , with surprise in her voice . ` ` yes ! how did you know ? ' ' ` ` well , i showed up for my lunch in the dining hall , and was told that my tuition ' s being taken care of . what ' s going on ? ' ' ` ` i was actually just picking up the phone to tell you . . . it all happened so fast this morning .
