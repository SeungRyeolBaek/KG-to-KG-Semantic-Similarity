he pulls back a second time , and when he does , my lips part in surprise at my body ' s reaction . i think he can tell that i ' m starting to respond to the touch , because he begins to move a little faster . ` ` oh , nate , that feels . . . that feels . . . ' ' i trail off . there are no words . i just wrap my legs around his waist and thread my fingers into his hair as he moves against me , and the sensations roll through my body . his lips find mine again , kissing me with a passion that matches the frantic pace he ' s setting . i feel an orgasm begin to build inside me . i ' ve had one before , usually an intense one with nate , but this one is different . it ' s so intense that it scares me . i press down against it , holding my breath to keep it at bay . but everything nate is doing is working against me . i feel his hands go to my hips , and my back arches against the length of his body . he kisses my neck as i open to him , and his tongue finds sensitive and sensitive nerve endings to take me to the edge . ` ` oh , nate , it ' s too much . . . ' ' i gasp, closing my eyes . ` ` i ' don ' t know if i can . ' ' he looks down for a moment . ` ` brynn , you ' re coming with me , ' ' he says , his dark eyes meeting mine , love and desire burning in them . ` ` you just have to let go . let go with me . ' ' he starts to sit up , but his eyes do ##n ' t leave mine . i take his hand , trying to let the orgasm take me rather than trying to fight it . ` ` oh , god , brynn , ' ' he says . my eyes roll back in my head . he pushes his fingers into me again , pushing his fingers into me . i feel myself begin to feel as if i ' m outside of my own body . his body arches inside of me and he pushes in a little more . the very different sensation is enough to send me right over the edge . i almost lose it , my body exploding with pleasure of its own accord . i can still feel him moving on top of me , his sweat dripping down onto my back . he rolls on top of me and i bury my face into his neck . his body heat is right there on top of me . i feel like icould stay like this forever . chapter twenty - two i wake up to warm lips on my neck . my eyes pop open in surprise . ` ` mmm ? ' ' i whisper softly . ` ` you passed out , ' ' i hear nate whisper back . i realize he ' s still on top of me - and inside me . ` ` oh , sorry , ' ' i say , relaxing a little . ` ` i guess i just don ' t make that much noise . ' ' he laughs . ` ` actually , i think if they ' d said anything , we would have heard about it by now . ' ' ` ` how long was i asleep for ? ' ' ` ` about ten minutes or so . i was afraid i was going to hurt you . ' ' he kisses my neck and then lies down . i feel him at the end of the bed as he pulls out of me . the sensation of him on my body is overwhelming , and i lie there for a minute , absorbing it , before he goes to the bathroom . he comes back with a box of his boxers and i sit up to take them from him . ` ` it ' s okay , ' ' he says . ` ` lie down . ' ' i nod , and follow himquickly kissing down the inside of my arm , and i start to giggle . he turns and looks at me with a confused expression . ` ` i ' m sorry , i just - i never thought i ' d be in this bed with nate thornhill ! ' ' i gasp . he shakes his head with a small smile as i continue to giggle . ` ` you moved a little , but you ' didn ' t fit under the covers . that would have been hard to do , ' ' he says as he points to the bed . ` ` you could have just said i missed my mark , ' ' i point out as i pull my arm away and climb under the covers . ` ` yeah , i guess that ' s true , ' ' he says , walking over and crawling into bed next to me . ` ` i can ##n ' t say i ' m not a virgin yet , ' ' i say as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me close . ` ` i was beginning to think it would never happen . ' ' ` ` so . . . you liked it ? ' ' he asks , running his fingers up and down my back . i ' m surprised to feel my body relax instantly , even though i really didn ' t .had a mind - blowing orgasm ten minutes ago . ` ` are you kidding me ? ' ' i ask , raising my eyebrows at him . ` ` what about me ? because i . . . ' ' ` ` you were there , ' ' he tells me . ` ` it was different , though . ' ' ` ` different , how ? ' ' i ask , confused . he shrugs . ` ` i don ' t ' t ' remember the women i was with . or my feelings for them .
