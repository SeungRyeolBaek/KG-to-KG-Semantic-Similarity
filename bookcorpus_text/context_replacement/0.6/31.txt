` ` yes , sir . ' ' ` ` did you have trouble maintaining your erection ? ' ' ` ` you could once again point out that you had no knowledge of how well i was able to control myself once again , but i ' ll decline . otherwise , i ' ll say yes . ' ' ` ` ha , ha , nice way to get your point across . ' ' ` ` i had to try . ' ' she shook her head at him , giving him a sly smile . ` ` if the patient was able to resist as much as you did during my session , then i would like to inform him that i am a doctor . ' ' ` ` i understand . please forgive me for trying to undermine your authority . ' ' ` ` you ' re dismissed . . . for that . ' ' he took a long sip of his iced tea . ` ` you did very well in there . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` yes , you did . for that to be your first time on your job , you had to pull yourself together and to give the patient the best level of care and treatment you could . ' ' she could couldn ' t help the heat rising to her cheeks that his compliment caused . ` ` thank you .i appreciate your concern . ' ' ` ` i think you ' re going to make an excellent assistant . i doubt that there will be any company willing to hire you . ' ' megan shook her head . ` ` i ' don ' t know about that . ' ' ` ` i ##n ' t doubt your abilities . ' ' ` ` you think they would want to keep you here ? ' ' she asked . his eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` you would ##n ' t want a permanent position here ? ' ' she asked . ` ` it ' ##n ' t been long , and i have been happy here . i like the people i work with . i know i would don ' t want to go into the hospital when i realize what i have become . ' ' he took a bite of his sandwich . ` ` that ' s true . ' ' after wiping his mouth , he looked at her . ` ` i think they would be foolish not to make you their assistant . ' ' ` ` i hope so . ' ' leaning forward over his plate , he met her gaze . the way in which he looked at her caused her to blush . she really don ' t like the effect he was having on her in the middle of the crowded restaurant .a myriad of emotions raced through her - excitement , fear , happiness , love . she had hadn ' t experienced that kind of emotion with a man in a long , long time . finally , he spoke . ` ` you know it would make me very happy to have you back , and i would do everything in my power to ensure you are . ' ' before she could respond , a tray slid down onto the table next to her . one of the doctors , a young man named dr . morris , smiled at the two of them . ` ` ah , i see you two have had a good session . ' ' ` ` yes , we have , ' ' megan replied . she ' didn ' t dare look over at pesh to see his reaction after being interrupted . dr . morris laughed . ` ` oh come on . spare me the dirty talk . i just haven ' t gotten to experience one of those lately . the only sexual experience i ' ve had was when some woman tried to remove his penis , and they got stuck . ' ' when megan wrinkled her nose , pesh ' s voice startled her . her gaze flew to him , and he smiled . ` ` i told you that the drinks we had in here were not very good . '' ` ` i ' m starting to like you , ' ' she said , with a smile . somehow she managed to eat the rest of her dinner while pesh told dr . wells the ins and outs of the case . when she finished , she shot out of her chair . ` ` i guess i should get going . you know , with everything being so weird . ' ' however , pesh did ne ' er stand up nor did he try to walk her out . instead , she saw the look on his face that told her he was letting her go and there would be no questions raised between the two of them . ` ` thank you for dinner , ' ' she said . ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' he replied , with a smile . his words were starting to do something to her that she really don ' t understand . they were no longer setting her insides on fire ; instead , they were making her want to spend time with him . she quickly slung her purse over her shoulder and walked out of the room . with the crowd around her , she could put pesh out of her mind for the rest of the day . chapter 8 after two more hours of her clinicals , megan was ready for a little randr . but she hadespecially when emma called her asking if she wanted to join her for a valentine ' s day . she was even more thrilled when emma heard that aidan was going to marry noah , so she and noah could be together . even though she was sure her parents would have loved him , she hated relying on them so much . an hour after the call , she was pulling into aidan and emma ' s driveway . when she opened the door to let noah out , he was practically jumping up and down in his car screaming with excitement .
