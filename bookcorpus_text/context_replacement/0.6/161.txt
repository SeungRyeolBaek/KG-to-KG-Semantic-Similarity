there ' s a long silence , and i begin to feel uncomfortable . ` ` it ' s eileen . . . nate ' s mom . ' ' i almost drop the phone in shock . ` ` i , um , i don ' t - ' ' ` ` please ! please , please , ' ' i hang up . i just heard the news , and thought that nate might be willing to talk to me again . ' ' ` ` i do don ' t care . ' ' ` ` because he ' ll learn the truth about me , and then maybe he wo ##n ' ll believe what he says about me . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry , i do don ' t think i should be in the middle of this . ' ' there she is . ` ` please , please . . . ' ' i hear her sigh and the soft sound of crying . ` ` i just haven ' t talked to nate in so long . . . he ' s my everything , he ' s my everything . ' ' ` ` and you had to leave him . . . ' ' ` ` is that what he told you ? ' ' ` ` yes , nate . ' ' ` ` he kept it from me . i left him because he was cheating on me . 'nate was used to doing everything his own way , and he was right . he was the one with the money , he went into the office with me , and signed the pre - nup . i mean , i never even looked at the papers at the time - i thought we ' d be together forever . pierce was an excellent lawyer and managed to get full custody in the end . i never had the chance . i ' ve been trying to get in touch with nate for months to tell him the truth . . . i love you , and nate . i would never leave my son . i never would have left him , even if he was cheating on me , if i had known i ' d never see my son again . i thought after seeing this news on tv , that you ' d tell me . . . ' ' she bursts into tears . ` ` eileen , eileen , it ' s me , ' ' i say , feeling sick . something about what she ' s telling me is wrong . i can feel it in my bones . ` ` i want to believe you , but . . . nate , he ' s very worried about his son . i just don ' t know what i can do . ' ' ` ` i know , and i ' msorry to spring this on you . i called the police , and am going to call nate , and i was really hoping that you would pick up nate and then hang up on me . ' ' a noise behind me makes me turn around . carl is standing in the doorway to the living room . ` ` everything ok ? ' ' he asks . ` ` yep , everything ' s ok , love , ' ' i whisper so that eileen can hear me . ` ` just write down my number , okay ? ' ' eileen says quietly . ` ` okay , just tell him what i said . ' ' i write the number down on a small pad on the table , aware that he is watching me . ` ` # ##cha , love . talk to you soon , ' ' i say , and hang up . ` ` not a stalker , i hope , ' ' he says with a small smile . ` ` no , just a friend , ' ' i say as quickly as possible , and tear the paper off the pad and shove it in my pocket . ` ` well , this has been the worst day of my life , ' ' he says with a sigh , running his hand through his hair . ` ` i hope you and your friend don ' ' not get alonginto anything . there will be some people hanging out at the office tonight . probably best to just ignore them . ' ' ` ` sure , no problem . ' ' he looks genuinely sad , and i find myself almost feeling sorry for him . he seems so normal right now that it ' s hard to imagine what eileen and this other woman are thinking about him . the man in front of me paints me a different picture . ` ` on the other hand , olivia , i ' m glad that you and your sister are here right now . maybe it ' s because of her . but i ' don ' t think i ' d make it through all this without her . she ' s really brought life back into my life . ' ' ` ` she ' s . . . yeah , she ' s great , ' ' i say quietly . ` ` are you having a good time at the office ? not too much excitement today , i hope . ' ' ` ` no , not at all , really . everything ' s fine , thank you . ' ' he smiles . ` ` well , i should get back to work . you ' d think i ' d have had a lot done , considering how long i ' ve been in town , but i ' ve just been busy with thegoodnight . ' ' ` ` okay , baby , i ' ll see you tomorrow night . ' ' ` ` ' goodnight . ' ' ` ` goodnight . ' ' i walk back home with the phone still burning a hole in my pocket . it ' s amazing to me that i ' ve gone from being so sure that he was lying , to feeling like i ' ve betrayed his trust in the course of a single conversation with him . is he telling the truth , or does he just have the real ##ist ' s ability to tell the truth for himself ? i get ready for bed slowly , my mind racing ahead .
