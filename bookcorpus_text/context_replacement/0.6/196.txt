` ` you ' ve really changed this summer , brynn . you ' ve become a star , ' ' he says , leaning into me . i can feel his hot breath on my neck . ` ` i need you to stay away from me , ' ' i whisper , my throat tight . ` ` just for a minute . . . i need to know . . . ' ' he says softly , sliding his hands onto my back and smoothing over my skin . my body responds at his touch , burning with my anger . i bring my hands up between us and push him away . ` ` get off me , you fucking bastard ! ' ' i scream . he stares at me in disbelief . ` ` you think you ' re a celebrity with your expensive clothes and your money , when really you ' re just a cheap fuck , taking advantage of anyone you meet . i know who you really are , even if no one else does . ' ' his face twists with anger , and i feel my face f ##en with pain before my brain can register that he ' s slapped me . i bring my hands up to my own face , my head being jerked to the side , watching as he disappears in a blur . i look up with a gasp when i seenate has already knocked him to the ground , and they are both rolling around on the kitchen floor . ` ` ' don ' t you dare touch her ! ' ' nate yells at his father , whose face is turning red in an attempt to defend himself against his much larger opponent . i hear voices from the kitchen and see my dad running down the stairs and have to stop myself . ` ` nate ! nate , stop ! ' ' i yell , as nate struggles to regain the standing position . my dad screams and nate punches him hard in his face . i throw myself onto nate ' s chest and he pulls his arm back in preparation for another punch . ` ` nate , i ' m ok , i ' m ok , ' ' i whisper in his ear . i feel him relax a little and try to help him up . he drops his arms and stands up with nate . nate pushes him back . he stands up , too , and they face off , nate breathing heavily , nate with a trickle of blood coming from the corner of his mouth . ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' my mom finally asks , her voice full of concern . ` ` i know everything , ' ' nate says , facing his father . ` ` you hypoc##rite . ' ' to my surprise , nate begins to laugh . ` ` i knew it , i knew it ! look at you two ! ' ' he says , pointing at us . ` ` what ' s he laughing at ? ' ' my mom asks , looking at me . ` ` they ' re fighting ! ' ' nate cries out . ` ` what . . . what ? ' ' my mom asks . ` ` oh , god , nate , are you really that fucking stupid ? you ' ' ' not even close ? ' ' my mom shakes her head . ` ` that ' s why you ' re laughing ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' nate says , turning to her . ` ` i saw him trying to pick up brynn , and then she told him to stop , and he hit her . ' ' a look of horror spreads across my mom ' s face . she looks at me , then at nate . ` ` is this true ? is this true ? ' ' he ' doesn ' t even bother responding to her question , just turns his face away and screams . a strangled cry escapes my mom ' s lips . for a moment i think she ' s going to faint , but instead she throws herself at him , her face a blur .she ignores him . ` ` i trusted you ! i trusted you ! ' ' she screams . he throws his hands up to protect himself . nate steps forward and wraps his arms around her , breathing her in and then pushing her away . ` ` my own daughter ! my own daughter , you son of a bitch ! ' ' with a strangled cry , she shakes her head and begins to cry against nate ' s chest . pierce joins the three of us , huddled against him on the other side of the door . ` ` what ? ' ' nate asks , as he touches my father ' s shoulder . ` ` you got anything to say for yourself ? ' ' ` ` come on , nate . you ' re not going to tell them ? ' ' pierce asks , a look of disgust on his face . ` ` i did don ' t want to - i saw you with my own eyes . maybe i should have told brynn in the first place , ' ' nate says calmly , but i can hear the anger in his voice . he can only manage a snort of air as he turns toward the door . ` ` my fault , ' ' nate says , and then turns , his back turned toward his father . ` ` you set everything up , right ? 'do you ? ' ' he stands there for a moment , his head slightly tilted to the side . i ca n ' t imagine his expression , and ca n ' t imagine what could be going on inside his head . his carefully constructed world , slowly falling apart around him . he shakes his head slowly , as if wiping away an unpleasant memory , and turns to walk down the hall . he goes straight to the front door , and closes it behind him . when we hear the sound of his car driving up the driveway , my mother looks up , and nate ' s hands fall to his sides .
