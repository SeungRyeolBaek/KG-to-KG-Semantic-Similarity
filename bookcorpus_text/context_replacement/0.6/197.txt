` ` i need to be alone for a little while , ' ' she says , her eyes on the floor , and walks slowly toward the door . i watch her go , wishing she had the chance to touch me for just a second . ` ` she ' s just in shock , ' ' nate says , reading my mind as well . ` ` i know , ' ' i say with a sigh , trying to pull myself together . ` ` i should have told you . ' ' ` ` i had no reason to believe . ' ' ` ` i know . i either could ' ' not believe she was capable of that kind of thing , or that i did don ' t want to believe . ' ' ` ` you said some horrible things to me today . wait , was that for me ? ' ' i ask with a small smile , reaching up to rub my eyes . ` ` i ' m so sorry , brynn . it was just . . . just my fault . . . i ' didn ' t mean any of those things . the time we ' ve spent together - ' ' he stops , taking a step toward me . ` ` no , baby . i ' m so sorry for that . i just don ' t know if we can go back. . . ' ' i whisper , a tear rolling down my cheek . ` ` brynn , please , i just don ' t love you . ' ' ` ` you were so ready to cheat on me , ' ' i whisper . ` ` so ready to push me away and be done with it . ' ' ` ` i was in shock at seeing her die . i thought ##n ' t you feel it . ' ' ` ` ' you felt it , ' ##n ' t you ? the way i feel about you . . . i would never want you that way , would never want you to hurt . but you want me to hurt . you ca don ' t feel the way about me that i feel about you . you just don ' t . ' ' ` ` that ' s not true ! you have no idea how much i care about - ' ' ` ` i love you . ' ' there ' s a long silence . i look up into his beautiful face , my heart breaking . i still don ' t respond . he just looks back down at me , a deep emotion playing across his face . ` ` well , there you go . there you go . goodbye , nate , ' ' i say , turning my back to him . ' 'wasn ' t anything . ` ` what are you going to do ? ' ' he finally asks me . ` ` um , well , ' ' i say with a nervous laugh . ` ` i think i ' m going to eat this last cream cheese sandwich , and then i ' m going to start packing . ' ' chapter twenty - two i drive my mom ' s old beat - up station wagon . both the car and our old house were just on the verge of being destroyed , but my mom was able to hold on . maybe she was spending her time in the house because she was ##n ' t that she had to worry about us anymore . the house was wasn ' t even hers - the only things that mattered to us anymore were our cars and our knick - ups . it only took us a few minutes this morning to fix it up . it ' s so familiar and comforting . our old house is still waiting for us , almost as if this whole thing never happened . which of course it did . i asked last night if i would bring these last few things back if i could . if i was doing a magic spell that could make it appear that my mom had never left me , that we ' d returned to our old lives for the summer ,that my time with nate had ever extended beyond that night at the pool hall , would i have it ? i honestly don ' t know if i ' ve ever felt as much pain as i do now , and certainly not as much joy . i was living in such a tight little bubble before , never really knowing the depth or breadth of anything , and i know you can ##n ' t have one without the other . to not have my nate in my life . . . no , i can ##n ' t have that . despite so many horrible things that happened , i would never want to forget the time i spent with him , even if it would take away the pain i ' m feeling right now . the pain that i can feel even in my head , like a throbbing ache in my entire body . it ' s like i ' m suffering from a mysterious , unknown substance . one that i know only kills you in the end . i caught a glimpse of my own swollen face through the kitchen window from where nate caught me last night . we have haven ' t seen him since - he must be staying over at a friend ' s house or a motel . i do don ' t even want to think of the legal proceedings that my parents will be wrapping up .no . i hear the front door open behind me and think - could it be nate coming to say goodbye ? maybe it ' s my mother , carrying a very small box , her eyes covered by small , dark sunglasses . ` ` ready ? ' ' she asks , without looking at me . i nod , and remember one more thing i ' ve forgotten . ` ` i ' ll be right back , ' ' i say , and walk out of the front door without turning . i walk back up the stairs and down the hall into my room . it looks exactly the same as the last time i saw it .
