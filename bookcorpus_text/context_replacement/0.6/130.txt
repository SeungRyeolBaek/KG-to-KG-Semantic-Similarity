on the way to the car i sat across from her and she kept giving me dirty looks . i kept my back straight , and my fists clenched as they clenched between my legs . if i did anything else i ' m afraid i would hurt her myself . as soon as we got to the front of house i grabbed her hand and headed for the bedroom and over to where i dropped the belt i wanted to slap her face . ` ` no , you ca n ' me . ' ' she tried to pull away from me which only angered me more . i grabbed the belt and was about to pull it down over her head , not even trying to get her attention i was so angry . ` ` i ' m pregnant . ' ' holy f * * k , that just stopped me in my tracks . ` ` what did you say ? ' ' ` ` you ca don ' t tell me , i ' m pregnant . ' ' i dropped the belt and looked down at her . there was something else going on with my heart . it was beating again , and the pressure was building again . i felt a buzzing in my head and so fast i lost it all for a second . ` ` you ' re pregnant ? ' ' i pulled her up to myin front of me . she sighed and looked down at her hands . ` ` why did ##n ' t you tell me ? ' ' ` ` i just found out , i was going to tell you , but i asked you that question this morning and you cut me off . ' ' the silence seemed to reflect her anger and she glared at me . ` ` i really wasn ' t going to try to fool you with a lie , i just don ' t want to marry someone who does don ' t even love me for me , i ' ve had that ass * * le in my life already . ' ' i grabbed her arm and pulled her to her feet . ` ` i told you not to throw that f * * k in my face . just because you ' re carrying my child , you think for one second that i wo ##n ' t knock your sorry ass up . ` ` what the f * * k ever gave you the idea that i just don ' t want to marry you ? ' ' ` ` you know . . . ' ' she lowered her voice and started to cry . ` ` shut your f * * king mouth , you ' re walking on thin f * * king ice . what the f * * k ever gave you the idea thati ' m the only one that wants his life to belong to him ? that ' s my life , not f * * king yours no matter what some stupid new york f * * k says . ' ' ` ` ' it ' ##n ' t seem like you ' gon ' know , but if you do , you ' ll just know it was all because of your bastard brother . ' ' i followed her into the kitchen and over to the safe she kept in there . it took me a few minutes to get the idea i hated that f * * king bastard . from the safe i removed the black leather box i ' d kept hidden for years . ` ` i got this two days after we left . i was waiting for you to be done with this before giving it to you . ` ` well , . . . ' ' ` ` forget it , i told you , ' wo don ' t apologize for what that ass * * le did to you . remember that that ' s why let ' s talk about that stunt you pulled tonight . ' ' ` ` i thought you ' didn ' t want to , i mean . . . ' ' ` ` ' you wanted to get back at me for doing something that was going to piss me off . as a kidfor the night ahead , you will not even have to piss me off . i ' ll be honest with you when it comes to some things , but your attitude will not be tolerated , and never , ever . ` ` you want me to kick your ass you pull a stunt like this again . if you say no it means f * * king shit . you hear me ? ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' she nodded . ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' ` ` you ' re too f * * king beautiful for your own good . i ' m not sure if i should let this happen , but i really don ' t want the news of my baby ' s birth to be spread by this f * * kery , and since you ' ve accepted my proposal you can live with that fact . ' ' i took the ring from her hand and placed the two - inch diamond on her finger . this was not how i ' d planned this to go . i ' d had everything planned out . i was going to take her to italy since that was her favorite place and propose to her there at one of their # ##rated italian restaurants . that ' s not my home , it ' s hers . i was going to giveanything to make the night better . i didn t ' even make love to her that night . not because of any reason or anything like that , i guess i was just thinking a lot if you ' ll believe the truth . i ' d gone from being proud and wanting to crawl inside her body , to thinking that i was going to be a father and a grandfather . so i helped her get ready for bed and watched her as she sank into the exhaustion of the long day and night . once again i remembered my father , the always waiting , always wanting and always having feeling of happiness . and the hunger , thirst , all the things you would expect from a young man whose mother abandoned him .
