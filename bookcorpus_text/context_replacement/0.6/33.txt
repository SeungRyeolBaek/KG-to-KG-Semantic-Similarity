` ` i thought you guys would never get married . i ' m impressed . ' ' emma nodded . ` ` good . they were a little busy at the hair salon . ' ' they walked through the front door and were immediately greeted by the hostess who wished them well . as they settled into a nice , quiet booth , they took stock of the situation . ` ` you have to order food on our own since we ' re both practically grown - up by now , ' ' casey said . megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` ' ' didn ' t know you were pregnant . ' ' casey laughed . ` ` well , nate still turned me down . ' ' she slowly shook her head . ` ` ' i think he ' s the one in this picture . ' ' ` ` you must ' ve done some hard work , ' ' megan teased . with a smile , casey said , ` ` nate comes from such a large extended and loving family that he ' s been wanting to have a child . we ' ve been married a year and then two , so i figured it was about right . and while he still wasn ' t thrilled with the idea of having a child when his job was so important , his health will be improving by the time the baby isnow . ' ' ` ` when are you due ? ' ' ` ` at the same time , emma . ' ' that almost made emma smile . ` ` our kids are going to be best friends , emma . i just know it . ' ' casey smiled at the thought . ` ` ' boyfriend and girlfriend . . . ' ' ` ` that ' s the idea . ' ' emma jerked her head up . ` ` i ' m not sure i want your son with my baby sister . ' ' with her blue eyes sparkling , casey asked , ` ` and what if it ' s my daughter that your son is with ? ' ' emma laughed . ` ` if my son takes after his father , then that would be the case . but i think we both need to know that if your daughter is anything like you , she ' ll be the one doing the parenting . ' ' casey nodded . ` ` that ' s true . ' ' ` ` maybe we should get him off of her back , huh ? ' ' megan suggested , with a grin . ` ` maybe , ' ' emma agreed . when the waitress arrived to take their drinks and their order , casey fixed megan with an intense stare . ` ` so , ' ' she began , "her looked at megan . ` ` i hear your doing your clinicals under dr . mcdreamy now . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help but smile . ` ` if you say i ' m doing them under dr . nadeen , then the answer is yes . ' ' emma chewed on her bottom lip before answering . ` ` have you been thinking about what happened the night of noah ' s ark ? ' ' before megan could answer , casey ' s eyes widened . ` ` whoa , whoa . hold the fort . something happened between you two ? ' ' megan felt heat rise to her cheeks . it was almost too much to admit , but still , she filled casey in on each and every little detail that had happened . ` ` yeah , he ' s pretty freakin ' hot , ' ' ' is he ? ' ' casey asked . ` ` yes , he is , ' ' megan agreed , nodding . emma shook her head . ` ` there ' s nothing wrong with his personality . that ' s what drew me to him in the first place . there are very few gentlemen left on the planet . ' ' before she could stop herself , megan continued , ` ` ' i ' hadn ' t wanted a relationship . i wanted to beno . ' ' casey laughed . ` ` ' ' ' do we all ? ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` just when i think your pregnancy hormones have haven ' t made you even more sex ##ier , you go and say something like that , ' ' she teased . megan swirled the straw in her diet coke bottle . ` ` what ' s funny is even though i should have been completely and utterly put off by what happened that night , he ' s still interested in me . i mean , the guy is hot and has all of the girls in the world all over him , and he still wants me . ' ' ` ` ' what ' s the problem ? ' ' emma asked . ` ` he ' s interested in me , not sex . ' ' emma ' s brow furrowed . ` ` why would ##n ' t you want him , if you were dating ? ' ' megan shrugged . ` ` we ' re at a crossroads - i just want some time without him and a movie , and to impress him , he wants to show me a whole new world with a movie . ' ' ` ` how silly of him , ' ' casey said to which emma gave her an arch look . with a sigh , megan said , ` ` 'we ' re going to be strictly in the friend zone because neither one of us is going to give in . ' ' ` ` would it really kill you to go out with the guy ? ' ' casey asked . megan widened her eyes in surprise . ` ` you mean , you of all people are so against me giving in to him ? ' ' she tilted her head back at emma . ` ` i ' d like that much of her , thank you . ' ' casey wiped the corner of her mouth with her napkin . ` ` it ' s just a date . i really don ' t think he ' s going to kidnap you and take you to a wedding reception . ' '
