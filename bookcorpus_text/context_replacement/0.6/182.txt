` ` oh , hi . ' ' i look up as nate slowly opens the door from outside . he smiles at me and i quickly bury my face back in my hands so that my mom ' s ' dad see the blush spreading across my cheeks . ` ` still tired from your morning run , nate ? ' ' my mom asks as she begins to pour herself some coffee . ` ` you ' re still taking up time off work . ' ' ` ` must ' ve been that bad , ' ' nate replies dryly . ` ` how ' s your cast ? ' ' ` ` much better , ' ' i reply , pulling it out from under the table and holding it up to him . ` ` gotta keep the cast on for another day just to be safe . ' ' ` ` that ' s exactly what i was thinking . ' ' ` ` anybody want some tea ? i ' m just putting some coffee on , ' ' my mom cuts in . ` ` yes , please , ' ' we all reply . ` ` you know , i ' m so glad you two are getting along . that ' love ' word has such a bad meaning , i guess because of the . . . you know , the old ways . and of course ,' a big family can be such a good thing , ' ' she says , turning off the heat on the stovetop . i watch her for a moment , wondering if she ' s going to bring up something about what pierce said to her last night , or how she came to be involved in pierce ' s cruel treatment of his family . ` ` very good , ' ' nate replies quietly , not looking at me . i glare at him warningly . now is definitely not the time for any of his smartass comments . ` ` callie and i are going to the farmer ' s market in half an hour . you guys want to come ? ' ' and have the chance to be alone with nate ? ` ` i was thinking i was just going to sit by the fire tonight , ' ' i reply . ` ` give my leg a little more time to heal . ' ' ` ` probably not , ' ' my dad replies . ` ` what about you , nate ? ' ' ` ` i have to , um . . . ' ' he trails off , trying to come up with an excuse . ` ` you know , i know my friend callie will come by tomorrow , so you can stay here . ' ' ` ` nate , stop the small talk , '' my mom with a heavy sigh . nate and my mom both leave the table to take their plates into their rooms , where i can continue eating my breakfast in peace . after i clean up my mess , i decide to go into the kitchen and turn on the tv . my stomach refuses to eat that delicious breakfast i just made . nate and my mom pass me by the chairs on their way out the door , and i wave back . but as soon as the door closes , a ball of anxiety forms in my stomach . i ' m here with nate . i feel like a kid on christmas morning . i push away the feeling and get up , heading for the hall and nate ' s room . a wave of relief hits me as i walk down the hall and knock softly on his door . ` ` one sec ! ' ' he calls out . ` ` yeah , come in . ' ' i push the door open to find him standing just inside his room , a white towel wrapped around his waist . he ' s soaking wet , having only just gotten out of the shower . ` ` hey , it ' s you , ' ' he says with a smile . i close the door behind me . ` ` they just left . ' ' ` ` how are you feeling ,why ? i wanted to make sure you # ##n ' t move too fast last night . any regrets ? ' ' i step toward him . ` ` i do have a question . ' ' he frowns in confusion , his handsome face marred by a line drawn between his brows . ` ` there was something i wanted to do last night , but i just didn ' t get the chance . ' ' the tension slowly leaves his body . ` ` which was ? ' ' he asks , the corners of his mouth turning up in a half smile . i step forward and grab his shirt in seconds , then stand in front of him . i watch his body grow hard in front of my eyes as he stares down at me . without a word , i slide my hands down the front of his jeans , feeling his hard muscles beneath my fingertips just before it reaches the swell of his stomach . i lean forward , planting kisses just below his belly button . he smells delicious - the spicy scent of his shower gel with the very familiar scent of his cologne . it ' s unlike anything i ' ve smelled before , and since i ' haven ' t been with anyone else , i know the scent is uniquely his own . i wrap my arms around the back of his neck as i kissmy hand and touch the tip of his shaft . his body bucks up in response to my touch , and i hear him groan . i wrap my hand around him , pulling him toward my mouth . i flick my tongue gently around his tip , drawing out the drop of moisture that had just been there . i move to the base of his shaft , pressing my lips together gently as i kiss my way back up the length of his shaft , then swirl my tongue around his tip .
