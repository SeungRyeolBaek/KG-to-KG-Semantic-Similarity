` ` speaking of being on the job , roderick called him steven pierce , ' ' greg says , referencing pierce ' s business card . i frown . ` ` wow ! is there even a steven in there ? ' ' ` ` nope ! that ' s the worst part . pierce said that he was sort of . . . ' ' greg shakes his head sadly . ` ` how come pierce ' s ? ' ' ' not working at thornhill and co . ? did he ' t want to go with his dad ? ' ' ` ` um , the opposite , actually . pierce was really hard on nate . . . i felt kind of bad about the whole thing because i knew nate wanted the job , and that pierce gave it to me to help him . i wanted not to go , but i did , and we ' d just met , you know ? i really don ' t want to go there . not to mention , my mom and dad really haven ' t known each other for that long , and i was a little taken aback by how far they ' d come along . . . ' ' i bite my lip . ` ` sorry , greg . i ' m sorry . ' ' ` ` it ' s okay , i get it . my parents are very, really . ' ' ` ` no , they ' ain ' never been married . they just ain ' t married in the first place , ' ' i say . but greg ' s ' is listening - he ' s standing at the entrance to the restaurant . ` ` speaking of . . . ' ' ' is that nate here ? did you tell him we were coming here ? ' ' ` ` yeah , what ? ` ` ain ' t that him , ' ' i say , turning around to look . and sure enough , there he is , with the little girl on his arm . that nate ! there ' s no way this is a date - he must have overheard me telling my parents that greg was meeting me here . ` ` brynn ! ' ' nate says with a grin , waving his date over as the waiter approaches them . ` ` # # ##n ' ' ' you guys were coming here ? ! greg , right ? i ' m nate . ' ' ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' greg says , shaking his outstretched hand . ` ` and this is sophie , ' ' nate says , introducing his date . ` ` hey , ' ' she says , looking up for a moment from the menu in her hand . ` ` thank you` want to sit down ? ' ' the hostess asks . ` ` we could pull a table over . ' ' i could ask her . ` ` what do you think ? ' ' nate asks greg , his anger returning full - force . ` ` um , sure , sure , why not ? ' ' greg replies . i slowly stand and make my way over to greg as the waiter and the hostess pull a second table over . i ' m not going to sit next to nate and have a repeat of that ass - kicking incident . ` ` i ' ll let you two sit next to each other , ' ' i say with a small smile as i take a seat next to greg . ` ` we already have and you ' re not that far away , ' ' greg says as the waiter hands nate and sophie plates . ` ` could we get a picture of dom for the table ? ' ' nate asks the hostess , who nods once and walks away . ` ` nate , you - ' ' you have to - ' ' greg begins . ` ` yes , i do . we ' re not your friends tonight , ' ' nate says firmly . ` ` we told you , ' ' sophie pipes up , quickly covering herright now . i narrow my eyes at nate and he just avoids my gaze . ` ` so , what were you two guys talking about when we got here ? ' ' nate asks greg . ` ` nothing , really , ' ' greg says looking at nate . ` ` you know , with your blond hair , you two could almost be twins . twins , maybe , ' ' nate says , leaning back in his chair . i playfully kick his leg under the table . i see his jaw drop and he ' doesn ' t even make a sound . ` ` oh my god , nate ! ' ' sophie says . ` ` i went out with my cousin nate , but i ' didn ' t know he was my cousin at the time . and then it happened and . . . ' ' i look at nate . sophie launches into her story , and nate looks over at me . it ' s going to be a long night . chapter twelve i twist around in nate ' s leather chair as he closes his office door behind him . i ' ve been sitting there , frozen , ever since greg dropped me off ten minutes ago . ` ` hey ! what are you , a disney character ? ' ' he asks , sounding amused . ` ` what were you thinking ? !i think you did that on purpose to ruin my night , you know ! ' ' nate laughs . ` ` come on , you really mean to tell me you were having a great time when you got here ? ' ' ` ` oh , so you were just checking me out , is that it ? greg was totally weirded out by the whole thing . ' ' ` ` sophie had a great time . ' ' ` ` sophie , really ! where ' d you meet her ? the high school dance ? ' ' ` ` i like her , ' ' nate says with a sly smile as he sits on his bed . ` ` oh , yeah ? then why are ##n ' ing you with her right now ?
