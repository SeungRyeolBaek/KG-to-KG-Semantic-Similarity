` ` well , i ' n ' you will . ' ' ` ` take care of the problem shiane . ` i will . ' don ' t forget , i ' m a lawyer . it makes no sense whatsoever for you to rent that house and pay the same price for an empty apartment . i know that you both have doubts and fears , but i ' m not going to let them get in the way of this . i ' ve spent the last two years trying to convince you , but all that ' thinking ' was working . you ' re just gon ' have to decide if you want to take a chance on me or not . a word to the wise : i wo ##n ' t care for anyone else ' s easy - going . so if that ' s what this is about , you better stop that shit right f * * king now . ' ' it looked like we were going to have our first real conversation just for a minute , but then she took off . she needed someone to take charge and i had no problem with that . she ' d gone from under her parents ' roof , down to this lawyer ' s office , and now , she ' d been told what to do her whole life . when people argue against that ,but with shiane , it was just the opposite . she loved me . she left two weeks later for college and i spent the time gathering as much information as i could about her life and the other people around her . i still don ' t remember that club that she ' d told me about , and from some of the things she ' d said , i still wasn ' t so sure that her best friend was being taken advantage of . as her father , it was up to me to ensure that no one was taking advantage of her . and since our relationship had been in the dark so far , it was only a matter of time before it got out . and how would it feel for wall street ' s richest kid to be letting others take advantage of his girl ? we talked every night about her , no matter what time it was , that being a promise that i ' d made before she left . she could stay up during the day because i knew she was busy with work , but at night i needed to know that she was okay . we had facetime until she fell asleep ; this time , i could see that my girl was happy . she seemed to be having fun . there was a lot of stuff in the news about her , but i knewdidn ' t know or understand any of it . that was until two weeks later she was coming back . my wife was in one of those gossip magazines that were filled with half - truths and lies . that ' s how i ' d always read them until i saw my wife walking out of a bar in chicago with her boyfriend . i did ##n ' t want to get on the plane ; the picture on the screen had been taken the night before which had to mean it was where we ' d met and she had hadn ' t mentioned it to me . my first instinct was to get on the plane and fly off her way , after dealing with both of them , but common sense and logic won out . i could ##n ' t fly my way around the world to find her . no , i ' ll wait ' til she comes back and finds her ass in the basement of our old house . that night when she called , she still did ##n ' t do it and she acted like nothing was wrong . there was something in her voice but i still wasn ' t quite sure what it was . ` ` ` you ' ve got your own party tonight , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , and then i ' ll be back . ' ' `` i ' ll be there . ' ' the next morning when she called , i did ##n ' t answer . i ' d spent the entire night in a drunken state and had pretty much locked myself up in my room . i ' d come to terms with the fact that i could ##n ' t believe for a second that she ' d cheated on him , that whatever reason she had for sleeping with him was not good enough . and the fact that she had hadn ' t mentioned it to me , only upset me more . she was crying when i woke up the next morning . when she ran to me and jumped into my arms i held her tight and did ##n ' t with her . she knew something was wrong and her eyes followed me around the room . ` ` is something wrong ? ' ' ` ` is there something you want to tell me shiane ? ' ' she looked at me at first . i pulled out the letter i ' d had hidden in the drawer of the small bedside table and thrust it at her . her eyes widened when she saw it and she looked up at me with tears in her eyes . ` ` it ' s not what it looks like . i can explain . ' ' i walked away from her and into the bathroom to wash mycoat and hat where she found them a few minutes ago . ` ` so . . . ' ' ` ` are you the one that was afraid of me cheating on you ? ' ' she ' d never seen me this way before , and she had no way of knowing that the calm tone and serious expression were a sure sign that her friend was in trouble . ` ` ` i # n ' t know , you cheated on me because we played a few games , and . . . ' ' ` ` and you said ##n ' t tell me this because . . . ' ' ` ` i # n ' t want to cause you pain . ' '
