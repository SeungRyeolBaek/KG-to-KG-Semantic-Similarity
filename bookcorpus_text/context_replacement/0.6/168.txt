i put everything back together as quickly as i can , and then look over at him . his eyes are closed , and he ' s sitting slowly and very still on the edge of the bed . he looks as peaceful as i ' ve ever seen him look , which is really saying something . my heart sinks a little , and i walk to the door and close it behind me . i walk down the hall and into my old room , which suddenly feels cold and empty . i climb into bed without bothering to take off my clothes and pull the covers over me . i ' m no closer to nate thornhill than any of the other women he ' s been with , and i should have known that . stupid , stupid , stupid . i hear a soft knock on the door and pull the covers up a little more , but i ##n ' t move . if it ' s my mom , i do ##n ' t want to see her , and if it ' s nate , i definitely do ##n ' t want to see him . there ' s another knock , a little louder , and then the door is slowly pushed open . i can just see nate ' s face in the doorway . he closes the door behind him and walks into the room . to my surprise , he walks into theout of my bed and to the other side , he jumps up , sitting down on the bed next to me . ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he says , resting his head on his knees . ` ` you ' don ' t need to apologize . you were just being nice . ' ' ` ` yes , i suppose i was . and i ' ll stop messing with you and your people . ' ' i clear my throat to keep the noise down . ` ` okay . ' ' ` ` ' ' don ' t even have any friends . . . ' ' he laughs . ` ` why ? ' ' ` ` olivia and i are , like , best friends , actually . and that ' s what she is , too , so that ' s cool . ' ' ` ` mmm . ' ' ` ` ` i ' d . . . i ' d like us to be friends . ' ' ` ` we ' re like half - siblings , ' ' i choke out . i can hear him breathing next to me . ` ` yes . but that ' isn ' t my problem . ' ' he smiles . ` ` i like you . . . ##uld ' t deny that i ' m attracted to you , of course , but i ' m also .the good kind of guy . not to mention the kind of guy that dating my big brother would bring about . ' ' he smiles . ` ` ' can we be friends ? ' ' i think for a moment . if i ' m nate ' s only real friend , then i definitely feel closer to him . maybe not in the way i ' m most comfortable , but still , it ' s something . ` ` okay . okay , then . well , first , ' ' i turn onto my side and face him . ` ` since we ' re only friends , i want to ask you some non - sexual questions . ' ' ` ` well . . . ' ' he says quickly , turning onto his side , smiling . ` ` am i . . . am i . . . good with all that stuff ? you know . . . ' ' he laughs . ` ` what we just did , you know ? . . you were more than good at it . ' ' i nod . ` ` when did you lose your virginity ? ' ' ` ` when i was sixteen . ' ' ` ` wow . ' ' ` ` she was my mother ' s little sister . ' ' ` ` wow . ' ' ` ` how many girls have you been with ? ' '` ` oh my god , i do n ' t even know . . . ' ' ` ` wait , what ? you do ##n ' t even know ? ' ' ` ` you mean , what ? i do n ' t know . ' ' ` ` sheesh . okay , first question : ' ` ##n ' are you the same kind of person ? ' ' he asks . ` ` i do n ' t know , ' ' he says quietly . ` ` i tried a few times , but that kind of thing , it just made me sad . that ' s all i know . ' ' i nod , grateful he ' s telling me everything he knows , and roll back over onto my back . i love the feeling of lying there with him next to me . i feel way more relaxed than i would have thought possible . i feel my eyes start to drift closed as he pulls me under . ` ` brynn . . . . . . . ' ' i can almost hear nate laughing . ` ` you ' re going to make some people very happy one day . ' ' chapter twelve ` ` i ' m so glad the whole thing has been over , ' ' greg says as we turn onto the road . i smile as i look out at the city .##hizzing around in the office . the woman who accused greg of sexual harassment withdrew her complaint when it turned out she had accused two other office workers of the same thing . ` ` it just seems like he ' s been a presence in the background for the past year . ' ' ` ` maybe , ' ' i reply noncommittally . greg clears his throat as we approach my office . ` ` well , i ' m glad we had the chance to hang out tonight , ' ' he says . ` ` me too , ' ' i reply with a smile . this is our first date , and he still still hasn ' t said anything . i ' m wondering if tonight will be the night .
