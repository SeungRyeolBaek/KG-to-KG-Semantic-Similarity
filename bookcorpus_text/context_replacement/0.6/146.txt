i ' d love to go with you sometime . shopping is fun , my favorite hobby , and you are every woman ' s dream job . ' ' ` ` i really don ' t think i - ' ' i finish my quick reference to our dinner date when i realize that maybe she can afford it . and she looks so damn beautiful in her black skirt and white shirt . ` ` you know , that would be nice . i don ' t ' t know what to wear . ' ' ` ` well , i can help you with that . just try not to wear anything too revealing , mr . thornhill , ' ' she says , rolling her eyes . ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' i reply with a smile . ` ` oh my god , who is that ? ' ' constance asks , breaking away from our embrace to turn and peer out our bedroom door . i follow her to see nate and olivia walking down the hall , toward the elevator bank . they must be having dinner together . ` ` that ' s his name , ' ' i say , quickly sitting up again . ` ` he looks like a football player ! ' ' she says , sitting back down . ` ` um , what were you saying to him - -. thornhill - and you ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' ve never had an idea , but maybe he ' s just not into the ##s , ' ' she says , tossing her long hair over her shoulder again . ` ` from what i ' ve heard , though , he has a certain charm . ' ' ` ` oh , shit , ' ' i say , still pulling at my hair . oh . shit . i knew it was too good to be true . ` ` ' ##n ' ' ##l . from what i ' ve heard , he ' s pretty cool , he ' s just from a different world when it comes to women in the world - especially asian women , ' ' she says . ` ` mmhm , ' ' i say , my body already going into panic mode . ` ` you okay , brynn ? ' ' ` ` ' he ' s not , though . i mean , he ' s married now , ' ' i say , clinging to a thread of hope . ` ` yeah , i thought he was married . ' ' she nods . ` ` could be . i just don ' t think it ' s something that ' s been too long or anything . ' ' i say , feeling somewhat relieved .we both turn back to our seats when we hear footsteps at our table . i look up to see pierce and nate standing in the doorway . ` ` brynn , this is going to be awkward , ' ' pierce says , and i brace myself . ` ` ' nate and i had plans to go to lunch , and we went down to the restaurant before we realized how rude it was not to invite you over . ' ' phew . for a second i thought someone overheard our conversation . ` ` well , that ' s very nice , but i do have lunch plans with my best friend from school , nate . ' ' ` ` ' i see . . . well , congratulations ! there are some great restaurants around here . we just wanted to let you know you were welcome , ' ' she says cheerfully , and from nate ' s expression i ' m guessing that it is more his concern than his friend ' s . ` ` great , right ? ' ' he asks , turning to her . ` ` yes , that ' s great , ' ' she replies . ` ` okay , well , we better get going or we ' ll be late for our meeting . see you at lunch ! ' ' she says with a wink , and walks away with nate in tow .huh . i swear that nate will ##n ' t say a single word to me . i guess he just don ' t like being the one freaking out for me . ` ` why does mr . thornhill want you back here ? ' ' constance asks , slowly turning her desk around to face me , a puzzled look on her face . ` ` um , well , i ' m his daughter . he just hired my sister . ' ' she sighs and puts her head in her hands . ` ` oh my god , oh my god , i ' m so sorry . i ' m fired , okay ? ' ' ` ` what ? no ! ' ' don ' t want that kind of job , i ' m just an employee , like you . ' ' ` ` you ' re the boss ' s daughter , and i was just talking about him ! ' ' ` ` father - daughter , and i know it . if i ' d said things like that , i would have to protect the people i work with , too . ' ' ` ` ' i ' don ' t even know if they ' re true , i ' m so sorry , ' ' she says quietly . ` ` no , it ' s nothing . and i ' m notthat i did ##n ' t tell you . that i ' m his assistant . i just . . . you know , i ##n ' t want it to seem like that was the only reason i got the job . i mean , i really do work really hard . ' ' ` ` of course you do ! of course . . . i should get back to work , ' ' she says , turning to her computer and beginning to type furiously . ` ` . . . and now i ' m afraid she ' s going to start acting all weird around you , ' ' i say to allison over a caesar salad at mcdonald ' s on main street . ` ` do you think it ' s true ? ' ' she asks , sitting across the table from us .
