before this happened , i was sure of everything in my life . sure of my feelings and actions . sure that i was happy . but i feel less and less sure of myself the longer i stay in this room . just as i finish brushing my teeth , i hear a noise from the bathroom , then a groan . that sounds like nate . with a sigh , i open my bedroom door . sure enough , it ' s nate , lying on the floor just outside his bedroom door . i frown , remembering i ' m wearing my pink bikini , and that he ' s seen me in it too . ` ` nate ? are you okay ? what happened ? ' ' i ask , moving to stand next to him . the smell of alcohol coming off of him gives him away before he says anything . ` ` i ' m not okay , brynn , ' ' he says , starting to stir . ` ` shhh , you ' ll wake up our parents , ' ' i tell him . ` ` why are you on the floor ? ' ' ` ` sorry . on my own bed , ' ' he says with a laugh . ` ` well , come on , get up , ' ' i tell him , wrapping my arms around his waist to help himno . he immediately nods and gets to his feet , where he ##agger slightly . ` ` okay , on the bed , ' ' i say , kicking his bedroom door open with my foot as i wrap my arm around his waist to steady him . i feel his muscles flex beneath his t - shirt as we move . not the time , brynn . ` ` drink first , ' ' i tell him as we approach the covers . ` ` mmm , ' ' he replies , as he kicks them off . ` ` i ' m getting you some water . ' ##n ' ' worry . ' ' i walk back to my room and grab my water bottle from the bedside table , then fill it from the tap in my bathroom before heading back to his room . i close the door behind me to keep the sound from echoing through the house , and blink in surprise when i see that nate has stripped down to his boxers and is sitting on the edge of his bed . ` ` drink , ' ' he says , as i slowly step forward and hand him the glass . i watch him gulp the whole thing down , the dim light from the window illuminating his muscular torso . he sets the glass down on his nightstand and covers his mouth with the back of his hand' he smiles slightly . ` ` you drunk ? ' ' i ask him . ` ` i ' ve never seen you drunk before . ' ' ` ` ' ' ' ' you worry . every day . practice , practice , school , school . ' ' ` ` and you said i was the drunk , ' ' i remind him . ` ` you ' re not , ' ' he says , shaking his head slowly , and takes a step toward me . ` ` nate . . . ' ' i gasp as my heart explodes . ` ` what , brynn ? ' ' he asks softly . ` ` you said this was wrong . those were your words , ' ' i remind him . ` ` do you think it ' s wrong ? ' ' he takes a step toward me , and looks down at me . ` ` i - ' ' his hand wraps around my waist . ` ` does this feel wrong ? ' ' ` ` no . . . no , ' ' i whisper . i barely have time to answer before his mouth is on mine . his mouth tastes like mint , but i ' don ' t care . i wrap my arms around his neck and he grabs my face with both hands , our breath coming hot from where our lipsone night alone . i thread my fingers into his hair as our mouths open to one another . he pulls me back against him and groans deep in his throat as our lips meet . then he pulls back , bracing himself on my shoulder . ` ` wait , ' ' he says , shaking his head as if to clear it . ` ` can you please stay with me for a while ? ' ' ` ` yes , of course , ' ' i reply quickly , even though i ' m taken aback by his request . i watch him roll to his side and crawl over to his bed , then curl up on his side and look at me intently . i nod , then join him , crawling across the bed and curling around his waist . i bury my face between his shoulder blades , wrap my legs around his waist , and feel him take my hand in his and pull me back against him . i remain as still as i can , barely breathing . i can ##n ' t believe he ' s letting me touch him like this . yes , it was wasted , but still . i never thought he ' d be so close to me . i hear his breathing heavily . ` ` i ' ve always looked up to him , ' ' he says , hisno . ` ` i know , ' ' i whisper softly , knowing that he ' s thinking about his mother . ` ` ' ' don ' t know what i would do if she - ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' i whisper , gently kissing the side of his head . he nods against his pillow , and his breathing goes down slightly . i sit with him for a while , until i know he ' s asleep . i want to know nate ' s feelings about his mother before i tell him what she told me .
