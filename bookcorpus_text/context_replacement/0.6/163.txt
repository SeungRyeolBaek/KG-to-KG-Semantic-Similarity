his world is already falling apart around him , and i just don ' t want to make it happen again . i sigh . i should probably go back to my room . i roll over with a start and stretch . my eyes are heavy , and the light coming in from the window is way too bright . i blink my eyes open and then sit up with a start . i ' m in nate ' s room . ` ` it ' s me . ' ' i look over to see nate sitting at his desk with a cup of coffee , his dark hair sticking up at odd angles . ` ` they left early this morning for work . your door was locked , so they thought you were still asleep in there . ' ' ` ` oh , sorry , ' ' i reply . i notice my skirt is riding up high on my hips and lift up the material self - consciously . ` ` coffee , ' ' nate says , pointing to the bedside table next to me . i look over and see he ' s got a paper cup there . ` ` cream and brown sugar , right ? ' ' ` ` no , thanks , ' ' i reply , reaching for it . ` ` sorry about last night . i just don ' t remember anything before i got here .' ' i nod even though i ' m worried that he might don ' t remember the conversation . ` ` you were asleep , and you asked me to stay up for a while . ' ' didn ' t want to fall asleep . ' ' i glance at the clock . ` ` what , it ' s after nine ? i never sleep that late . ' ' ` ` i ' ##n ' t stay up ' til nine - that ' s normal for me . ' ' my mind immediately returns to my conversation from last night . ` ` i - i know you ' don ' t want to talk about this , but your mom - ' ' ` ` what about her ? ' ' he asks , still looking uncomfortable . i decide to tread carefully . ` ` i know that it ' s hard to talk about , i just wanted to ask : why did she leave ? ' ' nate crosses his arms over his chest . ` ` eileen left because she could ##n ' t handle being a parent . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? how so ? ' ' ` ` i was out of control when i was a kid , and she could ##n ' t handle it . could ##n ' t handle it . ' ' ` ` that ' s what your mom told you . '' ` ` that ' s what happened , ' ' nate says , looking at me . ` ` i still remember the day she left . they went out for dinner , and i went home with the nanny . both of them , because i was pushing them away , and i slipped up . i threw a punch , broke a window . . . i ' m pretty sure the nanny left as soon as my dad got home . anyway , they got into this big fight - i could hear it all in my head - and the next day she left . ' ' ` ` and you ' ve not seen her since ? ' ' ` ` skipped town a few times . but after that , she just wasn ' t really interested in seeing me . she tries to call me back , but she feels bad . she even tries to blame my dad for what went on , ' ' he says quietly . ` ` do you think that if . . . if you had been sober , she would ##n ' t have left ? ' ' he asks . ` ` # n ' t , nate . why are you asking me this now ? did we talk about it when i was sober or something ? ' ' ` ` no , nate . ' ' i shrugmy head falls on the nightstand . ` ` she was upset last night . ' ' ` ` eileen ? you talked to her ? ' ' ` ` well , yeah , she was really upset . ' ' ` ` fuck , brynn , ' ' he says , standing up . ` ` why would you do that ? this has nothing to do with you . ' ' ` ` i was just trying to help . . . ' ' ` ` i really don ' t need your help , ' ' he snaps at me . ` ` would you please stop for a minute ? ! she called because she thought you might be willing to talk to her about what the doctor said on the morning after - ' ' ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' he demands . ` ` she said your dad was cheating on her , that ' s why she called . nothing to do with you . ' ' ` ` get out , ' ' he says , raising his hands and walking to the door . ` ` nate , my mom is , too , remember ? you know what he ' s like . and she is so upset , she ' s desperate to talk to you . she ' d hate for my dad to be like that to you . ' ' ` ` nate ,` that ' s what this is about , your daddy said . ' ' ` ` no ! that ' s not what i meant , ' ' i say , his words cutting to my core . ` ` look , i ' m sorry that your mom ' ' ' not here , but your current situation has nothing to do with me ! ' ' ` ` no ! ' ' i say , feeling defeated . i kick off the covers and stand up . ` ` i told her i ' d call you , and i will . i ' ll never have to contact you again . ' ' ` ` that ' s all i said ! ' ' he shouts after me as i storm out of his room . i slam my bedroom door behind me , my fists clenched in frustration .
