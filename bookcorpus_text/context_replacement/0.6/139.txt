` ` well , hello , both of you , ' ' my mom cuts in . ` ` i have no idea what i ' m going to order ! everything looks so good . ' ' she runs her fingers over the menu in front of her . having grown up in a family of illegal immigrants , my mom has always avoided me like the plague , but this time i ' m grateful for the change of subject . i decide to order the steak since it ' t ' does seem to be an option , and we each order a drink in addition to the steak . something seems to click in the back of my mind as the waitress leaves to put in our drink orders . ` ` so , i ' m sorry if this is an awkward conversation , but are you in college ? your name sounds very familiar . ' ' ` ` oh , ' ' he says , looking surprised . ` ` i ' m a former candidate - ' ' ` ` - for congress . now i am . you helped pass the campaign finance act . ' ' i smile . ` ` good point . ' ' ` ` one of my majors is political science , and i try to keep up with you . ' ' ` ` and your other major ? ' ' ` ` social studies . ' ' ` ` youbesides , we own thornhill and co . out of the ##fc , and we ' re still looking for a summer job . why ? ' ' ` ` well , i thought you were going - ' ' nate cuts in before i can finish . ` ` and i thought you were going to get a summer job , ' ' his dad says , keeping his voice low . ` ` well , brynn , what do you think ? ' ' ` ` i , um , i was just trying to get a summer job here in california to help pay for college , ' ' i say . ' you offer his dad the job ? ' ' don ' t want to start off this conversation with nate on the wrong foot . ` ` you really don ' t need to worry about that anymore , honey , ' ' my mom says firmly . i stare at her in shock . oh my god - is pierce going to pay for my college education ? the thought probably hadn ' t even occurred to me . i look at them and they stare back at me blankly . ` ` no , no , i really don ' t think - i mean , i ' d love to , but i mean - if nate gets the - ' ' ` ` then it ' s settled , ' ' nate cuts in. ` ` i have to go into the city really soon , but we have an extra room you can borrow . ' ' ` ` really ? i still don ' t understand . ' ' ` ` so , nate and i are moving in together . i mean , i do live here now , but i ' m not using the old house , now that we ' re married . ' ' ` ` oh . of course . ' ' my brain struggles to process all the new information . just as i ' m figuring it all out , i feel a touch on my thigh . i look down in time to see nate ' s hand slip under the table . i look at him . he ' s staring straight ahead as if nothing ' s wrong . i fight to keep my composure as heat travels from his hand and all the way up to . . . ` ` so , this weekend , we ' ll be staying with you guys ? all of you ? ' ' nate turns to look at me again . his hand travels an inch up the bare skin of my thigh . i narrow my eyes at him . he does s ' pose understand . ` ` that ' s right . we ' ll all be staying at nate ' s house - ' ' ` ` our house , '' he asks my mom with a smile . ` ` our house , the house . it ' s got lots of room , and views of the potomac . it ' ll be nice to take the time to be with each other , and to be a family . ' ' nate ' s hand moves an inch up my thigh . i can feel the soft , warm skin of his hand . i ' ve never been so turned on in my life , and i ' m fighting against it . what is he doing ? we ' re having dinner with our parents ! ` ` i know you have your stuff in the old house , but we ' ll get it moved to the new house . everything will be all set up when you get there , ' ' my mom says , looking at me . ` ` mmm , ' ' i say , trying to focus on her words . ` ` it ' isn ' t that close to the old house though , ' ' i say with a smile . we ' ve met a few years after my parents died , but no one else has ever felt like this . nate ' s hand moves another inch up my thigh , pushing up the hem of my dress as his fingers slip beneath it . my entire body is tingling . oh shit , ii ##t breathe . i ' m glad nate and my mom can ##n ' t seem to notice that anything ' s wrong . with his free hand , nate takes a long sip from his champagne flute . where ' s the food ? he ' ll have to move his hand when the food arrives . he moves his hand up an inch . i can ##n ' t hold it any longer - another inch and i ' m going to start screaming . as my mom presses her lips to nate ' s ear to whisper naughty things , i slide my fork across the table and place it point - first into the palm of nate ' s hand .
