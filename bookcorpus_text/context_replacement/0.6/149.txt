i ask . ` ` sorry , i ' ca don ' t need this damn thing to . . . ' ' he starts to wrap a bandage around his wrist . ` ` excuse me , ' ' i say , seeing the first aid kit on the counter by the sink . from the blood stains on it , i can tell nate ' s already gone through it . ` ` you ca don ' t need to , ' ' he says . ` ` come over here . the water ' s on , ' ' i tell him . ` ` do you know what you ' re doing ? ' ' he asks , less than happy to accept my help . ` ` better than you , ' ' i say with a smile , looking at the mess of bandages around his wrist . i wash my hands at the sink and then pick up the kit . i grab a pair of surgical scissors and cut through the bandage that he ' s still wearing . i look down again , and for the first time it hits me that he ' s shirtless , wearing only a pair of gym shorts and sneakers . he ' s covered in sweat . ` ` how ' d this happen ? ' ' ` ` i cross - legged a little . got up , tripped over a rock and stuck out my handto strengthen my arm , ' ' he says , eyes wide as he watches me carefully . ` ` ' - ' for what ? boxing or football ? ' ' i ask as i pull out a roll of bandages and a bottle of vinyl chloride . ` ` either . anything , ' ' he says . ` ` this is going to hurt , ' ' i tell him , as i wipe the cuts on his arm with the wet cloth . he wince ##s as the cloth touches him , but doesn t ' ever flinch . i place my other hand over his , to steady him as i clean the cut of blood . i ' ve never seen him this way before . ` ` your hand . ' ' he switches hands and i set to work on the injured hand . ` ` maybe you should take a little time off from training , ' ' i suggest gently . ` ` or i could go work on my knee instead , ' ' he suggests , and i look up to see a small smile on his face . ` ` mmm , ' ' i reply , smiling back . ` ` you know , ' ' i go on , a little more seriously , ` ` i heard that only a football team gets a booster chair , because they are soa lifetime ##r , much less a two - seater car - ' ' ` ` i ##n ' t do that , ' ' he says . ` ` i ' don ' t want your pity . ' ' ` ` it ' s not pity , it ' s love . ' ' ` ` i was born with everything , i have no excuse for not getting my share of it . ' ' ` ` where did you get that ? it sounds like - ' ' i break off , feeling him tense under my touch . i was going to say his name but i can tell he ' doesn ' t want me to go there . ` ` you ' re just being hard on yourself , that ' s all , ' ' i say softly . i gently rub the salt onto the wound . ` ` i see what everyone sees when they look at me , ' ' he says softly . ` ` ' . . . work with a wooden spoon in my hand . . . i work as hard as i can so that no one will think i work because of my father ' s money . ' ' i agree . that ' s part of the reason i guess , but it sounds like he still don ' t understand how far his parents pushed him . ` ` ' 'a little bit of that was happening the other day , ' ' i say , wondering if it ' s appropriate to change the subject of the things i know . i find a small piece of tape and wipe his palm with it before picking up the tape and starting to wrap it around his hand . ` ` when they found out i was mom ' s daughter , i mean . pretty soon . ' ' ` ` your first taste of florida ? ' ' ` ` yep , ' ' i say with a smile . ` ` well , my mom just got herself a part - time job as the nurse at the hospital where she used to work , so i guess that ' s not unusual . ' ' ` ` where does your dad work ? ' ' ` ` no idea . in a machine shop somewhere . he ' s a mechanic , or he was . last time we heard from him was two years ago . he lived in florida then , but he never stayed in one place very long . ' ' ` ` so you ' re the first in your family to move to florida , ' ' he says , as i start with one hand and move to the other . ` ` yep . ' ' ` ` is that why you ' re so good? ' ' ` ` am i ? ' ' i ask , my eyes snapping back to his . ` ` ' is ain ' t the right word . . . distant , maybe . ' ' ` ` what ? that ' s funny , ' ' i say , feeling a little embarrassed . ` ` i ' m ' t trying to hurt you . i ' m just trying to help you out . we were always in class together ? which one ? ' ' ` ` there were two . the third was this american community college class last year . ' ' ` ` alec carter ? ' ' ` ` yes . i always sat beside you , alec . i ' m not surprised you ' don ' t remember me , ' ' i say , moving closer even as i finish washing his arm .
