` ` ' what the hell is the test ? ' ' ` ` i wish i could tell you , but i honestly don ' t even know myself , ' ' megan said as tears filled her eyes . ` ` dammit , the pregnancy test . ' ' ` ` ' megan , you do really care about him , ' don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' she whispered . ` ` and you ' re a liar about what you ' re feeling for him , now aren ' t you ? ' ' kristi asked . megan could couldn ' t hold back the tears any longer . they tore at her , causing her to bend at the knees under the strain . kristi rushed over , wrapping her arms around megan . even though she knew she should try to control her tears while she was at work , she refused to let herself cry and let it all out . when she finally got a hold of herself , she shook her head , wiping what she hoped were the thick ##est tear stains from her cheeks . ` ` i ' m so sorry . that was so wrong of me . ' ' kristi gave her a weak smile . ` ` would you stop that , megan ? this just ain ' t an option . please , ' '" the man who brought you in here and kissed you . you should keep your thoughts and feelings down on the table . ' ' ` ` the truth is i do feel for pesh . how could i not ? i ' m just not sure i ' m the right woman for him . ' ' ` ` ' if he loves you , how could you think you ' re not the right woman ? ' ' megan laid out all the things she ' d never told pesh about her feelings and her lack of having a serious relationship . when she had finished convincing herself of all her doubts and fears , she looked up at kristi . there was no emotion in her eyes or voice for that moment . instead , she gently patted megan ' s hand . ` ` ' megan , you ' ve got to shut all those bad thoughts down and go with your heart . ' ' megan shook herself . ` ` ' what if i just don ' t do what my heart is telling me to do ? ' ' ` ` you will . just give it time . ' ' kristi squeezed her hand . ` ` ' why don ' t you go get cleaned up and then take your lunch break ? ' ' ` ` no , i want to make up for the past . 've ##rily . ' ' ` ` you ' re right . ' ' she gestured to the door . ` ` go now . see if dr . nadeen is on his way to work . you can call him . ' ' ` ` ` i should ##n ' not . i wo ##l ' t feel as if we ' re alone together . ' ' kristi laughed . ` ` alone together in a crowded hospital room ? i really don ' t think that ' s wise . ' ' megan chewed on her bottom lip and resisted the urge to argue with kristi . after all , if the older woman who was in charge of her medical team should ##n ' t give a damn about her and pesh being alone together , why should she ? instead , she just heaved a small sigh . ` ` okay , i ' ll go now . ' ' ` ` good luck . and you keep listening to your doctor talk . okay ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll try . i promise . ' ' although she said the words with great strength of conviction , megan was afraid it was going to be harder than she thought . chapter twelve when pesh arrived at work the next morning , he found kristi sitting at the nurses ' station . looking around , she asked , ` ` where' ' megan ? ' ' ` ` yeah , she called in sick today . ' ' ' relief and relief filled him . she had been a little distracted the night before when they had eaten dinner in the restaurant . she was quiet and somewhat withdrawn . he decided to chalk it up to the fact that they were dealing with some of the other employees and she was trying not to make things too awkward with them all . he wondered if he should call her and check to make sure she was okay . they were in such turmoil now that even though it seemed like the right thing to do , he was wasn ' t sure . with a deep breath , he decided to leave things as they were and promise to check on her again when she came to work . as much as pesh hated to admit it , the day dragged on without megan . he went from patient to patient with a desperation he hadn t ' ever felt in a long time . when his shift ended , he met kristi in the lobby . ` ` want me to walk you out ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` thank you . i ' d like that . ' ' ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' they walked out the back door to the employee parking lot . toover the sound of their feet slapping on the tile , he said , ` ` i heard to hear that megan still wasn ' t feeling well . ' ' ` ` so did i . poor megan had to work a double shift to make up for being late . ' ' kristi laughed . ` ` she really is going to make a great nurse . ' ' ` ` yes , she is . ' ' ` ` you ' ve taken a special interest in her , huh ? ' ' you ? ' ' kristi asked . pesh ' s smile suddenly faltered , and he frowned . ` ` what do you mean ? ' '
