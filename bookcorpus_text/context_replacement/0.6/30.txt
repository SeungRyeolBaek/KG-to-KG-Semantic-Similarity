` ` that we ' re just normal people having dinner , ' ' she replied . ` ` you ' re a doctor , and i ' m a registered nurse . could ##n ' t we keep in touch ? ' ' ` ` doctors and nurses often have dinner together on their rounds . the hospital is a very safe place for us to be alone together . if someone happens upon us in one of the waiting rooms or an outside waiting room , then we might have a problem . ' ' ` ` if you say so , ' ' she replied , as she pressed the down button on the elevator . as they stepped into the elevator , pesh faced her . ` ` you ' re serious , ' s ' pose you ? ' ' she asked . ` ` my job means everything to me . ' ' don ' t want to do anything to ruin it . ' ' ` ` ` i ' ll make sure we ' don ' t go by ourselves . ' ' ` ` thank you . i really appreciate that . ' ' as the elevator began its downward journey , pesh leaned his head back and took a long breath . ` ` so , that means . . . ' ' megan smiled at him . ` ` the good doctor was right . ` hein your time in the hospital , you ' ve had one or two such incidents . ' ' he tilted his head , looking amused . ` ` a penis stuck to the wall is probably the worst . ' ' ` ` the worst ? ' ' megan asked him , as the elevator doors slid open . pesh chuckled . ` ` a man high on adrenaline walking into the hospital with his dick in his mouth is probably the worst . ' ' megan ' s hand flew to her mouth . ` ` he just bit into his . . . ' ' she glanced around to make sure no one was listening to their conversation . ` ` is the other doctor okay ? ' ' he teased . she narrowed her eyes at him . ` ` ' what happened ? ' ' ` ` we got him home and into bed as soon as we could . i hope they were able to turn it back on . i ' m not sure of whether or not he will be . . . fully functional again . ' ' ` ` that sounds crazy . ' ' ` ` i know . ' ' pesh handed her the tray back . as they considered their options , megan asked , ` ` is that your husband ?of being in a situation like that ? ' ' ` ` i think we ' ve established that you still haven ' t been assigned to any such cases , but yes , any time there is an issue with the body that is not related to the bladder or bladder , you would answer those questions . ' ' when the customer service guy gave them both an odd look , pesh looked over at her . ` ` why do you ask ? ' ' she shrugged . ` ` ' to be prepared for the next question . ' ' he cocked his head at her . ` ` do you want to continue your line of questioning ? you know , tell me what you ' ve learned ? ' ' ` ` let ' s order our food then , shall we ? ' ' ` ` sure . ' ' after deciding that the homemade cheese sandwich was not the most popular option in the food court , she ordered a salad and one of the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . just as she got up to leave , pesh placed his plate next to hers . he had made the kind of stir - fry that ' anyone ' would find irresistible to megan . when she dug into her purse for her wallet , he handed the bill to the waitress . after she paid hisstartled , she shot him a look . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` you know my mother ' ' ' she sound so nice , ' ' she teased , as they walked toward the door . pesh shook his head with a grin . ` ` i highly doubt she ' s got the f ##s up on how dr . nadeen made the hottest female medical student a millionaire . ' ' ` ` you never know , ' ' megan said . ignoring pesh , she watched as he made his way over to a table filled with doctors and nurses . while the bottom half was filled with food , the top was mostly empty . ` ` mind if we take these outside ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` go right ahead , nadeen , ' ' the dark haired doctor said . ` ` we ' re inviting a few guests to join us , ' ' he said , while also smiling at megan . ` ` you play a dangerous game , ' ' she said , laughing . ` ` thank you . ' ' she ' d just poured her salad . her salad when pesh asked , ` ` want to enjoy yourself ? ' ' ` ` are we really going to talk about this while we eat ? ' ' ` ` you' ll assume that your mornings and evenings are spent either working cases or getting involved into them . ' ' ` ` okay then . ' ' putting on a professional face , she asked , ` ` have you had any sexual s ##s ? ' ' after taking a bite of stir - fry , she answered , ` ` no , sir . ' ' ` ` do you have difficulty obtaining an abortion ? ' ' the light returned to his eyes . ` ` i would think you would wouldn ' t want to answer that question after our first meeting . ' ' a shiver ran down her spine as she felt her breasts brush against the hard bulge in his pants . ` ` since it is unlikely that you would have any intimate knowledge of the subject , please answer the question . ' ' he gave her a wry smile .
