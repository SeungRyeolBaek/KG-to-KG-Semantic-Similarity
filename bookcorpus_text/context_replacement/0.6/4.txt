` ` oh , that ' s great . thank you so very much for bringing up that topic of our break - up , today of all days . ' ' casey grabbed noah ' s hand and picked up his little body to put on the new shoes . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ` ` so , what you were saying , ' ' megan said . ` ` okay . so it was when aidan and i were growing up that i met pesh . he was with your father on the day of his heart attack in the hospital , and pesh was the doctor who treated him . ' ' ` ` so . . . you two struck up a friendship then ? ' ' megan asked . emma shrugged . ` ` not really . you see , i wanted to get aidan to actually fall for me , and i thought the best way to do that would be for him to have some fun . ' ' megan asked her eyes widening in surprise . ` ` you asked pesh to marry you ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` marry you ? ' ' emma was momentarily distracted by casey blowing kisses on noah ' s head . a smile spread across her face . noah crossed his legs and looked at casey . ` ` asked me totake him to his room ? ' ' casey asked , as she looked around . ` ` if you ' ##n ' ' mind . ' ' pressing her hand to her forehead , megan blew out an annoyed breath . ` ` um , could you please focus for just a second on the one you just dropped for me ? ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . i ' didn ' t mean to upset you at all . i mean , what happened between us was all in the past . neither one of us really cared for the other like we thought we did . ' ' ` ` did you . . . ' ' megan asked . at emma ' s questioning look , she raised her eyebrows playfully . emma ' s cheeks flushed . ` ` no , of course not ! ' ' casey assured emma as she grabbed the wedding dress off the rack . ` ` you did go out with him once . ' ' ` ` last night . and he definitely does don ' t go to the wedding , ' ' emma said . with a sly smile , casey said , ` ` fine . maybe you could educate me on what he had going on below the waist . ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` you ' re crazy . ' ' she snatched the dress away from casey and grabbedand throwing him into the bowl of straw . ` ` it was wasn ' t like we were in a relationship . we didn ##n ' t really ever hang out together . he came to the hospital daily to bring me flowers and check on me when i was on bed rest , and then he took me to the movies . that was it . ' ' ` ` was there any chemistry between you two ? ' ' megan asked . without thinking , emma pushed herself up into a sitting position and began working the row of buttons on the back of the chair . ` ` what ? ' ' megan asked . she heaved a deep sigh , picking noah up . she looked into his eyes as she spoke . ` ` we had no chemistry whatsoever . he was an amazing guy and had gotten my hopes up and going in all the right directions . on the other hand , he was smart , sexy , and funny - every woman ' s dream . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` ` ' ' didn ' t matter because he was no ' not aidan . i could never , ever love another man like i loved him . ' ' giving him a kiss on the cheek , she said , ` ` neither one of us was really in a serious relationship - i was going to be athat aidan jackson was the reason , and despite being surrounded by family and friends , he was able to marry for the first time since his wife ' s death . ' ' megan crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` i get that he probably don ' t want to be married , but who is to say that having a son is going to help him ? that it could give him the confidence he needs to go out and meet the new girl of his dreams ? ' ' casey snorted . ` ` how could a guy that looks like that have any self - esteem issues ? ' ' megan shrugged . ` ` you never know . if he got married a short time after his wife died , he might find it hard to get back into the music business . especially if the only person he cared about was someone else . ' ' emma shook her head . ` ` trust me , aidan ' isn ' t the marrying kind of guy . he wants a wife and kids . ' ' although megan wanted a son , she still wasn ' t quite ready for that . maybe in a few years . right now she just wanted to marry and have children . she ' d already done so much to ensure that aidan could get all of her attention since he was already a father . after all , sheperhaps the biggest problem was her wanting a committed relationship . she would don ' t want to open her husband up to the hurt that might come from him becoming engaged to a man she loved only to have them fight when they broke up . ` ` aidan really wants to break you up ? ' ' megan asked . emma nodded . ` ` regardless of what happened with pesh when we were broken up , aidan does love and admire him . he wants pesh to be happy . ' '
