but pesh took his time . ` ` we ' ll come back another time . ' ' his words seemed to calm mason , and he happily swung his and pesh ' s arms back and forth as they walked to the car . when they were safely in , megan turned back to mason . ` ` what did you say to pesh for saving you ? ' ' ` ` thank you , esh , ' ' mason replied . his answer sent a wide smile spreading across pesh ' s face . ` ` you ' re welcome , mason . i had a good time . ' ' when he glanced over at megan , she gave him a shy smile . ` ` i had a good time , too . ' ' taking one of his hands off the steering wheel , he reached over to take her hand in his . although the gesture was a little too lovey - dovey for her liking , she could don ' t argue with him . instead , she simply accepted his touch . once they had left a sleepy mason back home at megan ' s , they left her car and climbed into pesh ' s truck . ` ` ` where exactly are we going ? ' ' megan asked , as she buckled her # ##belt . ` ` it ' s a surprise . ' '` ` what ? you ' re just being weird about it ? ' ' ` ` for just a little while longer . ' ' she shifted in her seat where she could look at him better . ` ` can i try to explain ? ' ' ` ` ' guess . i ' m not sure i ' ll believe you even if you try , ' ' she teased . ` ` ' we going to play ? ' ' he shifted his gaze from the road back to her . ` ` ' no . ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , she said , ` ` i ' don ' t have time for this . ' ' ` ` okay , i ' ll give you a little hint . unfortunately , it ' s more of a hint than it is a question . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` do you have a fear of heights ? ' ' she laughed . ` ` no , i do . ' no . why ? ' ' he gave her a crooked smile . ` ` i told you . it ' s a risk . ' ' ` ` i went skiing when i was twenty - one , and i ' m perfectly okay with it . of course , i seriously doubt we ' re going scuba diving in these mountains . ' ' ` `no , we ' re not . ' ' she wrinkled her nose . ` ` please tell me it ' s ' the night at the opera or something like that . ' ' his face fell . ` ` you really don ' t like the opera ? ' ' ` ` never have and never want to . ' ' pesh looked almost equally shocked . ` ` i ' m going to have to change your mind on that one . ' ' ` ` ' am i not sure you like opera ? ' ' ` ` ` don ' t stop me until you ' ve seen it . ' ' ` ` a bunch of young men and women singing in a language i ' don ' t understand ? not my idea of a good time . ' ' ` ` ` there is a passion and passion in their voices , ' ' she explained . ` ` um , i ' m just going to have to agree to go with you . ' ' ` ` for tonight at least , ' ' he said , with a wink . when the car was slowing down , megan stared out the window before turning to pesh . ` ` we ' re in mccollum ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` you ' re taking me there ? ' ' he nodded . ` `yes , i do . ' ' even though she had known he was a gift from how he ' d helped bring aidan to noah ' s ark , she could ##n ' t believe their relationship was something as mundane as flying . ` ` ' let me get this straight . i ' m dressed like this , ' ' she made a slow circular motion with her hands , ` ` to be flying ? ' ' an amused glint flashed in his blue eyes . ` ` you have absolutely no idea , do you ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' ' ' no . ' ' as he put the car in park at the airport , he turned to her . ` ` given your history of being able to have sex , i ' m guessing you ' ve never engaged in actual flying before ? ' ' she could couldn ' t stop her heart from leaping to her throat . ` ` w - what ? ' ' she stammered . turning in his seat , he pinned her with a heated stare . ` ` have i managed to seduce you yet ? ' ' unable to speak , she simply shook her head . pesh merely chuckled at her reaction . ` ` come on . let ' s get going . ' ' still in shock , she remained glued toher husband . when he came around to open her door , she looked up at him . ` ` ' me ? ' you , trudie jones , and the sex ? ' ' ` ` yes , i think so , ' ' he said , as he offered her his hand . normally , she would ne ' er have taken it , but with the realization that pesh was moving into something beyond the sexual realm , she was too excited to argue with him . ` ` i ' ##n ' i think you ' d do anything . . . sexual . ' ' pesh ' s blue eyes widened . ` ` ' sex ? ' . sexual . it ' s about connecting with your partner on a more intimate level . it ' s about letting them in and not being denied . ' ' ` ` ' it ' s not about having sex that way for days ? ' '
