casey laughed . ` ` i ' m sure aidan would n ' not mind you referring to the fact his gown is an antique , and in fact , he ' s married . ' ' emma laughed . ` ` no , i ' m sure he would n ' not . of course , he ' d probably appreciate that while the baby may not have changed him , he still looks handsome and much older than his years . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` that sounds just like him . ' ' she reached over emma to pinch one of noah ' s nipples . noah took her fingers in his hand and held on for dear life . ` ` aw , you love your daddy , now don ' t you baby ? ' ' emma teased . noah finally stopped sucking on the nipple to reveal a wide smile , which melted megan ' s heart . ` ` he ' s such a good man , ' ' she said . ` ` and a gentleman , just like his old self , ' ' casey added . ` ` that too , ' ' megan agreed . embarrassed about her comment , she shook her head at casey . ` ` are you sure you ' re okay with him being the daddy ? ' ' casey waved her hand dismissively . ` ` well , the babyall i want is the godfather . i plan on spoiled him rotten and raising him like only a good father can do ! ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` i ' m quite happy with both my sons , megan . you ' don ' t have to worry . ' ' ` ` ' who is the godfather then ? you know he ' s not part of the family . ' ' casey gasped and her hand flew to her mouth again . ` ` you mean , you ' ve never met dr . mcdreamy before ? ' ' megan laughed . ` ` no , i mean no ' not . i mean , i ' ve heard about him and how he got aidan here in time for noah ' s birthday . ' ' she ignored the confused look that emma exchanged with casey . ` ` really ? what should i know about him ? ' ' casey tapped her chin with her index finger . ` ` hmm , what should you know about the ' godfather ? ' ' she looked at megan . ` ` first off , he is absolutely gorgeous . i mean , the man is like sex on a stick . tall , jet - black hair , blue eyes , and he ' s built like a fucking shithouse . ' ' megan suddenly found her curiosity piquin##g . she ' hadn ' t thought that the man would be good - looking . it had been such a long time since she had dated anyone . scratch that - it had been a long time since she ' d had sex with anyone . she ' d spent the last two weeks practically homeless since she and nate broke up . she could probably run one of the local hospitals as a nurse with how long she had left . ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm . he reminds me of that movie star john abraham , ' ' casey said . emma laughed . ` ` since when do you watch bollywood movies ? ' ' ` ` since one of nate ' s friends took me to the indian film festival . ' ' casey looked at megan . ` ` besides the fact that he ' s a great actor , he ' s also smart , funny , and charming - an extremely good combination . ' ' ` ` and why ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` and he ' s here because he ' s a doctor . ' ' this conversation is getting better and better by the minute . ` ` is he crazy ? ' ' emma made a disgusted face . casey said , ` ` no , no , he ' s not . he ' s a doctor .. ' ' megan pursed her lips at the thought . men generally fell into two categories - those who were still haunted by their parents ' death and those who were ready to have fun and live a little . she just hoped this pesh guy fell into the latter category . more than anything , she wanted to have a little fun herself . ` ` do you really think you would be interested in dating pesh ? ' ' emma asked , as she pulled noah to her lap to cradle him . with a sigh , megan said , ` ` dating him . just having some fun with him . sounds like you could do that . ' ' emma smiled as she wiped casey ' s face dry . ` ` this is exactly why i asked aidan here to try and hook you two up . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` pesh wants a relationship , not a hook - up after everything he ' s been through . since his wife ' s death , he just haven ' t had it easy on the relationship department . ' ' ` ` what for ? ' ' when casey asked , emma shot her a warning look . ` ` nothing . it ' s just he ' s ' never want to get involved with someone who obviously isn ' t interested in himlong - term care . ' ' ` ` well , you might as well tell her , ' ' casey said . megan looked between the two of them . ` ` tell her what ? ' ' ` ` nothing , ' ' emma blurted out . she handed noah to casey . ` ` making yourself useful by knowing his name . ' ' while casey was busy cleaning up noah , emma turned to megan . ` ` when aidan and i broke up - ' ' ` ` what you mean to say is , ' you left aidan when he said ##n ' t show up for emma ' s math test because he was cheating on you ? ' ' casey asked , talking into the wet rag in her hand . emma closed her eyes for a moment , shaking her head .
