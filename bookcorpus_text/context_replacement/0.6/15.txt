after waiting a few minutes in the silence , megan reached over to turn on the radio . ` ` do you sing ? ' ' ` ` go ahead . ' ' humming along with one of the songs , she leaned her head back against the seat . ` ` ` wo ##n ' i hurt your feelings by singing . ' ' ` ` do you ever sing ? ' ' ` ` yes , i do , but i ' don ' t do it often . emma ' s the one with the voice . ' ' ` ` ` i ' ve heard . ' ' turning to look at him , megan asked , ` ` did she ever sing for you ? ' ' ` ` uh , no . ' ' megan harrumphed as she crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` she hung out with you , but she would ##n ' t sing for you ? that ' s just gross . ' ' pesh made a disgusted sound . ` ` emma told you . . . about me ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' she smiled at him . ` ` i think you ' re a nice guy . ' ' cutting his eyes over to her , he gave her a questioning look . ` ` it really was . ' not like that for me . i ', we just weren ' t in love with each other . ' ' ` ` yeah , that ' s what she said . but , she did say that you got her all hot and bothered . ' ' ` ` she - she did ? ' ' he stammered , embarrassment in his voice . ` ` hey , the ability to get a girl hot is nothing to be ashamed of . besides , i was turned on when i first saw you there . and my panties were wet . ' ' ` ` megan , do ##n ' t , ' ' pesh groaned , gripping the steering wheel to where his knuckles turned white . turning in her seat , she faced him , licking her lips . ` ` you ' don ' t want me to know how you got me trapped in that car ? how you ' have been just being all sweet with the sex talk ? ' ' ` ` fine . do # n ' t . ' ' ` ` fine , ' ' she said , before settling back into her seat . she ' didn ' t talk to him for a long time . finally , she closed her eyes and leaned back with her head resting on the back ##rest . when the car started to slow , she forced her eyes open . she didn ' ' t know if shefell asleep and passed out . sitting up , she stared out the window at the few houses of the neighborhood they lived in . when they pulled into the driveway , megan could ' ' not stop staring up at the house . ` ` holy shit , this place is beautiful . ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` thank you . ' ' ` ` i know you think it ' s just the alcohol talking , but i ' m serious . you have great taste . ' ' ` ` i think you ' ll enjoy the view just as much . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure i will . ' ' when he came around to open the door , she jumped out of the car a little too fast . her shaky legs faltered , and she ended up crashing into pesh ' s chest . looking up at him , she offered an embarrassed smile . ` ` sorry about that . ' ' ` ` it ' s nothing . need some help ? ' ' with the alcohol affecting her brain , she said , ` ` if it helps keep your eyes on me , then yes . ' ' pesh laughed , but his arm was wrapped around her waist to steady her . she stumbled along beside him . when he unlocked the door and punched in the security code, she followed him inside . her peripheral vision took in the large kitchen with his gleaming stainless steel appliances . she watched him as he made his way into the living room . gesturing toward the couch , he said , ` ` won ' t ' t you have a seat while i make you some coffee ? ' ' although it was a good idea to warm herself up , she really don ' t want any coffee . she just wanted pesh . grabbing the collar of his suit jacket , she pressed herself up against him . ` ` when did you put this jacket on ? ' ' she wondered aloud . she felt so small against his broad chest . it was a good feeling - - one of comfort and security . it just set her even more on fire with desire . lifting her head , she looked up at him to study his face . even in the semi - darkness , she could see his blue eyes burning with desire . she ran her hands up his chest to his shoulders . she pulled him down to where his mouth was inches from hers . filled with renewed desire , she pressed her lips to his . she could couldn ' t help the soft moan that came from deep in her throat . pesh ' s mouth was warm , soft , and firm . the intimate contactmaking her want him all the more - for him to kiss her . tentatively , she ran her tongue along his bottom lip , willing him to open for her . almost immediately , the tip of his tongue met hers . they moved against each other , kissing , touching , and exploring . he cupped her face in his hands , holding her still as his tongue swept in and out of her mouth . emma had been right - the man could kiss like there was no tomorrow . he knew when to be gentle with his kisses and knew when to move to more passionate , more intimate territory .
