` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' she could couldn ' t imagine telling pesh about mr . robertson ' s condition . the last thing she was going to do was leave the patient to him . sometimes an entire patient should be left to the patient , not the attending physician . ` ` no , it ' s okay . he ' s just a little dizzy . ' ' at that moment , the door to the exam room swung open . mr . robertson was hunched over , his hands an almost impossible distance apart . he took one look at pesh and his lab coat , and almost screamed at him . ` ` help me . please ! ' ' although it was strictly against the dress code , she would have loved nothing more than to have helped mr . robertson right then and there . pesh took mr . robertson ' s hands under his own and held them there . ` ` please , you need to get back inside . as weak as you are , you obviously do not want to be on your feet . ' ' as pesh led mr . robertson back to the exam room , megan quickly ushered them into the room and closed the door . ` ` what seems to be the matter ? ' ' mr . robertson looked from pesh to meganand turned back to pesh . with a confused expression , he nodded . ` ` um , you seem to be having some serious abdominal pain . ' ' megan managed to refrain from rolling her eyes . she stepped between pesh and mr . robertson and looked pesh straight on in the eye . ` ` although the doctor refuses to discuss his condition , it appears to all that he has an urgent need . ' ' at the words , color rushed into pesh ' s pale face , and he broke eye contact to quickly look down at the floor . his expression was not what megan had thought she would see at the hospital . she had never thought his lack of appetite would cause him to be concerned about a medical issue . but of course , their physical relationship made anything of the medical nature a lot more difficult than if she were working with one of the other patients . it took pesh only a few seconds to respond , and then he finally turned his attention to mr . robertson . ` ` did you take any sexual dysfunction medication in the last four to five days ? ' ' when mr . robertson turned to look at megan , pesh shook his head . ` ` my wife will be with you for the rest of your shift . ` ` '' one more , did you take any pills ? ' ' ` ` none . ' ' ` ` how many pills ? ' ' when mr . robertson hesitated , pesh asked , ` ` are you being deliberately vague , or do you already know ? ' ' ` ` i ' n ' pose know , right ? i got it from a friend of mine . ' ' ` ` do you ever take anything that ' n ' pose new to you ? ' ' ` ` i just wanted to check it out . ' ' pesh looked over at megan . ` ` i ' m going to ask for a quick blood check - up . who knows what else you might ' ve taken . ' ' megan nodded and punched in the number on the control panel to send a member of the medical staff over to check the patient . after walking over to the doctor , pesh pulled a pair of rubber gloves on . ` ` i ' m going to have to ask you first . ' ' with a frustrated sigh , mr . robertson pulled the gloves back . megan bit down on her lip to keep from laughing at the expression on pesh ' s face . she was pretty sure he really hadn ' t had to deal with a lotof one that killed other men during his life . of course , her smile quickly faded when she realized how uncomfortable it was being in the room with him while he held another man ' s penis in his hand . she tried distracting herself with the medical exam in front of her . she refused to do anything but stare at the body spread before her . when pesh finished that part of the exam , mr . robertson sat himself down on the exam table , and pesh once again examined the flesh - colored lump . ` ` ' how long have you had the shot ? ' ' ` ` two and a half weeks . ' ' ` ` it ' doesn ' t seem to do any permanent damage , so we wo ##e ' t have to do surgery . i think the best course of treatment , as well as the least invasive , would be to administer an injection to stimulate the gland and increase the blood flow to your penis . that should reduce the swelling . ' ' mr . robertson ' s eyes narrowed suspiciously . ` ` and where do you want to give me the injection ? ' ' ` ` in the bathroom , of course . ' ' with a sigh , mr . robertson said , ` ` fine . do it . ' ' '##sh ##h . ` ` can you get a bottle of pre - med water ? ' ' ` ` sure , ' ' megan replied . she quickly rose from the table to go to the medicine cabinet . after pulling the bottle out , she quickly returned to mr . robertson ' s side . ` ` thank you , ' ' pesh murmured , as he took the bottle from her . she watched with obvious concern , as well as amusement , as he took mr . robertson ' s arm in his hand . ` ` take a deep breath , ' ' he instructed . the moment the needle touched the skin , mr . robertson shuddered violently . megan could couldn ' t help rolling her eyes at what a complete idiot she was being with the man .
