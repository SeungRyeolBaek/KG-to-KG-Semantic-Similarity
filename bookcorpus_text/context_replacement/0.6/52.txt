` ` you okay in here ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` are you kidding me ? this is amazing . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad to see you made it . i was ##n ' to ask if you were ready to check on your brother aidan . ' ' ` ` i thought you gave him permission to do it . ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` yes , i did . he slept most of the way home . ' ' ` ` ' bullshit , ' ' she said with a laugh . gently touching one of the seats , pesh said , ` ` well , you have to understand that my first wife was no ' more than saint , megan . she loved flying with me because she knew how much i loved flying , but most of the time , she ' d take a moment to sleep . ' ' ` ` ' she did don ' t share your joy ? ' ' ` ` no , she did don ' t . she always encouraged me to do what i wanted . she never seemed afraid to make me choose between her and something else . she was that way . ' ' ` ` that was very kind of her to be that way . ' ' when pesh remained silent , megan decided it was time for a subject .. ` ` now that i know we ' re going to savannah , are you going to tell me where we ' re going for dinner ? ' ' he grinned . ` ` there ' ll probably be a late lunch when we get there . ' ' ` ` okay , where will our late lunch be ? ' ' ` ` do you like the hilton hotel ? ' ' ` ` i love it . ' ' ` ` good . i ' ve picked a hotel out for it . ' ' ` ` do you come to savannah often ? ' ' ` ` a couple of times a year , mostly for business trips to the states . ' ' ` ` and you always come ? ' ' ` ` i do , ' ' she said , with a smile . the flight took less time than she expected , and with the rest , she felt more comfortable . as they were on their descent , pesh looked over at her . ` ` are you ready for the flight ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' would s ' pose i am ? ' ' ` ` it can be a little scary for some people . you feel a lot more of the air all around you than when you ' re in a 747 . ' ' she shook her head at him . ` ` we can skydi##ving , right ? ' ' ` ` ah , that ' s right . ' ' with a wink , he said , ` ` you ' re my little adrenaline rush . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i know . not anymore . ' ' ` ` what happens after that ? ' ' ` ` everything . when you ' re responsible for the health , safety , and happiness of someone else , your entire life changes . ' ' ` ` he ' s a perfect gentleman . ' ' she turned her back to him . ` ` yes , he is . ' ' pesh gave her a small smile before engaging the pilot . once they had clearance to land , they began slowly losing altitude . the ground came closer and closer until the plane shuddered violently and then began sliding across the runway . when they finally came to a complete stop , megan released the breath she ' d been holding . ` ` you okay ? ' ' pesh asked . she nodded . ` ` much better . ' ' the sound of the engines came to her ears as pesh listened to the radio . the plane began heading toward one of the runways . once he had clearance and powered up the engine , he stepped out to join her . after a brief conversation with a couple of the pilotssmiling , pesh took her hand and led her out of the restaurant . a cab arrived to take them into the city . she smiled as she slid into the seat . ` ` what ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` i ' m surprised by the place . i thought you could just go anywhere without having a cab or self - driving car pick you up . ' ' ` ` i prefer to be alone , ' ' he said with a grin . she shook her head at him before turning to look out the window at the city . when they were walking past the brick buildings of the financial district , megan felt her stomach growl . she ' d been too nervous to eat breakfast , and now she ' d ' ve to eat at chuck e . cheese ' s . the cab stopped at a modern italian restaurant . after pesh paid the driver , megan stepped out and took in the sights around her . she loved the old world feel of the city with all its charm and beauty . pesh offered her his hand , and together they walked inside . the restaurant ' s charm was different from how crowded it was here at five in the morning . they were led to a small , candlelit table . ` ` coffee ? ' ' '##sh ##h . ` ` wine please . ' ' ` ` you sure ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' when the waiter returned with their wine glasses , megan opened the menu and smiled . ` ` everything smells so good . ' ' looking over his shoulder at her , pesh said , ` ` with the food being delicious , i thought you would like it . ' ' ` ` i love all kinds of food . believe me , as drunk as i was tonight , i would have loved anything . ' ' the waiter returned with their wine , and megan knew she had to make a choice . ` ` i ' ll have the chicken and rice , please . ' '
