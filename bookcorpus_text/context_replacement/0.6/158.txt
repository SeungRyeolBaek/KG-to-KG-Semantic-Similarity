` ` your friend seems really nice , ' ' allison says as we walk . i watch her for a moment , looking between us , feeling warm and happy . ` ` i know she does . and she ' s also really good at business - like business , too . and nate , when he says it , don ' t come to him first . ' ' ` ` brynn . . . ' ' allison begins , raising an eyebrow at me . ` ` well , i mean , i ' m just , you know . . . ' ' i say , trailing off . ' not the time to tell allison that nate and i met , though . # don ' t know if that day will ever come . i like allison , but seeing in shades of gray is not her strong suit . ` ` thought you two could use some company . ' ' i look up to see greg , the tall guy with the sandy - blond hair , standing next to me , his shot glasses carefully balanced on his long nose . ` ` greg , hi ! i ' m so glad you could make it . ' ' i take the seat next to me and help him set down the glasses so that they can ##n ' t spill their contents . ` ` greg , this is my friend allison. we went to school together . ' ' ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' allison says . ` ` you too . hope these drinks are okay with you . i heard what the girls called them . . . ' ' ` ` i drink , ' ' i say , rolling my eyes . ` ` the taste sucks , but they ' re really good . ' ' ` ` ' where are you from now , greg ? ' ' allison asks . ` ` washington , but i plan to move to california when i graduate . ' ' i join in , as allison and greg walk across campus . i ' ve never seen nate moving between groups of people , able to make conversation easily . i look around to see if there ' s a girl with him , but i still don ' t see her . this must be the first time i ' ve seen him without a girlfriend at this kind of party . the thought that it could be because of me comes to my mind , but i quickly dismiss it . i can ##v ' t let myself think about that . nate would ##n ' t have that kind of relationship with me , not even if i was wasn ' t his date . i think his girlfriend probably wanted a free two - step or something . ` ` iwelcome back , ' ' allison says . ` ` i need to get a quick shower ! ' ' my attention shifts back to greg as she stands and stretches . he touches his chest and clears his throat . i watch as a flush spreads onto his rose - colored cheeks . ` ` you look . . . um , that ' s a nice compliment , ' ' he finally says . ` ` thanks . ' ' i ask , trying not to linger on the subject , ` ` so , you think you ' ll want to be in politics when school starts ? ' ' ` ` yeah , and politics , ' ' he says with a smile . ` ` ' i ' m sure that one ' s ' other continues to exist without the other . i think i need to focus on the other . . . you know . . . ' ' he waves his hand vaguely . ` ` thank you thing ? ' ' ` ` sure , ' ' he says . ` ` i , ah , i was thinking . . . ' ' my attention shifts from him again as i see my mom and greg waving frantically at the door . my mom covers her mouth with her hand and greg turns back to the window , his frown turning into a smile as if by magic . ` `i ' m so sorry , greg , could you excuse me ? i thought my dad might need me . ' ' ` ` oh , shit , ' ' he says , as i head toward the door into the study . my mind races with the possible suspects as i walk through the room and up the stairs . as i take the last flight of stairs up to the master bedroom on the second floor , i realize it must be my mom . the last time i saw my mom look that upset , it was because my dad was back in town and asking her for money . i knock softly on the closed double doors of their bedroom . ` ` mom ? ' ' i ask , as i let myself in . ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' i ask as i walk in . she ' s curled up on top of the covers , like a rag doll . ` ` it ' s dad , ' ' she says without moving . ` ` his lawyer has called him . a witness has come in accusing him of sexual assault . it ' ll be on the news soon . ' ' chapter twelve ` ` oh god , ' ' i say , sitting next to her on the bed . ` ` i ' m so sorry , mom . ' ' ` ` is it. . . is it me ? ' ' she asks , shaking her head . a tear rolls down her cheek . ` ` what ? what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` maybe it ' s me . . . maybe it ' s my hormones . it ' s like i ' m a freak . ' ' ` ` no , no , no , ' ' i say , reaching over and brushing her hair out of her face . ` ` this shit ain ' t all because of you . i mean , when does this shit come on ? the , you know , the . . . ' ' i pause , unable to say those three little words : sexual harassment .
