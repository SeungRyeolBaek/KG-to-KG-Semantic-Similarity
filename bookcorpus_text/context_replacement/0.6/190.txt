eventually the crowd begins to thin out , and constance and i each take a step back to our table . ` ` what ' s that ? chocolate ? ' ' she asks . i look at the cake . ` ` i think so , but i thought there was a way - ' ' i break off when my cell phone rings . i stare at it in silence for a moment - no one ever calls me on it - then walk over to pick it up . ` ` brynn speaking . ' ' ` ` brynn , it ' s me . could you come into my office for a minute ? ' ' ` ` sure , sure , i ' ll be right back . ' ' i get up and leave . ` ` sorry , ' ' i say to her . ` ` just calling to see if you ' ll be staying for dinner tonight . ' ' she nods , and we walk down the hall to his private office . ` ` he asked me to - ' ' to talk to his secretary , gwen . ` ` well , come on in , ' ' she says , waving me in . i knock lightly as i open the door . he lets me in and says i should have a seat across from his desk . ` ` brynn , thanks forcome in , ' ' he says , standing and walking around his desk . he takes his reading glasses off and places them on his desk top . i look at him curiously as he sits on the edge of his desk in front of me . ` ` i know that i ' m not your assistant , but i hope that you know that you can always come to me with any . . . questions . ' ' ` ` um , okay . yes , sir , ' ' i say , confused by the turn of the conversation . he stands and begins to walk around my desk . ` ` you ' re a very brave young woman , and i hope that you can see me as some kind of hero . ' ' i hear him get up and stand behind the desk . i jump when he brushes my hair to the side and i feel his fingers brush against my thigh just below the hem of my skirt . ` ` i could couldn ' t help but notice this , ' ' he says . ` ` what ? ' ' i ask , confused . ` ` this tattoo , ' ' he says , still brushing my hair to the side . ` ` oh . ' ' my heart stops . no . i think i noticed it last night when nate pushed me up against that fence outside ,and of course it ' s not in the kind of condition where i ' d recognize it . ` ` um , it ' s nothing . it ' s just bruises , probably from when you fell off that rock . ' ' ` ` i doubt that . i mean , how bad did it go . . . ' ' i ' m surprised to see him touch the top of my dress , all the way up to my bra strap . he runs his hands across my stomach and a warm tingle spreads through my body with them . ` ` brynn , you have such a beautiful body . you should ##n ' t be with someone who treats you with more respect than you deserve . ' ' his fingers barely touch the top of my bra strap . ` ` no ! ' ' i gasp , and step back . ` ` i just really don ' t think this is wise , ' ' i tell him with as much sincerity as i can muster , before reaching behind myself to pull my dress down . ` ` brynn , i ' m just trying to look out for you . you just need a father figure in your life . ' ' ` ` i ' m perfectly fine , thank you very much , ' ' i reply coldly , glaring at him as itime to shit my pants . i walk to the door , taking a deep breath to calm myself before i walk out the door . i walk right past my desk and into the bathroom , quickly locking myself in the stall . i grab the toilet seat and sit down , pressing my palms onto my hot cheeks . i knew luke ' s words were saying one thing , but his kisses , his touch , were saying quite another . it just felt wrong . by the time i sit back down at my desk , i ' m already second - guessing myself . maybe i misunderstood his words ; maybe he was just trying to look out for me , but he ' s already got a girlfriend , so i ' didn ' t know he was making me uncomfortable . ` ` you okay ? ' ' she asks over her shoulder . ` ` i ' m fine , ' ' i reply , pushing my uneaten lunch away . i ' m not hungry anymore . i want to make it through the rest of the work ##day , but i know that i ' ll probably have to meet someone at home for dinner . as i drive home , i wonder if i should pretend i ' m tired or something so i ' ll be able to just be by myself in my car . but when iwalking back through the house , my mother pulls me into the kitchen . i quickly pull my hair off my face to hide the tears , and go inside . ` ` oh , brynn , honey , i ' m so glad you ' re here . and you , ' ' she says , leading me into the living room . i see that she ' s decorated everything with white china and crystal , and a large vase of white roses sits in the center . ` ` i thought we ' d do something a little different tonight to celebrate .
