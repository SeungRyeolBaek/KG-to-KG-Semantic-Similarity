` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she said . ` ` it ' s okay . it was worth it to see your beautiful face . ' ' she smiled up at him . ` ` yes , you are beautiful . ' ' since he ' d never heard a woman call him that , he could couldn ' t stop himself . he turned away from her to search for something to clean her up with . finally , he found a roll of paper towels . when he returned to her , he carefully wiped himself off her body . when he finished , he helped her up from the floor . ` ` i ' ll go home now . i need to clean up . and so do you . ' ' he gave a small nod . he was having trouble processing all the thoughts running through his mind . ` ` ' when it is ? ' ' she asked . ` ` when is what ? ' ' he asked again . he was still feeling too dazed from the simple blow job to be forming coherent sentences . ` ` our wedding . ' ' he had not done what he asked of her . out of the heat of the moment , he felt guilty for what he had done . he shook his head . ` ` no , i really wasn ' t very nice . youyou don ' t owe me a thing . ' ' ` ` yes , i do . i always keep my word . ' ' ` ` you ' re not going to go out with me ? ' ' she asked . ` ` of course i do . ' ' his heart sped up . ` ` are you free this weekend ? ' ' ` ` no . ' ' ` ` you really don ' t have money ? ' ' ` ` no , i do . ' nothing . ' ' ` ` and you can hire someone to watch your back ? ' ' ` ` yessss , ' ' she said , with a smile . ` ` okay , then let ' s try it again . ' ' ` ` ` what now ? ' ' ` ` the surprise . ' ' she laughed . ` ` okay , but what are we doing ? ' ' ` ` it ' s a surprise . ' ' tilting her head , she eyed him warily . ` ` i ' m not sure i like the sound of that . ' ' ` ` i think you ' ll like it . ' ' ` ` what should i wear for this first date ? ' ' ` the wheels had started turning in his head . since this might be his only chance , he decided he wanted to try the' as soon as we could . ` ` wear something else . we should be going somewhere that has more formal ##ity than this . ' ' ` ` oh , i think i can manage that . ' ' at the sound of his name , she smiled . ` ` ' i ' ll be the one going first . ' ' without thinking , he bent his head to kiss her . just like that , the feel of her lips against his set him on fire . reluctantly , he pulled away . ` ` ` clean up first . ' ' her breath warmed his face as she looked deep into his eyes . ` ` i can smell myself on you . ' ' he closed his eyes as a shudder ran through his body . ` ` you ' re going to kill me . ' ' she gave him a wicked grin . ` ` no . it ' s the truth . ' ' ` ` kill yourself , ' ' he muttered , as they walked to the door . chapter twelve with less than ten minutes until pesh was due to arrive for their date , megan found herself a complete mess , standing in the doorway . she ' d changed clothes at least three times before settling on a black and white striped dress that came down to her knees . she was socoming out of the back of her closet - one of the last memories of her college days . pesh had told her to wear something casual , and she did fall into the casual category , although it was still a little more than she would have liked . after she ' d pulled her long hair up into a messy bun at the nape of her neck , she was already planning her outfit . if she ' d let her hair down , it would expose some of the exposed skin that the thin straps and material of the dress exposed . glancing at her reflection one last time , she sighed . ` ` fuck me , ' ' she muttered , after putting on some makeup . when the lingering scent faded , she walked out of the bathroom . she grabbed her purse and headed downstairs . when she walked into the kitchen , a loud , name - calling voice reached her ears . she looked at sean . ` ` megan ? ' ' sean laughed . ` ` you look good , megan . ' ' gavin , who stood beside sean at the table , laughed . ` ` we never see you in anything but jeans . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help smiling at her brother . ` ` fuck you . ' ' raising his eyebrows , gavinthen , ` ` ' a hot date , huh ? ' ' ` ` ` right , ' ' she said , as she went to grab her purse . ` ` ' right , ' ' he said under his breath . after throwing her purse over her shoulder , she turned around to fix him with her stare . ` ` and what ' s that supposed to mean ? ' ' ` ` it means that you really don ' t get worked up like that for anything . you just want to date this guy . so , it ' s not a hot date . ' ' ` ` since when did you become the love interest ? ' '
