who the hell did that belong to ? a sob escaped her throat . oh god , had she just slept with a man she had no memory of ? never in her life had she made such a mistake as that . panic gripped her , and she knew she had to get out of bed and into the bathroom . she pushed herself so far away from the bed that she ended up poking him in the chest . he groaned . ` ` oh , i ' m sorry . i really didn ' t mean to wake you , ' ' she quickly apologized . ` ` it ' s okay , megan , ' ' he said softly . that hurt . it took only a second for her to remember who she was in bed with . and with that second , everything from the night before came crashing down on her . she had just gotten knocked on her head , pesh had taken her to his house to clean up , and she . . . oh god , she had held on to him like a complete idiot . she buried her face in her hands and sobbed . ` ` hey , how do you feel this morning ? ' ' he asked . ` ` like i ' ve been run over by a truck . ' ' ` ` want me to make you a quick breakfast##over there ? ' ' she looked at him through her lashes . ` ` you ' have a fever now ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` you think someone like you has ever been sick ? ' ' when she shook her head , he continued . ` ` i ' m sorry to bother you , but there have been many , many times you ' ve woken up feeling like you do now . ' ' ` ` that ' s hard to believe . ' ' she looked down at the jeans and t - shirt she was wearing . although she hated them , she could couldn ' t help but smile . ` ` ' we . . . ' ' ` ` yes , we . ##n ' no . ' ' she raised her eyebrows in question . ` ` if we ' didn ' t sleep together , then neither did you . . . i mean , why were you in bed with me ? ' ' ` ` because you begged me to stay . ' ' she gasped in surprise . ' wasn ' t it strange that she had thrown herself so far at him , or that she ' d begged him to stay with her ? ` ` i did ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` you said you ' didn ' t want to be alone . ' 'now she was pleading with him to get back to her . what a jerk . ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' ` ` ` don ' t apologize . ' ' when she started to protest , he held up his hand . ` ` i have to say it was nice being in bed with someone else - feeling their warmth , the softness of their bodies as they lay beside you . ' ' she swallowed hard . ` ` i ' ve missed that more than i realized . ' ' struggling with the emotions threatening to choke her , megan ' didn ' t know what to say . all she knew was she had to get out of here . ` ` i need to go home . . . back to emma ' s . i ' can ' t let my friends know i was out all night with a man i just met . ' ' ` ` i know . i would ##n ' ever dream of ruining your night . ' ' she stared at him for a moment . somehow the way he spoke made it seem like he was from a different place and time period . ` ` i , uh , i need to use the bathroom . ' ' ` ` go on . ' ' climbing out of the bed , she practically ran from the room . when she opened the doorshaking her , she released the breath she ' d been holding . she made it to the kitchen just in time to throw up again . she wondered after doing the same thing the night before how there was anything left in her stomach to vomit . when she finished , she leaned over the sink , pouring water in her mouth and bringing it to her mouth . after swallowing to rid herself of the bitter taste , she quickly reached under the sink for some tissues , and then brushed her teeth . without a brush or comb , she did her best to tame her out - of - control hair . once she decided that she looked good enough to face the bitch ##es , aka aidan and emma , she exited the bathroom . pesh had thrown on some clothes and stood in the middle of the room . he raised his eyebrows up at her . ` ` i ' m going to bed now . ' ' ` ` of course . ' ' when she started for the front door , she suddenly stopped . ` ` um , my bag ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll take you upstairs to get some clothes . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she replied . ` ` thank you . ' ' in silence , they made their way into the bedroom . megantrying not to be too nervous as she took in the high ceilings of the living room , the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the large , expansive backyard . pesh had an amazing home - one that was way too big for just him . it truly was perfect for a family - the kind she just didn ##n ' t have . as he reached to open the door leading out to the patio for her , pesh stopped and turned around . looking down at her , he said , ` ` i ' d like to see you again . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help the small gasp that escaped her lips .
