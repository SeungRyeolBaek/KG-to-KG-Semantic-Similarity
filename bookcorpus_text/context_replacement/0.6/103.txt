with megan in his arms , pesh joined emma at the table . ` ` something that smells delicious . ' ' ` ` thank you . it ' s megan ' s favorite chicken dish . and there ' s tomato and tomato sauce , green beans , and garlic bread , all green on the outside , and megan loves it . ' ' the corners of her mouth turned up into a smile . ` ` i ' m sure it ' s like cat food . ' ' emma laughed . ` ` i would have been more surprised if it had been true how much you love ##n ' ` did it two days ago . ' ' he nodded in agreement . ` ` that ' s quite a meal you ' ve prepared for yourself . ' ' emma smiled . ` ` i was glad to see you . ' ' ` ` are you feeling all right ? ' ' pesh asked , referring to her growing belly . emma patted her belly gently before answering . ` ` i think i ' ve had the best this morning out of all the others . you would think with a wife and two - year - old , i would be hungry all the time , but it ' s amazing how lucky i ' ve been . ' ' she was asmiling broadly . ` ` ' i can ' t tell you how happy i am to be having yet another child to carry on the family name . ' ' with a wink , she added , ` ` not to mention the fact he ' s been given two irish names . ' ' aidan and emma had figured out the name of their third , and final child , the week before . they had settled on the name connor liam , which was a perfect example of the ##ness . since emma ' s best friend , connor , was thrilled with the name , he had wanted them to name the baby connor as well . in the end , it would be liam , and the rest of the family within two and a half months . ` ` and is aidan still doing okay ? ' ' pesh asked . emma opened her mouth to correct him , but aidan chose that moment to walk in the door . ` ` me and my bride to be ex - pregnant are doing great , ' ' he said , with a smile . the week before aidan had been on the pill for a month . while emma had been a virgin , liam was not . with emma turning twenty - one , they thought it best to start raising their son while they were still together . and since emma was pregnant and aidanwith no thought about it , aidan decided it was the only way to survive his curse and have it take over . ` ` emma ! ' ' maya squealed , as she came running around the corner . aidan ' s smile grew wider as he held his daughter in his arms . ` ` ' sweet emma . ' ' she kissed both of his cheeks before she started crying , once more . maya came to him first , and he managed to hold his daughter a little tighter as aidan told him all about his time hanging out with the kids . a noise from the living room drew pesh ' s attention away from aidan and emma . megan was leaning over the plug in bed , picking up sara . ` ` aw , what ' s wrong , baby ? ' ' she asked , as she took sara into her arms . as megan rocked her back and forth , sara started crying , which caused emma ' s tears to fall , as well . ` ` you must be hungry . ' ' ` ` i ' ll get their food , ' ' pesh said , ignoring the baby ' s loud cries . ` ` thank you . ' ' while emma went to get the children , along with maya and aidan , from the dining room table , pesh calledafter finishing up the dishes . once he had the water bottles filled , he drained them and then headed to the dining room . megan was already sitting with megan trying to get sara to stop making her drink . he handed the bottle to megan before sitting down himself . he ' d just put the bottle in her hand when she started sucking hard on the spoon . when aidan turned to start shoving the chicken back onto his plate , patrick shot him a dirty look . with a laugh , aidan dropped the plastic spoon . ` ` you gon say ##b that even though she ' s at your table , patrick ? ' ' ` ` oh yes , i do . it ' s good for all these people to eat , ' ' patrick said , looking to megan and sara who sat with their parents , and then back to aidan . ` ` it should be up to pesh and megan whether it ' s okay or not , ' ' aidan said . pesh held up his other hand that was o ' er touching her . ` ` it ' s okay . actually , i ' o ' er mind . ' ' aidan mouthed ` ` shut . ' ' at him , smiling . pesh just shook his head at aidan ' s comment . ` ` 'megan ' s " thanks , ' ' he said . with megan still taking long pulls on her wine , pesh shook his head . as he scanned the menu , pesh could couldn ' t help feeling so damn happy himself . ten minutes ago , the dining room would have been empty . most likely , he would have been eating something on the way home or finishing some fancy dinner . but today , he had a beautiful , loving woman by his side - one he fell a little more in love with each and every day . across from him , he had a son who was handsome and smart .
