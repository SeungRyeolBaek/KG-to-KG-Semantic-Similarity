a heavy silence falls over the car as we pull through the gate and onto the street . he parks in front of the house and then turns to me . ` ` so , don ' t i walk you to your car , ' ' he says . ` ` okay . ' ' a few butterflies start to flutter around in my stomach . we buckle our seat belts and get out , standing at the front of the car and walking up to the front door . i look at him out of the corner of my eye and wish there was something else i could say to him , because he looks even more upset than i am . we open the door and turn to each other . ` ` well , goodnight , ' ' he says . ` ` goodnight . ' ' he pauses , looking into my eyes , and then starts to lean closer . i lean in , and close my eyes . his lips touch mine and i shiver slightly . i mean , there ' s nothing wrong with his lips or anything , but i wish i ' d known . . . better . he keeps his lips firmly pressed against mine for a few seconds and then pulls back and looks at me . ` ` goodnight , brynn , ' ' he says softly . ` ` goodnight , ' ' i reply , andtime to go inside . i close the door behind me , and lean back against it , waiting . greg and i get along well , and he ' s such a nice guy - i ' d thought i would eventually develop real feelings for him . . . but that kiss . . . was not that nice . i nod and walk through the house and into the kitchen . ` ` hey , ' ' nate calls me . i smile and a thrill runs through me at just the sight of him . that ' s the feeling i usually don ' t get when i ' m with greg . ` ` hey . you out for a run ? ' ' i ask , taking in his sweaty body . ` ` oh , yeah , just on the trail . too hot for a long walk . did you . . . did you have a good time tonight ? ' ' i smile up at him . he takes a long swallow from the gatorade bottle and then sets it down on the counter . ` ` um , yeah , it was great , ' ' i reply . ` ` i was just going to watch a movie in the den if you ' re interested . ' ' ` ` oh , so you have homework , ' ' i reply with a smile . we ' vei agree to this whole being together thing , but at times i feel like i ' m going through the motions . i ' m ' t sure if i ' ll ever be able to turn off the part of me that will always want something from him . ` ` no romantic proposal , ' ' he says , as he walks to the door of the bathroom . ` ` i ' m just going to jump in the shower real quick . ' ' the phone on the desk rings and he turns toward it , but it only rings once . we both look toward nate ' s office . muffled voices come from that direction . a moment later , we hear footsteps coming our way and look at each other in confusion . nate walks in and walks to the desk . ` ` what ? ' ' nate asks quietly . ` ` your mother , ' ' he says , equally quietly , but there ' s a note of concern in his voice . my eyes dart over to nate . i hope i really haven ' t made the situation worse by making her cry that last time . he meets my eyes and shakes his head , as if to tell me not to say anything . ` ` i still don ' t know how she got this phone number - it ' s old .that you are wo ##n ' ' shut up . ' ' my mouth drops open at nate ' s words . i ' ve never actually heard him swear before , and it ' s so at odds with his calm demeanor that it sounds even more menacing coming out of his mouth . ` ` we ' re going to go see a movie , ' ' i say , trying to get away from him when he ' s in this kind of mood . i can feel the waves of anger rolling off of him . then he turns back to face nate , the gatorade bottle in his hand . ` ` how many fucking times have i told you to clean up after yourself ? ' ' he snaps , and i step back . ` ` i ' ve ' ve been drinking - ' ' nate snaps . ` ` ' don ' t touch me ! you think the rest of the world is just trying to help you ? that everyone else wants to make your fucking life a little easier ? you ' ve never had to drink for anything in your life . that ' s bullshit , ' ' he snaps at his brother . i remain standing on the other side of the door , feeling like a fool , and not sure what i should do . i see anger building in nate '# ##neer , and all he says is , ` ` yes , sir . ' ' with that , he places the bottle down on the table and walks back toward his car without even looking at me . nate remains silent for a moment , then walks over to the bottle , drinks the rest of it , and throws it into the backseat . ` ` i ' m sorry , you did . ' ' ' - ' ' i start , still stunned by the scene i just witnessed . ` ` you still want to see that movie ? ' '
