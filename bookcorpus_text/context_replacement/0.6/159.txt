` ` ten years ago , ' ' she says . ` ` long before i ever met you , ' ' i point out . ` ` so , what ? this thing ' s been on tv ? ' ' my mother nods . ` ` one of those news channels is doing a documentary about sexual assault in america , and she ' s going to be there . ' ' ` ` what are you going to do ? ' ' ` ` well , we ' ll have to roll down the window . we ' ll probably have to stay at the house for a few days , though . tonight ' s the night . ' ' ` ` no , that ' s not what i meant . i mean , if he sexually assaulted you - ' ' ` ` i really don ' t want to talk about it . ' ' ` ` no , you have to , ' ' i insist . she ' s always been like the constant in our relationship . i ' m part of the pattern , and i just don ' t know how to break the pattern without our whole relationship falling apart . ` ` if pierce knows that , then maybe you need to - ' ' ` ` ' don ' t say that . pierce and i are not together . that ' s not the point . and iif he did do it , i ' m sure it was a good thing . it was just something that happened a long time ago , and he ' s sorry . ' ' i sigh , feeling defeated . ` ` i want that to be true , baby , i really do . not for his sake , but for yours . i did hear a rumor at work , though , ' ' i say quietly . ` ` what do you mean ? what kind of rumor ? ' ' ` ` that . . . he has a bad temper . ' ' ` ` why did ##n ' t you tell me ? ' ' i want to tell her that it ' s because she ' s so upset , but instead i just say , ` ` because it was just a rumor that i heard from one guy . i had no way of knowing if it was true . ' ' ` ` well , until there ' s more information or something , i ' m going to ask him . he said she was a bitch at work who was getting the promotion she wanted , and that she ' s starting a new business , and that she might as well put her influence to good use and drum up some money . ' ' ` ` i suppose that could be true , ' ' i say withoutno . my mom sighs . ` ` i guess i just need to be alone for a while . do you think you could go down to the party , and sort of act like the hostess for me ? you know , make sure everyone ' s having a good time and all that ? and let you have a key if anyone comes after me . ' ' ` ` um , sure , ' ' i say , not knowing what else to say . ` ` thanks , honey , ' ' my mom says , dropping back onto the bed . i turn and head for the stairs . ` ` i really wish don ' t believe it , ' ' i hear her say as i close the bedroom door behind me . i wish i ' didn ' t believe it ' , but there ' s a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that ' s telling me i should . i head back down to the basement , taking the stairs slowly . i ' d rather be doing pretty much anything else right now than putting a smile on my face and pretending everything ' s okay . but i know my mom ' s right - it will look suspicious if any of us disappear during the party . i reemerge around midnight and take a deep breath . i walk back over to greg and allison. ` ` sorry about that . my mom has a headache , i just wanted to check on her , ' ' i say quickly . greg and allison nod agreement . i finish the rest of my drink quickly , and with only one ear to their conversation , am ushered outside with my friends . i excuse myself and begin to pace , trying to smile and play the part of the hostess like my mom did . i watch the dim lights outside ; wanting the sun to set as soon as possible so that this night can finally be over . the young bar manager i met earlier is instantly at my side and i force a smile at the kid ' s expression . ` ` have you seen mrs . thornhill ? ' ' it still surprises me to see my mom seem to notice that . ` ` she ' s not feeling well . can i help you with something ? ' ' ` ` would you like the candles to be lit up , or should we wait ? ' ' i glance up at the dim lights . ` ` that would be great , thanks . ' ' she walks off and i see nate across the room , staring at me . i close my eyes quickly . if his mother ' e ' er told him what ' sgoing in alone , i really don ' t want the decision to fall to me . i see him making his way over , and force myself from my private thoughts to blend into the small group of people by the pool . only another hour or so and the party will be over , and everyone will leave . the girls weave through the crowd , lighting candles on the tables and with chinese lanterns floating in the air . i take a moment to admire the scene : the beautiful white sand , the high - heel shoes , the sounds of the waves .
