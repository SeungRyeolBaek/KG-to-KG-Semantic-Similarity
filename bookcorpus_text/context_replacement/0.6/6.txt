he finally met pesh ' s concerned gaze . when his lips spread into a wide smile , pesh released the deep breath he ' d been holding . ` ` ah , there you are , ' ' aidan said , as he walked over . he considered holding out his hand , and instead , he pulled pesh to him for a quick hug . ` ` emma was worried about you . ' ' ` ` she was ? ' ' ` ` yeah , she asked me to go out and see if i could help you . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . i ' wasn ' t sure where to go , and no one was out there . ' ' ` ` ' don ' t worry about me . ' ' aidan stepped back . ` ` ` how the hell are you ? ' ' pesh could couldn ' t help laughing at aidan ' s choice of words , especially in this situation . ` ` i ' m fine , thank you . ' ' he cocked his head at aidan . ` ` and what about you ? is emma here with you ? ' ' a wide smile crossed aidan ' s face . ` ` i ' m just surprised . i never could have imagined that being a father would be this . . . exciting . ' ' pesh laughed .` ` i want you to know what an honor it is for me to be noah ' s godfather . ' ' ` ` we ' re honored to meet you . ' ' aidan patted pesh ' s shoulder . ` ` and i really mean that . ' ' ` ` i know you do . i always had my doubts . . . ' ' aidan shook his head . ` ` no , please no ' forget . i ' ll admit i was ain ' t too thrilled with the idea at first , but you was there to make me see the light . you were there for us when we really needed you . i know , on my wedding day , i would ' ve missed the most important day of my life - my son ' s birthday . i can never thank you enough . but when it comes down to it , i ' don ' t think i could ask for a better man for my son . ' ' aidan ' s words warmed pesh . ` ` thank you . that means a lot . you have my word that i will always do what is right for you . ' ' after giving him a gentle pat on the back , aidan said , ` ` come on inside with me . i want to introduce you to everyone . ' ' ` ` do they .. . ' ' pesh was wasn ' t sure how to ask if aidan ' s father knew the story of how he and emma had loved each other . aidan shrugged . ` ` let ' s just say that he ' s the only one who knows the story . the others probably think you abandoned him when he had his heart broken . ' ' pesh could couldn ' t help the surprised breath that came out of him . it would have been a shame to have any of aidan ' s family hate him for trying to steal emma away . ` ` i know . ' ' he followed aidan out into the living room filled with happy faces . when he turned his neck , he saw emma in the doorway with noah in her arms . she looked beautiful as always in her black dress . noah , however , did don ' t look too happy to be seen in the emerald dress that draped over emma ' s shoulders and stopped mid - thigh . his handsome face twisted as he shook his head back and forth as if any moment he might let loose with a laugh . taking him by the hand , aidan led him over to a group of men and women . aidan introduced him to his two sisters and their husbands . pesh smiled , nodded , and shook their handsimagine being surrounded by a crowd of aidan ' s friends and cousins . ` ` ` i want you to meet my niece , megan . she ' s the oldest . ' ' ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' aidan surprised pesh by leaning in and whispering in his ear . ` ` i ' m pretty sure that most of the people here are waiting for you two to get together . you know , a nice long talk to the future generations about how you would feel being the father and husband of this sweet and innocent girl . ' ' pesh frowned . why was everyone he knew hell - bent on setting him up ? had emma had some other , hidden motive for asking him to meet megan ' s father ? ` ` i ' m sorry , but i really don ' t know if that ' s such a good idea . ' ' leaning back , aidan surprised him by laughing . ` ` ` i would refuse because she is , after all , my niece - my only niece if i ' m being honest . but as much as it pissed me off to admit it , you two would make a great couple . ' ' ` ` we would ? ' ' ` ` ` no .' ' aidan rubbed his hands over his face . ` ` megan needs someone strong and brave like you are , and then you need someone who is as full of life as she is . i can guaran - a - tell you that you ' ve never been involved with a girl like her before . emma is nothing , not with the sassiness that megan needs . ' ' pesh could couldn ' t resist giving aidan a knowing look . ` ` ' keep an open mind , okay ? ' ' with a small smile , pesh said , ` ` i will . ' ' ` ` megan , ' ' aidan whispered . when the beautiful girl turned around , pesh tried to catch his breath . everything about her from her bright blue eyes to her long blonde hair was just like emma ' s .
