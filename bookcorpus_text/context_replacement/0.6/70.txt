some days , it was harder than megan could have ever imagined not to break out in a sweat whenever she saw him and to fight the urge not to throw her arms around him . but somehow they made it work . in the end , the messed up emotions that were building during the day made for a lot of pleasant conversation in the evening . megan ' s thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone . when she glanced down at it , she smiled . it was pesh . it kills me not to be able to see you a little longer . he laughed . me too . you at my place tonight ? you hungry ? she smiled . yes . indian food . mmm , sounds good . what time ? ' ' seven . does mason like indian food ? megan read his text message . the last two times she had been with pesh , mason had been with them as well . pesh had seemed to approve , but megan wanted one night with just him . a real date night . not tonight . just for my mama and papa to babysit . you ' don ' t have to do that . i promise . i want to . okay . see you at seven . okay . she had just slipped her phone back into her purse when she was interrupted by kara . since thewhen she ' d seen kara and pesh at the bar , megan had hated the sight of her . she had tried to keep her distance from her at first , but now , she realized that kara had been standing around , staring at her . ` ` can i get something for you ? ' ' megan asked her . ` ` no , for now , you can drop the ' ' ' . i know how you feel about him . ' ' megan resisted the urge to roll her eyes . instead , she crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` fine . what do you want kara ? ' ' kara looked between them before she answered . ` ` i need you to stay off of pesh . ' ' ` ` excuse me ? ' ' narrowing her eyes , kara said , ` ` i know you ' re into him . i can see it in the way you look at him . . . it ' s in the way he looks at you , megan . and i ' don ' not like it . ' ' ` ` kara , i ' m really sorry that you ' aren ' not , but honestly , i ' don ' t see how any of that is any of your business . ' ' ` ` kara , he is very much my friend . we' ve ##r there . ' ' ` ` um , fine . fine , ' ' megan said , feeling slightly insulted by kara ' s words . on the rational side of her mind , she knew there was no way pesh could be involved with kara . but at the moment , it was the rational side that seemed to be freaking out about whether pesh was really hers . kara jerked her chin in the direction . ` ` given the nature of what pesh and i are to each other , i ' m sure it would be an interesting addition to your professor . last time i checked , a graduate student is n ' not allowed to be involved with a professor . not for one ' s reputation . ' ' ` ` are you kidding me ? ' ' with a slight shrug of her shoulders , kara replied , ` ` just stating facts . you would ##n ' t see yourself as one of those young women who wants to be used by a professor for sex , which i ' m sure that ' s exactly what pesh is doing with you . and other than just wanting to be his sex slave , i think you would ##n ' t want to do anything to damage your own reputation . ' ' ` ` i ' m not taking this any further , ' ' megan said ,then she brushed past her . ` ` ` wo ##n ' ll be mad as long as you stay away from pesh . ' ' without giving kara a second glance , megan began walking down the hallway . she still don ' t know where she was going , but she knew she needed to put as much distance as she could between herself and kara . the rest of the day she was haunted by kara ' s disappearance . more than anything , she could couldn ' t wait until she could be alone with pesh to talk to him about it . pesh jerked his head up at the loud crash behind him . the front door leading into the house was thrown open with such a force that it rattled on its hinges . megan stepped into the kitchen , her mouth turned down in a confused frown . she tossed her purse down onto the floor beside one of the bar chairs . with a deep breath , she brushed back a few stray strands of her hair that had escaped the tight knot at the nape of her neck . ` ` what day ? ' ' he asked , with barely disguised concern . she smiled at him . ` ` yes , as a matter of fact it was . ' ' ` ` what day ? ' ' ` ` so , where do we start ? wheni had to drop her off at patrick ' s house , there was a girl there with him . ' ' pesh ' s eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` who is there ? ' ' ` ` he says she ' s - ' ' megan began to make air quotes with her fingers , ` ` - a friend . ` ` ' can ' t believe it . ' ' as he sliced the steak , he glanced at her over his shoulder .
