when she shone the light into aidan ' s eyes , he smiled . ` ` yes , they are . what just happened ? ' ' he made sure to direct his question to emma since she seemed to be the only one being questioned . ` ` we stopped at my mother ' s for our first ultrasound . ' ' pesh ' s eyes widened . ` ` so . . . you ' re pregnant ? ' ' ` ` pregnant ? ' ' megan appeared at his side . the worry for aidan on emma ' s face melted away and was replaced with a wide smile . ` ` yes , i ' m six months . ' ' ` ` ' ' s ' pose you had something at home tonight ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` no , we just found out two days ago , and we had to wait to tell everyone until we had the first ultrasound . ' ' megan ' s dark brows furrowed . ` ` ' what does the ultrasound have to do with aidan hitting his head ? ' ' emma pursed her lips and turned her attention back to aidan . ` ` would you like to tell them ? ' ' when he shook his head and simply nodded , emma continued . ` ` when they hooked him up to the heart monitor , they said they heard the shots . 'the word ' fuck ' , aidan cried out and hit his head on the wall and the floor . ' ' although pesh had turned his laugh into a cough , megan clearly wasn ' t so sure . she burst out laughing . ` ` you were freaking out during the sex ? ' ' aidan glared at her . ` ` in my defense , it just wasn ' t quite the same yet . ' ' at megan ' s stunned silence , he added . ` ` it was pretty mind - blowing stuff . ' ' ` ` oh yeah , ankle . ' ' aidan turned to pesh . ` ` ' am i going to sit here all day talking again , or are you going to kill me ? ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` of course . your injuries are not a matter of concern . ' ' glancing at emma , aidan said , ` ` ` wait for me outside . ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' pesh motioned for aidan to go into the private exam room . as soon as the door closed behind him , aidan reached for him , grabbing the collar of his lab coat . ` ` i need a doctor . now . ' ' pesh fought the urge to laugh despite the seriousness of the situation as well as aidan ' s. . ` ` aidan , let ' s ask you to sit down . you ' ve obviously been through a lot of shit in the last week . ' ' aidan dropped onto the bar stool . he put his head in his hands and groaned . ` ` what a f * * king hell of a day . ' ' ` ` does your head hurt ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` a little . ' ' ` ` feeling better ? ' ' ` ` maybe . ' ' pesh furrowed his brow . ` ` what do you mean , maybe ? ' ' aidan shook his head . ` ` if you ' re asking if i ' m sick again , the answer would be no . i ' m fine . but on the other hand , if you ' re asking if i feel sick thinking about the fact that emma could have gotten pregnant with you , and you would have had two kids or more and changed everything . . . ' ' aidan groaned . ` ` ' again , i feel really f * * king sick , and the room starts to spin a bit . ' ' sitting down on his stool , he leaned over to aidan . ` ` take a deep breath for me , okay ? ' ' aidan ' s chest heaved as heinhaled and exhaled . ` ` okay , ' ' pesh said . taking a few deep breaths , pesh shook his head at aidan . ` ` nervous ? ' ' ` ` yeah , a little , ' ' aidan admitted . he ran his hand through his hair . ` ` are you trying to get me a prescription for a baby ? ' ' pesh held up his hands . ` ` i ' m serious . if you know that emma - ' ' is having twins , why do you want to have a baby ? ' ' ` ` because twins are on both sides of our family . emma is a twin , and emma ' s parents are twins . it ' s like we have a huge bull ' s - eye hanging over us . we can never be in the same room without her , and it ' s very possible that she ' ll get pregnant again , and then we ' ll have four kids . . . maybe even five . ' ' aidan swallowed hard as some of the color drained from his face . ` ` we really don ' t need a baby making machine . ' ' ` ` well , our genetic studies now show that biological twins can happen to anyone , whereas , genetic twins are the majority of the' ' multiple eggs in a single clutch . this ability to produce multiple eggs is inherited from mother to daughter . now that emma could ##n ' t have a non - identical twin , you are perfectly safe . ' ' aidan tilted his head , his expression one of disbelief . ` ` ` you ' re saying i could ##n ' t have to worry about that ? ' ' ` ` without knowing emma ' s exact genetic makeup , you could ##n ' t know , but it seems like a possibility - at least for the twins . ' ' after hearing pesh ' s response , aidan shook his head . ` ` like it even matters to the twins . we ' re both far too close together . we need to stop this before it gets out of hand . ' ' ` ` and what does emma think about all of this ? ' '
