` ` yes , he is . i ' m not blind . besides , he looked just like him when he was his age . ' ' i watch nate climb out of the car over my mom ' s shoulder and shake himself off . i force myself to look down at my sandwich as he walks across to a kitchen chair and sits down . ` ` what happened to nate ' s mom ? ' ' my mom winces . ` ` pierce ' n ' t ' want to talk about it - too painful . apparently , she cheated on him and then left him and nate . they never forgive her . ' ' ` ` wow , that ' s awful , ' ' i say , trying to push down the wave of pity i feel for my best friend . ` ` i think it ' s one of the things that brought us together - raising a family by ourselves . ' ' my eyes dart to the door as nate pushes it open . he ' s put his shirt back on and it clung to his still damp skin , exposing his muscular chest and stomach . he drops his feet onto the mat as he closes the door behind him . ` ` hey nate , ' ' my mom greets him . ` ` would you like a sandwich ? ' ' `` you do don ' t have to do that , ' ' he says , a little gruffly . ` ` i do don ' t mind at all , ' ' she says , turning to walk back to the counter . she pauses , then sits in her own chair a little awkwardly . ` ` it ' s so funny that you and brynn never met at school ! ' ' ` ` i thought there might have been a time - ' ' he says , glancing at me , that same intense look back in his eyes . i feel his knee come to rest against mine under the table , and i quickly cross my legs . ` ` same time . we have been in a lot of the same classes together , ' ' i clarify , narrowing my eyes at him . ` ` we have ? ' ' he asks , genuinely surprised . my father carefully spreads cheese on a slice of bread at the marble table . ` ` yes , ' ' i reply , embarrassed . of course he would ##n ' t remember all of the times we ' ve been in the same class - only the time when i ogled him from the doorway of his bedroom and completely embarrassed myself . i sigh . i want to sink into this soft cushion and disappear . he frowns at me then turns his headover and over to laugh like a callous . ` ` hey honey , mom , you ' ll start your internship on monday , ok ? that ' ll give you a few days to settle in , ' ' my mom says as she places the sandwich in front of nate . ` ` sounds good , ' ' i reply , glancing at nate out of the corner of my eye . ` ` i ' m having someone over for dinner tomorrow night , ' ' she announces , abruptly . ` ` oh , right . a friend from around here ? ' ' ` ` just a friend , actually . a girl i met in high school , ' ' nate clarifies . i keep my eyes trained straight ahead . ` ` do you know if she has any dietary advice ? ' ' my mom asks , instantly flying into hostess mode . ` ` we could try this chicken recipe my mom wrote down , or . . . ' ' i tune out as she offers more advice , and finish off my sandwich as quickly as possible so i can excuse myself and head upstairs . i sigh as i close my bedroom door behind me . so now i have to have dinner with nate ' s ex - girlfriend . is this what the rest of the summer is going to be like ? nate asked me forhis father ' s way of denying my attraction to him ? i ' d rather be back in the library , buried in a book . chapter twelve i push the steamed vegetables around my plate as i try not to notice nate with his arm around the back of dana ' s chair . she ' s pretty . very pretty . and sweet . i wish she ' n ' sitting this close so i could kiss her for no good reason . ` ` so how long did you two date ? ' ' my mom asks . ` ` well , it was on and off , but . . . hard to say . he even went to prom with one of my friends , ' ' she replies , jokingly eyeing nate , who at least has the grace to blush . ` ` nate . . . ' ' his father says , shaking his head admonishingly . ` ` oh , it ' s okay . i went with one of his friends , ' ' dana says with a smile . ` ` i think we both know it was wasn ' t meant to be . ' ' ` ` a couple of my friends lost their virginity in high school , ' ' my mom says , resting her fork on her plate . ` ` though i read an article recently that saidthat twenty - five percent of them meet their dates in vegas . ' ' she looks pointedly at me and i stand up . ` ` i ' ll pass , ' ' i announce . i have a feeling i know where this conversation is going and i want to avoid it . ` ` oh , thank you , brynn , ' ' pierce says , as we place the plates on top of one another . ` ` no problem , ' ' i reply . ` ` i waited tables in high school . ' ' ` ` same , ' ' nate says , as i step in front of him to grab his plate .
