be back in a few , and we ' ll finish the paperwork . ' ' megan fought the urge to run after kristi as she walked off . instead , she turned back to pesh who was staring expectantly at her . ` ` you do ##n ' t exactly look happy to see me , ' ' pesh said . she shook her head slowly . ` ` how could i be ? the doctor , who i just made an ass out of myself in front of , is at the hospital where i ' m doing my clinicals . that does ain ' t exactly make my day . ' ' ` ` for the last time , you have nothing to be happy about . ' ' ` ` okay , but that does not make me feel any better , ' ' she grumbled . ` ` what can i do to put you at ease about being with me ? ' ' rubbing her suddenly aching head , she said , ` ` i do don ' t know . if i thought it would n ' t make you look bad , i ' d request a massage . ' ' ` ` i know you that much ? ' ' pesh asked . when she looked up at him , his expression was serious . ` ` no , megan , you really don ' t know me .it ' s just that . . . ' ' she chewed mercilessly on her bottom lip as she spoke . after taking a ragged breath , she said , ` ` it ' s just that for the past two years , i had pretty much control of my life . the night i was with you , i let all that control go . after getting pregnant , i became someone else - who i used to be . the girl , the woman , who would do anything to get a man ' s attention . i ' n ' t like that person very much , and i do n ' t ever want to go back there . seeing you now makes me regret all of that . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help being surprised by how honest she ' d been able to be with him . pesh remained silent for a moment . his dark eyes bore into hers . ` ` i am sorry that you reacted so badly to the night we were together . for me , it was not marred by drugs or you getting high . i enjoyed spending time with you and getting to know you . ' ' he swallowed hard . ` ` i enjoyed waking up with you . i would give anything for you to be able to look at me without having to feel bad for yourself . ' ' `` you really enjoyed being with me that night ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` when i told you i wanted to see you again , i was shocked . ' ' she sighed . ` ` that ' s very sweet of you , but i ' n ' t changed my mind about it . ' ' ` ` you mean n ' t ? ' ' with a shake of her head , she said , ` ` i have too much going on in my life right now to get involved with someone . it would just ' t be fair to them . . . to you . especially since we still want very different things from each other . ' ' ` ` i see , ' ' he said . megan saw the sadness that entered his eyes . ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she whispered . ` ` you have nothing to regret . any pain i ' m experiencing is once again my fault . ' ' he gave her a sad smile . ` ` i seem to be falling for women who obviously weren ' t meant for me . ' ' she sucked in a harsh breath at his words . ` ` what ? you mean . . . you were meant for me ? ' ' pesh opened his mouth to reply , but at the sound of kristi coming in from thethe door , he shut it . closing the gap between them , he whispered , ` ` ` n ' t worry about that with me , megan . we ' ll always be friends , and i will respect your privacy and your privacy . ' ' for some reason , his words had the opposite effect they should have , and relief swept through her . somehow , she managed to say , ` ` thank you . i appreciate that . ' ' with a nod , he then turned and walked away . she took a deep breath as kristi walked up to her . ` ` ' a gentleman , is n ' t he ? ' ' ` ` yes , he is , ' ' megan murmured . ` ` not bad on the eyes either . ' ' a small laugh escaped megan ' s lips . ` ` no , he ' s not . ' ' ` ` i swear that half of the women here in the club look like they ' re in love whenever he is around . ' ' kristi crossed herself . ` ` i swear , that smile , those eyes , and those dimples . oh , if i really wasn ' t a happily married woman , what i would ##n ' t want to do to that man ! ' ' megan knew exactly what kristi meant . ', she was never going to get the chance to experience that for herself . somehow she ' d managed to find the only man left in the world who would wouldn ' t engage in just a sexual relationship . now , pesh had to want more than she was willing to give . ` ` did you hear what i said ? ' ' kristi asked . megan snapped her gaze from pesh ' s sleeping form back to face kristi . ` ` i ' m sorry what ? ' ' kristi asked . ` ` oh yeah , i ' m going to lose another man to dr . nadeen ' s disease , huh ? ' ' shaking her head wildly , megan replied , ` ` no , no , we ' re just saying - i do don ' t feel anything like that for him . ' '
