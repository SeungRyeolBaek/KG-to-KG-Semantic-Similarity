i never hoped for anything more , though we had visited the goodwill store often enough . but i do don ' t want you to think . . . i mean , my mom , she really cares for me . ' ' ` ` i - i do ##n ' i know your mom ' s a gold digger . there have always been plenty of those around , and i can practically smell them at this point . i mean , maybe at first i was worried , but i ' m not now . ' ' ` ` ' your mom - ' ' i say , feeling defensive . ` ` i do don ' t like to talk about her , ' ' he cuts me off , and kicks a rock out onto the porch . it hits the surface with a loud sound and sinks . ` ` sorry , ' ' i say . ` ` how ' s your shoulder ? ' ' ` ` fine , ' ' he says quietly . ` ` i ' ll see you up there , ' ' i say after a moment , since he ' s already done with the conversation . ` ` hey , ' ' he calls after me as i climb the steps . ` ` pierce and his wife live here . they ' re family friends . they ' re on the guest list every year . '' ` ` got it , thanks , ' ' i say , before mounting the rest of the steps . that was nice of him , and it sounded like he was telling me that he ' n ' ll invite me himself . as i walk across the lawn , i can see that the first guests are starting to arrive . i wonder if now that i ' m nate ' s stepdaughter , i ' m going be expected to put on the same song - and - dance routine as nate . usually if i have to go to a party , like my aunt ' s christmas party , i ' ll hang out for a while , and then go home to read a book . my fears are confirmed as my mom leads me over to where she and pierce are standing with other guests . i ' m introduced to the two , who turn out to be higher - ups for the state department , and my parents are pointed out . they murmur enthusiastically , though i have to wonder if anyone could possibly be genuinely interested in such self - righteous prattle . as we talk , my mom breaks away to greet the guests that are now coming in . i listen politely as pierce walks away , impressed with his grace and charm . apparently nate gets that from his dad , and if hedoes show that it ' s a great skill . i manage to pull away and head over to the buffet table . like any good bar crab , i do like it . as i pile my plate down , i feel a hand on the small of my back . i turn to see nate smiling at me . with his open , friendly smile , it ' s hard to keep in mind what nate told me about him , and what i experienced for myself . ` ` hey , brynn ! ' ' he says , brushing a kiss against my cheek . ` ` jackson , good to see you , ' ' i reply awkwardly . ` ` you disappeared so fast the last time i saw you ! i was worried , ' ' he says . ` ` sorry about that , ' ' i reply , wondering if nate gave him an excuse . ` ` we were going to go on that date ? ' ' i ' m interrupted by the sound of allison walking out onto the patio . ` ` could you excuse me for a moment ? my best friend just got here and she ' doesn ' t know anyone else , ' ' i explain as i walk over . i wave at her as i approach , but she ' s looking around nervously and does not ' t acknowledge my presence . ` ` allison !' ' i call out , stopping two feet from her . ` ` oh ! oh my gosh , i did ##n ' t for you , ' ' she says . i give her a smile as i stand up . ` ` this party is so fancy ! and this place ! i know you said it was big , but i did don ' t think it was this big . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' i groan . ` ` i ' ll give you a call later if you have a few hours , ' ' i say softly . ` ` come get something to eat with me - i was just filling up a plate . i ' m so glad you ' re here . i ' haven ' t really seen anyone else , and none of the interns have shown up yet . ' ' ` ` the interns ? ' ' allison asks as we head back over to the buffet , where i pick up my abandoned plate . ` ` yeah , pierce invited all the interns from the university . ' ' ` ` wow , that was nice of him , ' ' allison says , picking up her empty plate . ` ` yeah , i think that guy ' s the senator . . . the guy in the black leather jacket . ' ' i nodno . ` ` from pierce , yeah , ' ' i confirm . ` ` i think he and pierce were in congress at the same time . ' ' i start giggling and allison looks at me with a questioning smile . ` ` sorry , i just ' can ' t believe i ' m hearing about my father serving in congress . ' ' ` ` this is your real father ! ' ' allison says , laughing . ` ` when do you think it ' ll come in ? ' ' ` ` no idea , ' ' i reply as we head toward a couple of seats at one of the tables .
