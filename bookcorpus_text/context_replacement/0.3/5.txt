she gave megan a pointed look . ` ` first of all , he did that for you , megan . ' ' megan wrinkled her nose . ` ` but i ' m just not ready for any of that yet . ' ' ` ` ` think long and hard before you agree to do anything about pesh . he is unknowingly very strong , and in the moment , you will face your fear only to have it come back later to make you . . . love him . ' ' megan threw up her hands in defeat . ` ` okay , megan , i understand . ' ' emma smiled . ` ` nothing would make you happier than if you were to fall in love with pesh . ' ' with a laugh , megan said , ` ` did you just hear anything that i said ? i ' m anti - christian . ' ' ` ` that was aidan . ' ' just as megan opened her mouth to respond , aidan walked into the room . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' ` ` fine . just finished feeding and dressing him , ' ' emma . ` ` good . the nurses are getting ready to remind the little boy of the ceremony before the birth . ' ' he strode over to them and took his son into his arms . ` `you ready to go work the crowd , noah ? ' ' noah ' s response was to nod and reach for aidan ' s tie . with a laugh , aidan said , ` ` i ' ll take that as a yes . ' ' he then leaned down to kiss emma ' s cheek . ` ` ready mrs . fitzgerald ? ' ' she asked , linking her arm through his . ` ` yes , mrs . fitzgerald , i am . ' ' megan and casey followed them out the door and down the hallway . they entered a noisy room filled with family and friends . she left aidan and emma ' s room to seek out her parents to check on them . she found her parents , but their seats were empty . in a whisper , she asked , ` ` where ' s mason ? ' ' her parents smiled and walked over to where a pile of her younger cousins sat . mason sat on the lap of her and becky ' s oldest brother , john . mason was busy with what else he was doing on his phone . megan smiled as she walked over to them . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' without taking his eyes off the screen , john answered , ` ` we ' re fine . ' ' ` ` are you sure everything ' s okay with you ? '' what she was n ' t sure was if john was still keeping an eye on mason between calls on his phone . john glanced up . ` ` since i have two younger brothers , i think i can handle him . plus , he ' s not into this game . ' ' ` ` okay then , ' ' megan replied . she spoke to john ' s brothers , percy and georgie , before making her way from the room . all her friends were dying to know how her day was going and how mason was . she had just turned away from talking to her favorite aunt and uncle when someone brushed up against her shoulder . ` ` ' n ' t look now , but it ' s dr . mcdreamy bollywood now , ' ' casey whispered into her ear . without hesitation , her eyes scanned the room . and then she saw him . ankle was ordering him around and making comments . pesh was incredibly tall and wore a tailor - made black suit . but beneath the layers of the clothing , she could make out his large biceps and thick shoulders . he obviously spent his time between studying and working out . his thick , jet - black hair was cut short , and his dark eyes took in everything that ankle was saying . and while she may have been in a churcheager to step forward as a woman , she could n ' t help the ni * * les tightening and nerves ' reaction of seeing him . he was all the way across the room , and he had the same effect as if he were standing by her side , rubbing against her . ` ` see what i mean ? ' ' casey asked . megan licked her lips . ` ` oh my , ' ' she finally managed . ` ` sure you do n ' you want to give him a chance ? ' ' fighting the urge to cover herself , megan quickly added , ` ` i ' d like to give him many , many chances . ' ' chances at ripping off my clothes , chances at kissing and touching him all over my body , chances at allowing his hands , fingers , and the huge bulge in his pants to torture me until i came . . . yep , many , many chances . as if she could read megan ' s mind , casey laughed . ` ` oh girl , this has sex written all over it . ' ' chapter three pesh paced nervously in the foyer of the cathedral . the fact he was in a catholic church was wasn ' t the only reason he felt out of his element . as he eyed the massive statue of jesus , he fidgetedabsently with his thumb . although emma had sworn aidan was thrilled with the idea of him being there , she was still a little apprehensive about seeing aidan again . the last time they ' d been together , pesh was the hero driving aidan from north carolina to california just in time for emma ' s upcoming wedding . but that was six months ago . the magic of the wedding now had begun to fade , and to aidan , pesh could still be the man who almost took emma away . the car door opened , and aidan stepped out .
