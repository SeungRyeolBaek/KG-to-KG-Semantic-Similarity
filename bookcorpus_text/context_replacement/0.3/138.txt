` ` h - hi . nate . brynn . i ' m brynn , ' ' i say . he looks over at me . ` ` brynn , pleasure to meet you , ' ' he replies casually . wait , does he not even remember meeting me last night ? ` ` nate , scooch , brynn , and nate can sit , ' ' mom says , waving us over with her hand . ` ` right , dad , ' ' i say , sliding over so that nate can sit next to me . i stare straight ahead as he sits . i can feel my body leaving me again . the pressure from his hand under the table is giving me heart ##burn . ` ` thought you were n ' t going to be able to make it , ' ' pierce says a little awkwardly to his mother . ` ` sorry , i was in the library studying . i had my afternoon off . ' ' ` ` well , you missed the big day . we were just telling brynn that holly and i had gotten married . ' ' i glance at nate out of the corner of my eye . i see his eyes widen in surprise . ` ` what ? i thought you said you ' d never get married again . ' ' ` ` well, nothing changed . when i met her , i just knew . you ' ll see when you get to know her . she ' s a wonderful person . ' ' i watch my mom glow like a hundred watt bulb and i don ' t help but smile . it ' s been a while since i ' ve seen her so happy . ` ` well , i ' m . . . i ' m just . . . ' ' i watch him struggle for words just like i did . ` ` surprised . but happy . i ' m looking forward to getting to know you better , nate . ' ' wow , that was . . . wow . not what the girl i met last night would say . ` ` yeah , me too , nate , ' ' my mom replies , looking overjoyed . ` ` and i ' m so excited for you and brynn to get to know each other ! ' ' ` ` ' our children . . . ' ' he nods meaningfully . ` ` you ' ll have to learn to cook . ' ' my mom laughs and i join in weakly . ` ` you always wanted a family , brynn ! and now you have one ! well , a step - sibling , but still . ' ' a step - sibling that i ' ve' so dozens of bad memories vs . perfect . ` ` so , you two have never met , then ? ' ' my mom asks , glancing between us . ` ` pierce and i were so excited when we heard both our kids were coming here . ' ' ` ` uva is my alma mater , ' ' she adds quickly . ` ` no , we ' ve never met , ' ' i cut in quickly . i feel nate eye me for a moment before he answers . ` ` nope , we did , actually , ' ' he says . ` ` we thought it best not to tell you guys about it until we knew it would really last longer . i think it would have not been so awkward for you two if we ' d broken up and now you have to keep seeing each other around campus , ' ' my mom says . ` ` yeah , that would have been nice , ' ' nate replies drily , and i know he ' s thinking that nothing could compare to my own awkwardness last night . the waitress comes over with the bottle of champagne that pierce ordered . dom perignon , i think as i look at the label . whoa , he must be loaded . my new stepdad must be loaded . she expertly pops the cork and pours us aan empty flute , pouring the contents into a tall glass next to the table . pierce takes his glass and raises it . ` ` to my entire family , ' ' he says , looking around the room . we all raise our glasses and raise them together . i manage to do so without making eye contact with nate . the wine burns my throat on the way down . i ' ve never wanted to drink a glass of wine more in my entire life than at this moment , but i limit myself to a small sip . ` ` so , honey , you told me you had good news , right ? ' ' my mom asks , as she puts down her glass . ` ` oh , yes , but i do don ' t think i can bring that up , ' ' i reply with a smile . ` ` please ! you sounded excited on the phone , ' ' she encourages me . ` ` well , i got a hotel room , ' ' i explain . my mom nods in excitement , but i see him glance over at his parents . ` ` i thought you said that they still haven ' t announced it yet , ' ' he says quietly . ` ` no . . . i thought you ' d be disappointed . i was waitlisted . it was me , jug##gling two varsity sports , one double major - ' ' nate replies . i look at my mom and then between the two men . nate is looking down at the floor . ` ` i was looking for a waiting list , too , ' ' he says , releasing him and turning to me . ` ` it ' s an important accomplishment . ' ' ` ` thank you . . . ' ' i say quietly . nate looks completely miserable . ` ` being waitlisted is important , nate . ' ' he looks up at me sharply , his eyes flashing . shit . i feel it , too : anger .
