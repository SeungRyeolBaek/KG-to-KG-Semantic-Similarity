aidan laughed . ` ` well , she is a little un - emma , now isn ' t she ? ' ' ` ` she is . besides , she ' s going to give you nightmares when she ' s a baby , ' ' megan said . ` ` i know . believe me , i know . ' ' when caroline looked up at her , megan could n ' t help herself . ` ` you ' re a good girl , missy . you make me want to be a father . ' ' ` ` is that a bad thing ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` no , it ' s just . . . ' ' ` ` just what ? ' ' ` ` i want pesh to give me a proposal of marriage before we start trying . i know he ' s busy right now , but i just want this time with him . you know , just the two of us . ' ' ` ` that ' s understandable . ' ' ` ` but holding her . . . ' ' megan shook her head . ` ` you ' re too sweet for business , miss caroline . ' ' aidan laughed . ` ` tell me about it . whenever i hold her or aidan , i think how much i ' m going to like it when they ' re not babies anymore .it eats at me enough that i think it ' ll be better if we have kids . ' ' ` ` any word on the baby ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` good news . definitely not ruling it out yet . and as long as you and the babies , you ' ll know when the time is right . and if anyone is patient and understanding , it ' s pesh . ' ' ` ` that ' s true , ' ' megan agreed . mason appeared in the doorway again . ` ` ' hi , mason . ' ice cweam ! ' ' megan exclaimed . ` ` here , let me give your little bad boy back to you , ' ' she said , handing mason to aidan . she then took mason ' s hand and started out of the bedroom . ` ` daddy says i did ice cweam first . ' ' ` ` did he ? ' ' megan said , as she prepared to follow pesh . ` ` uh huh . ' ` it ' s my ' doption day . ' ' when she caught pesh ' s eye , she raised her brows . instead , his cheeks flushed . ` ` spoiled him . ' , ' didn ' t you ? ' ' she said in a teasing voice . ` ` 'could ##n ' t do it . it ' s a special day . ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm , and when this special day turns into an all nighter because he ' s cheating on you , you ' re going to sleep with him . ' ' pesh grinned . ` ` i will . i promise . ' ' megan leaned up to kiss him . ` ` you ' re too sweet for your own good . you ' re always going to have me playing good cop when it comes to discipline . ' ' ` ` but you love me anyway , right ? ' ' he whispered against her lips . ` ` so , i was getting ready to make our decision about when we ' re as a family . ' ' his eyes bulged at her words . it took him a few moments to respond . ` ` that means a lot that you would say that , but deep down i know how you really feel . so , i ' m going to be good and just wait two more months before taking your birth control . ' ' ` ` it ' s a date , ' ' she whispered , before kissing him again . epilogue as soon as he finished with his last patient , pesh practically ran from the operating room . he walkedinto the employees ' lounge , trying hard to keep his head down and not draw any attention to himself . he wanted to be able to get out the door without anyone calling him in for a drink or to work a longer shift . once he had gathered his things , he started for the parking lot . ` ` dr . nadeen ! ' ' kristi called . inwardly , he groaned . ` ` yes ? ' ' he questioned , as he turned around . ` ` you were n ' t leaving , were you ? ' ' she asked . he exhaled a defeated breath . ` ` i was planning on it . does someone need me to wait for them ? ' ' kristi winked at him . ` ` ' you just stood there for a minute , did didn ' t you ? ' ' a deep sigh escaped his lips . ` ` i did . ' ' she smiled . ` ` i have something for megan . ' ' ` ` ' kristi , you really don ' t need to do anything else for me . ' ' waving her hand dismissively , she handed a brown paper bag to him . ` ` i wanted to do this . ' ' after stepping inside , pesh smiled before he bent down to kiss kristi . ` ` thank you . i ' m` she ' ll love it . ' ' ` ` you tell her we miss her being here . ' ' ` ` i will . ' ' she patted his back . ` ` you go on home to your girls . ' ' he nodded and then walked out the door . today had been his first day back from doing his maternity leave and some of his other amassed work days . as he slid into the seat of his car , he felt a wave of shame for how he had almost gotten teary on the way to work that day after seeing megan . it had been the worst day of his entire life . he thought he would never be released so he could go home to her . even now , the entire thirty - minute drive home seemed to take an eternity .
