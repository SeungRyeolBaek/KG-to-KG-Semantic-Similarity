` ` i know , ' ' he says . i glance up again , but his eyes are n ' t focused on my face . they ' re looking at my body , which i now realize is completely covered in my thin , white cotton panties . i completely forgot i was wearing underwear . there ' s a moment of silence , and i suddenly become very aware of every inch of myself , and every inch of him . his smell of sweat , some of it still dripping slowly down his back , and a smattering of hair between his legs . allison ' s face flashes in my mind , and i ' m reminded of what she said . ` ` i ' m done . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' he says , his eyes pulling back to mine . ` ` with your sister . i ' m done . ' ' ` ` right . ' ' i grab a glass from the cupboard and pour him some water from the tap . ` ` so , you get dizzy because you ' re dehydrated . ' ' ` ` thanks , ' ' he says . he reaches for the glass with his left hand , which is shaking , and then stops and takes it up with his right . ` ` what was that ? ' ' i ask , and. ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` let me see your left arm , ' ' i say , reaching for him , but he pulls away . ` ` no , no , it ' s nothing . ' ' ` ` what happened ? ' ' ` ` my arm . it ' s just a little sore . ' ' ` ` oh yeah ? did a doctor tell you that ? ' ' ` ` not really . ' ' ` ` webmd ? ' ' i ask , raising my eyebrows . he nods , then frowns . ` ` you need to take better care of yourself . you ca n ' t be pushing yourself too hard . ' ' he nods , and ca n ' t respond . ` ` or , at least , some relief for the pain , ' ' i add . i pour two pills into my hand and begin to repack the first aid kit with the other . ` ` that ' s all . ' ' i tilt my head at him . ` ` this stuff ain ' t going to make you heal any faster , ' ' i point out . ` ` fine , ' ' he says with a small smile . i watch as his fingers brush my skin as he takes the pills . ` ` well . i guess i ' llgoing back to work . i ' m supposed to check out one of the smithsonian buildings tomorrow , so . . . ' ' i trail off , completely exhausted now . ` ` okay , see you later , ' ' he says , turning toward the back door . i pause for a moment , then head back toward the stairs . just like that , the only real relationship that my stepbrother and i have ever had is over . i could practically feel him coming back up at the end anyway . i climb the steps and shut my bedroom door behind me . i feel more confused now than ever about our relationship . i did don ' t think things could get any weirder than that peep show i gave him , but somehow this little piece of him makes things even more complicated . i close my eyes and try to go back to sleep , but when my alarm goes off at midnight , i ' m still wide awake . chapter twelve the heat is really starting to hit in the middle of june , and it ' s a wonder that people ' n ' t taken advantage of our pool yet . the only swimsuit i have is an old athletic one - piece , and i put it on reluctantly in my bedroom . my mom keeps asking me if i want to go shopping ,but i ' haven ' t taken her up on it yet . all her new clothes are nice but i think i ' ll be uncomfortable spending so much time by myself . i walk down the hallway and almost bump into nate as he enters his bedroom . i reflexively cross my hands over my chest , even though i know he ' s seen me in less . ` ` hey , ' ' i say . ` ` hey , ' ' he replies . it ' s the same look we ' ve had ever since i met him in the kitchen that morning . we quickly settle into polite , but formal , interactions with each other afterward . if i had to choose between this and the mind games we start out with , i might choose the mind games . the doorbell rings and i start to move past him to answer it . ` ` it ' s ok i ' ll get it . it ' s my uncle jackson . ' ' he walks down the hallway toward the stairs . i follow behind him , and turn toward the backyard once we ' re in the foyer . i hear his footsteps walk in just as i exit the french doors . there ' s a table pushed against the wall with the beach blanket on it , so i grab one and set it on a chair . the area around thepool it is paved with light stones before it turns into grass , and lounge chairs and a table with an umbrella are all set around it . i walk to the pool and step gingerly onto the first step at the shallow end . it ' s semi - shallow , but still refreshing in the hot summer sun . i dive in the rest of the way until the water circles around my stomach , and then lean forward . i swim to the deep end , where the water gets darker and darker , then push off and glide onto my feet .
