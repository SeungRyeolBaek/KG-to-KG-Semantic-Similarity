` ` yes and no , ' ' pesh said . ` ` what the hell does that mean ? ' ' she asked , raising her startled gaze to his . he chuckled . ` ` is the black knob there for ' throttle ' ? ' ' ` ` yeah . ' ' ` ` look at it this way . you know when you ' re in a car and you ' re going fast , you pick up speed ? ' ' megan nodded . ` ` it ' s the same as in a car . but if you pull on the black knob , it reduces the engine noise . there wo ##ll ' t be an increase in speed . ' ' with her fingers grasping the black knob , megan asked , ` ` how hard do i have to pull on it ? ' ' ` ` by pulling back half - way . ' ' after pulling on the knob , megan increased the speed . ` ` we ' re slowing down . ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` are we at sixty knots ? ' ' megan looked up . ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` okay , then push the throttle back a little more . that will give us a glide - down , a controlled descent . ' ' megan pulled on the steering wheel until the nose of the plane dipped below thenow . ` ` ` put the landing gear in the right position , ' ' pesh said . ` ` is that the one with the flat tire on it ? ' ' ` ` yep , that ' s the one . ' ' megan pressed it . ` ` got it . ' ' ` ` grab the steering wheel , move the wings a little to the right , so we ' re lined right up with the runway . ' ' megan turned the steering wheel to the right a little too hard . ` ` oops , ' ' she said . ` ` it ' s okay . just level it out . you always want your next target is to stay in the little red dot on the windshield . ' ' as megan looked ahead , she realized how close they were getting to the runway , and in fact , the ground . and she was n ' t even sure if she could land the plane . it was perfect for taking off , but it seemed like there was so much more that could go wrong when landing . ` ` uh - uh , o - pesh , ' ' she stammered . ` ` what ? ' ' he asked her . ` ` i do n ' t think i can do this . ' ' she cut her eyes over to him . ` ` ' cadon ' t land the plane . it ' s too dangerous . ' ' ` ` yes , you are . ' ' megan shook her head furiously back and forth . ` ` not really . you need to take over the controls . i could cause you to crash . ' ' ` ` but i have faith in you . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` of course . i would n ' t let you do this if i did ##n ' t think you could . ' ' she stole a glance at him , taking in his earnest expression . yes , he really and truly believed in her . and it was wasn ' t just about the fact they were seeing each other every time they got alone . no , he saw through to the real her . ' taking a deep breath , she felt herself finally calm down . ` ` okay . i ' ll try , but i ' m not making any promises . ' ' ` ` that ' s my point , ' ' pesh replied . ` ` what should i do now ? ' ' ` ` all right , now you need to pull the seat all the way forward as well as pulling back on the wheel to keep the nose from turning . ' ' clearing her throat that felt as rough as sandpaper , megan jerked herthe door opened , pulling on the steering wheel . it was a lot easier considering how sweaty her palms were . ` ` keep it steady . you ' re doing great . ' ' as they came closer and closer to the runway , megan resisted the urge to close her eyes , but she knew that would not be the right thing to do . instead , she braced herself for the impact . the moment the plane hit the asphalt she gasped and clutched at the steering wheel . ` ` do don ' t feel the pain . we ' re fine . you ' re fine . ' ' they raced along the runway . ` ` okay , now ease up on the accelerator and push on the bottom of both pedals to apply the brakes . ' ' without thinking , megan moved her feet , causing the plane to roll . ` ` okay , ' ' pesh said . she let her foot off the accelerator , and they began to coast . ` ` ' you ' re going to bring us back into the hanger . ' ' ` ` oh , hell no ! i would end up going out the side of the building with the tires ! ' ' megan cried . pesh ' s playful smile faded quickly at the death glare she gave him . ` ` megan , you 'll be fine . you just crashed a car . i think you can handle pulling into a ditch . ' ' she smiled at him . ` ` fine . but when you have to file a huge insurance claim , i ' m going to say ' i told you so . ' ' ' ` ` we ' ll see , ' ' he said . she could tell he was holding back a smile the way he was biting down on his lip . ` ` all right , take a left turn , ' ' she said , pointing to where the runaway was . she turned the car to the left and began easing her foot down on the brake when she saw the house come into view .
