` ` good , good . ' ' i look up as nate walks through the door from outside . he winks at me and i quickly bury my face back in my hands so that my ' mom doesn ' t see the blush spreading across my cheeks . ` ` just returning from your morning workout , nate ? ' ' my mom asks as she goes to fix herself some tea . ` ` you ' re both running really late again today . ' ' ` ` must ' ve been that bad , ' ' nate replies nonchalantly . ` ` how ' s your leg ? ' ' ` ` lot better , ' ' i repeat , holding it out from under the table and turning it around to him . ` ` i keep the cast on for another day just to be safe . ' ' ` ` that ' s just what i was thinking . ' ' ` ` anybody want some coffee ? i ' m just putting some coffee on , ' ' my mom breaks in . ` ` yes , please , ' ' we both reply . ` ` you know , i ' m so glad you two are getting along . that ' step ' word has such a special meaning , i suppose because of cinderella . . . you know , the wicked witch . but of course ,' a bigger family can be such a good thing , ' ' she muses , turning up the heat on the stovetop . i watch her for a moment , wondering if she ' s going to bring up something about what i said to her last night , about how she seems to be involved in nate ' s careful treatment of his family . ` ` very positive , ' ' nate answers quietly , not looking at me as i glare at him warningly . this is definitely not the time for one of his smartass comments . ` ` pierce and i are going to the farmer ' s market in half an hour . you guys want to come ? ' ' and have a chance to be alone with nate ? ` ` i was thinking i was just going to sit by the kitchen table , ' ' i reply . ` ` give my leg a little more time to heal . ' ' ` ` probably wise , ' ' my mom agrees . ` ` what about you , nate ? ' ' ` ` i have to , um . . . ' ' he trails off , trying to come up with an excuse . ` ` you know , you know my friend jackson will swing by soon , so i better get going . ' ' ` ` ok , just the usual then , '' my mom with a faux smile . nate and my mom both leave the kitchen to take their coffee into their rooms , so i can finish off my breakfast in peace . after i clean up my mess , i decide to go into the den and turn on the tv . my body needs to remember that delicious breakfast i just devoured . pierce and my mom find me sitting in bed on their way out the door , and i wave goodbye . but as soon as the door closes , a ball of excitement forms in my stomach . i ' m here with nate . i feel like a kid on christmas morning . i push aside the throw and stand up , heading for the stairs and nate ' s room . a flurry of energy hits me as i walk down the hall and knock softly on his door . ` ` one sec ! ' ' he calls out . ` ` ok , come in . ' ' i push the door open to find him standing just inside his door , a white towel wrapped around his waist . he ' s soaking wet , having only just stepped out of the shower . ` ` oh , it ' s you , ' ' he says with a smile . i close the door behind me . ` ` they just left . ' ' ` ` how are you feeling ,why ? i want to make sure i did ##n ' t go too far last night . any regrets ? ' ' i step toward him . ` ` i do have a regret . ' ' he frowns in concern , his beautiful face marred by a line in between his eyebrows . ` ` there was something i wanted to say last night , but i did n ' t get the chance . ' ' the tension slowly leaves his body . ` ` which is ? ' ' he asks , the corners of his mouth twisting up in a small smile . i reach out and grab his towel in return , then stand in front of him . i watch his body grow taut in front of my eyes as he gazes down at me . without a word , i run my hands up the front of his thighs , feeling his leg hair under my fingers just before it reaches the line of his hips . i lean forward , trailing kisses just under his belly button . he smells amazing - a delicious mix of his shower gel with the very familiar scent of his cologne . it ' s unlike anything i ' ve smelled before , and since i ' haven ' t been with anyone else , i know the smell is all his own . i wrap my arms around the back of his neck as he dipmy hand and kiss the tip of his shaft . his cock moves slightly in response to my touch , and i hear him groan . i wrap my hand around him , pulling him toward my mouth . i circle my tongue gently around his tip , licking away a bead of liquid that has just formed there . i move to the base of his dick , pressing my hand down hard as i make my way back up the length of his shaft , and flick my tongue around his tip .
