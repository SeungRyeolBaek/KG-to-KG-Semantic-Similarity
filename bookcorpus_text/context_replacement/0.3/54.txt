` ` i ' m here because i go to the gym to work off stress . and if you put me on the team , i ' d be a total jerk . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` that does n ' t piss me off at all . i ' ve dated my share of jocks . ' ' ` ` ' ? ' ' he asked . although he was trying to be casual about it , she knew he wanted to hear the full story . ` ` having jocks for friends is poison , and when i did date them , i made sure to date the ones at the top of their game . my last boyfriend ' s cheating caused me to lose my internship at medical school . ' ' ` ` that ' s horrible . ' ' ` ` yes , it is . but what ' s worse is i ' n ' t learn anything from my boyfriend because i fell for that one . ' ' with a rueful smile , she added , ` ` at least i got something out of that one . ' ' pesh laced his fingers together . ` ` emma ' s father is a professional athlete ? ' ' ` ` yeah , he played football for the falcons . ' ' ` ` you know i ' m friends with the ... ' 'some medicine maybe . i could probably get something for him . maybe a little something special for his cup ? ' ' at the mischievous glint in pesh ' s eyes , megan burst out laughing . ` ` i can hardly believe , you of all people , did such a thing . ' ' with a smirk , pesh said , ` ` it ' s a stupid prank . ' ' ` ` i know that . it ' s just i ca n ' t imagine someone like you would even think of doing something like that . ' ' when he started to open his mouth to speak , she held up her hand . ` ` i know , i know . ' don ' t pigeon ##hole you . ' ' ` ` exactly . ' ' their main course arrived , and megan could couldn ' t resist digging into the rich greek food . as they ate , the conversation flowed freely . that was one of the things she liked most about pesh - he was so easy to talk to . because he was older , refined , and a gentleman , she could have felt intimidated by him . but he never made her feel that way . he always seemed fascinated by every single thing she had to say , which was quite a change from most of the guys she dated . they were only half listening toher while glancing over her shoulder at the tv to get the final score . after they ordered , the waiter took their plates . ` ` dessert ? ' ' megan asked , as she finished the last of her wine . pesh nodded his head toward the crowded dance floor . ` ` how about a dance partner ? ' ' she wrinkled her nose . ` ` i ' m really not much of a dancer . ' ' he raised his brows at her as if he knew she was lying . ` ` okay , well , i used to dance all the time back in high school and college . ' ' ` ` then dance with me . ' ' ` ` i ' m not good at slow dancing . you ' ll probably be asking me the moment we get out there . ' ' pesh dropped a couple of bills into the # ##fold . ` ` as you would say , the dancing is protesth too much . and i think i understand the reason . ' ' ` ` oh , you do ? ' ' he asked . ` ` ' dancing is intimate , and you ' n ' t want to have to make yourself feel intimate with me . ' ' ` ` you went down on me in the supply closet . i think that ' s pretty obvious , ' ' she challenged .` ` that is not intimacy . sexual acts are of the mind where our emotional connection is . intimacy is of the heart . ' ' he met her gaze . ` ` we both know you ' ll let me into your mind but not your heart . ' ' knowing he was right , she crossed her arms over her chest and stared at him . she still don ' t know why she just could ##n ' t get up and go dance like he had asked . she ' d already danced a few times at parties . what was the difference now ? somewhere deep inside , she knew the answer to that question . ` ` if you ' n ' t want to dance , then let ' s go and see the dancers . ' ' not wanting to let him get the best of her , she got out of her chair . ` ` fine . i ' ll dance with you . ' ' he chuckled . ` ` ' n ' you sound so sure . ' ' after he stood up , he took her hand and led her out to the dance floor . she started to wrap her arms around his neck like she was supposed to , but she put one of her hands on his chest and then he took the other one in his . his other hand slid around to rest on her lower back .the band played the first beats of one song and then switched over to another . a lone guitar pounded out the opening chords . the lead singer ' s husky voice filled the air , ` ` like a rose about to bloom . ' ' megan immediately recognized the song as norah jones ' turn me on . the electricity between them ignited , and as megan looked up into pesh ' s eyes , she saw desire and desire warring in them . her gaze traveled down to his full lips , and she could couldn ' t help wanting him to kiss her .
