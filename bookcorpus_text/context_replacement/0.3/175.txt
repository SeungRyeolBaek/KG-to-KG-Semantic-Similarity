` ` are you ready to go home by yourself ? ' ' nate asks , rolling down the window . ` ` uh , yeah , sure , ' ' i reply , snapping back to reality . i open the door and use my left leg to hop into the passenger seat . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' he asks . ` ` yeah , everything ' s fine . ' ' when we arrive back at the house , nate basket - walks me straight from the car into the kitchen , gently setting me down on a chair in the breakfast room . he kneels in front of me and unlaces my shoe , then slips it off and takes my sock off . ` ` can you move your toes ? ' ' i move them back and forth . ` ` and , really , move your whole foot around . ' ' i wince as i circle it and pain shoots up through my leg . ` ` i broke my ankle playing football my junior year , and i really don ' t think that ' s what this is . let ' s try and ice it and see how it looks tomorrow , or monday . if it ' s still there , i ' ll take you to the doctor . ' ' ` ` you know how to wrap it ? ' ' ` ` hey, when it ' s all my own fault , i ' m pretty good at it . ' ' i watch him take down that same first aid kit from the cabinet and set it down on the floor as he kneels in front of me again . he carefully wraps some tape around my ankle and another around the middle of my foot , twisting it around and around until my ankle is firmly bound . ` ` ok , let ' s get you into the house so we can wrap it . ' ' i start to protest but he reaches down and picks me up again , carrying me through the hallways to the cozy den . he sets me down on the couch and then disappears . i grab a pillow and tuck it behind my back as i stretch my legs out , marveling at the sudden appearance of nate ' s protective instincts . he reappears with a ziploc bag of crushed ice and a bottle of water , setting the latter down on the couch next to me before lowering the ice pack onto my ankle . i shiver as he places it there , and he pulls the throw blanket from the back of the couch . he takes one end and wraps it , then sits on the edge of the couch next to me to spread it over me , tucking the blanket inaround my neck . i become very aware of my own breathing as he moves over me . i watch his hands as they take the edges of the blanket and wrap it around my shoulders . his right hand moves down from the blanket onto the exposed skin of my neck . i hold my breath as he slowly runs his hand down onto my cheek , then up to my chin . with his thumb and forefinger , he gently tips my head up until i look at him . he ' s staring at my lips , and only pauses for a moment before he looks down . ` ` i really don ' t , ' ' i say . he ' s just inches away from kissing me . ` ` if you ' n ' t want anything more , it ' s just sex . ' ' ` ` what if i do want something more ? ' ' he asks , his dark brown eyes flickering up to mine . ` ` more . . . ' ' i say , rolling the word around my tongue . ` ` what kind of more ? ' ' ` ` i ' ve never felt about someone the way i feel about you . i ' ve tried fighting that feeling , i ' ve tried dealing with it , but it just keeps getting worse . i want to give in - i want to .i ' can ' t tell you i know exactly what this will look like . . . i ' ve never done anything like this . but i promise you that when i ' m with you , i ' ll be with only you . and i want you to be with only me . ' ' i smile up at him . that ' s still a lot of promise , but i know that he ' s giving me everything he can right now . plus my heart is about to beat out of my chest , and my body is freaking out . ` ` only you , ' ' i whisper , before reaching around his neck and pulling him toward me . our lips meet in an open kiss , our tongues finding each other ' s and burning with our passion . he presses me back against the cushion , his hands finding my waist through the fabric and quickly moving up and over my hips . i arch my back into him , wanting to feel him against me . . . feel him everywhere . ` ` you guys ready ? ' ' nate jumps up when we hear my mom ' s voice from the kitchen . he takes a deep breath and then runs his hands through his hair before answering . ` ` we ' re in the den ! ' ' he calls out , then turns to me .` ` soon , ' ' he promises , his eyes filled with promise . chapter twenty ` ` are you ok , brynn ? ' ' my mother asks me , concerned . ` ` yeah , i ' m fine , ' ' i reply lightly as i use my napkin to try to wipe the tomato sauce off my lip where i ' ve just touched it . nate ' s promise of an evening out has left me distracted and distracted during dinner .
