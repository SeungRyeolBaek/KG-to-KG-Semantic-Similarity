as the water beat down on us , i pushed her down to the hard floor and started f * * king her hard . ` ` this is f * * king torture . ' ' was it because i ' d slept with her in my arms for three whole nights and not taken her ? i could n ' t think of a reason for this hunger that would n ' ever be satisfied . the more i had her the more i wanted , but if we kept this thing up she ' d spend the next two weeks bed ridden . ' i had seen the red flush to her labia and heard the slight sounds of pleasure she made even as she urged me on to f * * k her . i was sure i was killing her against the hard floor , the moans and groans she made were becoming almost audible , but she threw her hips back at me riding my c * * k like a pro . i did my best to nail her into her seat with me . this time when she came the sound was more of a moan as i thrust and thrust into her until i was spent . ` ` that ' s it , we ' re getting out of here , now try to keep your greedy hands to yourself shiane , my poor man ' s hands .only not so much . ' ' she threw herself into my arms and howled with laughter and i felt my heart break a little more . we both made it out of the shower and i quickly put on clothes as we headed down to the kitchen . ` ` did you say you made dinner ? ' ' ` ` yep . ' ' she pointed to the pots and pans on the counter and i furrowed my brow quizzically . i guess i was out of school typing after all , i had a ' not quite the little pop ' to know her way around the kitchen . she ' d made a plate of fried lamb chops of all things , with rice pilaf and creamed green peas . ` ` i guess ' ' n ' go make it . ' ' ' right . ` ` nope , the lamb chop ain ' t done yet , it ' s just starting on the sauce . ' ll take five minutes to cook and the rest of the stuff can be reheated no problem . you just eat and i ' ll take care of everything , ' ' ` ` yes ma ' am . ' ' i opened a bottle of wine and poured her a glass , taking one for myself as i sat at the island and watched her move around myno . she seemed , happy . it was strange to look at this complete stranger and realize that somehow i ' d gotten to know her so well . did she even realize that she ' d started signing ? she had n ' t done that since she ' d been here . i would ' ve thought that she spent every waking moment singing , but this was the first time since i ' d brought her home that i ' d heard her so much as sing . it was wasn ' t the song from the other night , this one was slow and soft , with a slight southern accent to it that made me have to strain to hear the words since she was singing so loudly . ` ` sorry , princess i can t ##g you . ' ' she turned wide eyes to me and looked down at her hands . ` ` i ' m not very good at that . ' ' ` ` come again . ' ' ` ` i think i ' ve learned how to control my voice somewhat before i go out on stage , but i ca ##v ' t ever sing in front of anyone else like that . ' ' ` ` ' how do you do it ? ' ' ' my mom gave me these pills . . . ' ' i did n ' t like the sound of thatone bit . ` ` what kind of pills ? ' ' i lowered my head and looked at her . ` ` it ' s nothing really , just something to calm my nerves . ' ' ` ` is it a prescription ? ' ' ` ` ` something like that , i never even asked him where he gets them . . . ' ' ` ` do you have them with you now ? ' ' ` ` ' why ? ' ' she looked at me quizzically . ' ' ` ` i ' ll just have to take a look at them that ' s all , make sure they ' re okay . ' ' ` ` oh i ' m sure they ' re . doug would never do anything to hurt me . ' ' ` ` so you have the pills back at your place ? ' ' ` ` no , doug has them with him , he gives me one for each show and sometimes when i have to go on one of those talk shows . looks like i was gon ' have to have a talk with her again . she was so f * * king green , i was sure it would never cross her mind to believe anything the manager said . though i did n ' t know him personally , i ' m a lawyer and i know all about the bottom line .her voice was such liquid gold , i ' m sure dear old doug would do anything to see that nothing got in the way of her making them happy . that was something else i ' gon na ##ught to look into as well . when i ' d made the decision to marry her , everything that she did was my business . there might be some , because i ' ve noticed that she has a bit of an independent streak , but i had no intentions of letting that stop me . but i ' d save it for another time , it was bound to change the future for us . ` ` voila , dinner is ready .
