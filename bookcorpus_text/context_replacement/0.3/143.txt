` ` you did not , ' ' i retort , before i can finish . he looks over at me and raises his eyebrows , his gaze shifting between them . he laughs . ` ` it ' s true . ' ' ` ` my dad says working is the best way to build character , ' ' nate says quietly . ` ` oh , ' ' i reply , blushing as i push my way through the back door into the kitchen . i place the china carefully next to the table and climb onto the counter . suddenly , i feel like i ' n ' t say anything else to nate . my mind freezes , while my body is set on fire . ` ` so , are you dating anyone at all , brynn ? ' ' pierce asks . fuck him . ` ` not right now , ' ' i reply , sitting back down . ` ` who were you expecting ? maybe i know him , ' ' nate says , his dark eyes picking up the pattern in the table ' s white linen . my dad spent all day on this . ` ` probably him , ' ' i say quickly , pasting a polite smile on my face . he really knows how to get under my skin . the truth is , i ' ve never really dated anyone, just as my mom told me , and as much as i ' m embarrassed by the fact . ` ` who wants dessert ? ' ' i try to sidestep any more questioning by passing on the last course , but then i ' m forced to think about the fact that nate and i are probably going to want to go out somewhere like this and have sex . i hope it ' s not in nate ' s room . what if i can hear them through the wall ? my mom insists on carrying the c ##s , and nate and i stand up . she and nate start talking quietly , and she walks over to me . ` ` you look so beautiful . ' ' she offers . ` ` i have to ask : what do you like on your skin ? ' ' ` ` w - what ? um , soap ? ' ' oh wow , she really makes it hard to resist her . ` ` soap ? oh . . . soap ? oh my god , i hate this whole routine , ' ' she says , laughing at herself . ` ` oh , okay . i guess i ' ll be seeing you around often ? ' ' i ask , and she looks surprised . ` ` because you and nate are dating . ' ' ` ` we ' re not really dating , '' she confides to me . ` ` he ' s not the one , and i gave up hope years ago . and now look at him - can you blame me for coming here ? ' ' she replies with a grin , then her eyes widen . ` ` oh my gosh - sorry ! i thought for a second that he ' s your brother ! ' ' ` ` y - yes , ' ' i correct her . ` ` well , i ' m gon go ##z upstairs . it was really nice to meet you , nate . ' ' ` ` you , too , ' ' she replies , stepping away to join nate and nate ' s conversation . i head into the foyer but at the last second decide not to go inside . i need some air . i find myself walking down the hall and to the french doors in the wood - framed room . they open onto the backyard and i step inside with relief , closing the door behind me . the firm breeze from the river pushes me forward and i head down toward it . i circle around the swimming pool on the first floor of the backyard , and walk down to the grassy area with a lacrosse goal set up on one end . the wooden steps down to the sandy beach are located on the other side , andit takes me a while to find them in the dark . as i walk down the stairs , i see the potomac spread out in front of me . the river flows slowly by , lit only by the sparsely set houses and the cliffs surrounding it . as i step onto the shore , i can feel the rocks pushing up against my sandals , and trees casting long , dark shadows on either side of me . this is no white - sand beach . the river runs dangerously deep after rains , and there are even white - water rapids along parts of it . i look back at the house behind me and then back down at the river . i feel so out of place here . even though our old house did n ' t ever feel like home again , i wish i were there now , stretched out on the big old bed , with my mom in her pajamas , watching something on our old tv . i ' n ' t sure if i ' ll ever be able to feel like i belong here . i ' ll always feel like a guest in someone ' s house . i walk down closer to the shore until i can feel the pebbles getting smaller underneath my feet . i do ##n ' t want my feet to get bigger . i jump as a branch shoots out of a tree behind me. i can barely see it as it flies off , its body a black ink blot against the night sky . i wish i could see it . i turn and walk back toward the house , feeling as alone as i ' ve ever felt . i shake my head at myself as i climb the wooden steps . my family is happy , and i ' m fortunate to live in a place like this .
