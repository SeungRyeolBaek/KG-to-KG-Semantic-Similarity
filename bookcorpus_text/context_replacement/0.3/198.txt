i pause for a moment , taking in the rest of the room for the last time , before walking over to my desk and opening the top drawer . i reach my arm all the way to the back and fish out the small piece of paper still sitting there . i walk out and down the hallway . nate ' s bedroom door is wide open and i can tell from the silence that he ' s not asleep . i push it open all the way and walk to his bed . i run my hand over his bedspread and breathe in his smell . i pull back the comforter and place the piece of paper on top of his bed , then pull the sheet back up over it . i really do don ' t want him to find the piece of paper where eileen left her phone number . i ' m about to leave when something makes me look up to his window overlooking the river . my eye catches on a flash of movement on the upper deck : nate sitting on the top step of the stairs leading down to the rocky shore . he sits completely still , his white t - shirt stretched across his broad back . i resist the urge to wonder what he ' ll do now - it ' s really none of my business anymore . i walk back out to the car andwith my mom sitting in the passenger seat . i open the driver ' s door and see that she ' s placed the bag on the seat . i get in without a word and turn the car on and pull away from the curb . i glance in the rearview mirror to get one last glimpse of her as i turn the car out of the driveway . my mom is silent on our drive back to our old house , just staring out the window as we turn onto the highway that takes us farther away from the city , back to our much less expensive neighborhood . the seed of anger that ' s been building inside of me all day , or maybe longer , finally takes root . i glance over at her impassive face . ` ` you have ##n ' t not looked at me all day , ' ' i finally say , gripping the steering wheel with white - knuckled fingers . ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' she asks faintly , still not speaking to me . ` ` you have ##n ' t looked at my face , ' ' i say . ` ` brynn . . . ' ' she sighs . ` ` no , it ' s not . your husband left you last night and you never even came to check on me . and now you wo n '` look at the bruise . ' ' ` ` brynn , you ' ve been very upset . ' ' ` ` and you have n ' t ? he beats me up , hits me , and you have ##n ' t asked me if i ' m okay . ' ' ` ` it ' s not my fault that he did those things ! ' ' she cries , almost hysterical . ` ` mom , i ' m not blaming you for his death , alright ? but you ' re my mother . you should have told me - you should have taken care of me . i ' ve been taking care of you for years , and this time , i believe you . ' ' my mom nods slowly , reaching up to cover her mouth with her hand . ` ` i wanted to believe you , brynn , i really did , ' ' she suddenly sobs . ` ` i just knew that if i did , everything would fall apart , and it all seemed so perfect . ' ' ` ` ' it was ain ' t . ' ' ` ` no , it was n ' t . ' ' i feel her hand reach up tentatively to touch my cheek , and her fingers graze over the small cut in the corner of my mouth . ` ` oh , i ' m so sorry ,my dad . did he hurt you ? ' ' ` ` not at all , ' ' i reply , fighting the tears that have sprung up at her words . ` ` i never knew . . . about you and nate , i mean , ' ' she says . ` ` that ' s over , mom , ' ' i say , as my emotions threaten to overwhelm me . ` ` ah , ' ' is all she says . ` ` well , i know that might not be the kind of thing you ever want to talk about with your mother , but i ' m here . you talk about him a lot ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' i reply , my voice thick with held emotion . ` ` ' i suppose you want to get a job ? ' ' i ask , changing the subject . ` ` oh , yeah . i guess so , ' ' she says . ` ` i think i ' ll be able to get my old job at the salon back , at least . i talked to anita and she said the new manager they hired is good . ' ' ` ` did you sign a pre - nup ? ' ' i ask , thinking of eileen . i know i ' ll have to fill my mother in on what i know about hersoon , because it would just be too much for me right now . ` ` yes , ' ' she says . ` ` bikini - style . ' ' chapter twenty - two i close the door behind me and dump my newly - acquired textbooks on my bed ##roll , then sit up to survey my lawn room . it ' s not much to look at , with its sparse furnishings and lack of internet access , though it does have a framed list of every inhabitant that ' s lived here , dating back to uva ' s very first year .
