as if he read her mind , pesh ' s mouth closed over hers . darting her tongue inside , she tried to taste his lips . when she did , he tasted like a mixture of the wine and spices they ' d shared . his tongue pulled back to taste her lips as his h * ps moved , pushing him against her . she followed his lead by pressing herself flush against him to where her br * * sts were pressed against his chest . she shivered when he groaned into her mouth . his thumb rubbed back and forth between her shoulder blades , and she could couldn ' t help arching into his touch . when he pulled back from their kiss , he kept his eyes locked on hers . she ' d never had a man stare at her so intently . it was like he was trying to see through her to her very soul . it both excited and terrified her at the same time . it was all part of his slow seduction plan , and it was working . ` ` please take me somewhere - somewhere we can be alone . ' ' his voice was husky . ` ` megan - ' ' she moved her hand from his face to cup his lips . ` ` do don ' t make me want to be with you again . ' ' shaking his head , he replied, ` ` i ca ##uld ' t want you anymore , not after having a taste of you . ' ' megan gasped at the intimacy of both his words and the way he said them . taking her by the hand , he led her off the dance floor . they snaked around the tables in the dining room until they reached the exit . weaving through the people , they walked into the lobby that adjoined the restaurant . it was much more of a small bed and breakfast than a hotel . as they entered the reception area , pesh released her hand to reach into his back pocket . once he retrieved his wallet , he walked up to the man . ` ` i need a room please . ' ' ` ` credit card and identification please , ' ' the inn ##keeper requested . as she sized him up , megan could couldn ' t help thinking he was incredibly pompous - the usual type of man who stayed in a high - end place . ` ` would you prefer one or - ' ' ` ` a king suite , ' ' pesh requested through gritted teeth . ` ` do you need help with your luggage ? ' ' ` ` no , we do don ' t have any . ' ' the man typed something into the computer . ` ` and how long willyou are staying with us ? ' ' ` ` as long as we live , ' ' pesh replied , drumming his fingers on the marble counter . megan watched as the man ' s eyes widened and a flush entered his cheeks . he quickly finished the reservation and handed pesh his credit card . ` ` we want you in one of our balcony room suites . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' taking her by the hand , pesh led her back to the elevators . when megan turned to look over her shoulder , she saw the man staring back at them . as they stepped onto the car , megan could couldn ' t help the nervous giggle that escaped her lips . when pesh looked at her in confusion , she giggled even harder . ` ` what is it ? ' ' ` ` by the way that conversation went down , he probably thinks i ' m a prostitute . ' ' pesh ' s eyes widened . ` ` you ' don ' t really believe that ? ' ' ` ` what , ` a high - priced prostitute ? ' ' a growl came from low in his throat . ` ` do not demean yourself like that . ' ' ` ` i ' m not lowering myself . think about it . we come in during the middle of the nightwith no luggage , and we want a nice room with a king size bed . ' ' she tapped her chin with her finger . ` ` hmm , what could we possibly be doing ? ' ' the corners of his mouth turned up into a smile . ` ` i probably should care what the world thinks , but right now , i frankly do n ' t give a shit . ' ' she laughed . ` ` me either . ' ' the elevator dinged , signaling they had reached their floor . they stepped inside and read the sign to find their room . once pesh opened the door , megan walked inside . she took in the beautiful beauty of the room with its brick fireplace , fireplace , and four - poster bed . going to a hotel could have been sleazy , but this place had such a comfortable feel to it . when he came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist , she could n ' t help suddenly feel shy . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' he asked . ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' his breath warmed against her neck . ` ` you shivered when i touched you . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . i ' didn ' t mean to . i guess i ' m just tired . ' ' peshturned her around to face him . ` ` you ' n ' i have anything to be embarrassed about . if you ' n ' i want to do this anymore , we do n ' t have to . ' ' ` ` no , i want to do it , ' ' she assured him . without another word , his fingers moved to her hair . when he released the clasp , her hair fell down over her shoulders . an involuntary shudder went through her when he nuzzled his face into the strands of her hair . from there he sought out the zipper at the small of her back .
