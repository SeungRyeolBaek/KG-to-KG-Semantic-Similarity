when nate comes back over , he smiles as he sees me struggling to get it in between the straps of my sports bra . ` ` want some more ? ' he asks . ` ` . . . please , ' ' i reply , pretending i ' m anything but . the idea of nate ' s hands on me , when i know nothing else is going to happen , is sheer torture . i might much prefer getting a first - degree sunburn , but he ' s already taken the bottle from me and poured half of it out into his palm . ` ` um , just pull the collar of your shirt up , ' ' he tells me . i do as he says , pulling it up to my neck . i feel his warm - up fingers slipping under the straps of my bra , and am glad he ca doesn ' t see the blush that immediately spreads across my face . i take a deep breath , trying to keep my raging hormones at bay , as his fingers wrap around the base of my ribcage . ` ` now you do me , ' ' he says , as i lift my shirt . ` ` that ' s what she said , ' ' i reply . ` ` ha ! ' ' nate laughs , a short , loud .of laughter . ` ` i did n ' t know you were funny brynn , ' ' he says , smiling down at me . ` ` there ' s a lot you did ##n ' t know about me . ' ' i say , unable to meet his eyes for a brief moment . i clear my throat and take the bottle of sunscreen from him , forcing myself to keep my hands steady . he pauses , then turns around and pulls off his shirt . i groan inwardly at the sight of his tanned , muscular back . where are our clothes ? i need some sort of buffer between us . but there are no signs of any cars pulling into the parking lot anytime soon , so i dutifully squeeze the lotion onto my fingers and slowly begin to rub it across his chest . i slowly rub it all the way up to his neck , across his shoulder blades - feeling the hard ridges of muscle there , down his back , and then down to the top of his athletic shorts , my fingers venturing just inside his waistband . i hear him suck in a little bit of air , and see the hard throbbing of his erection in his shorts . he ' s trying hard to hold back , i can tell . ` ` ok , all done ! ' ' i say ,asks , as i hand him the shirt . nate throws his shirt into the bed of his truck and begins to rub it across his body . i keep my eyes fixed on the night sky . ` ` they say how long they were going to be ? ' ' ` ` nope , my mom just called - ' ' i break off when i hear my phone start to ring in my purse on the front porch . ` ` i bet that ' s her now . hey , mom , ' ' i greet her as i answer the call . ` ` hey , honey . ' ' ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' i ask , immediately hearing concern in her voice . ` ` oh , it ' s nothing , but i wo ##n ' t been able to get out of the house long enough to go out today . i ' m just going to head down to the beach today , so at least you and i can have lunch together . ' ' ` ` nate , should we - ' ' ` ` no , you two go kayaking and have fun , okay ? we ' ll see you tonight for dinner . ' ' ` ` yeah , okay , if you ' re sure , ' ' i reply , wincing when i catch nate watching me , hishis hair gleaming in the sun . ` ` your dad got caught up in work today , and my mom ' s going to go meet him at the restaurant for dinner , but they ' re not coming . they said we should just go if we want , ' ' i explain as we hang up . ` ` since we ' re alone , ' ' nate replies with a grin . ` ` you ever been kayaking alone before ? ' ' ` ` never been kayaking at all . ' ' ` ` well , you ' ll love it , ' ' he replies , starting up his car . ` ` says the captain of the uva boat today . ' ' i laugh . in short order , we ' re pushing off the dock in a giant kayak . with nate ' s big arms pumping , we quickly cross the deep , dark water and head toward the open sea . ` ` you ' ll get the hang of it , ' ' nate tells me , and i turn around to smile sheepishly at him . ` ` i think i ' m just getting you back , nate , ' ' i say , trying to get the hang of how to get the boat into the water at the right time . ` ` well , i have a lot more experience than you" a boat , ' ' he says . ` ` we used to go for rowing on the potomac in high school , but we were a lot farther in to the river . we ' d see georgetown , the city center . . . you ' d be amazed at the things you can see out here , though , ' ' he tells me as he steers us upriver and into the current . ` ` i feel so far away from everything , ' ' i observe as the sounds of traffic are completely covered up by the trees rising on either side of us .
