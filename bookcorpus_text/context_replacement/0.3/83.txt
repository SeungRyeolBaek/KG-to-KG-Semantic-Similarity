it seems that with this pregnancy she ' s having first period morning sickness . i told her i would go home with her , but she insisted i come for a good meal . ' ' ` ` sure thing . we ' ll make her a plate for you to take home to her house tonight , ' ' megan offered . aidan nodded . ` ` good . if she can make it , i know she ' ll be fine . ' ' patrick clicked his fork against his water glass . ` ` is everyone here that ' s going to be hungry ? ' ' a chorus of , ` ` yes , ' ' rang through the room . ` ` good . let ' s return thanks . ' ' pesh slowly nodded his head along with the others . when patrick finished , the dishes were passed around and food was served . it was certainly a lot different than how his family did it , but he still enjoyed being with megan ' s family . while mason ate off his plate , megan gave aidan a break from feeding noah , or more accurately letting him feed her in private while he fed himself . ` ` you ' re a genius , ' ' megan said , into noah ' s salt - and - corn crusted face . his response was to grin at her. ` ` i ' m sorry , mister , but that poor little boy ' he ' s going to work for me . ' ' ` ` he ' s so stubborn , ' ' aidan said . ` ` a stubborn boy ? i ' ve never heard of him , ' ' becky said across the table . aidan shook his head . ` ` i ' m sorry . he refuses to let ' ' em feed him , and then he ends up wearing more than he should . ' ' ` ` sounds like his father , ' ' angie said . when aidan gave her an odd look , she added , ` ` you are the exact same way . i do n ' t think you ate a thing until you were sure that mother did ##n ' would have to finish you off when you finished . ' ' aidan laughed . ` ` ' ##n ' t tell her that either . she already hates you both for noah ' s stubbornness . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` let ' s hope that this new noah shares emma ' s temperament . ' ' ` ` like she ' n ' is special , ' ' aidan countered . ` ` no more than you are , ' ' megan replied . licking his lips , aidan seemed to be studying her intently . ` ` you mighthave a seat , ' ' he said , with a grin . after everyone finished eating , the adults sat around the table talking and laughing as the children filed into the living room . only mason and percy wanted to play with the bigger kids . ` ` will you keep an eye on them ? ' ' megan asked percy . ` ` sure , ' ' percy replied . ` ` i love you , perce , ' ' aidan said , as percy took the boy by the hand . as he sat with his arm draped over the back of megan ' s chair , pesh enjoyed listening to the lively conversation around him . occasionally one of aidan ' s friends would ask him a question or his thoughts . he had always been naturally quiet , and when he was in the midst of such a lively bunch , he tended to become even quieter . he realized if he was going to really fit in , he was going to have to speak up more . their conversation was interrupted by a crash that came from the living room followed by a loud wail . aidan was out of his chair in a flash and megan was close on his heels . mason came running into the dining room . ` ` what happened ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` he got shot . ' ' aidan reappeared inthe dining room with noah in his arms . ` ` he ' s fine . he just fell down . ' ' taking noah ' s hand , aidan said , ` ` ` daddy will put the booboos on , okay ? ' ' noah smiled and nodded his head . watching aidan finish with his son , noah held out his hand . aidan smiled . ` ` okay . ' ' once he bent down to noah ' s leg and kissed it , aidan asked , ` ` are you emma ' s daddy ? ' ' ` ` uh - huh . ' ' angie laughed . ` ` that ' s not going to do that when emma still ain ' t here . ' ' as the others laughed , pesh glanced at mason . he was staring at aidan and noah with a stunned look on his face . never in a million years could he have imagined what he would do next . mason crawled up into his arms and kissed pesh ' s head . ` ` esh mace ' s daddy . mace ##y ' s daddy . ' ' everyone in the dining room gasped . without even looking up , pesh felt his skin singing under the gaze of everyone staring at him and mason . there was no way he could ignore the boy when he wore such an expression ofhappiness . ` ` yes , you ' re daddy ' s girl . ' ' a loud gasp caused him to whip his gaze from mason back to megan . wide - eyed and open mouthed , she blinked a few times as if she were trying to confirm that what she was seeing was real . then without another word , she rose from her chair and left the room . pesh sat in a shocked silence for a few seconds trying to decide what to do . bending down , he whispered into mason ' s ear , ` ` can you come back and sit with the others ? i need to check on them .
