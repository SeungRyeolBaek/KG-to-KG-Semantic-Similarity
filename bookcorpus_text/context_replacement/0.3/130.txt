all the way to the car i sat across from her and she kept giving me dirty looks . i kept my eyes straight ahead and my fists clenched as they clenched between my thighs . if i did anything else i ' m afraid i might strangle her ass . as soon as we got through the door of reception i grabbed her arm and headed for the bedroom and straight to where i grabbed the belt i used to massage her ass . ` ` no , you ca n ' me . ' ' she tried to pull away from me which only angered me more . i grabbed the belt and was about to slam it down on her ass , not even waiting to get her undressed i was so pissed . ` ` i ' m pregnant . ' ' well f * * k , that just stopped me in my tracks . ` ` what did you say ? ' ' ` ` you ca don ' t tell me , i ' m pregnant . ' ' i grabbed the belt and stared down at her . there was something strange going on with my heart . it was beating fast , but the rhythm was off somehow . i felt a pain in my head and i think i lost sight there for a second . ` ` you ' re pregnant ? ' ' i turned her around to standin front of me . she stopped and looked down at her feet . ` ` why did ##n ' t you tell me ? ' ' ` ` i just found out , i was going to tell you , but i asked you that question this morning and you blew me off . ' ' the silence seemed to reflect her anger and she glared at me . ` ` i was ain ' t about to try to trap you with a baby , i really don ' t want to marry someone who does n ' t even love me for me , i ' ve had one ass * * le in my life already . ' ' i grabbed her neck and lifted her to her feet . ` ` i told you not to throw that f * * k in my face . just because you ' re carrying my child do not think for one minute that i wo n ' t knock your little ass up . ` ` what the f * * k ever gave you the idea that i really don ' t want to marry you ? ' ' ` ` you know . . . ' ' she raised her voice and started to speak . ` ` shut your f * * king mouth , you ' re walking on thin f * * king ice . what the f * * k ever gave you the idea thati ' m the old man who needs his wife to talk to him ? that ' s my place , not f * * king yours no matter what some feminist new age f * * k says . ' ' ` ` well you did n ' t look like you ' gon na ##ught , because if you do , i ' ll always know it was all because of your damn ring . ' ' i followed her into the closet and over to the safe i kept hidden there . it took her a few seconds to get the idea i was that f * * king pissed . from the safe i removed the little black box i ' d kept there for years . ` ` i got this two days after we met . i was waiting for you to be finished with this before giving it to you . ` ` ` i . . . ' ' ` ` save it , i told you , i wo ##n ' t sorry for what that ass * * le did to you . and that that ' s why let ' s talk about that stunt you pulled tonight . ' ' ` ` i thought you wo ##n ' t going to , i thought . . . ' ' ` ` so you decided to get back at me by doing something that was going to piss me off . as a resultfor the future ahead , you will not ever want to piss me off . i ' ll be lenient with you when it comes to some things , but your disobedience will not be tolerated , not now or ever . ` ` you want me to kick your ass you pull a stunt like this again . if you say no it means f * * king nothing . you hear me ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' she sighed . ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' ` ` you ' re too f * * king spoilt for your own good . i ' m not sure if i should let this happen , but i ' don ' t want the joy of my daughter ' s life to be marred by this f * * kery , and since you ' ve spoiled my proposal you can live with that fact . ' ' i took the box from her hand and put the two - carat diamond on her finger . this was not how i ' d planned this to go . i ' d had everything planned out . i was going to take her to paris since that was her favorite place and propose to her there in one of their ultra - swanky restaurants . that ' s not my style but it ' s hers . i was going to takeanything to make the night special . i never n ' ever make love to her that night . not because of any reason or anything like that , i think i was just scared a little if you ' na know the truth . i ' d gone from being pissed and ready to heat up her up , to scared that i was going to be a daddy or a dad . instead i helped her get ready for bed and held her until she gave into the exhaustion of the long day and night . once again i saw my childhood , the always wanting , always having and never any hope of winning . and the shame , shame , all the things you can expect from a young boy whose parents neglected him .
