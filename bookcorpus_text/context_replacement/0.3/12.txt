when pesh took her hand in his , she jerked her head up in surprise . in a soft voice that vibrated with empathy , he said , ` ` he hurt you very badly , ' ' ' did he ? ' ' as she shifted in her seat , she helped diffuse the situation by pointing her free hand at pesh . ` ` now you ' re really putting the heated questions on me , are n ' t you ? ' ' he quickly released her hand . ` ` i apologize . ' ' she hesitated . ` ` no , it ' s okay . ' ' she raked her fingers through her hair as she was deciding if she was really going to be honest with pesh . looking into his eyes , she could n ' t detect any probing or prying - there was only compassion . ` ` yes , he hurt me . he continues to hurt me every time i look at mason and realize what he ' s really like . ' ' she jerked her head over to where aidan cradled a sleeping mason in his arms . as the others talked and laughed around him , aidan stared down at his son with such love in his eyes and concern on his face that it cut a jagged hole in megan ' s heart . her voice trembled as she replied , `` i want that for my children . ' ' pesh ' s blue eyes pooled with tears as he once again took her hand in his . ` ` it is n ' t the physical pain , but i do know how you feel . i feel it every time i see a husband and wife sharing a private moment . it drives home what i do not have . . . what i have lost . ' ' megan wiped her eyes with the back of her hand . ` ` emma told me about your mother . i ' m so touched . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' he murmured . nibbling her bottom lip , megan very softly asked , ` ` what was she like ? ' ' by his raised eyebrows , pesh seemed surprised by her question . megan knew she had n ' er stepped over a line in asking . he leaned back in his chair and drew in an agonized breath . ` ` she was my everything - the sun , the moon , and the stars . ' ' he held her intense gaze , waiting to see if she really wanted him to continue . when she gave a brief nod , he began to explain . he told her how they first met and all the unique attributes that she possessed that made her unique . as megan listened to himspeak with such reverence and love about his late wife , she could n ' t help feeling just a little bit jealous . she ' d never heard a man possess such intense affection for her . she could don ' t remember ever being loved so deeply by a man that not even words could lessen his love . ` ` what you had with her , what you still feel for her , it ' s really beautiful , ' ' she murmured when she finished . pesh jerked a hand through his dark hair . ` ` it ' s strange to hear you say that . i think most women are turned on by what they perceive is a man who ca ##vin ' t let go of his late wife . ' ' megan shook her head . ` ` i ' don ' t think so . who would ##n ' t be turned on by a man who cared so deeply that he did n ' t stop loving his wife just because she died ? ' ' pesh ' s eyes widened at her statement , and he sucked in a harsh breath . ` ` most women do n ' t want to share your feelings , ' ' he challenged her . ` ` because they ' re obviously insecure . all of us have the capacity to love others in different ways . i love my son with allmy heart and soul , but there will still be room for another man . . . . . ' ' he stared at her for a moment , silent and unmoving . ` ` i have to admit that i find your body ... fascinating . ' ' ` ` you do ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' the intensity of his gaze caused her to laugh softly . ` ` ' ' don ' t think a man has ever told me that . ' ' ` ` that ' s a shame . ' ' before she could consider changing the subject , aidan appeared at their table with noah in his arms . ` ` after i put him down , i ' m going to make some drinks . emma wants one of her margaritas . you coming ? ' ' he asked megan . she nodded . a drink would certainly help cool her off after the night she ' d been having with pesh . ` ` sure . i ' don ' t think i ' ve had one in years . ' ' ` ` neither has she . i may be hanging her off the wall tonight , ' ' aidan teased . megan laughed . ` ` you have seriously got to stop with the teasing . you are my uncle , and it is mortifying and disgusting to have to speak ofyou in that case . ' ' ` ` i am so very sorry for hurting your sensitive mind . ' ' grinning , aidan turned to pesh . ` ` that okay with you , or would you like something else , please ? ' ' ` ` i ' m good with a beer , ' ' pesh said . aidan shook his head . ` ` be right back . ' ' after aidan headed into the kitchen , pesh caught her staring at him . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` just surprised you want a beer , that ' s all . ' ' ` ` and why is that ? ' '
