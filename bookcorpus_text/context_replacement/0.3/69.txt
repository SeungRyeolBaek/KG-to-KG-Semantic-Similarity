running her fingers through his dark hair , she shook her head . ` ` i think we need to talk about our future . ' ' ` ` oh ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` you coming over here has made me realize something very important . what we ' ve been doing has been amazing , and i ' ve enjoyed every second of it . but - - ' ' pesh ' s blue eyes snapped open , and the lines on his face shifted as if he were in pain . ` ` please . you ' n ' t have to do this . i ' ll just go . ' ' ` ` ' i do don ' t want you to go , ' ' she argued . ` ` then what are you trying to say ? ' ' ` ` that i need you in my life , and i need more . ' ' his brows shot up . ` ` more ? as in more of us together ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' he sucked in a breath . ` ` you want us to be an official couple ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` yes , i do . well , everything will change . ' ' ` ` ' ca n ' to believe it , ' ' he whispered . ` ` this ' can ' t be the reaction i thoughtyou would know , ' ' she teased . ` ` oh , i ' m happy . trust me . i ' m just shocked , that ' s all . ' ' she pressed her lips to his and gave him a tender kiss . against his lips , she whispered , ` ` can you ever forgive me for being so stubborn and so stupid ? ' ' ` ` i can try . but i suppose you ' re going to have to try very hard to make it up to me . ' ' ` ` do i ? ' ' he asked . ` ` yes , very hard . ' ' ` ` why do i get the funny feeling that your idea of ' making it up to you is entirely different than mine ? ' ' ` ` ` more time for you . lots more . ' ' ` ` i can see that . ' ' a wicked gleam appeared in pesh ' s eyes . ` ` the next trip will be to the fox to see the opera . ' ' she laughed . ` ` you do don ' t play fair . ' ' he ran his hands down her sides , causing her to gasp . ` ` i would like to say that you have haven ' t been playing fair all day . now it ' s my turn . ' ' ` ` are you` to take me ? ' ' she asked in a whisper . ` ` mmm , hmm , so will lots of sex and lots of time spent together . ' ' he arched a brow at her . ` ` ' living hell on earth . ' ' she could n ' t stop giggling . ` ` i ' ll be a good girl and take you . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad to hear it . ' ' as they fell into silence , megan ' s fingers wound into the hair at the nape of his neck . ` ` do you want to spend the night with me ? ' ' pesh ' s brow furrowed as if silently questioning her answer . ` ` but you - ' ' ` ` no sex . just sex . ' ' ` ` you think that ' s a good idea with him ? ' ' ` ` we ' re a couple now . he ' s going to be seeing a lot of you . ' ' pesh smiled . ` ` yes , he will . ' ' looking into his eyes , she asked , ` ` ' you ' ll stay ? ' ' ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' without another word , she slid off his lap . when he got up from the sofa , she took him by the hand andfollowing him to her bedroom . as she sat on the edge of the bed , she watched as pesh stripped down to his boxer shorts . when he was done , he walked slowly over to her . ` ` i ' m glad we ca ##uld ' t do anything else . ' ' he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheeks . ` ` i ' n ' t care . i ' m happy just to be with you . ' ' in her heart , she was happy as well and not worried about him staying the night . happy for how everything between them had worked out . ` ` so am i , ' ' she whispered , lying back on the bed . ` ` so am i . ' ' chapter eighteen for megan , the next few weeks flew by . she still don ' t know if it was because she was so busy with work , or it was because she was so busy being with pesh . she liked to think it was the latter . or maybe it was that she was happy being with pesh . on her work days and his , they spent every second together . most often , he came to her house . they made dinner together or they went out . although her parents didn n ' t entirely approve , he came over as well . whatthey did don ' t know though that some nights nothing illicit ##ly happened between them . aside from the day ' s events , they just enjoyed lying in each other ' s arms . as she came out of a patient ' s room , she looked up to see pesh standing across the room talking to another patient . for just a moment , his gaze met hers , and although no one else could have possibly seen it , she saw the longing and the affection . she gave him a small smile before walking over to the nurses ' station . since they had become a couple , their day at work had become almost a battle of wills to pretend there was nothing going on between them .
