for the past month , i ' ve just been sitting in our old house , doing my best to help my mom with getting her old job back and becoming a mom , but there really was wasn ' t much for me to do . i felt both relief and fear when it was finally time to drive back down to charlottesville . relief because i ' ll have something to occupy my time , and fear because i might run into nate on campus . honestly , i had hoped that he would try to get in touch with me after my mom and i moved out , but he did didn ' t . that really was stupid of me . i told him that i loved him , and he # ##n ' t say it back . simple as that . even though he was angry , there must have been some truth to his words when he told me i really wasn ' t attracted to him . i glance at the clock . just after four - almost time for my dinner shift in the cafeteria to be starting . i change into my work clothes and head over . at least i know i wo ##n ' t run into nate there - the athletes all have a separate dining hall with much better and more nutritious food . i open my door to the lawn , smiling halfhearted##ly sees another new student a few doors down as she exits her room at the same time . i walk quickly , keeping my head down , not really wanting to interact with anyone i know . i enter the dining hall and cross over to the back door , back into the kitchen . ` ` hi , brynn ! ' ' roberta , my teacher , waves to me from a desk in the front , where she ' s doing some paperwork . i wave back and head over . ` ` there ' s been some issue with your work - study , ' ' she tells me , when i reach her . ` ` an issue ? ' ' i ask frowning . ` ` do you know what it is ? ' ' ` ` something related to your scholarship - that ' s all the principal ' s office told me when they called . ' ' i rub my forehead in frustration . this is the last thing i need . ` ` if you go over to the hall now , you might be able to talk to someone who knows more than i do . ' ' i nod . ` ` sorry , ' ' she adds , before continuing with her work . i walk out of the dining hall and follow roberta ' s directions to see if i can get any more answers , but i fear i 'look what happened . my mom has been so frazzled lately , i think she wants to make a claim for the rest of the tuition that we still owe . i explain the situation to my secretary at work , who points me toward the person in charge of the work - study program . a man in his early thirties stands to greet me as i walk through the open door of his office . ` ` francis delton , ' ' he introduces himself , shaking my hand . ` ` how can i help you ? ' ' ` ` well , i was told there ' s a problem with my work - study program , or with my grades , or something , ' ' i reply , reaching to tug at my hair before realizing it ' s pulled back into a ponytail . ` ` so , your name ? ' ' he asks , sitting down and pulling me into the chair across from him . ` ` brynn atwell , ' ' i respond , spelling it out for him . he types my name into his computer and then clicks around for a moment . ` ` ah , this is very interesting , ' ' he says , raising his eyebrows at his assistant . ` ` ok . . . ' ' i say quickly . ` ` you can no longer enroll in the work - studyfirst , because your tuition has been paid in full . ' ' i stare at him . ` ` you mean , for this semester ? ' ' ` ` no , i mean all of your tuition . ' ' i shake my head , unable to answer him . ` ` for this semester ? or . . . i mean , nothing at all ? ' ' he nods . ` ` all all . ' ' ` ` ' that ' s . . . that ' s great . how ? why ? ' ' i stammer . ` ` i have no idea . i can already tell that you ' re paying for the program . ' ' ` ` ok , okay , ' ' i say , trying to gather my thoughts . ` ` thank you . thank you so much . ' ' i walk out of his office and out onto the street . with pierce and my mom getting involved , i knew i ' d have finals and exams to deal with soon , and i took it in stride . i was used to the stress , though . what the hell ' s going on ? i reach into my back pocket and call my mom . i have no idea if she ' ll answer either , but i can at least tell her the good news . ` ` hi , brynn ! bryn##n , i was just going to tell you ! ' ' she says as she picks up . ` ` let me guess , is it about my tuition ? ' ' i ask , hearing excitement in her voice . ` ` yes ! how did you know ? ' ' ` ` well , i showed up for my meeting at the town hall , and was told that my tuition ' s being taken care of . what ' s going on ? ' ' ` ` i was literally just picking up the phone to tell you . . . it all happened so quickly this morning .
