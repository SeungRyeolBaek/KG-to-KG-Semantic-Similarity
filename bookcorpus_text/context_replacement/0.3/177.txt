` ` hi , ' ' i murmur . ` ` hi , ' ' he replies , taking a few more steps in and closing the door behind him . i look at him nervously . i suddenly have no idea what to say - the usual buzz of conversation between us is replaced with jittery nerves and excitement . his presence right now is n ' t helping matters . he ' s barefoot , and wearing jeans and a v - neck white t - shirt . he looks incredibly , incredibly sexy . ` ` i ca ##uld ' t remember the last time i was alone with a guy , ' ' he finally says . ` ` oh , well . . . good . i ' m good , too , i mean . ' ' he turns and begins to walk slowly toward me . ` ` i want to do everything with you , brynn . the pleasure of being the first one to touch you . . . everything . . . ' ' he takes a deep breath . ` ` but i ' m going to go slow . you have to tell me if i ' m not moving too fast , alright ? it ' s going to be hard for me not to get caught up in the moment . ' ' i nod and realize that i ' ve been holding my breath while he' we been talking . he stops just in front of me and wraps his arms around my waist , then bends his head down until his forehead rests against mine . ` ` come to bed , ' ' he whispers . a thrill of excitement runs through me . ` ` you ' ' ' you know how long i ' ve waited to hear you say that . ' ' he grins widely and brushes his lips against mine . in contrast to our recent passionate caresses , this one is slow and gentle . perhaps because we know we ' re not on the same page , and we have all night to deal with each other . his tongue gently flicks against mine , and i feel his hands reach under my bottom and pick me up . he stands and walks to the bed , setting me down in a sitting position on the edge . ` ` is there anything . . . in particular you want tonight ? ' ' ` ` i just want you , ' ' i reply with a smile . ` ` well , that i can do . ' ' he grabs the hem of his t - shirt and pulls it off over his head . i bite my lip . the tightness and size of his muscles almost takes me aback . i lean forward and nuzzle my nose into the hair just below his bellysmile , then softly kiss him . i hear a low grunt from the back of his throat and lean back to look at him questioningly . he ' s looking down at me like he ' s about to devour me in one bite , but he takes a deep breath and bends down in front of me , spreading my legs wide so he can press himself up against me . he pulls me toward him and captures my lips with his . as our lips meet , i feel his fingertips gliding softly across the fabric of my camisole , barely touching my right breast . i lean forward into his hand , but he pulls back . i quickly learn my place and stay still as his fingers move , teasingly sliding up under the fabric . finally i feel him reach up with both hands and pull the cotton up and hook it over my head so it stays there . he dips his head and pulls my breasts together , taking one nipple into his mouth and sucking on it , then quickly moving over to the other . i moan and tilt my head back as my hands grip the comforter beside me . he backs off and grabs the bottom edge of my shirt , pulling it off over my head . ` ` you have the most gorgeous breasts , ' ' he says , palming themas if he ' s just clay . ` ` really ? i ' ve always been self - conscious of them . ' ' ` ` why ? ' ' he looks at me in confusion . ` ` they ' re beautiful . ' ' he leans in to kiss me softly , then starts to undo his jeans . ` ` wait , um , can we ? ' ' i ask him . he smiles at me and stands . i slowly walk forward and finish unbuttoning them , then pull the zipper down . i can feel his eyes on me , but i keep my gaze on what i know is waiting for me beneath his denim . the head of his erection is pressing against his boxer - briefs as i push his jeans past his knees . i pause and then grab the edge of his waistband and pull them out and down . his thick mushroom cock slips out and soon i pull the boxers down . he ' s so big that i ca n ' t want to imagine how he ' s going to fit inside me . my confusion must read on my face , because he says , ` ` we ' ll take it slow . ' ' i nod and slide the boxers down to his jeans , opening them as he steps out of them . i watch as he 'and face - to - face again with his manhood . ` ` have you ever . . . ? ' ' he asks leadingly , looking down at himself . ` ` no , ' ' i reply . ` ` give me your hands . ' ' i comply , reaching up to place mine in his still outstretched palms . he places one on his thigh , and moves the other to his shaft . he wraps it around the base , and then moves it up to his tip , then back down .
