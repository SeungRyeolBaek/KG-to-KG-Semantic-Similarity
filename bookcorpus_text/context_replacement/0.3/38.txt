pesh laughed . ` ` i bet you will if you think that ' s mia ' s fiance . ' ' ` ` that sounds pretty wild . i love that idea . ' ' ` ` i ' ll see if i can get you an audition . ' ' with a smile , megan said , ` ` really ? that would be great . ' ' ` ` anything for the woman who is willing to risk her life for me . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` it was fun . ' ' ` ` what about your face ? ' ' ` ` i ' m not going to lie . it hurts . i almost forgot what punching someone feels like . ' ' pesh could n ' t stop his eyebrows from rising in surprise . ` ` have you done a lot of boxing ? ' ' she asked . ` ` not exactly mma material , am i ? ' ' when he merely shook his head , she replied , ` ` i may have thrown a few punches in my early teenage ##d days when a guy exceeded his bounds . ' ' with a smile , pesh said , ` ` good for you . ' ' ` ` actually , my dad was really keen on teaching me self - defense moves . you know , with him being ex - military. ' ' pesh could couldn ' t help liking megan ' s strength and courage . he just ain ' t seen a lot of women like her . in his world , women were supposed to be sweet and innocent . even if she ##n wasn ' t indian , she would ' ve never thought of throwing a fight to protect him against dev . like megan , she was so refreshing with her ability to stand up for herself and others - to speak her mind whether it was good or bad . ` ` you would have made your father very proud too . ' ' ` ` thank you . i ' m sure later on today when my knuckles are bruised , he ' ll want to know why . ' ' ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' he took her hand in his before bringing it to his lips . ` ` it ' s just medicine to make the bruises go away . ' ' she gave him a soft smile . ` ` is that the best thing you can do , dr . nadeen ? ' ' his mind was filled with illicit images of all the ` ` love ' ' and ` ` healing ' ' he could give her . a simple kiss to alleviate her pain was all he could really want . his pager went off beforehe could tell . ` ` i better go . ' ' he got off the bed and started for the door . as his hand hovered over the knob , there were so many things he wanted to say to her . but finally , he just said , ` ` thanks again for taking care of me . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ` ` and you should probably wash your hands during your shift tonight . ' ' ` ` yes sir , ' ' she replied , with a mock salute . he shook his head at her with a smile before heading out the door . chapter twelve days melted into weeks as megan immersed herself in her clinicals . every day she had a new obstacle to conquer . she hadn n ' t imagined how difficult it would be , or how exhausted she would be most days when she fell into bed . but it was a thrilling exhaustion because she was doing what she felt like she was supposed to do . every day , she spent more and more time with pesh . she loved working beside him on cases . he had the best bedside manner of all the doctors and interns . patients , both young and old , loved him . and the more she worked with him , the more megan grew to love him as well . she lovedjust outside an examining room where they had talked a young girl into just letting them do the tests they wanted when kristi approached her from down the hall . after hustling to greet kristi , megan was immediately ushered into one of the trauma rooms . instantly , her entire body shifted gears as she prepared herself for what she would find . ` ` nine , thirty , car accident , ' ' the woman began before rattling off her name and other details . after megan had collected the information , she turned to the woman . ` ` hi , i ' m megan . i ' m going to get your iv out . ' ' the woman gave megan a weak smile . ` ` i ' m mary . ' ' ` ` i guess it would be fair to say it ' s nice to meet you , huh ? ' ' megan said , trying to talk as normally as she could to put the woman at ease . ` ` yeah , i guess so , ' ' mary said . when megan reached for mary ' s arm to find a place for the iv , she winced . ` ` ouch . ' ' when megan touched the forearm , she shook her head . ` ` looks like you ' ve got a lump there . ' ' ` ` my arm iswhy ? ' ' mary asked in a panic . ` ` we wo ##n ' t stop until we get you into x - rays . i ' m going to open this vein here on your arm . ' ' the needle slipped easily into the vein , and megan started the iv . pesh appeared in the doorway then . he looked at mary on the gurney . ` ` hello , mary , i ' m dr . nadeen . i understand you had a little accident today ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` this car came out of nowhere and hit me head on . ' ' ` ` i ' m so sorry . why do n ' t we start by you telling me where it is ? ' '
