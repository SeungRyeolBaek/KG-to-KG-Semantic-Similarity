after spending a few moments in comfortable silence , megan leaned over to turn on the radio . ` ` do you mind ? ' ' ` ` go ahead . ' ' humming along with one of the songs , she leaned her head back against the seat . ` ` i wo ##n ' t hurt your feelings by singing . ' ' ` ` do you ever sing ? ' ' ` ` oh , i do , but i ' don ' t do it often . emma ' s the one with the voice . ' ' ` ` ` i ' ve heard . ' ' turning to look at him , megan asked , ` ` did she ever sing for you ? ' ' ` ` sadly , no . ' ' megan harrumphed as she crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` she hung out with you , but she would n ' t sing for you ? that ' s just gross . ' ' pesh made a disgusted sound . ` ` emma told you . . . about me ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' she smiled at him . ` ` i think you ' re a nice guy . ' ' turning his attention back to her , he gave her a questioning look . ` ` it really was wasn ' t like that for me . i mean, we ' n ' been in love with each other . ' ' ` ` yeah , that ' s what she said . course , she did say that you got her all hot and bothered . ' ' ` ` she - she did ? ' ' he stammered , embarrassment burning his cheeks . ` ` hey , the ability to get a woman hot is nothing to be ashamed of . besides , i was turned on when i first saw you there . like my panties were wet . ' ' ` ` megan , do n ' t , ' ' pesh groaned , gripping the steering wheel to where his knuckles turned white . turning in her seat , she eyed him , licking her lips . ` ` you mean ' ' you want me to say how you got me drunk in the bar ? how you could get me drunk and all bashful about the sex talk ? ' ' ` ` no . just do n ' t . ' ' ` ` fine , ' ' she muttered , before settling back into her seat . she did n ' t speak to him for a long time . finally , she closed her eyes and leaned back with her head supported by the head ##rest . when the car began to slow , she forced her eyes open . she did n ' t know if shefell asleep and passed out . sitting up , she stared out the window at the beautiful houses of the subdivision they lived in . as they pulled into the driveway , megan could n ' not stop staring up at the house . ` ` holy shit , this place is beautiful . ' ' pesh grinned . ` ` thank you . ' ' ` ` i know you think it ' s just the alcohol talking , but i ' m serious . you have great taste . ' ' ` ` i think you ' ll like the inside just as much . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure i will . ' ' after he came around to open the door , she slid out of the car a little too fast . her wobbly legs wavered , and she ended up crashing into pesh ' s chest . looking up at him , she offered an apologetic smile . ` ` sorry about that . ' ' ` ` it ' s nothing . need some help ? ' ' with the alcohol affecting her libido , she replied , ` ` if it means having your hands on me , then sure . ' ' pesh laughed , but his arm only came around her waist to steady her . she loped along beside him . after he unlocked the door and punched in the security code, she followed him inside . her blurry vision took in the large kitchen with his gleaming stainless steel appliances . she watched him as he made his way into the living room . motioning toward the couch , he said , ` ` why do don ' t you have a seat while i fix you some coffee ? ' ' although it was a good idea to sober herself up , she ' didn ' t want any coffee . she just wanted pesh . grabbing the collar of his suit coat , she pressed herself up against him . ` ` when did you put this back on ? ' ' she wondered aloud . she felt so tiny against his massive chest . it was a good feeling though - one of security and safety . it only set her even more on fire with desire . cocking her head , she glanced up at him to see his expression . even in the semi - darkness , she could see his blue eyes burning with desire . she ran her hands up his arms to his neck . she tugged him down to where his mouth was inches from hers . fortified with liquid courage , she pressed her lips to his . she could couldn ' t stop the low moan that came from deep in her throat . pesh ' s mouth was warm , firm , and firm . the brief contactmade her want him all the more - for him to kiss her . tentatively , she ran her tongue across his bottom lip , beckoning him to open for her . almost immediately , the warmth of his tongue met hers . they moved against each other , tasting , searching , and seeking . he cupped her face in his hands , holding her still as his tongue swept in and out of her mouth . emma had been right - the man could kiss like there was no tomorrow . he knew when to be gentle with his kisses and knew when to move to more demanding , almost desperate kisses .
