i go straight to my bed and grab my pillow and swing it down as hard as i can onto the mattress . i . ca n ' t . believe . i . ever . had . feelings . for . that . asshole . i sigh as i swing the pillow down again and again until i ' m out of bed . it ' s finally time for me to move on . chapter twelve ` ` you look nice , ' ' my mother says as i enter the kitchen , giving her a hug . ` ` oh . . . ' ' i reply , rolling my eyes . ` ` well , you do ! where are you two going tonight ? ' ' ` ` la mirabelle . ' ' ` ` wow - how romantic ! ' ' ` ` it ' s just a first date , okay ? do don ' t get too excited . ' ' i nod as nate and grammy emerge from the dining room . ` ` i just have a bad feeling about this one , that ' s all . ' ' she continues , handing me a glass of water , ` ` and he ' s picking you up , right ? ' ' ` ` oh , do you have a date tonight , brynn ? ' ' nate asks , raising his eyebrows at my mother . ` ` no ,' ' i nod , not wanting to make a big deal out of it . ` ` greg ! the guy from your office , ' ' my mom introduces him . ` ` well , yeah . you know , i remember seeing you two sitting together in the living room last night , and thinking to myself , ' those two would make a fine couple . ' ' ' i nod as my mom smiles broadly . it ' s amazing how quickly things have gone back to normal since that woman went on trial . for about a week , a handful of people waited around outside the courthouse , but they all left when the excitement died down . greg told us he has been working to get the woman ' s story , and that everything will go back to normal . except for nate and me . . . ` ` so it ' ll just be the two of us for dinner then , ' ' my mom says . ` ` two , maybe . i ' m going out tonight , as well , ' ' nate replies casually . i manage to resist the urge to glare at him . ` ` oh ? ' ' my mom asks . ` ` nate , you should ' ve let me know about your plans . how many times have i had this conversation with you ? responsibility , responsibility ,responsibility , ' ' pierce says as he walks to the door . i glance at my mom , but she ' s looking down at her clip board . ` ` sorry , honey , ' ' nate says quietly . ` ` it ' s nothing , honey , ' ' my mom replies quietly . thankfully , the bell rings and i can excuse myself . angry as i am at nate , i really do n ' t want to hear his mother speak to him in such a condescending way . i walk down the stairs to the foyer , and find my mom and pierce watching me . i smile . i was hoping i ' d get to the door without them all meeting - and nate , too . i look at greg as i open the door . he ' s wearing a black suit and tie , and looks a little nervous . ` ` hey , greg , ' ' i greet him . ` ` greg ! it ' s so good to see you , ' ' my dad says from behind me , forcing me to open the door all the way . ` ` good to see you , ' ' he says , extending his hand . ` ` mr . thornhill , ' ' greg replies formally . i see nate standing in the doorway to the living room, leaning back on the doorjamb but saying nothing . he glances at me and i catch his eye . i smile at him and look away . ` ` have her home by morning , ' ' pierce tells greg . ` ` yes , sir , ' ' greg replies . pierce slaps him on the back just as i ' m about to protest . ` ` do n ' t worry , greg , i ' m just giving you a little advice . ' ' ` ` oh , you scared me for a second there , ' ' greg says , exhaling in relief . ` ` well , we should get going , ' ' i lean in so that he ' n ' not have the opportunity to make any more sarcastic comments . ` ` see you later ! ' ' i call , pulling the door closed behind me . i just catch nate ' s concerned look as i shut the door . ` ` you okay ? ' ' greg asks as we walk to his car . i force a smile and shake my head . ` ` yes , sir ! my mind races for a second . so , have you ever been to this place before ? ' ' greg chose a very nice italian restaurant for our date , it ' s a cozy , dimly lit place up in the hillsof course . the wait staff is very passionate about their food , and loves to take a young couple on a date that they can argue over . ` ` so , how is it going for your stepdad ? ' ' greg asks with a smile . ` ` you know , it ' s not that bad . i hardly ever think twice about it , really . he ' s all the way at the top of the hierarchy , and i ' m all the way at the bottom , so we just work on a day - to - day basis .
