and i do don ' t want to give nate the satisfaction of seeing me cry . chapter twelve i breathe in as deeply as possible and hold it , counting to ten and breathing as slowly as i can , trying to rid myself of the hurt feelings that followed me home from the party . it ' s a trick i learned to control my anxiety , and to say that i ' m anxious right now would be a lie . i ca n ' t remember the last time i heard someone talk about me like that , though i know it ' s not my fault for it . i finally start to feel well enough to go to bed , and reach to turn off my bedside lamp . a rush of footsteps on the stairs makes me jump . i sit up a little as they head down the hall toward my bedroom . a second later , my bedroom door bursts open and nate walks in , his face red with anger . ` ` you ' re in here ? you ' ve got ta be fucking kidding me . that was fucking selfish of you to take off without telling anyone , you know that ? ' ' he spits at me , then turns around and walks out . i ' m frozen in place for a moment . what the hell was that ? what theyou have to be mad at me for ? i leap out from under my covers and run out of my bedroom just in time to stop him from opening his door . he turns around as i charge into his room . ` ` i ' m sorry ? you are just . . . you are just . . . ' ' i stumble in my words , trying to think of the right word . ` ` no , you ' re selfish , brynn ! i looked around that house for you for ten minutes ! i thought you might have been there ! i even called the cops ! ' ' ` ` wait . . . what ? ' ' i ask , completely confused . ` ` ever heard of a text message ? ' ' he asks , his voice dripping with sarcasm . ` ` no , i ' ve heard of a text message ! ' ' man , i wish i were better at this . ` ` hey , wait a second , this is ' ' not about me , this is about you ! you ' re the one ! i heard what you were saying about me to jackson , i ' m not a buzzkill , and maybe i ' m not gorgeous , but i ' m not some kind of whore , either ! ' ' i fight back the tears welling in my eyes, more angry than i ' ve ever been in my life . well , that surprises him . he looks dumbfounded and i take the opportunity to walk out . just as i ' m about to leave the room , he reaches around me and closes the door in front of me . i stop walking and turn around slowly , almost ready to punch him . he ' s standing so close to me i ' m practically pressed against the door . ` ` wait , what ? how ' d you hear that ? you followed us outside ? ' ' ` ` no , i heard you , ' ' i reply , stumbling a bit because i know i was wrong in that regard . ` ` i was mad because you were obviously trying to stop me from sleeping with jackson , and i wanted to know why . ' ' i take a deep breath . ` ` i ... i ca n ' t understand what you think about me , and that ' s . . . well , that ' s true , but i do don ' t understand why you had to go sharing your opinion with jackson . i mean , am i really that unattractive to you ? ' ' to my surprise , my bottom lip begins to tremble . ' ' don ' t want to cry right now but i ca n ' tholding back the tears any longer . ` ` no . . . no , that ' s not what . . . ' ' nate says , his eyes widen as a tear rolls down my cheek . i quickly wipe it away and nate stands up , running his hands through his messy hair . ` ` it ' s not that i # n ' t want jackson to date you , it ' s that i # ##n ' t want you to date jackson . ' ' ` ` what ? that does don ' t make any sense , ' ' i say , trying to staunch the flow of tears as i tug at my hair . ` ` jackson ' s track record with women is pretty bad . they ' re just conquests to him . ' ' i cross my arms and glare at him . ` ` that sounds pretty hypocritical . i mean , the first time we met , you asked me to have a threesome with you and you # n ' t even know my name . ' ' a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth . ` ` ok , that ' s it . for the record , you just looked so shocked , and i - i could couldn ' t breathe . you ' re right , it ' s not like i have a great track record .. i guess the problem , in my case , is that i ' m honest about it . i ' ve never offered a girl a relationship . the girls i sleep with , they know that it ' s not going anywhere because i tell them that . jackson lets them in , promising them a future with him , and then as soon as he sleeps with them , he acts like they don t ' not know . ' ' ` ` but you ' re sleeping with him . . . ' ' i point out . ` ` well , he ' s a good friend .
