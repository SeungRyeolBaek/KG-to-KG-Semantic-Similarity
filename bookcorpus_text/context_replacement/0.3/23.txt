kristi laughed . ` ` yeah , you keep telling yourself that , honey . ' ' chapter twelve as pesh exited one of the exam rooms , he saw megan sitting on a stool behind the counter , working on a chart . when the door shut behind him , she snapped her head up and caught him staring . he cleared his throat and walked over to her . ` ` hi , ' ' he said , pleasantly . ` ` hi . ' ' ` ` so , are you settling in ? ' ' she smiled . ` ` everyone has been very kind and helpful . ' ' ` ` good . i ' m glad to hear that . we usually have very good success rates with our new candidates . ' ' megan smiled before her head dropped back down to work on the chart . sighing , he scratched the back of his neck . things were coming up with them now that he knew he should ##n ' t try to rock the boat . after all , he had promised her he would keep his word . but he could couldn ' t help himself . in the two weeks since their last meeting , he had n ' t stopped thinking about her . now that she had shown back up in his life so out of the blue , he could n ' t help feeling that something was wrong .ask her to dinner , his mind screamed . he bit down on his lip to keep the question he was burning to ask from escaping his lips . finally , he blurted out before he could stop himself . ` ` why do n ' t you let me buy you dinner after work ? ' ' megan ' s pink pen stilled on the paper . she looked up and shook her head at him . ` ` it implies a date , and i thought we were clear on that . ' ' he gave her a wry smile . ` ` well , i was just eating some less palatable junk food . i hardly think that constitutes a date . ' ' ` ` in my realm of self esteem , every time you sat down at a restaurant , eating and drinking coffee , it implies a date . ' ' crossing his arms over his chest , he countered , ` ` if that were true , it would mean you were seeing your sister and brother every time you sat down there . i know your family is close , but i ' n ' t think they ' re that close . ' ' megan ' s eyebrows rose . ` ` oh , is the good doctor making jokes now ? ' ' ` ` perhaps . ' ' the corners of megan ' s lips turned up . ` ` ' whatexactly would you consider a date ? ' ' pesh leaned back against the counter , causing her to smile . ` ` a mutually agreed upon event . ' ' ` ` you ' re being proper , ' ' megan teased . he rolled his eyes at her , something he never did until he started spending more and more time in her company . ` ` and you ' re avoiding the same question . ' ' megan set down the pen and paper and crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` so , if you could take me on a date , where would we go ? ' ' pesh rubbed his forehead in frustration . ` ` well , if would happen to be something you would like to do , then we would start with dinner . ' ' when she started to protest , he held up his hand . ` ` somewhere that was filled with wine and classical music - or a place where we could dance in between songs . ' ' staring at him in disbelief , megan replied , ` ` you ' re serious ? ' ' ` ` of course . ' ' she slowly shook her head back and forth . ` ` okay , go on . ' ' ` ` after we finished wine and dessert , i would then like to take you somewhere you ' ve never been - '' ` ` ' your home ? ' ' megan asked with a grin . ` ` i do believe you ' ve only been there once . ' ' the teasing faded from megan ' s eyes , and a flush stained her cheeks . ` ` shall i continue ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' she replied . ` ` i would love to go with you to see something you never had before - an art gallery , an opera , a theater . anything that would bring wonderment and wonder to your face . ' ' he gave her a small smile . ` ` and it would help all the more that i was able to share it with you . ' ' he watched with only mild amusement as she considered his words . most likely she had never had a man talk to her the way he did , and it was obviously affecting her . feeling like it was time to go in for the kill , he asked once again , ` ` so , will you have dinner with me ? ' ' pesh leaned forward expectantly as megan opened her mouth . they were interrupted by the sound of emma ' s voice . ` ` oh thank god . i ' m so glad you two are on . ' ' her excited tone was the only thing that could have caught pesh ' s attentionaway from megan . he looked from emma to aidan , who was grimacing and shaking his head . ` ` what happened ? ' ' emma said , ` ` he fell and hit his head , ' ' at the same time aidan said , ` ` ow . ' ' megan stepped back and walked over to aidan . she smiled as she saw him . ` ` wow , your feet are cold ! ' ' pesh pulled his keys out of his back pocket and went to aidan .
