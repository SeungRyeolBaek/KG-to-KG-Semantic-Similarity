there ' s another long pause , and i begin to feel uncomfortable . ` ` it ' s eileen . . . nate ' s mom . ' ' i almost drop the phone in surprise . ` ` i , um , i don ' t - ' ' ` ` no ! please , please , n ' i hang up . i just heard the news , and thought that nate might be able to talk to me again . ' ' ` ` i do don ' t know . ' ' ` ` because he ' ll learn the truth about me , and then ... i wo n ' t believe whatever he says to me . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry , i do don ' t think i should be in the middle of this . ' ' there she is . ` ` please , please . . . ' ' i hear her gasp and the clear sound of sobbing . ` ` i just haven ' t talked to nate in so long . . . he ' s my son , he ' s my son . ' ' ` ` but you had to leave him . . . ' ' ` ` is that what he told you ? ' ' ` ` yes , nate . ' ' ` ` he heard it from me . i left pierce because he was cheating on me . butnate is used to having everything his own way , and i was not . i was the one with the money , i came into the house with nothing , and signed a pre - nup . i mean , i never even looked at the papers at the time - i thought we ' d be together forever . i had an excellent lawyer and managed to get full custody in the end . i never had a choice . i ' ve been trying to get in touch with nate for months to tell him the truth . . . i love you , not nate . i would never leave my son . i never would have left him , even if he was cheating on me , if i had known i ' d never see my son again . i thought after seeing this woman on tv , maybe he ' d forgive me . . . ' ' she bursts into tears . ` ` eileen , eileen , it ' s ok , ' ' i whisper , feeling helpless . something about what she ' s telling me rings true . i can feel it in my gut . ` ` i want to help you , but . . . nate , he ' s very touchy about his father . i do don ' t know what i can do . ' ' ` ` i know , and i ' msorry to spring this on you . i call the house now and then trying to find nate , and i was just hoping that he would pick up tonight and not hang up on me . ' ' a voice behind me makes me fly up . pierce is standing in the doorway to the living room . ` ` everything ok ? ' ' he asks . ` ` yep , everything ' s ok , mom , ' ' i reply so that eileen can hear me . ` ` just write down my number , okay ? ' ' eileen says quietly . ` ` okay , just tell him what i said . ' ' i write the number down on a small notepad on the counter , conscious that everyone is watching me . ` ` got ##cha , mom . talk to you later , ' ' i say , and hang up . ` ` not a reporter , i hope , ' ' pierce says with a sad smile . ` ` no , just a friend , ' ' i reply as calmly as possible , and rip the paper off the counter and stuff it in my pocket . ` ` god , this has been the longest day of my life , ' ' pierce says with a sigh , running his hand through his hair . ` ` i hope you and your ' ' don ' t get madinto anything . there might be some reporters hanging out by the bar tonight . probably best to just avoid them . ' ' ` ` sure , no problem . ' ' he looks very tired , and i find myself quickly feeling sorry for him . he seems so genuine right now that it ' s hard to imagine what eileen and this other woman are saying about him . the man in front of me paints such a different picture . ` ` on the other hand , though , i ' m glad that you and your mom are here right now . maybe it ' s selfish of me . but i ' n ' t think i ' d make it through all this without her . she ' s always brought joy back into my life . ' ' ` ` she ' s . . . yeah , she ' s great , ' ' i say quietly . ` ` are you having a good time at the bar ? not too terribly busy tonight , i hope . ' ' ` ` no , not at all , actually . it ' s great , thank you . ' ' he smiles . ` ` well , i better get back to work . you ' d think i ' d have quite a lot done , considering how long i ' ve been working here , but i ' ve only been working at thegoodnight . ' ' ` ` oh , well , i ' ll see you tomorrow night . ' ' ` ` ' night . ' ' ` ` goodnight . ' ' i walk back upstairs with the phone still burning a hole in my pocket . it ' s amazing to me that i ' ve gone from feeling almost certain that pierce is lying , to feeling like i ' ve betrayed his trust in the course of one short conversation with him . is he telling the truth , or does he just possess a real politician ' s ability to spin the story for himself ? i get ready for bed slowly , my mind wandering elsewhere .
