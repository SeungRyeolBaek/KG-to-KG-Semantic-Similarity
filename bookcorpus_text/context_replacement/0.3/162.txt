before this happened , i was sure of things in my life . sure of my feelings and actions . sure that i was happy . but i become less and less sure of myself the longer i stay in this house . just as i finish brushing my teeth , i hear a noise from the hallway , then a groan . that sounds like nate . with a sigh , i open my bedroom door . sure enough , there ' s nate , lying on the carpet just outside his bedroom door . i hesitate , realizing i ' m wearing my favorite nightgown , and figure he ' s seen me in it too . ` ` nate ? are you okay ? what happened ? ' ' i ask , hurrying to stand next to him . the smell of alcohol coming off of him gives it away before he says anything . ` ` i ' m so sorry , brynn , ' ' he says , starting to laugh . ` ` shhh , you ' ll wake up our parents , ' ' i warn him . ` ` why are you on the floor ? ' ' ` ` sorry . on my left foot , ' ' he says with a laugh . ` ` well , come on , get up , ' ' i order him , slipping my arm under his torso to pull himupward . he just nods and stands to his feet , where he moans slightly . ` ` okay , get in here , ' ' i say , kicking his bedroom door open with my foot . i slide my arm around his waist to stabilize him . i feel his muscles flex beneath his t - shirt as we walk . not the time , brynn . ` ` clothes off , ' ' i order him as we approach the bed . ` ` mmm , ' ' he says , as he kicks them off . ` ` i ' m getting you some water . do n ' t move . ' ' i hurry back to my room and grab my water glass from the bedside table , then refill it from the tap in my bathroom before heading back to his room . i shut the door behind me to keep the sound from echoing around the house , then stop in surprise as i see that nate has stripped down to his boxers and is sitting at the edge of his bed . ` ` water , ' ' he slurs , as i slowly step inside and hand him the glass . i watch him gulp the entire glass down , the dim moonlight from the window illuminating his muscular torso . he sets the glass down on his nightstand and wipes his mouth with the back of his handthen he sways slightly . ` ` you alright ? ' ' i ask him . ` ` i ' ve never seen you drunk before . ' ' ` ` like you ' d really drink . no one . work , home , school , anything . ' ' ` ` and you thought i was the drunk , ' ' i remind him . ` ` you ' re not , ' ' he says , jerking his head up , and taking a step toward me . ` ` nate . . . ' ' i gasp as my core clenches . ` ` what , brynn ? ' ' he asks innocently . ` ` you said this was wrong . those were your words , ' ' i remind him . ` ` do you think it ' s wrong ? ' ' he takes a step toward me , and looks down at me . ` ` i - ' ' his hand wraps around my waist . ` ` does it feel wrong ? ' ' ` ` yes . . . wrong , ' ' i breathe . i barely have time to answer before his mouth is on mine . his mouth tastes like whiskey , but i do don ' t care . i wrap my arms around his neck and he grabs my face with both hands , our kiss picking up right where our lipsone broke off . i dig my fingers into his hair as our mouths open to one another . he pulls me back against him and groans deep in his throat as our bodies collide . then he stumbles back , bracing himself on my shoulders . ` ` please , ' ' he whispers , shaking his head as if to clear it . ` ` can you just stay with me for a while ? ' ' ` ` yes , of course , ' ' i reply immediately , even though i ' m taken aback by his request . i watch him walk to his bed and crawl over to his side , then curl up on his side and look at me intently . i nod , then follow him , crawling onto the bed and curling around his waist . i bury my head between his shoulder blades then drape my arm around his waist , and feel him take my hand in his and pull me back against him . i lie as still as i can , barely breathing . i can ##uld ' t believe he ' s letting me touch him like this . sure , i was scared , but still . i never thought he ' d be so vulnerable around me . i hear his breathing deepen . ` ` i ' ve always looked up to him , ' ' he whispers , hisno . ` ` i know , ' ' i whisper back , knowing that he ' s talking about his dad . ` ` i ' n ' you know what i would do if he - ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' i whisper , gently kissing the back of his head . he shifts on his pillow , and his breathing goes shallow again . i sit with him for a while , until i know he ' s asleep . i need to understand nate ' s feelings about his mother before i tell him what she told him .
