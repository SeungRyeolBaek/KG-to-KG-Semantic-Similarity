` ` i just thought that at least , we could be more open . no one really thinks you ' re my stepsister anymore . i mean , allison would have freaked out , too , right ? ' ' ` ` i guess so . . . she just . . . she called it ' weird . ' we ' re not , are we ? ' ' ` ` well , i really really don ' t think there ' s anything gross about you . ' ' ` ` it ' s more than that , though . i feel like we ' re being apart a lot , ' ' i reveal , swallowing the lump of emotion in my throat . ` ` mm , ' ' he says , smiling . ` ` like you and me , sort of . well , maybe you wo n ' t be quite as close as you think , but there are still things you can share with her . ' ' ` ` when ' d you get so serious ? ' ' i ask , pulling his face closer to mine . ` ` since i started hanging out with you . you ' re rubbing off on me . ' ' before i have time to wonder whether he ' s being serious or not , we hear my mom yell , ` ` dad ! ' ' from the kitchen , and iforced to put our conversation on hold . he seems to be in an unusually good mood during the meal , for which i ' m grateful . not for his sake , but for nate ' s , because he ' s much less likely to snap at his son when he ' s feeling stressed . ` ` well , we have n ' t made an official announcement , brynn , but thornhill and co . has just landed mark broadman as a client , ' ' he says casually . ` ` the hedge fund manager ? ' ' ` ` that ' s right . he has several new clients , and needs advice on some important policy issues . ' ' ` ` wow , that ' s huge . congrats , dad , ' ' nate pipes in . pierce nods at him in a self - satisfied way . ` ` i ' m glad that ' s all - i ' m glad that ' s happened , pierce , ' ' i tell myself . i had referenced the scandal earlier this summer , but decided to change course . we can talk about it later , though i know that pierce was worried that it would negatively impact his career . but landing such a new client is a good sign that people have caught on , and are on pierce ' s side . after dinner ,nate and i enter the living room separately , while our parents remain there chatting . we always make a point of going our separate ways , to keep up appearances . i close my bedroom door knowing that he ' ll come for me at midnight , as he has every night this past week . my stomach twists with excitement just thinking about it . i consider writing an email to allison , but decide i want a little more time to think about what to do . i go to my closet and pull out the bag from victoria ' s secret that i wore to the bottom . i remove the black lace panties , a tiny heart - shaped piece of fabric that barely covers the essentials , with two thin strips , string , really , hooking around my hips and hanging down to the floor . the bra is conservative by comparison , though , with its chantilly lace - covered cups . i take a shower and then head downstairs for a cup of tea . i ' m pulling a mug down from the kitchen cupboard when i feel nate come up behind me . he wraps his arms around my waist and presses against me . ` ` nate , not tonight ! ' ' i whisper . ` ` i know , i ' m sorry , ' ' he murmurs in my ear . ` ` i just thoughtyou all the time . ' ' ` ` i have a surprise for you tonight , ' ' i admit . he grinds his hips into my hand in response , his hands sliding under my shirt . ` ` you ' re killing me , ' ' he moans , then sighs , and rests his head against mine before walking away . ` ` see you tonight . ' ' i lean against the wall as i watch him go , my skin tingling where he ' s touched me . i know that sneaking around wo n ' t take much , but for me , there ' s something really hot about it . i take my decaf earl grey up to my room , and change into the lingerie . i drink deeply , carefully picking up the scent . i sink into bed with a sigh , pulling the sheet up over me . these late night assignations , while i would wouldn ' t give them up for anything , are playing tricks on my sleep patterns . the next thing i know , i ' m being woken up by someone sinking into bed next to me . i turn into the warmth of nate ' s body and slowly open my eyes . ` ` sorry , should i have let you sleep ? ' ' he asks , kissing the top of my head . ` ` noplease , ' ' i say softly . ` ` you need to remove your bra . ' ' ` ` where is it ? ' ' he asks , looking confused . i lift my head and point down at my chest . he nods , and pinches the edge of the sheet in his hand and begins to slowly pull it down . i bite my lip as i hear his sharp intake of breath as he reveals my bra . he asks , looking down at my face . ` ` there ' s more , ' ' i promise him .
