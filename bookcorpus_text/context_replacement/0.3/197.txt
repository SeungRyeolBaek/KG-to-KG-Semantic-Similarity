` ` i need to be alone for a little while , ' ' she murmurs , her eyes on the floor , and walks unsteadily toward the stairs . i watch her leave , wishing she had the strength to comfort me for just a moment . ` ` she ' s just in shock , ' ' nate says , reading my mind like always . ` ` i know , ' ' i say with a nod , struggling to keep myself together . ` ` i should have told you . ' ' ` ` i had no reason to believe . ' ' ` ` i know . i just could ##n ' t believe she was capable of that kind of thing , or that i did don ' t want to believe . ' ' ` ` you said some awful things to me today . god , was that just me ? ' ' i ask with a sad laugh , reaching up to rub my eyes . ` ` i ' m so sorry , brynn . i was just . . . with my temper . . . . ' n ' t mean any of those things . the time we ' ve spent together - ' ' he stops , taking a step toward me . ` ` no , baby . i ' m not sorry for that . i do n ' t know if we can go back. . . ' ' i murmur , a tear slipping down my cheek . ` ` brynn , please , i do don ' t love you . ' ' ` ` you were so ready to turn on me , ' ' i whisper . ` ` so ready to push me away and be done with it . ' ' ` ` i was in shock at seeing her hurt . i did n ' t ' mean it . ' ' ` ` ' you felt it , did n ' t you ? the way i care about you . . . i would never want you that way , would never want you to hurt . but you want me to hurt . you just don ' t feel the way about me that i feel about you . you do ##v ' t . ' ' ` ` that ' s not true ! you have no idea how much i care about - ' ' ` ` i love you . ' ' there ' s a long silence . i look up into his beautiful eyes , my heart breaking . he ' doesn ' t reply . he just looks back down at me , some deep sadness flickering across his face . ` ` well , there you go . there you go . goodbye , nate , ' ' i say , turning my back to him . " '' ' i move . ` ` what are you going to do ? ' ' he finally asks quietly . ` ` um , nothing , ' ' i say with a nervous laugh . ` ` i think i ' m going to eat this last grilled cheese sandwich , and then i ' m going to start packing . ' ' chapter twenty - seven i drive my mom ' s old beat - up station wagon . both the car and our old house were just on the verge of being sold , but my mom was able to hold on . luckily she was taking her time in the house because she ' n ' t think she had to worry about money anymore . the house is ain ' t even full - the only things that mattered to us then were our clothes and our knick - knacks . it only took me a few hours this morning to pack everything up . it ' s both sad and sad . our old life is still waiting for us , just as if this whole thing never happened . but of course it did . i asked last night if i would take these last few hours back if i could . if i was given some small gift that could make it so that my mom had never met pierce , that we ' d returned to our old life for the summer ,that my relationship with nate has never progressed beyond that encounter in the elevator car , would i wave ##r ? i do n ' t know if i ' ve ever felt so much pain as i do now , but also , so much joy . i was held in such a tight little bubble before , never really experiencing the possibilities or heights of anything , and i tell you ca ##n ' t have one without the other . to not have my nate in my arms . . . no , i ca don ' t imagine it . despite so many terrible things that happened , i would never want to erase the time i spent with him , even if it would take away the pain i ' m feeling right now . the pain that i can feel even in my head , causing a throbbing ache in my whole body . it ' s like i ' m suffering from a powerful , toxic substance . one that i know only hurts me in the head . i catch a glimpse of my slightly swollen lip in the passenger window from where pierce hit me last night . we have n ' t seen him since - he must be holed up at a friend ' s house or a motel . i do n ' t even want to think of the divorce papers that my mom will be wrapping up inno . i hear the front door open behind me and turn - could it be nate coming to say goodbye ? but it ' s my mom , carrying a very large suitcase , her face covered in large , round sunglasses . ` ` ready ? ' ' she asks , without looking at me . i nod , then remember one more thing i ' ve forgotten . ` ` i ' ll be right back , ' ' i say , and hurry out through the front door without explanation . i run straight up the staircase and down the hall into my room . it looks exactly the same as the last time i saw it .
