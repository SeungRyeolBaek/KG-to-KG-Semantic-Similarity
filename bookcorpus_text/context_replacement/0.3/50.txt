but pesh shook his head . ` ` we ' ll come back another time . ' ' his reply seemed to pacify mason , and he happily swung his and pesh ' s arm back and forth as they walked to the car . when they were buckled up , megan turned back to mason . ` ` what did you say to pesh for bringing you ? ' ' ` ` thank you , esh , ' ' mason said . his answer was a broad smile stretching across pesh ' s face . ` ` you ' re welcome , mason . i had a good time . ' ' when he glanced over at megan , she gave him a shy smile . ` ` i had a good time , too . ' ' taking one of his hands off the steering wheel , he reached over to take her hand in his . although the gesture was a little too lovey - dovey for her liking , she could don ' t argue with him . instead , she just enjoyed his touch . once they had left a sleepy mason at home at megan ' s , they exited her suv and gotten into pesh ' s car . ` ` ` where exactly are we going ? ' ' megan asked , as she buckled her seat belt . ` ` it ' s a surprise . ' '` ` seriously ? you ' re still being coy about it ? ' ' ` ` for just a little while longer . ' ' she shifted in her seat where she could look at him better . ` ` should i try to guess ? ' ' ` ` i suppose . i ' m not sure i ' ll believe you even if you do , ' ' she teased . ` ` are we going to atlanta ? ' ' he shifted his gaze from the road back to her . ` ` have to . ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , she said , ` ` i do n ' t have time for this . ' ' ` ` okay , i ' ll give you a little hint . unfortunately , it ' s more of a question than it is a statement . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` do you have a fear of heights ? ' ' she laughed . ` ` no , i do n ' t . why ? ' ' he gave her a sly smile . ` ` i told you . it ' s a hint . ' ' ` ` i went skydiving when i was twenty - one , and i ' m perfectly okay with it . of course , i seriously doubt we ' re going scuba diving in these mountains . ' ' ` `no , we ' re not . ' ' she wrinkled her nose . ` ` please tell me it ' s not an office for the opera or something like that . ' ' his face fell . ` ` you do don ' t like the opera ? ' ' ` ` never been and never want to . ' ' pesh appeared almost personally insulted . ` ` i ' m going to have to change your mind on that one . ' ' ` ` ' am i not sure you like opera ? ' ' ` ` do don ' t knock it until you ' ve heard it . ' ' ` ` a bunch of young men and women sing in a way you can ##n ' ' understand ? not my idea of a good time . ' ' ` ` ' there is such passion and passion in their voices , ' ' he said . ` ` um , i ' m just going to have to agree to go with you . ' ' ` ` for tonight at least , ' ' he said , with a wink . when the car was slowing down , megan peered out the window before turning to pesh . ` ` we ' re at mccollum ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` you ' re taking me there ? ' ' he smiled . ` `yes , i do . ' ' even though she had known he had a gift from how he ' d helped guide aidan to noah ' s ark , she could ##n ' t believe their date involved something as unique as flying . ` ` ' let me get this straight . i ' m always like this , ' ' she did a slow circular motion over her head , ` ` to go flying ? ' ' an amused glint twinkled in his blue eyes . ` ` you have absolutely no idea , do you ? ' ' ` ` no , i do don ' t . ' ' as he put the car in gear at the airport , he turned to her . ` ` by your lack of being able to withhold sex , i ' m assuming you ' ve never engaged in any tantric sex ? ' ' she could couldn ' t stop her mouth from dropping to her chest . ` ` w - what ? ' ' she stammered . turning in his seat , he pinned her with a hard stare . ` ` have i managed to shock you somehow ? ' ' unable to speak , she simply shook her head . pesh merely chuckled at her response . ` ` come on . let ' s get going . ' ' still in shock , she was glued toher seat . when he came around to open her door , she looked up at him . ` ` tantric sex ? like you , trudie styler , and marathon sex ? ' ' ` ` yeah , i guess so , ' ' he replied , as he offered her his hand . normally , she would wouldn ' t have taken it , but at the declaration that pesh was actually into something outside the normal parameters , she was too stunned to argue with him . ` ` i did n ' t think you ' d do anything . . . sexual . ' ' pesh ' s blue eyes widened . ` ` sex is n ' - kinky . it ' s about connecting with your partner on a more intimate level . it ' s about breathing them in and not being afraid . ' ' ` ` ` it ' s not like marathon sex that lasts for days ? ' '
