` ` you slept in there ? ' ' she asked . ` ` are you kidding me ? this is amazing . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad to hear you like it . i ' didn ' t know if you were going to cheat on your uncle aidan . ' ' ` ` i thought you gave him money to buy it . ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` yeah , i did . i slept most of the time there . ' ' ` ` total bullshit , ' ' she said with a smile . after taking one of the seats , pesh said , ` ` well , i have to admit that my late mother certainly ain ' t no saint , either . she tolerated sleeping with me because she knew how much i loved it , but most of the time , she ' d take a pill to sleep . ' ' ` ` ' she did ##n ' t ' your passion ? ' ' ` ` no , she did . ' not . she always encouraged me to do what i wanted . she never was one to make me choose between her or something else . she was that sacrificing . ' ' ` ` that was really nice of her to be that giving . ' ' when pesh remained silent , megan decided it was time for another conversation .. ` ` now that i know we ' re going to savannah , are you going to tell me where we ' re going for dinner ? ' ' he grinned . ` ` there ' ll probably be a late lunch when we get there . ' ' ` ` so , where will our late lunch be ? ' ' ` ` do you like the hilton hotel ? ' ' ` ` i love it . ' ' ` ` good . i ' ve got a restaurant there for dinner . ' ' ` ` do you come to savannah often ? ' ' ` ` a couple of times a year , mostly for medical reasons on the weekends . ' ' ` ` and you always fly ? ' ' ` ` i do , ' ' he said , with a smile . the flight took less time than she expected , and with the weather , it was more comfortable . as they were on their descent , pesh glanced over at her . ` ` are you ready for the flight ? ' ' ` ` yes . why would n ' pose i be ? ' ' ` ` it can get a little scary for some people . you get a lot more of the air rushing around you than when you ' re in a 747 . ' ' she cocked her head at him . ` ` we went skydi##ving , right ? ' ' ` ` ah , that ' s right . ' ' with a wink , he said , ` ` you ' re my little adrenaline junkie . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` never was . not really . ' ' ` ` what was all that ? ' ' ` ` everything . when you ' re responsible for the health , safety , and happiness of someone else , your whole world changes . ' ' ` ` he ' s a true gentleman . ' ' she turned her gaze to him . ` ` yes , he is . ' ' pesh gave her a small smile before approaching the tower . once they had clearance to land , they began rapidly losing altitude . the runway came closer and closer until the plane shook violently and they began sliding along the pavement . when they finally came to a complete stop , megan exhaled the breath she ' d been holding . ` ` you there ? ' ' pesh asked . she grinned . ` ` much better . ' ' the voice of the tower echoed in her ears as pesh listened to the instructions . the plane began rolling toward one of the runways . once he had parked and tied down the plane , he stepped out to join her . after a quick conversation with a member of the groundssmiling , pesh took her hand and led her out of the restaurant . a cab arrived to take them into the city . she laughed as she slid off the seat . ` ` what ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` i ' m surprised by the drive . i thought you might really be surprised by having a taxi or self - driven car pick you up . ' ' ` ` i want to be here , ' ' he replied with a grin . she shook her head at him before turning to gaze out the window at the city . when they were winding through the victorian homes of the historic district , megan felt her stomach growl . she ' d been too nervous to eat dinner , and now she had n ' t dared eat at chuck e . cheese ' s . the cab stopped at a chic looking restaurant . as pesh paid the driver , megan stepped out and took in the sights around her . she loved the old world feel of the city with all its beauty and architecture . pesh offered her his arm , and together they walked inside . the restaurant ' s popularity was evident from how busy it was even at four in the afternoon . they were ushered to a small , candlelit table . ` ` wine ? ' ' '##sh ##h . ` ` yes sir . ' ' ` ` white wine ? ' ' ` ` sure . ' ' when the waiter returned with their drink order , megan opened the menu and smiled . ` ` everything smells so good . ' ' glancing over his menu at her , pesh said , ` ` with the food being served , i thought you would like it . ' ' ` ` i like all kinds of food . trust me , as hungry as i am now , i would have eaten anything . ' ' the waiter returned with their drinks , and megan knew she had to make a choice . ` ` i ' ll have the shrimp and rice , please . ' '
