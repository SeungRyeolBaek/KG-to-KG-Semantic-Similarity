pierce ' s lawyer offered me a settlement in the divorce ! and it specifically included payment of your tuition . ' ' ` ` you paid my tuition ? ' ' i asked , my mind racing . ` ` yes ! as soon as i signed , the money was wired over . ' ' ` ` but . . . ' mom , is it a good thing ? i mean , did you have a lawyer send it over ? ' ' ` ` no , it was the same lawyer who told me i ' d get married because of the pre - nup i signed . he was very skeptical , and told me i ' d better go before he changes his mind . ' ' ` ` but . . . why ? i mean , it was so out of character for him . ' ' ` ` i know ! i can hardly believe it either . it ' s crazy ! i ' ll be able to pay off the mortgage on the house and have a lot left over . i mean , we ' re not rich or anything , but we have a lot of money left . ' ' ` ` doubt it , you know , ' ' mom , ' do you think ? ' ' ` ` i doubt it . the lawyer said that there ' s no more reliable person than that womannot to defame her ex - boyfriend , so i do don ' t even think she would be worried about me going to the press with stories or anything - not that i ' d want to do that anyway . but honey , it ' s over now . it ' s all over . we ' ll ' t have to worry about him anymore . ' ' ` ` well , i ' m happy that you ' re okay with it . if you ' re happy i ' m happy . so , this is the first good news we ' ve gotten in a while , huh ? ' ' i touch my lips with my fingers , wondering when the last time i smiled was . ` ` have you seen him yet ? ' ' my mom asks quietly . she does don ' t bother to mention that she ' s talking to nate . ` ` not yet , ' ' i reply . ` ` but i ' ve convinced myself that the dark - haired guy i ' ve seen from the back is him . ' ' ` ` that ' s normal , ' ' my mom assures me . ` ` you ' ll see him everywhere for a while . but it will be soon , my dear . i promise . ' ' chapter twenty - two realizing i now have the evening off , itake a deep breath and call allison . i ' m not in a hurry , but i want to share my good news with her and miriam . allison and i have n ' t talked since our breakup over the summer , so i ' m relieved when she answers my call on behalf of both of them . i find a nice small restaurant , and tell her that it ' s my favorite . half an hour later , i ' m walking out of my room in a light summer dress - the weather here in virginia is always sweltering , even though it ' s summer . i walk slowly across the quad to the on - campus restaurant , trying not to work up a sweat . i see a group of freshmen girls giggling as they head out for a group lunch . new hall ##ies , no doubt . i remember how scared i was my freshman year here , afraid that i would n ' t make any more friends than i did in high school . my stomach contract as i remember the scene where i first saw nate on the grass , just a few weeks into my senior year . i shake my head at myself . i have to forget him . when i reach the restaurant , an upscale mexican place known for its homemade food , i ' m relieved to hear the ac in the. the waitress nods at me just as i spot allison sitting in a booth by herself . she waves with a shy smile and i walk over . ` ` i hope you ' don ' t mind , ' ' she murmurs as we sit down . ` ` i sort of lied to miriam and told her you pushed back dinner by fifteen minutes so we ' d have a chance to talk . ' ' a short bark of laughter escapes my mouth . ` ` ' ' don ' t know if i ' ve ever heard you apologize before . ' ' to my surprise , she blushes as we sit down across from each other . ` ` well , i ' ve been thinking about what you said . . . about my being stupid . . . and maybe i was a bit of , you know , y ##y ##y - shoes . maybe i need to loosen up a little . what i ' m trying to say is , i ' m sorry for what i said . ' ' i reach over and place my hand over hers . ` ` thanks . it means a lot to hear you say that . i ' ve hated not talking to you . ' ' ` ` me too , ' ' she replies . i see her glance over my shoulder . ` ` and here i thought i wasearly ! ' ' i hear miriam say . i get up to give her a hug . ` ` i see you two finally got your kicks , being in the same room together every day ! ugh , i was so worried ! ' ' she sits down with a dramatic sigh in the chair next to allison , her bright red hair falling onto her shoulders . ` ` so . catch me up on everything that ' s been happening . ' ' to my horror , i start to tear up . ` ` oh , god , miriam , ' ' i say , reaching for a tissue .
