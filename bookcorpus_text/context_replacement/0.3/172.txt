` ` this land used to belong to a native american tribe in the - ' ' ` ` piscataway , ' ' i finish reflexively . ` ` damn , i keep forgetting my dad is a nerd , ' ' he says , and i can hear from his voice that he ' s amused . ` ` ' wo n ' t gonna try to impress you with my passion for local history , though . ' ' ` ` oh , come on , tell me , ' ' i tell him . ` ` ' wo n ' t hold a secret , ' ' he admits defeat . ` ` you get better grades than me . ' ' ` ` yeah , well , put me on two different teams and i think those two might help a little . i ' n ' t know how you do it . my friends allison and miriam tell me i spend too much time in the library - i never have enough time for them . not to mention , i ' m not athletically gifted at all , ' ' i say , nodding to my friend miriam . ` ` but you ' ve got me there . ' ' ` ` you met allison on the bus , right ? ' ' ` ` right . ' ' ` ` and miriam ? ' '` ` she ' s back home in california for the summer . she ' s my new best friend ; she and allison room together . ' ' ` ` why do don ' t you live with them ? ' ' he asks , and i turn to listen to his feet dropping quietly into the water . ` ` yeah , i thought about that , but i hate being alone . my mom can be . . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' he asks me . ` ` i ' m trying to think of a more flattering word for her . ' ' ` ` you can be needy if you want . i wo ##n ' t mind . ' ' ` ` ok , she ' s not that needy , ' ' i say , feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders . i hardly ever talk about the more negative aspects of my relationship with my mom . ` ` honestly , a lot more so since she ' s dating you , though . sometimes i just feel like i ' m - ' ' ` ` her too , ' ' he finishes for me . i turn to face him , raising my eyebrows . ` ` is it obvious ? ' ' i ask him . ` ` i do n ' t want to sound resentful . ' '` ` you ' re free to feel however you want about her , ' ' he responds with a kind smile , and i turn back around . ` ` at first i thought you were fragile , ' ' he says after a moment . ` ` that if i touched you , you ' d break . i think that ' s why . . . that ' s why i wanted to touch you a little . ' ' ` ` you mean when you stood me up at lunch with our mother sitting across from us ? ' ' he asks . ` ` i can ##v ' t believe i did that , and i do n ' t think i ' ve cried again . ' ' ` ` no , you do ##n ' t , jerk . ' ' ` ` i am fragile . ' ' ` ` so , you do n ' t think i ' m fragile then ? ' ' ` ` no . i think you ' re one of the strongest people i ' ve ever met . look ! ' ' he says suddenly . i turn back toward him and see where ' s he ' s pointing . ` ` a great blue heron , ' ' he says as i spot the huge bird with its wings spread , perched on a rock in the middle of the river . ` ` that ' show they dry their clothes after they dive for food . ' ' he stops rowing for a while and we watch it . then it pulls its wings in , pulls itself into a coil , and rises into the air . we watch it disappear into the distant clouds and we begin paddling down the river again . ` ` why are you interested in history ? ' ' i ask him . ` ` i like understanding why people think the way they do , ' ' he replies quietly . i resist the urge to ask how this relates to his own history , and to ignore the trap he ' s set up . ` ` how ' s greg ? ' ' he asks suddenly . i turn around and narrow my eyes at him . ` ` what ? that ' s a stupid question , ' ' he replies with a wry grin . ` ` i . . . i do n ' t want to talk about it , ' ' i reply , a little more harshly than i meant to . ` ` so . . . so that history is really good or really bad . ' ' ` ` it ' s not really good , ' ' i reply . ` ` uh - oh . ' ' i reply . ` ` it ' s just , it ' s nothing . . . you know. . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` yes . i have to tell him soon - i ' n ' t want him to get hurt . not that i think i ' m breaking his heart or anything - ' ' ` ` i see the way he looks at you . ' ' ` ` meaning ? ' ' ` ` he ' s falling apart . i ' d stop him before he falls any further . ' ' ` ` i think you ' re right . ' ' ` ` trust me . ' ' we fall back into a comfortable silence as i think about his words . the silence of the river , broken only by the gentle wind blowing through the trees , seems to ease my anxiety about the conversation i need to have with greg . the feeling of ` ` problems ' ' seems to fade from here , though . it ' s the oppressive heat , which feels like it ' s trying to melt my body into the seat of the car .
