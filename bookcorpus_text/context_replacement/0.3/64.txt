i ' ll be back in just a minute . ' ' after pesh nodded and slid into the front seat , megan hurried to get her jeans on . once she had them buttoned and zipped , she smoothed down her hair that managed to look like she had just been f * * ked against an airplane wall . she peeked into the passenger seat to see that pesh had opened the driver ' s door and was talking to trace . trace ' s gaze left pesh ' s and returned to hers . it took only a few seconds for him to put two and two together of what had just been going on . he slowly began backing away from the plane . ` ` okay , well , you two have a nice day then , ' ' he said . ` ` same to you , ' ' megan replied , trying not to start crying again . pesh shook his head as he stepped back out of the car . ` ` come on . let ' s go before we get in any more trouble . ' ' ` ` ` getting in trouble is so much better , ' ' megan protested , as she opened her door . he glared at her as he walked around to face her . ` ` you , my love , are a very bad liar . ' ' he folded his armsaround her waist , pulling her closer to him . ` ` but i ' m grateful for every moment i have with you . ' ' ` ` mmm , you know exactly how to kiss a girl , ' ' she murmured , still kissing him . after a few heated moments , pesh pulled away . ` ` if this place has security cameras , let ' s not exactly give them all our attention ##s . ' ' megan gasped and covered her mouth . ` ` did they . . . did they . . . ? ' ' ` ` not inside the building . ' ' she sighed with relief . ` ` thank god . ' ' he grinned . ` ` come on , little troublemaker . let ' s go get something to eat . ' ' ` ` sounds good to me . ' ' with a wink , she added , ` ` even if it ' s dessert ! ' ' chapter 8 a few days after her first test and partial recovery in the mile high hospital , megan had managed to send a few pills to the pharmacy when she was grabbed by the arm and dragged into the examining room . ` ` what the ? ' ' she began , as the door was closed behind her . instead of pesh behind her , it was kristi . ` ` i need tojust a moment with you . ' ' anxiety fluttered in megan ' s stomach , and she had to take a few deep breaths before she could speak . ` ` have i done something wrong with my date ? ' ' kristi shook her head . ` ` ` no , this has everything to do with dr . nadeen . ' ' megan ' s eyebrows shot up in surprise . ` ` pesh ? what ' s wrong with him ? ' ' ` ` it ' s not what is wrong with him . it ' s what is wrong with you . ' ' megan frowned . ` ` me ? ' ' kristi nodded . ` ` i really like you , megan , but i am afraid that you are not like him . it is cruel . he ' n ' t deserve it . ' ' ` ` i still n ' t know what you mean . ' ' ` ` please , don ' t be coy . not only do i have female friends about your age , but i ' ve spent enough time working with women to have a pretty good insight into the female psyche . so , i ' ll ask once again , what were you thinking ? ' ' megan squirmed under the weight of kristi ' s gaze . if anyone found out that she and kris##sh ##k they up , it could be very bad for her future career . ` ` we ' re friends . he ' s my son ' s godfather . ' ' kristi rolled her eyes . ` ` fine . let me explain as clearly as i can since you insist on playing along . i ' don ' t give two shit if you and pesh are screwing around over this guy - ' ' megan was unable to stop her shocked gasp . ` ` excuse me , but i - ' ' now it was kristi ' s turn to interrupt . she held up her hands . ` ` let me finish this . ' ' ` ` fine , ' ' megan muttered . ` ` i realize that deep down he ' s just a friend , and after spending a long time without you , it was just a little easier for him to give in to just a causal relationship with you . but i ' ve been by his side for ten years , so i have a pretty good handle on what he ' s really feeling . ' ' ` ` ' really ? ' ' megan asked , unable to stop herself from being snarky . ` ` yes , i do . that man loves you with every fiber of his being . ' ' those words caused megan ' s shocked gazeto fade . she could couldn ' t help staggering a bit on her feet . she knew that pesh liked her - i mean , any guy could see that . " love ? ` ` he - he does ? ' ' ` ` ` yes , he does . he ' s been carrying a torch for you since the moment you walked in here . i saw it the first time he introduced you here . i do don ' t know what has happened since that moment , but i know something has changed for you , emma . ' ' ` ` it ' s just that i care about him . he ' s the most amazing man i ' ve ever known . ' '
