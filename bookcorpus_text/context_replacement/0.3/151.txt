i open my eyes as i push the water past me with my hands and look up toward the house looming against the horizon to my right . a flash of movement in the second story window catches my eye . there ' s a figure standing there , pulling the curtain aside . at first i think it ' s nate - it ' s his room , i think - but then i catch a glimpse of dark hair . must be his friend jackson . i turn onto my stomach and dive back under the water . i want nate to be the one watching me . i was never really into sports , but i ' ve always wondered if i ' d be any good at them . i push harder for the last couple minutes and then pull my legs up on the other end , gasping for air . i take the steps back out of the water and walk around to my bed and take off my suit , then drape it onto the chair and lay down on it . i can feel the suit clinging to my torso , and water sitting on my belly button . i hear the door to the house open behind me and shield my eyes from the sun as i turn around to see who it is . nate walks out of the door , his face set in a wide grin . ` ` hey , youmust be brynn . i ' m jackson , one of nate ' s oldest friends . ' ' ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' i say as we shake hands . i remember nate from earlier , standing just inside the door and looking reluctant to put another foot toward the pool . ` ` come on , nate , let ' s go in . i ' ve been dreaming about this girl for weeks . ' ' ` ` we should n ' t bother her , she needs to be alone , ' ' nate says quietly . jackson pulls off his shirt , and i look down at my crossed fingers in my lap . he ' s got a great body . maybe not as good as nate ' s , but whose better ? jackson kicks off his flip - flop and jumps in , his splash just missing me . nate slowly walks toward the pool furthest from me , and takes off his shirt . i watch his arm muscles tense as he pulls it off his shoulders . ` ` nate and i grew up playing lacrosse together , ' ' he says , walking to the edge of the pool and leaning his elbows onto the railing in front of me . ` ` hm ? hmm , ' ' i say , as nate jumps into the deep end . ` ` so youguys go to school together ? ' ' ` ` yup . uva - i mean , of course you knew that . ' ' ` ` which year are you from ? ' ' he asks , pushing his dark hair out of his eyes . ` ` i ' m not . it ' s summer , and i ' m usually pretty busy with school . um , where do you live ? ' ' nate pops up next to him . they are quite a pair , nate with his blue eyes and jackson with his long blonde locks . ` ` you sure ##t want some food now ? ' ' nate asks . ` ` dude we just got here . remember , you ' re not supposed to eat for thirty minutes after you swim . ' ' ` ` before , ' ' nate and i both chime in . we look at each other before he continues . ` ` you ' re not supposed to eat for thirty minutes now . ' would s ' pose it be okay to eat after you swim ? ' ' ` ` i dunno , ' ' he says , flashing me a blindingly white smile . ` ` just thought that was the point . ' ' i find myself smiling back at him . he has a big grin that ' s infectious . ` ` i ' m pretty surethat ' s a myth they made up so they ' d have time to eat their own food without the kids being around . ' ' i laugh . ` ` ah that makes perfect sense . you grew up around here ? ' ' he asks me . ` ` yeah , on the eastern shore . ' ' ` ` oh , sweet . my family has a beach house there . i love going out there . swimming in the bay and everything . you go sailing a lot ? ' ' ` ` um , not really , ' ' i reply . nate pushes off the wall and starts to swim back and forth with jackson . i guess he ' s decided not to make it easy on his injured shoulder . ` ` we should go some swimming . maybe swim with him , ' ' he says , nodding at him . ` ` so competitive . ' ' ` ` he is , though isn ' t he ? ' ' it feels good to be able to talk about nate with someone who knows him . and who can gossip . ` ` was he always like that ? ' ' ` ` oh yeah , always . we ' re young , fifteen years old , playing football on our school team , and coach was constantly having to hold him back during . ' ` he was always sofull in , full out . ' ' he and i laugh together . i see nate pause in his stroke , but i ' can ' t imagine he can hear us . ` ` do you still play lacrosse ? ' ' ` ` naw , i do don ' t really have the ability to keep up with football . i was good in high school , but you have to be great to make it in lacrosse . what sport do you play ? ' ' ` ` oh , none . ' '
