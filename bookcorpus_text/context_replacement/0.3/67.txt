but he was already walking such a fine line with her that he ' n ' t want to come on too strong and scare her off . ` ` i ' m not sure your mother feels up to it . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` if you ' do n ' t mind us , we ' d love to have you . ' ' ` ` are you certain ? ' ' ` ` absolutely . ' ' ` ` okay then . ' ' mason took his hand and led him through the house . pesh took in the cozy decor of the small apartment . in the chair , megan ' s textbooks and papers were scattered around , while on the floor it looked like a tornado had swept through the living room with all the books lying everywhere . when he met her gaze , she flushed . ` ` ' it ' s just a mess . ' ' ` ` it ' s fine . ' ' ` ` are you hungry ? ' ' she asked . ` ` no , i ' m fine , ' ' he lied , but his stomach growled . megan cocked her head and shot him a look . ` ` sit down and let me fix you something . ' ' ` ` not with you so unwell . ' ' ` ` although i wish i could cook you something , i 'i ' m up to reheating some of the food we had today , and there are some homemade enchiladas i made last night , ' ' she said , as she opened the fridge . ` ` that would be lovely . ' ' she smiled and pulled out a small plate . ` ` you hungry , mason ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm , ' ' he murmured , barely glancing up at his mother from one of his books . after pulling out two heaping plates each , along with some rice , she put it in the microwave . she then motioned for him to have a seat at the table . ` ` you ' n ' t need to wait for me . ' ' ` ` ` shut up and let me take care of you for two hours . ' ' her words reminded him of when she had cleaned his wounds after dev ' s punch . no matter what the situation , she was always ready to be there for him and take care of him . the microwave chimed and snapped him out of his thoughts . he walked over to the table and sat down beside pesh in his booster seat . when megan put down the two plates , he reached for her hand and squeezed it . ` ` thank you . ' ' 'funny something flashed in her eyes before she nodded . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ` ` wo ##n ' can you come with me ? ' ' he asked . ` ` actually , i would like to take a hot shower . you know , to see if it would help relax my muscles . ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` i ' ll be sure to keep an eye on mason while you do that . ' ' ` ` you do ? ' ' mind ? ' ' ` ` of course i ' n ' mind . ' ' ` ` thanks . i really appreciate it . ' ' she kissed the top of mason ' s head , and then kissed his cheek . she turned to start into the bedroom before turning back around . he rolled his eyes at the expression on her face . placing her hands on his chest , she leaned forward and laid a soft kiss on him . he could n ' t hide his surprise . when she pulled back , she grinned at his reaction . ` ` ` wo won ' t be long , ' ' she whispered . once the bedroom door closed behind her , pesh gazed over at her . ` ` what do you want to do when we finish eating ? ' ' ` ` nothing , ' ' he said through hislots of food . pesh furrowed his brow in confusion . ` ` what ' s minions ? ' ' hopping up from his chair , mason ran over to the tv . when he returned , he had a dvd box in his hand . he pointed to some yellow blobs on the screen . ` ` minions . ' ' ` ` ah , i see . you want to watch this . ' ' mason shook his head . ` ` is it your favorite ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` uh , huh , ' ' mason answered . ` ` ' i think we should eat fast so we can watch it . ' ' at mason ' s beaming smile , pesh felt a little tug in his chest . even though he should s ' pose , he already had strong feelings for the little guy . from almost the moment they ' d met , he had welcomed pesh into his heart . the sound of a spoon scraping against a plate snapped pesh out of his thoughts . ` ` done ! ' ' mason exclaimed , jumping out of his chair . although pesh was wasn ' t happy , he grabbed his hand and pulled him from the table . instead of arguing with him , pesh just let himself be dragged over to the tv . once they got the remoteon , they settled down on the couch . he could n ' t fight the warmth that spread through his body when he sat next to his brother . instead , he just embraced the feeling and let happiness override the pain that screamed in his head . under the soft , warm jets of the jacuzzi tub , megan ' s tension began to ease . of course , as much as she tried to relax , it was too hard considering that pesh was in her living room . she could n ' t believe that he had shown up out of the blue to check on her . just when she thought he could ##n ' t be any happier or more relaxed , he did something like that .
