eventually the crowd begins to thin out , and constance and i each take a cupcake back to our table . ` ` what ' s that ? vanilla ? ' ' she asks . i pick at the frosting . ` ` i think so , though i heard there was some coconut - ' ' i trail off when my cell phone rings . i look at it in shock for a second - no one ever calls me on it - then reach forward to pick it up . ` ` brynn speaking . ' ' ` ` brynn , it ' s pierce . could you come into my office for a minute ? ' ' ` ` yeah , sure , i ' ll be right there . ' ' i get up and stand . ` ` pierce , ' ' i say to her . ` ` he wants to know if i ' ll be home for dinner tonight . ' ' she nods , and i walk down the hall to his corner office . ` ` he wants me to - ' ' i turn to his secretary , gwen . ` ` sure , go on in , ' ' she replies , waving me in . i knock softly as i open the door . he beckons me inside and indicates i should take a seat across from his desk . ` ` brynn , anything forcome in , ' ' he says , standing and walking around his desk . he takes his reading glasses off and sets them on his desktop top . i look at him curiously as he sits on the edge of his desk in front of me . ` ` i know that i ' m not your assistant , but i hope that you know that you can always come to me with any . . . problem . ' ' ` ` um , okay . well , then , ' ' i stumble , surprised at the direction of the conversation . he stands and begins to walk behind my chair . ` ` you ' re a very beautiful young woman , and i hope that you can see me as a kind of protector . ' ' i feel him walk over and stand behind the chair . i watch as he brushes my hair to the side and i feel his fingers graze against my skin just beneath the hem of my dress . ` ` i could couldn ' t help but notice this , ' ' he says . ` ` what ? ' ' i ask , frowning . ` ` this bruise , ' ' he says , still holding my hair to the side . ` ` oh . ' ' my heart races . shit . i bet i saw it last night when nate pushed me up against that bed ##post ,and of course it ' s not in the kind of place where you ' d find it . ` ` um , it ' s nothing . it ' s just worn , probably from when it was on that tree . ' ' ` ` i doubt it . i mean , how far did it go . . . ' ' i ' m shocked to see him touching the front of my dress , all the way down to my bra strap . he spreads his hands across my stomach and a sickening feeling spreads through my body with them . ` ` brynn , you have such a beautiful body . you should ##n ' t be with someone who treats you with less respect than you deserve . ' ' his fingers barely touch the top of my bra strap . ` ` no ! ' ' i exclaim , and jump back . ` ` i really do don ' t think this is necessary , ' ' i tell him with as much confidence as i can muster , while reaching behind myself to pull my zipper up . ` ` brynn , i ' m just trying to look out for you . you clearly need a father figure in your life . ' ' ` ` i ' m just fine , thank you very much , ' ' i reply calmly , looking at him as ifmanage to zip my pants . i walk to the door , taking a deep breath to compose myself before i walk through the door . i walk right past my desk and into the bathroom , quickly locking myself in the stall . i grab the toilet seat and sit down , pressing my hands onto my burning cheeks . i thought pierce ' s words were saying one thing , but his actions , his words , were saying quite another . it just feels wrong . by the time i sit back down at my desk , i ' m already second - guessing myself . maybe i misunderstood his behavior ; maybe he was just trying to look out for me , but he ' s never had a girlfriend , so he ' n ' t realize he was making me uncomfortable . ` ` you okay ? ' ' constance asks over her shoulder . ` ` i ' m fine , ' ' i reply , pushing my uneaten cupcake away . i ' m not nervous anymore . i manage to make it through the rest of the work day , but i know that i ' ll still have to see him at home for dinner . as i drive home , i wonder if i should say i ' m sick or something so i ' ll be able to just be by myself in my room . but when iwalking back through the garage , my mother pulls me into the house . i carefully pull my hair over my shoulder to hide the stain , then walk in . ` ` oh , brynn , honey , i ' m so glad you ' re here . come look , ' ' she gushes , pulling me into the dining room . i see that she ' s decorated it with fine china and crystal , and a large vase of white lilies sits in the center . ` ` i thought i ' d do something a little special , to celebrate .
