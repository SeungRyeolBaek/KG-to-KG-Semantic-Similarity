without emma , he and megan never would have met . sara , which meant ' beautiful ' , had taken her mother ' s maiden name , margaret , as her middle name . at the sound of megan ' s gentle snores , he smiled . ` ` did you wear your hair out again ? ' ' he asked maya . she opened her little mouth like she wished she could talk to him . ` ` let ' s wake her up . ' ' as he swept a lock of megan ' s long blonde hair out of her face , pesh leaned down to kiss her forehead . she stirred and her eyes fluttered open . ` ` hey , ' ' she said with a sleepy smile . ` ` hey , my love , ' ' he replied . ` ` how was your first day today ? ' ' she asked , as she stretched her arms above her head . he chuckled . ` ` ' great without you and the baby . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` we missed you , too . ' ' she tipped her chin up at him . ` ` she cried for five minutes straight after you left . i think we have a serious daddy ' s problem on our hands . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' he asked , looking down at her . " could you ' tand the warm glow that spread through his body at megan ' s words . at only six months old , his siblings were already developing distinct and unique personalities . maya was inquisitive and needed sleep to be awake to see what really was going on . he ' d grown up loving her more than sara simply because maya had surprised megan by not going to sleep . sara , on the other hand , was also very sweet , and a good snuggler . she probably represented his more laid - back , quiet side where she was likely to be a little shy , just like her mom . she stared up at him , her dark eyes staring down at him . ` ` did you miss me , my baby brother ? ' ' a huge smile appeared on her face . ` ` oh my god , she smiled at you ! ' ' megan cried . ` ` ' babies ' n ' t bothered with it until now . it could be hormones or something , ' ' he argued . megan nudged his leg with her knee . ` ` she most definitely smiled at you , pesh . ' ' she rose from the couch to kiss maya ' s cheek . ` ` you smiled at your sister , did ##n ' t you ? ' ' without taking her eyes off of pesh, she flashed a smile and clenched her fist . the sight caused tears to fill his eyes . he blinked rapidly , trying to stop them . he did not ' t like feeling emotionally weak in front of megan . but he knew he was weak the moment megan murmured , ` ` ' baby . ' ' she slid her arm around his waist , rising up on her tiptoes to burrow her face in his neck . ` ` do you know how much my love for you grows because you always get excited about your daughter ? ' ' he looked down at her in surprise . ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' she gave him a soft smile . ` ` after all , all i ever wanted was for my children to have a mother who loved and adored them . ' ' she smiled . ` ` you make that dream come true every day . ' ' he pressed his lips to hers . his mind worked frantically to illustrate all that he was feeling - - the true love that he knew would come from him . ` ` i love you , ' ' he whispered against her lips . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' just as he started to kiss her again , a loud commotion in the kitchen pulled them apart . megan rubbed his cheekall before bestowing a kiss on maya ' s head . she then jerked her chin towards the kitchen , and emma followed her . patrick had just come through the backdoor with all the kids in tow . ` ` we ' re home ! ' ' mason called , as he bobbed around the corner . four - year - old noah and his five - year - old sister , caroline , made a beeline for their parents . they began talking non - stop to emma while their bodies shook with unspent laughter . pesh watched with amusement as emma ' s hand came to her mouth and she pointed her wooden spoon at patrick . ` ` you gave them ice cream , did didn ' t you ? ' ' patrick laughed . ` ` i ' m their grandfather . protecting them is what i ' m supposed to do . ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` yeah , and then you bring them home to detox on my couch . ' ' ` ` emma , you hungwy ! ' ' caroline protested , tapping her foot . with her dark hair swept up in pigtails and her blue eyes bright with determination , she looked just like her mother . actually , her mother was like aidan . ` ` emma fitzgerald , you get an ice cream cone , you, and you are acting like you have no idea . we do not use our feet to get what we want . ' ' she looked thoughtful for a moment before saying , ` ` pwease ##y , i vewy hungwy . ' ' emma grinned . ` ` go wash up and then have a seat at the table in the dining room . ' ' ` ` come on guys , ' ' mason said . at almost four - and - a - half , he was still the caretaker of his younger cousins . mason and emma followed him into the half bathroom off the kitchen .
