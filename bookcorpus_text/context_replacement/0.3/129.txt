we ' d had an argument of sorts that morning , well i would n ' t call it an argument , but there was definitely some tension . we were lazing around having fun doing our own thing , which was something the therapist had told her was helpful for her recovery . i was reaching over to pour her some orange juice when she interrupted me . ` ` trace are we gon get ##g married ? ' ' she caught me off guard with that one , coming out of the blue like that and i guess i couldn n ' t handle the question to her satisfaction . ` ` why do don ' t we talk about this tomorrow when you ' re done with the paperwork ? ' ' it was the best i could come up with on such short notice . for some reason my answer pissed her off . she ' d been losing her temper a lot more lately and she realized i was n ' t the type to raise my fist and punch her in the face just for kicks . after she asked me that she got all moody for the rest of the day and when she was wasn ' t slamming things around the house she started hitting me . i decided to leave her to her mad and do some work in my office . two hours before she was ready to leave i 'her in the bathroom and f * * ked her against the wall although she ' d tried to give me shit at first . ` ` mine , you do don ' t call me no ever no matter how f * * king pissed you are . ' ' i had my hand on her off ##ness when i heard that and pulled it away to enter her swiftly . as much of a noise as she ' d made by the time i had her pinned to the bed , her legs were wrapped around my waist and her fingers were digging into my back as i f * * ked her to within an inch of her orgasm . she ' d cleaned my c * * k up after i ' d f ##ed inside her the second time and we ' d cleaned each other up after so i was under the impression that she was in her head . then she pulled this f * * king shit . we ' d had a few arguments about the way she dressed on stage and when she let it be known that she was n ' t too happy with any of the clothes either or her makeup and chose them , i ' d put my foot down . her talent didn n ' t have any gimmicks . i did don ' t expect her to dress like a nun on stage but i didi wanted her to show her ass to the world , especially when that ass was now the sole property of trace mckenzie . i waited until the show was almost at an end and she would be headed home for a clothes change . i grabbed her as soon as she got off the stage and while her helpers were waiting to make her change i dragged her off to the dressing room and locked the door . ` ` your next move had better be something really sexy shiane , or i swear to f * * k , i will drag your ass off that f * * king stage and take you home . ' ' ` ` do don ' t tell me how to do my job trace , i was planning this before we left and if you still don ' t like it . . . ' ' my hand came up and went around her neck and i pulled her face close to mine . ` ` ' what the f * * k you say to me little girl , i ' m holding onto my temper by a thread , so unless you want me to tie up your little ass when we get home you ' d better quit while you ' re ahead . ' ' ` ` maybe i wo don ' t like going home with you . ' ' she was laughing and obviously not happy .either because of it or she would ' ve been more careful . i laughed in her face . ` ` try it , there ' n ' not a tree or rock big enough to hide your face . and if you allow any one of these f * * kers around here to see you hide from me i will shoot the f * * k . ' ' i slapped her hard enough to split her lips before leaving her alone . i knew what she wanted but she was just going to have to wait . i ' m a man and for a man there ' s always the hard way and a fair way to do things . she walked right out my door and that ' s when she finally got there . i knew i ' d made my point when i saw the long dress with the slit down the front . just then one of the other dancers came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her from behind . she turned to him and they did some sorta two - step dance . then he did something with his foot and the dress was at her feet . she kicked it out of the way as the crowd went wild . she had the nerve to dead at me was she laughed and danced and shook her head at the crowd . i knew there was going to be a riot .i stood there for the rest of the set until she left the stage for the last time . by now my rage was a barely controlled anger building inside me . i said nothing as we walked backstage where everyone was cheering her on her performance . ` ` let ' s go . ' ' i walked over and grabbed her hand . ' ' ` ` ' i want to . . . ' ' one look at my face had her losing it . she swallowed hard and i could tell from her eyes that she was finally aware that she ' d gone too far .
