we ' ve got a big surprise for you guys . ' ' mason ' s eyes lit up . ` ` ' cweam ? ` ` oh yeah , there ' s lots of ice cream just for you . ' ' ` ` yay ! ' ' he laughed . when they drove up to patrick ' s , megan did a double take at the sight of the enormous wooden castle out on the lawn . aidan , john , and georgie were already making good use of it . ` ` emma , the party planning bug has hit again , ' ' she mused . pesh grinned as he got out of the car . he went to get mason while she went into the house . balloons and balloons filled the foyer and living room . over the dining room table , there was a giant christmas party sign . when she got to the kitchen , she sucked in her breath at the sight of all the huge balloons . ` ` emma rose , what have you found ? ' ' she asked . at the sound of megan ' s voice , emma jumped . clutching her stomach , she whirled around . ` ` okay , so maybe i found a really excellent spot for the bouncy castle . like , wow . ' ' megan crossed her arms over her chest . `` the food ? i thought you and my sister were cooking . ' ' holding up her hand , emma said , ` ` ' williamson chicken bbq . nothing fancy . ' ' ` ` anything else i need to know about ? stuffed animals or balloons bursting out of a cake ? ' ' emma giggled . ` ` nope . that ' s it . ' ' megan watched emma move around the table , setting up the plates and cups . ` ` um , is there anything i can do ? i mean , i feel pretty good considering this is my sister ' s birthday party , ' ' megan said , with a smile . pink tinged emma ' s cheeks . ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' megan wrapped her arms around emma and squeezed her tight . ` ` do y ' all be careful . you ' re going to ruin all of this for us . ' ' emma laughed . ` ` you ' re more than welcome . i ' m so happy for you and pesh and for me . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' when megan pulled away , emma said , ` ` now , there is something you should know . go tell aidan we ' re about to leave . he needs to get her up from her nap . ' ' ` ` '. i ' ll be glad to . ' ' as megan walked down the familiar hallway , she stopped outside of aidan ' s living room . through the crack in the door , she could see him walking around the room , bouncing caroline in his arms . at the sound of his voice , she had to suppress a laugh . aidan was many things , but a laugh was n ' t one of them . ` ` sweet caroline , dum , dum , dum . ' ` never been so good , ' ' he crooned off - key . when megan pushed open the door , aidan froze . ` ` um , hey , ' ' he said , a flush entering his cheeks . ` ` i never really knew you as a neil diamond fan , ' ' she said , with a smile . ` ` yeah , well , sweet caroline seemed like the right thing to sing to her . ' ' aidan cleared his throat . ` ` what are you doing in here ? ' ' ` ` emma asked me to come get you . ' ' ` ` oh , ' ' she said . in his arms , caroline began to whimper , her little fists flailed . ` ` shh , it ' s okay , sweet caroline . where was i ? ' ' ` `i ' ve been practicing , ' ' megan told him . ` ` good , ' ' he said , patting caroline ' s shoulder . when he filled her up with the music , megan said , ` ` that ' s too bad to torture her like that . ' ' when aidan scowled at megan , caroline began to giggle . aidan ' s expression then turned serious . ` ` see ? she likes it when i sing to her . ' ' ` ` ' you ca don ' t sing , ' ' megan said . aidan shrugged . ` ` it really don ' t matter to her . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` she has a daddy with a beautiful voice , but she refuses to listen to you ? ' ' flashing his trademark cocky grin , aidan said , ` ` what can i say ? all girls love music . ' ' with a roll of her eyes , megan said , ` ` give me a break . ' ' looking down at caroline , aidan asked in a sing - song voice , ` ` do don ' t you have the best , brightest , and most wonderful daddy in the whole wide world ? ' ' caroline cooed at his question and crossed her legs . ` ` she ' s a lucky girl because she knows how lucky she is . ' ' `` you ' re welcome , ' ' megan said , with a grin . aidan looked from his daughter back to megan . ` ` you want to have my own perfect baby girl ? ' ' ` ` i would love to . ' ' she held out her arms as aidan handed caroline to her . dressed in a deep purple gown and purple bow , she looked like she could be in formal wear . unlike caroline ' s long blond hair , hers was a deep purple . she had also inherited her mother ' s blue eyes . ` ` i have to agree that you ' re a lucky girl because you look just like your mother , ' ' megan said .
