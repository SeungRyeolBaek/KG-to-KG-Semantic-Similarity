` ` i do . i really do . ' ' unfastening her seat belt , she lunged over to kiss him . when she tried to end the kiss , he started to pull back . ` ` hey now , you need to stop that or we ' re not going to make it to my house . ' ' she giggled and then eased back down into her seat . she managed to enjoy herself the next few minutes . when he pulled into his gravel drive , he saw it was already crowded with cars . the sight of so many cars set megan off , and she began tapping her fingers nervously on her knee . ` ` ready ? ' ' he asked , as he turned to her . ` ` as i ' ll ever be , ' ' she replied . he shook his head as he got out of the car . like always , he opened her car door and helped her out . as they started down the driveway , megan was a flurry of movement . she smoothed down her skirt and then she adjusted her top . then she fiddled with her purse on her shoulder . ` ` stop it , ' ' pesh whispered , as he rang the doorbell . ` ` don ' n ' t do that . i ' m serious . ' ' he grinned down ather . ` ` megan , they ' re going to love you . i promise . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` they ' re going to hate me because i ' m not a proper indian woman . wait until they know i have a child out of india . they ' ll be ready to see you soon . ' ' the door swung open , cutting off the rest of their conversation . ` ` megan , it ' s so good to see you ! ' ' his brother - in - law , sanjay , exclaimed . after he greeted pesh , his eyes moved to megan . his eyes widened , and he blinked in surprise . ` ` uh , hi . ' ' ` ` hi , ' ' megan replied . sanjay gave pesh a curious look . ` ` you did ##n ' t tell us you were expecting us . ' ' ` ` this is megan . ' ' with a self - satisfied tone , he said , ` ` she ' s my sister . ' ' ` ` really ? well , what was that ? ' ' sanjay gave megan a warm smile . ` ` we ' re so glad to see you . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' megan replied . as sanjay turned to go into the living room , megan and pe##sh ' s arm . ` ` you did ##n ' ` tell them you were with me ? ' ' he shook his head . ` ` no , i prefer the element of surprise when it comes to my personal life . ' ' ` ` w - what ? ' ' she sputtered . ` ` it ' s better this way . trust me . ' ' before she could say anything else , pesh started taking off his shoes . wide - eyed , megan watched him . finally , she stepped out of her shoes and dropped them on the chair next to his . ` ` ' like you forgot to tell me ? ' ' she teased . he patted the small of her back . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' as they walked into the living room , pesh felt megan tense at his side . he thought that it was strange coming into a house packed full of people . his sister , shveta , walked in first . ` ` hello brother . you ' re looking beautiful this morning . ' ' ` ` thank you . so thank you . ' ' he hugged her tightly . when he pulled away , she looked down at her pregnant belly . ` ` and how is the crown prince doing ? ' ' shveta smiled and brought her hand to herabdomen . ` ` he ' s out kicking ass at the bar . ' ' when she spied megan behind him , she smiled . ` ` and who is this ? ' ' he sucked in a breath and gazed at his family . ` ` before i go into this with each and every one of you , i might as well get this out of the way . i want to introduce you to someone very special , my wife , megan . ' ' deafening silence reverberated around the room at his announcement . his mother and father exchanged a glance before looking back at pesh . megan tucked herself in closer to his side . although public displays of affection between men and women were frowned upon in his culture , he wrapped his arm around her waist . ` ` mom , say something , ' ' he urged . ` ` we ' re fine , son . it ' s just you caught us off guard , ' ' his mother said . his father ' s bushy eyebrows rose . ` ` so you ' re really here , eh ? ' ' ` ` yes , i am . ' ' at his declaration , his father clapped his hands and smiled . ` ` that is so good to hear ! ' ' he came forward to embrace megan . ` ` you are very welcome here .' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' she said . ` ` i ' m charlie , ' ' his father introduced . ` ` megan , ' ' she added , with a small smile . pesh peered past his father where his mother sat chewing her food . he could tell she was n ' t entirely happy that another blonde - haired , blue - eyed woman was standing beside her husband . while shveta and arjan had both sought out indian men to marry , he and dev were considered the black sheep since they had hadn ' t chosen to settle down with women of their culture . eventually , his mother ' s curiosity won out over anything else , and she stepped forward to shake megan ' s hand .
