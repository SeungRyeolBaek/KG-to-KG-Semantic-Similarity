pesh squeezed megan ' s knee under the table . she cut her eyes up to him and smiled . once the food had been passed around and everyone seated , they began to eat . ` ` mmm , the food is delicious , ' ' megan complimented . ` ` thank you , ' ' lavani said , with a beaming smile . as his mother turned her attention to shveta , pesh shook his head and spoke in a low voice to megan . ` ` ' i was watching beau with a samosa . ' ' she laughed . ` ` you did ? how ? ' ' ` ` he was at aidan ' s house spying on emma when she was on bed rest . i guess you could say he did . ' not with me invading his privacy . ' ' ` ` would beau ever take anything from you ? ' ' ` ` no , he saw it , ate it , and seemed to enjoy it . but i did t ' ' make any friends that night . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` good old beau . ' ' pesh raised his eyebrows . ` ` you ' re siding with the devil ? ' ' ` ` in that case , no . he was just watching emma and me . ' ' ` ` i know . ' ' 'her head toward him , she added , ` ` besides , i do n ' t want a relationship where you and emma are anything more than friends . ' ' ` ` i was there in a professional capacity , ' ' he argued . she crooked her finger at him . ` ` you brought emma with you . that fact alone means you were there for more than just the sex . ' ' when he gently pulled her finger away , she gave him a look that was a cross between amused and infuriated . ` ` are you trying to silence me ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m just teasing you , emma . we normally don ' t kiss - it ' s just rude . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` i ' ve done something else wrong now ? ' ' ` ` you ' re right . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` next time , you better plan on giving me a crash course in greek language before you even think about bringing me around your house . ' ' across the table from them , shveta cleared her throat . when pesh and megan looked at her , she smiled . ` ` you ' re doing great , megan . please do don ' t worry about breaking all the rules of our family . wei just don ' t want you to . ' ' megan returned shveta ' s smile . ` ` thank you . i would never dream of doing anything to hurt you . ' ' ` ` of course you would ##n ' t , ' ' charlie said . pesh # ##n ' t charlie sneak a look at his mother . after all , she was the one who established the laws and customs of their country . his father had tried to americanize himself as much as possible , right down to changing his name . charlie wiped the corners of his mouth with his napkin . ` ` i see you have a son , megan . ' ' she smiled . ` ` yes , he is only five . he ' s my entire world . ' ' ` ` you should have brought him with you this time . we would have loved to see him , ' ' shveta said . ` ` maybe next time . of course , after you see how much energy he has , you might change your mind . ' ' as the table cleared , she looked over at pesh . ` ` he truly loves pesh , and pesh is very patient with him . his patience is legendary . ' ' pesh smiled . ` ` he ' s a good boy . i 'spend time with him . ' ' ` ` so it ' s over between you two ? ' ' lavani asked . ` ` uh , well - ' ' megan began when she was interrupted by the doorbell . sanjay rose out of his chair . ` ` that must be dev . ' ' ` ` how is that he ' s so handsome ? ' ' shveta mused with a frown . pesh almost laughed at the horrified look on megan ' s face at the sight of dev . ` ` you said ##n ' t tell me he was going to be here ! ' ' she hissed . ` ` i just wasn ' t sure if he was coming or not . ` do n ' t worry . things are fine between us now . ' ' megan gave him a questioning look as dev walked into the living room . ` ` hey everybody , ' ' he greeted , holding out his hand . at the sight of megan sitting next to pesh , dev ' s eyes widened . ` ` well , well , if you ' n ' t miss me here , ' ' he mused with a smirk . ` ` it ' s a right hook , actually , ' ' she corrected . dev chuckled . ` ` good to know . ' ' ` ` you ' ve met megan , dev? ' ' lavani corrected him . ` ` we had the pleasure of meeting each other one day when i went to the hospital to see alpesh . ' ' at megan ' s sharp intake of breath , dev winked at her . he then eased down across from them and began putting food on his plate . ` ` so you two worked together and now you ' re friends , huh ? ' ' ` ` yep , ' ' pesh agreed . after taking a bite of his food , dev glared at them while he chewed . ` ` alpesh is sort of your boss , right ? ' ' pesh could feel megan ' s eyebrows rise . ` ` no , actually it is n ' day . i have a teacher , or head teacher , who is my boss .
