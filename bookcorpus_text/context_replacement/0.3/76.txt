` ` yes , i think i can do that . ' ' raising her head , she eyed him suspiciously . ` ` ' did you think i would have to be at my house for that ? ' ' ` ` it wo n ' t just be my sister and her husband . all of my family will be there , including my parents . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` you want to introduce me to your family ? ' ' ` ` yes , i would . ' ' she nibbled on her lower lip as she was prone to do when she was nervous . ` ` but that would mean we ' re very close , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' he replied , with complete confidence . scooting to the edge of the bed , she covered her lower belly as best she could . she looked up at him . ` ` you ' re not the least bit worried what they ' re going to say about you and me ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m not . ' ' the corners of her mouth turned up into a smile . ` ` ' i ' ll be , ' ' she said softly . ` ` really ? ' ' when she shook her head , he moved forward to take her in his arms . ` ` thankyou , my love . you ' ve made me so happy . ' ' ` ` you make me happy every day . it ' s the least i can do . ' ' with her head buried in pesh ' s chest , she was finally able to make the smile she had plastered on fade into a frown . while she should have been happy that pesh wanted to introduce her to his parents , she could couldn ' t help feeling overwhelmed . what if they hated her ? what if their dislike caused pesh to not want to see her anymore ? she didn n ' t want to think about what it would be like not having him in her life . at the same time , it was hard accepting all the emotions that pesh ' s devotion made her feel . he had always wanted to introduce her to his parents . she met them by accident during one of his visits . now she had a husband who wanted nothing more than to share all aspects of his life with her . it was hard to resist . in the end , she could only hope that everything went well . chapter 8 the next day at noon when pesh found a lull in traffic , he stepped into the nurses ' station . there he said hello to all of the other men and women of the hospital staff, he gave a singular amount of attention to megan . when he joined her at the desk where she was grading papers , she looked like someone had tasered her . ` ` go away , ' ' megan hissed . he chuckled . ` ` you know , i think i could be seen standing here in the nurses ' station without raising any suspicion . after all , i could be visiting a patient with you . ' ' ` ` then you should start writing in patient reports very soon . ' ' ` ` you wanted to know if it would be all right to pick you up at seven on friday evening ? ' ' when megan lifted her head off the paperwork she was working on , her blue eyes widened in surprise at him . in a low voice , she said , ` ` i can not believe you are talking about our date here at work . do you care anything about my date ? ' ' he held his hands up helplessly . ` ` i ' m sorry . i ca don ' t know what i was thinking besides the fact that i saw you and wanted to talk to you . ' ' megan ' s expression softened . ` ` i ' m sorry , but we just don ' t work that way here . ' ' pesh opened his mouth to speak when asomeone behind them cut him off . ` ` do ##n ' t you two get cozy , ' ' kara said . pesh whirled around to see kara staring at them with tears burning in her eyes . ` ` excuse me , but i need to get my ass on the carousel , ' ' megan said , with her head dropped to her chest . she turned to go , but kara reached out and grabbed her arm . ` ` if you do ##n ' ' kara , this room 2 needs a clean - up . ' ' ` ` kristi is the only one authorized to give the orders around here , ' ' megan replied . kara pursed her bright red lips . ` ` ' and sex with a doctor - you really have the career you wish , do don ' t you ? ' ' megan started to protest , but pesh stopped her . glaring at kara , he said , ` ` i need to talk to you . alone . ' ' after giving megan a dirty look , kara let pesh lead her out of the nurses ' station and down the hall . ` ` what in the hell do you think you ' re doing ? ' ' he demanded . ` ` stopping you from making a huge mistake . you really don ' t need a girl like that - youneed a woman to take care of you . ' ' when her hands tried to reach up around his neck , pesh grabbed them . ` ` ` n ' t touch me ! ' ' he warned . a slow smile spread across her face . ` ` you came when i touched you there . ' ' ` ` that was a mistake - a stupid mistake that i regret daily , and i never plan on making again . ' ' she narrowed her eyes at him . ` ` ' you ' re setting me aside for a young woman ? ' '
