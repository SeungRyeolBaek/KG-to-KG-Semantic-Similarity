he liked the feel of her against him a little too much . it made him want to draw her into his embrace . . . maybe do some things that he should ##n ' t be thinking when he was in a church . glancing over her shoulder at him , she joked , ` ` jeez , you ' re like a gentle giant , to me . ' ' ` ` am i ? ' ' he ' n ' t noticed the difference in their height - he ' d been focusing on her too much . she laughed . ` ` ' a little short . of course , it ' doesn ' t take much for someone to make you feel short . ' ' ` ` you look fine to me , ' ' she said sincerely . craning her neck back to look at him , she gave him a sly smile . ` ` do i ? are you flirting with me , dr . nadeen ? ' ' he stared down at his lap , trying to avoid the heat of her gaze . he tried to ignore the hot flush he felt in his cheeks . ` ` no , not flirting with the godmother , ' ' the woman said . reluctantly , pesh stepped away from megan . as the flashes went off , drawing hers and aidan ' s attention , he turned his headdamn her . as she focused on the camera , megan ' s blue eyes sparkled and she stretched her face into a wide smile . noah ' s little fingers wrapped around some of the strands of her hair , causing megan to yelp in delight . ` ` easy now . you got to do that , ' ' she said to noah . ` ` okay , that should do it , ' ' the photographer said . ` ` ' godfather , it ' s your turn , ' ' megan said , as she handed noah to him . by now , noah was tired of being held and tired of being ensconced in layers of lace . he peered up at pesh before answering . ` ` i ' m sorry , little man , ' ' he cooed , trying to bounce noah in his arms . as noah continued to cry , pesh looked over at the photographer . just before he was about to give up , megan came over and started waving her hands and making noises at noah . the boy finally stopped crying . ` ` that ' s okay , baby . give me a minute , ' ' megan said , as she backed up to stand behind the photographer . she continued making the noises , and she even took to flashing some of the strands of her hair at him .suddenly , noah ' s thin face broke into a grin . ` ` there we are , ' ' the photographer announced . pesh quickly plastered a smile on his face . after several flashes went off , the photographer set up his camera . ` ` got ##cha . ' ' both noah and pesh exhaled in relief . looking up at him , pesh asked , ` ` bet you ' re going to get up and get out of that dress , huh ? ' ' ` ` it ' s a gown , not a dress , ' ' megan said with a smile . he chuckled . ` ` regardless of what it ' s called , i do don ' t think he likes it very much . ' ' megan brought some of the lace between her fingers . ` ` seems a little uncomfortable for him . ' ' ` ` does your father wear this gown ? ' ' ` ` no , this is aidan ' s dress . i have my mother ' s , which my brothers and i also wore . ' ' ` ` i see . ' ' ` ` in your culture do they do anything special like this for a baby ? ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` we have the namakaran , the naming ceremony . it ' s usually early in the morning . and like this ,it ' s all about giving support to the child - family and people coming together in support of the new baby . ' ' ` ` i like that . ' ' they were both interrupted by aidan and emma walking in . aidan immediately reached out for emma . ` ` ' a mama ' s boy , ' ' aidan said , which earned him a glare from emma . he merely smiled at her in response before walking down the hall . pesh noticed megan ' s parents beckoning her with a wave . ` ` guess you have to go , ' ' he said . ` ` ' i ' ll see you at aidan and emma ' s , right ? ' ' she asked . he swallowed hard . ` ` um , yeah , i ' ll be there . ' ' ` ` good , ' ' she said , with an encouraging smile . she gave him a small wave before walking off to join her parents . shaking his head , he muttered , ` ` this is trouble . ' ' chapter four when megan arrived with her parents at aidan and emma ' s , she was surprised to see a pickup truck parked in the driveway . her surprise continued when she got to the house . walking out into the backyard , she saw where tables were set up in the driveway . the tables were coveredwith blue and white balloons and glittering blue and white lights . a low chuckle behind her caught megan ' s attention . turning around , she saw casey shaking her head . ` ` wow , this is an awesome birthday party , ' ' she said . ` ` it ' s awesome . that ' s for sure , ' ' megan agreed . when emma breezed into the kitchen with casey in a more comfortable position , casey shook her head . ` ` so , i was just wondering where the ice sculptures were ? ' ' pink tinged emma ' s cheeks .
