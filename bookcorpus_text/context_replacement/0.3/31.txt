` ` yes , sir . ' ' ` ` do you have trouble maintaining an image ? ' ' ` ` you could once again point out that you had no idea of how well i was able to control myself once again , but i ' ll disagree . so , i ' ll say yes . ' ' ` ` ha , ha , nice way to get your point in . ' ' ` ` i had to try . ' ' she cocked her head at him , giving him a teasing smile . ` ` if a patient was going to flirt as much as you are during my sessions , then i would like to remind him that i am a doctor . ' ' ` ` i see . then forgive me for trying to undermine your professionalism . ' ' ` ` you ' re safe . . . for now . ' ' he took a long swig of his iced tea . ` ` you did very well in there . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` yes , you did . for that to be your first experience on your own , you had to keep yourself professional and to give the patient the highest level of attention and care you could . ' ' she could couldn ' t help the heat rushing to her cheeks that his compliment caused . ` ` thank you .i like your personality . ' ' ` ` i think you ' re going to make an excellent nurse . i know that there will be many people wanting to hire you . ' ' megan shook her head . ` ` i really don ' t know about that . ' ' ` ` ` n ' t mind your talents . ' ' ` ` you think they would want to keep me here ? ' ' she asked . his eyebrows rose in question . ` ` you would ##n ' t mind a permanent placement here ? ' ' she asked . ` ` it has ##n ' t been long , and i have been happy here . i like the people i work with . i guess i would n ' t want to go into the hospital when i have what i have now . ' ' he swallowed a bite of his sandwich . ` ` that ' s understandable . ' ' after wiping his mouth , he looked at her . ` ` i think they would be crazy not to make you an appointment . ' ' ` ` i hope so . ' ' leaning forward over his plate , he met her gaze . the intensity in which he looked at her caused her to shudder . she didn n ' t like the effect he was having on her in the middle of the hospital cafeteria .a range of emotions swept through her - relief , safety , lust , love . she had n ' t experienced that range of emotions with a man in a long , long time . finally , he spoke . ` ` you know it would make me very happy to have you back , and i would do everything in my power to ensure you are . ' ' before she could respond , a tray slid down onto the table next to her . one of the doctors , a young man named dr . morris , smiled at the two of them . ` ` so , i see you two have discussed the priapism case . ' ' ` ` yes , we did , ' ' megan replied . she # ##n ' t dare look back at pesh to gage his expression on being interrupted . dr . morris laughed . ` ` oh come on . spare me the embarrassing details . i have n ' t been to any one of those yet . the only serious swelling i ' ve had was when some needle tried to pierce his balls , and they got infected . ' ' when megan wrinkled her nose , pesh ' s laughter startled her . her gaze snapped to him , and he grinned . ` ` i told you that the drinks we had over dinner were not very appetizing . '' ` ` i ' m starting to believe you , ' ' she replied , with a smile . somehow she managed to eat the rest of her salad while pesh told dr . wells the ins and outs of the case . when she finished , she slid out of her chair . ` ` i guess i better head home . you know , with everything being so weird . ' ' surprisingly , pesh did e ' er stand up nor did he offer to walk her back . instead , she saw an expression on his face that told her he was letting her go so there would be no awkward lingering between the two of them . ` ` thank you for dinner , ' ' she said . ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' he replied , with a smile . his words were starting to do something to her that she ' n ' er explain . they were no longer igniting her insides on fire ; instead , they were making her want to spend time with him . she quickly slung her purse over her shoulder and walked out of the cafeteria . with the crowd around her , she could put pesh out of her mind for the rest of the day . chapter 8 after two more weeks of her clinicals , megan was ready for a little randr . so she wasespecially when emma called her asking if she wanted to join her for a girl ' s day . she was even more surprised when emma mentioned that aidan was going to take mason , so he and noah could play together . even though she was sure her parents would have watched him , she hated imposing on them too much . an hour after the call , she was pulling into aidan and emma ' s driveway . when she opened the door to let mason out , noah was already jumping up and down in his car screaming with excitement .
