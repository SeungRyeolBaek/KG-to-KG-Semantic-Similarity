megan shook her head . ` ` we need to get you cleaned up . ' ' reluctantly , he followed her into the room . for the first time in a long time , he found himself on the opposite line of care . he lowered himself onto the examining table . ` ` no , megan , this is n ' t necessary . ' ' as she busy herself pulling out tubes , cotton balls , and bandages , she replied , ` ` quit your bitchin ' . ' ' she glanced over her shoulder at him . at what must have been his incredulous expression at her word choice , she laughed . ` ` that ' s right . ` shut up and let me take care of you . ' ' ` ` when you put it like that , how can i not ? ' ' he smiled . her smile warmed his heart . deep down , he was happy to see her so close to him . she only really cared about him if she insisted on cleaning him up . or was she so attentive because she was a good nurse ? and then there was the fact she hated dev for hurting him . of course , that was also true . did that mean she questioned his sanity since he did n ' t go toe - to -toe with his wife ? god , what she must think of him now . as he allowed megan to clean his wounds , his thoughts returned to dev ' s earlier sucker punch . he grimaced about dev ' s reaction to the fact he was in love with a ghost . was that what stopped megan from believing his attraction to her ? was she deliberately hiding her ghost phobia behind the lie that he was still madly in love with his wife ? his feelings gave him pause when megan asked , ` ` are you hurt ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m fine . ' ' when she gave him a skeptical look , he replied , ` ` it ' s more the fact that i ' m angry than i am being hurt . ' ' ` ` ' what exactly was all that about ? ' ' she asked , as she applied some medication along his jawline . he winced when the medication touched the tender skin . ` ` my father was angry with me . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` no shit . ' ' she held the cotton ball up as she examined him closely . ` ` what i ' m wondering is what got him so fired up that he would storm into the house , call you out , and then hit you ? you were the oneperson on earth who would enjoy being in a fight . ' ' ` ` the reason is so simple , ' ' he murmured . ` ` enlighten me , ' ' she urged . ` ` he ' s a spoiled child who can ##n ' t get his way - he ' s lashed out at me because he thinks it ' s all my fault . ' ' ` ` i heard the name mia . was it something about a girl ? ' ' ` ` yes , that ' s why i called it cliche . ' ' he drew in a deep breath , filling megan in about what exactly had happened between him , dev , and mia . ` ` wow , ' ' she said , when he finished . ` ` i guess that is all you can say about the relationship . ' ' ` ` you were too kind to take care of her like you did - i mean , with both her abusive ex - husband and dev . ' ' he paused . ` ` what else was i supposed to do ? i cared for her , and i wanted to make her happy . ' ' at the pain that flashed in megan ' s eyes , he quickly added , ` ` there was no amorous relationship between us . i was not married at the time, and she desperately needed someone to be there for her . ' ' megan cupped his scarred cheek in her hand . ` ` you truly are the most amazing man i ' ve ever known . ' ' ` ` how do n ' you know all that , ' ' he whispered . ` ` you really are . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` no wonder women are so crazy about you . it ' s one thing for you to be so good - looking and a smart guy , but , when you add in the fact of how sweet , caring , and loving you are , it ' s like you ' re a real monster . ' ' she turned to throw the cotton ball into the trash can . his heartbeat grew louder and louder at her words as he sat unblinking and unmoving . part of him wanted to rail at her for not seeing him like all the other women did . if she only knew what others did , then she would want to date him , would ##n ' t she ? why could ##n ' t she see how good he could be for her ? when megan met his tense gaze , she jerked back and he reacted by grabbing the piece of gauze in her hand . she then tossed the soiled one in the trashand i have another one . ` ` so this mia girl , she ' s going off with a drummer , huh ? ' ' she asked , obviously trying to change the subject and change the mood in the room . ` ` not just any drummer . a famous one at that . ' ' ` ` band ? what band ? ' ' pesh ' s cocked his head as he was thinking . ` ` something big . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` ' a train ? ' ' he snapped his fingers . ` ` that ' s it . ' ' clapping her hand to her chest , megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` you mean someone who knows aj resendiz ? ' '
