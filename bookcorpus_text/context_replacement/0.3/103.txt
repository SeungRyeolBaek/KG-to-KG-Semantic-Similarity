with maya in his arms , pesh joined emma at the stove . ` ` something sure smells good . ' ' ` ` thank you . it ' s megan ' s favorite chicken casserole . and it ' s broccoli and cheese sandwiches , green beans , and fried chicken , all crispy on the inside , like megan likes it . ' ' the corners of her mouth turned up in a smile . ` ` i ' m sure it ' s good indian food . ' ' he chuckled . ` ` i would have been very surprised if it had been known how much you did n ' t eat it many years ago . ' ' patrick nodded in agreement . ` ` that ' s quite a meal you ' ve made for yourself . ' ' emma smiled . ` ` i was going to eat it . ' ' ` ` are you feeling all right ? ' ' pesh asked , motioning to her expanding belly . emma patted her belly gently before answering . ` ` i think i ' ve felt the best this morning out of all the others . you would think with a three and four - year - old , i would be tired all the time , but it ' s amazing how good i ' ve felt . ' ' patrick took abeaming broadly . ` ` ' ca n ' t tell you how happy i am to be having yet another child to carry on the family name . ' ' with a wink , he added , ` ` not to mention the fact he ' s been given two irish names . ' ' aidan and emma had found out the name of their third , and final child , the week before . they had settled on the name connor liam , which was a double combination of irish names . while emma ' s best friend , connor , was thrilled with the idea , he also wanted them to call the baby connor as well . in the end , it would be liam , joining the rest of the family in three and a half months . ` ` and is aidan still doing well ? ' ' pesh asked . emma opened her mouth to answer him , but aidan chose that moment to walk in the door . ` ` me and my wife to be non - pregnant are doing fine , ' ' he replied , with a smile . a week earlier he had gone on the laser for a visit . while caroline had been a surprise , liam had been . with emma turning thirty - one , they thought it best to help raise their children while they were still together . and while emma was pregnant and sheand no doubt about it , aidan thought it was the best way to get his medicine and have it take effect . ` ` daddy ! ' ' caroline squealed , as she came running around the corner . aidan ' s smile grew wider as he held his daughter in his arms . ` ` hi , pea . ' ' she kissed both of his cheeks before she started wiggling , slowing down . noah ran to him too , and he managed to hold his son a little tighter as aidan told him all about his day helping out with the kids . a cry from the living room snapped pesh ' s attention away from aidan and emma . megan was leaning over the pack to help , picking up sara . ` ` aw , what ' s wrong , maya ? ' ' she cooed , as she scooped sara into her arms . as megan rocked her back and forth , sara started laughing , which caused emma ' s face to light up as well . ` ` you must be freezing . ' ' ` ` i ' ll get their bottles , ' ' pesh said , ignoring the baby ' s loud laughter . ` ` thank you . ' ' as emma worked to get the children , along with caroline and aidan , around the dining room table , pesh hadand heating up the kitchen . once he had the water bottles fixed , he grabbed them and then went to the living room . megan was already seated with maya trying to entertain sara to stop crying her eyes . aidan handed the bottle to megan before sitting down himself . he ' d barely gotten the bottle to her mouth when maya started sucking greedily on the formula . when aidan reached to start putting the chicken casserole onto his plate , megan shot him a dirty look . with a sigh , aidan grabbed the plastic spoon . ` ` you gon ' teach grace even though it ' s in your head , pop ? ' ' ` ` oh yes , i am . it ' s good for all these kids to learn , ' ' he replied , nodding to noah and noah who sat between their parents , and then over to aidan . ` ` it should be up to pesh and megan whether it ' s said or done , ' ' aidan grumbled . pesh held up his free hand that was wasn ' t holding hers . ` ` it ' s okay . truly , i do don ' t mind . ' ' aidan mouthed ` ` shut up ' ' at him before leaving . pesh merely shook his head at aidan ' s antics . ` ` thengod ' s return thanks , ' ' he said . with maya still taking long pulls from her bottle , pesh bowed his head . as patrick recited the vows , pesh could n ' t help feeling so very blessed himself . three years ago , the living room would have been empty . most likely , he would have been eating something on the way home or ordering some chinese takeout . but today , he had a beautiful , loving woman by his side - one he fell a little more in love with each and every day . across from him , he had a son who looked young and healthy .
