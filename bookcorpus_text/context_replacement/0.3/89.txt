aidan shook his head and stood up . ` ` you need to be on your feet . you said yourself you were ain ' t feeling very well before we left . ' ' emma shot him a murderous look . ` ` sorry for saying that in front of pesh and megan . ' ' aidan gave them a sympathetic smile . ` ` sorry guys . i hope it ' doesn ' t ruin your whole day knowing that emma , at six months pregnant and no change , is n ' t feeling wonderful . ' ' megan laughed . pesh shook his head . ` ` emma , if you want to go on upstairs and lie down , we wo n ' t be hurt . i remember how good it feels being pregnant , ' ' megan said . ` ` no , i ' m fine . i want to rest , ' ' emma said . when aidan motioned for her to have a seat , she shook her head . ` ` i need to go to the bathroom . ' ' ` ` you want me to go check on him ? ' ' emma asked . ` ` i ' m sure he ' s fine . the boys would have texted me . i ' m just being overprotective . ' ' aidan gave her a quick kiss . ` ` thank you , em. ' ' she smiled at him . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' after she headed through the crowd to the kitchen , aidan began telling pesh some wild story from hell that had pesh doubled over with laughter . when emma finished , she did n ' t sit back down . instead , she rocked back and forth on her feet next to her husband . ` ` aidan , ' ' she said in a shaky voice . megan could couldn ' t help noticing how emma had calmed down since her trip to the bathroom just a few minutes ago . aidan held out his hand . ` ` one second , emma . i need to finish telling pesh this story . ' ' ` ` but my water broke . ' ' without taking his eyes off pesh , aidan slid his glass of water over to her . ` ` ' take mine . ' ' if the situation outside hadn ' t been dire , megan would have laughed at how nervous aidan looked . pesh leaned back in his chair . ` ` um , aidan , i think - ' ' he did n ' t get a chance to finish . instead , water splashed against the back of aidan ' s head . he jumped out of his chair , whirling around to emma . ` ` what the hell ,em ? ' ' ` ` my . heart . stop , ' ' she said through gritted teeth . ` ` ' shit , ' ' aidan muttered . after tossing his napkin down on the table , he held up his hand . ` ` em , it ' s okay . no need to worry . we ' re not that far from the hospital - ' ' ` ` ' ten minutes , ' ' emma interrupted . aidan ' s hands went to her shoulders . ` ` it ' ll be fine , em . i promise . ' ' emma let out a few frustrated breaths as she weighed his words . then her grim expression softened . ` ` okay . ' ' aidan grinned as he turned back to pesh and megan . ` ` i hate to cut and run , but it looks like your girl is a huge enough target and wants all the glory tonight . ' ' megan shot out of her seat . ` ` ` don ' t you worry about it a bit . since she ' s a month overdue , i ' m going to let her have this one without accusing her of trying to steal the baby . ' ' ` ` can we do anything ? ' ' pesh asked . when aidan shook his head , emma added , ` ` just make sure she is okay . '' angie rose out of her chair . ` ` i ' ll go check on him right now . ' ' emma smiled . ` ` okay . ' ' aidan fished around in his pocket . when he produced a set of keys , he tossed them at pesh . ` ` since he came after you , you and i are driving separate ways . whoever has him hurt will need our help to take him to the hospital tomorrow . ' ' pesh nodded . megan said , ` ` good thinking . i ' m not sure if mom is with him or becky . ' ' at emma ' s slightly apprehensive look that there probably wasn ' t a good plan in place for this , megan added , ` ` it ' ll be okay . i promise . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she said , a little relieved . slipping his arm around emma ' s waist , aidan said , ` ` come on , sweetheart . we need to dance . ' ' at the feel of pesh ' s hand on her back , megan smiled up at him . ` ` exciting night for them , eh ? ' ' ` ` yes , it was . ' ' ` ` how about letting me take you for another spin on the dance floor ? ' ' ` ` i ' d lovethat . ' ' as an indian love song rang out from the stage , megan wrapped her arms around pesh ' s neck . this time he did don ' t bother dancing around formally like he had in india . instead , he wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her flush against him . closing her eyes , she rested her head on his broad chest , feeling the steady beat of his heart beneath his shirt . when the song finished , they did n ' t dance . they just waited for the next song . unfortunately , it was another slow song . halfway through , she felt a tug on the hem of her dress .
