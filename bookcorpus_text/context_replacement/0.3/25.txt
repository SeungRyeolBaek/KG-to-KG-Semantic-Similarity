a red flush entered aidan ' s cheeks . ` ` um , well , i ' n ' t even mentioned it to her . ' ' ` ` you do n ' t think your wife needs to know about such a life - altering event ? ' ' ` ` well , of course i ' d tell her before i turn in for the night . ' ' as pesh crossed his arms over his chest , he could n ' t help wondering just how hard aidan had been hit upside the head . ` ` you better not seriously be sitting there like that . ' ' aidan stared at pesh for a moment before he spoke . ` ` oh man , i ' m being a selfish , selfish tool about this , now aren ' t i ? ' ' pesh smiled . ` ` pretty much . ' ' aidan rubbed his hand over his face . ` ` it ' s just . . . being a father is f * * king scary sometimes . i think about emma constantly , and now there ' s another baby in the making . plus , another baby means more time spent away from emma . ' ' he offered a weak smile . ` ` i miss her so much . sometimes . . . i just ' n ' t get enough of her , and i do n ' twant to know . ' ' ` ` i think that ' s a perfectly normal response . ' ' aidan shook his head . ` ` it makes me sound like a selfish man . i mean , who is jealous of their wife for having their son ' s baby ? ' ' ` ` a lot of men . so stop beating yourself up over what you ' re feeling . first of all , please don ' t screw this up . talk to emma . ' ' aidan ' s blue eyes widened as he shook his head slowly back and forth . ` ` oh hell no , i do n ' t want her thinking badly of me . ' ' ` ` she wo n ' t . emma just prefers honesty . ' ' ` ` ' and being jealous of her relationship with our son ? i ' m pretty sure she would not appreciate me being honest about that . ' ' ` ` what has emma ever said is the most important thing in a relationship ? ' ' ` ` trust . ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` so how are you building her trust by lying to her about your feelings ? ' ' aidan ' s blonde brows furrowed . ` ` maybe i should just tell her i ' m afraid of losing her and that i want her to enjoy our time together ? ' '` ` i would hope so . i just don ' t think any woman could get angry hearing her husband say how much he loves her and wants to be with her . ' ' aidan looked thoughtful . ` ` i guess you ' re right . ' ' pesh smiled as he patted aidan ' s shoulder reassuringly . ` ` you ' re doing a great job being a father . i ' m sure you ' ll do just as well with a second and maybe even a third child . ' ' at the mention of a third child , aidan swallowed hard , his adam ' s apple bobbing up and down . ` ` i ' n ' t mind a third child . . . just not now . maybe in a couple of years . ' ' aidan looked up and smiled at pesh . ` ` ' thanks for the vote of confidence in me being a father . ' ' ` ` i just say it like i see it . ' ' ` ` i like that . ' ' ` ` how about i sit on your head now ? ' ' aidan nodded . ` ` okay . ' ' pesh began feeling for unusual lumps and bumps on aidan ' s head . ` ` hmm , i do don ' t feel anything unusual . but just to be on the safe side, i want you to have a ct scan to rule out concussion or any brain damage . ' ' ` ` so , i could see all of that from just above my eyes ? ' ' ` ` you would be surprised . let me just call in the ambulance , and they ' ll come take you home . hopefully you wo ##l ' not taking too long to stay . we ' re usually slower during the afternoons when the doctors ' offices and imaging rooms are busy . ' ' as he started for the door , aidan stopped him . ` ` hey , man , with all the excitement , i almost forgot to ask how is megan doing with her placement ? ' ' pesh ' n ' t have to think twice before saying , ` ` she is going to be an amazing doctor . ' ' aidan grinned . ` ` i ' m glad to hear it . not that i ever doubted her before . it ' s just nice to hear her songs sung by a doctor . ' ' popping pesh on the chest teasingly with his elbow , aidan asked , ` ` how ' s it going with you and megan ? ' ' pesh almost laughed out loud at aidan ' s question . it was not in his nature to be so blunt , and after megan hadhim , yet again , he was wasn ' t really sure how to answer . ` ` i truly respect and admire megan . ' ' aidan thought that the most diplomatic way to answer her uncle ' s question . despite feeling guilty that he never really earned his friend ' s respect , he would n ' t say anything negative about megan in front of him . it was her choice who she likes or did . ' not like . ` ` that ' s not what i meant . ' ' ` ` i could n ' t say it was . ' ' aidan eyed him before saying , ` ` ` i know you got off to a rocky start , but it ' s not over . are you planning on asking her out ? ' ' ` ` you ' re not letting this go , are you ? ' '
