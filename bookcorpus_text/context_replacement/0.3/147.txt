` ` i ' ##n ' i think . . . i mean , maybe he was being a jerk , and it got blown out of proportion , you know ? ' ' ` ` i hope that ' s what it is , ' ' allison says , shaking her head slowly . ` ` who knows how stories like that can get started ? and once they ' re out there , you ca don ' t forget them . ' ' ` ` i hope that ' s what it is . . . i just don ' t want to erase some girl ' s , or man ' s , story , because it would be inconvenient for me , though , and painful for my mom . she would be so crushed if it were true . ' ' ` ` i would n ' t forget about it . and that girl said they were old stories , right ? ' ' ` ` right . ' ' ` ` and you said he treats your mom well , so i guess they ' re just old stories . ' ' ` ` yeah , right , ' ' i reply , pushing the memory of allison ' s recent conversation to the back of my brain . ` ` how ' s the place you ' re staying , in washington ? ' ' i ask , and she' s taking advantage of a grant at the local university to give summer interns a low - cost place to live in an otherwise expensive city . ` ` it ' s fine . my mom ' s kinda loud , though . how ' s your new place ? ' ' ` ` it ' s so big ! i do don ' t know why anyone would need that much space . i mean when my mom and i got there , there was enough for two people . well , two , including the maid . ' ' ` ` there ' s no maid ? ! ' ' ` ` there is . she does n ' t live there anymore . oh , and there ' s still this flagstone on it , so i thought it was old , but my mom said that nate had the house built about fifteen years ago . he must have spent a lot of money to make something that old and worn - out . ' ' ` ` you ' re kidding , ' ' allison says . ` ` i know . ' ' ` ` how ' s the jock ? i ' don ' t know if i could deal with a dumb jock . ' ' ` ` well , nate ' s not dumb . i ' ve been in a few classes with him , and he ' s really smart. he was even waitlisted for the lawn job . ' ' ` ` you ' re a little defensive of him , ' ' allison observes , sipping her coffee . ` ` yeah , i guess so . i ' n ' t know why not . he ' s always playing these stupid mind games with me . ' ' ` ` mind games ? ' ' she repeats , frowning . i move a fry around my plate as i think about how much to tell her . i have a feeling it ' s not the kind of situation she ' d like , but i still really want to talk to her about what ' s been going on . ` ` so , you know that i used to have a crush on him ? ' ' ` ` yeah , i remember you saying something about it last year . ' ' ` ` i . . . i still have a crush on him . or i think i do . . . i ' n ' t know . i ' m really attracted to him , and he ' s aware of the fact . he can be really charming , and then last year , he almost kissed me , and he . . . ' ' ` ` whoa , what ? i mean , brynn , he ' s your boyfriend . ' '` ` i know ! but only for the first few weeks , and - ' ' ` ` ok . . . but what if you did kiss ? what then ? you ' d have to see him every weekend , because your mom and his dad are there . and , even if you ' hadn ' t been together , what about thanksgiving ? you ' d be cutting the thanksgiving cake and sitting across from the guy you ' d go out with . . . for every thanksgiving . ' ' ` ` ugh , you ' re right , ' ' i say , dropping my head and covering my face with my hands . this is why i did didn ' t want to date allison - she ' d throw logic in the face of my feelings . but the truth is , she ' s right . i feel like a bucket of ice water has just been poured over my head . ` ` you ' re right , ' ' i say . ` ` i ca n ' t think i even let it get this far . ' ' i go back to the office after work and spend the rest of the afternoon locked in an awkward silence with constance . i try to get her to put in more shopping , but she only gives me one - word answers . later in the afternoon i find a joband greg , a tall , strawberry - blonde guy who smiles when i look him in the eye . he is exactly the kind of person i should be able to date . i just wish i felt that same rush that i do whenever i ' m around nate . i drive home right after school in the old audi that i had installed in the thornhill ' s garage . it ' s probably the most expensive car i ' ve ever driven , and it ' s fun to really let out the tires on the short stretch of the beltway on my way back to school . i park in the driveway and let myself in to the small bedroom off the kitchen , where i kick off my shoes . ` ` mom ? ' ' i call out , before spotting her out on the back lawn , talking on the phone as the sun sets behind her .
