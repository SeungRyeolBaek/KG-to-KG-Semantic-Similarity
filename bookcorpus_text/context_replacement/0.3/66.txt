kristi laughed . ` ` you know exactly what i mean . ' ' ` ` it is true that we know each other outside of the hospital , but when we ' re in the office , our relationship is strictly professional . ' ' ` ` i never said it was ' ' not . ' ' still gazing around the nearly empty parking lot , he shook his head . ` ` what you ' re referring to about me and megan ? nothing good can come of those kinds of rumors . ' ' patting his arm , kristi smiled . ` ` there are no rumors - just an observation by someone who knows and admires you . ' ' his eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` you do n ' t you ? ' ' ` ` of course not . i think megan ' s the perfect match for both you and her . ' ' he was silent for a few moments , considering her words . ` ` maybe you should call and check on her . ' ' ` ` i think that would be a very good idea . ' ' she pulled her phone out of her pocket and pointed to the honda they were parked in front of . ` ` well , this is it . ' ' ` ` have a good night , kristi . ' ' ` ` same toyou , dr . nadeen . and good luck . ' ' he smiled . ` ` thank you . i appreciate that . ' ' when he got to his car , he slid in and took his phone out . he searched through his contacts to find megan ' s number . as he waited , he impatiently tapped his fingers on the steering wheel . the call went to her voicemail , leaving him with a defeated feeling . although he knew it probably probably wasn ' t the best idea in the world , he decided to go to her house to check on her . the moment he heard her parents ' doorbell he immediately started making the house calls . one of her older brothers answered . ` ` hey , what ' s up ? ' ' he asked . ` ` hi . i ' m dr . nadeen . i live with megan . ' ' snapping his fingers , he looked at pesh . ` ` wait , i know you . ' ' ' are you noah ' s godfather ? ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` yes , i am . ' ' ` ` cool . listen guys , megan ' s here . if you go around the side of the house , she has her own door . ' ' ` ` i will . thank you again . ' ' ` `no way . ' ' when the door opened , pesh debated going back to his car . but he knew it would be even worse if her mother told her he had been there and that he had left without telling her . with a frustrated sigh , he stepped onto the porch . he followed the path behind the house to where it curved around the hill . at the front door , he knocked loudly . when the door swung open , megan stared at him in a mixture of both surprise and confusion . ` ` what are you doing here ? ' ' she demanded . pesh shoved his hands in his pockets . ` ` you called in sick again . i was worried . ' ' ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' he resisted the urge to explain that by her disheveled appearance and dark circles under her eyes , she most certainly # n ' t be fine . ` ` i tried calling you , but you did ##n ' t answer . kristi and i were worried about you . ' ' her face softened a little . ` ` i ' m sorry . i must ' ve forgotten to charge my phone . ' ' ` ` can i get you something to eat ? some soup maybe ? ' ' ` ` really , i ' m fine . ' ' ` ` butyou look really pale . will you let me do an ultrasound ? you know the flu - - ' ' ` ` i ' n ' t have the flu . ' ' ` ` how can you be sure if you still haven ' t been checked ? do you get the flu shot at the hospital ? sometimes it can give you a mild headache . ' ' she shook her head and smiled . ` ` i do don ' t have the flu . since you ' re going to go on and on , i ' m going to go ahead and tell you . i had some stomach cramps with my period . usually , i can manage them with birth control , but when i started clinicals and stopped working , i could couldn ' t afford the birth control without health insurance . and it ' n ' t like i was ha * * ng s * x anyway . ' ' while he appreciated her honesty , he was still quite mortified . ` ` oh , i see . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry to have embarrassed you , ' ' megan said . he waved his hand dismissively . ` ` listen , when you go to work tomorrow , there will be a prescription for you for birth control . i just don ' t like the idea of you having pain, but i do don ' t want this to happen next week . ' ' ` ` ' the prescription , ' ' she protested . mason shook his head . ` ` it can be discounted at the local pharmacy . ' ' ` ` thank you , pesh . that ' s a very kind thing for you to do . ' ' a blonde woman appeared around megan . ` ` hi esh . you okay ? ' ' she winked at mason . ` ` i came to check on your girl . ' ' mason tilted his chin to look up at megan . ` ` her tummy hurts . she can eat . ' ##w ? ' ' ` ` um , yeah . . . ' ' he wanted nothing more than to spend time with her , and in the same way , with megan as well .
