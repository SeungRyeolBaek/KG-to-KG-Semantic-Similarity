he loved aidan and emma ' s company , and he also loved being with emma , even though they were six months apart . she grabbed him and his book bag and then made her way up the front walk . emma answered the door with noah on her hip . ` ` hey , i ' m so glad you could make it . ' ' megan said . ` ` you should know by now i have no family except for mason and emma . ' ' ` ` i feel the same way sometimes , ' ' emma said , as megan walked through the door . as she walked through the kitchen and down the hall to the den , noah struggled to get up . when she got him on his feet , she ran into the living room . that ' s where aidan was sitting on the couch with mason on the floor next to him . ` ` noah ! ' ' she exclaimed . he ran over to hug the computer monitor . megan never had to worry about aidan and mason ; emma was always a gentle giant when it came to infants and children . noah thumped his tail excitedly at the television . aidan looked up from the tv and smiled . ` ` hey , how are you ? ' ' she grinned as she reached down to pet his cheek . ` ` ' thanks .and you ? ' ' ` ` yep . looking forward to having a man ' s fun with the boys . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` yeah , with two kids under two , let ' s see how much fun you ' ll have . ' ' aidan shrugged . ` ` it ' s good practice for me when the next baby gets here . ' ' ` ` ' or babies ? ' ' she asked . with his eyes wide , he quickly added , ` ` baby singular . that is confirmed , thank you . ' ' shaking her head , she teasingly asked , ` ` and when is the ultrasound to determine the age your daughter is on her birthday ? ' ' aidan asked exasperatedly . ` ` not for a few more months , smart - ass . ' ' she put her hand to her chest in mock outrage . ` ` it was just a question . ' ' ` ` ' and since you ' ve had a baby yourself , i ' m sure you know only too well exactly what exactly the next ultrasound is . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i just think it ' s cool that i ' ll be the oldest son , and she ' ll be the youngest . ' ' with a pained expression , aidan groaned , ` ` oh . ' ' she laughed##ffled his still unkempt bed ##ding again . ` ` relax , mason . you ' re going to be an amazing father to that little girl . she ' ll undoubtedly have you wrapped around her finger before she ' s even out of the womb . ' ' ` ` a man like me , or i guess i should say , a man like you used to be , does not hesitate to bring his child into the world . ' ' ` ` life is a bitch , ' ' she mused . ` ` do don ' t i know it , ' ' he agreed . emma came into the living room first . she handed mason to aidan along with the baby . ` ` you sure you ' ll be all right mason ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll be fine - we ' ll be fine . wo n ' ll we promise ? ' ' mason stood up from pacing around the room over aidan ' s shoulder . ` ` yes ! ' ' ` ` see . stop worrying . ' ' he gave emma a very serious look before adding , ` ` a promise is a promise after all . ' ' she flushed a little at his comment , but she gave him a shy smile . when he winked back at her , megan could couldn ' t help feeling her chest tighten atthe truth . seeing her former man - whore husband as a loving , loving husband and father was still very frightening . but deep down , that was how much she truly wanted what aidan and emma had . love , companionship , and closeness to you . having someone else to parent with you . if you ' weren ' t so scared you could finally have something just like aidan and emma have with pesh ! but first , you have to keep believing that you ' re too afraid to get married . you ' re not taking your happiness with both men away because you ' re afraid . emma shook her out of her self - destructive thoughts . ` ` ' what should we do now ? ' ' she asked , as they walked into the garage . ` ` fingers and toes ? ' ' megan nodded . ` ` mmm , that sounds good . ' ' they both slid into emma ' s suv . as megan buckled up , emma turned to her . ` ` i hope you do don ' t mind that casey is joining us for lunch ? ' ' ` ` of course not . the more the merrier . besides , casey is a hoot . ' ' emma smiled and started up the suv . ` ` that she is . ' ' before long , they' going into starbucks to grab some coffee for megan and tea for emma . ' they walked around the corner to the hair salon . after relaxing manicures and pedicures , they drove about twenty minutes to meet casey at their favorite little local diner that was set around an old train station . as they pulled up , they saw casey standing out on the street texting . ` ` hey girl ! ' ' emma called . casey waved to them before sliding off the stool . ` ` oh , hi . ' ' a round of hugs was exchanged between the three girls .
