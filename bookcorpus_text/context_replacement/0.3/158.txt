` ` your mom seems really happy , ' ' allison observes as we sit . i watch her for a moment , in between bites , so happy and animated . ` ` i think she is . and she ' s just really good at cocktail - time stuff , too . like nate , but she says it does n ' t come to him often . ' ' ` ` brynn . . . ' ' allison begins , raising an eyebrow at me . ` ` no , i mean , i ' m just , you know . . . ' ' i say , trailing off . definitely not the time to tell allison that nate and i met , and i do don ' t know if that day will ever come . i love allison , but dressing in shades of grey is not her strong suit . ` ` thought you two could use some drinks . ' ' i look up to see greg , the young man with the strawberry - blonde hair , sitting next to us , three shot glasses carefully balanced on his long fingers . ` ` greg , hi ! i ' m so glad you could make it . ' ' i take the seat next to us and help him place down the glasses so that they do ##n ' t spill their contents . ` ` greg , this is my friend allison. we went to college together . ' ' ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' allison says . ` ` you too . hope these drinks are okay with you . i forget what the bartender calls them . . . ' ' ` ` freedom drink , ' ' i say , rolling my eyes . ` ` the taste varies , but they ' re really good . ' ' ` ` so where are you from now , greg ? ' ' allison asks . ` ` washington , but i plan to move to dc when i graduate . ' ' i tune out , as allison and greg walk across campus . i ' ve just seen nate moving between groups of people , seeming to make things easier . i look around to see if there ' s a girl with him , but i still don ' t see her . this might be the first time i ' ve seen him without a date at any kind of party . the thought that it could be because of me comes to my mind , but i quickly dismiss it . i ca n ' t let myself think like that . nate does ##n ' t want that kind of relationship with me , not even if i am wasn ' t his stepsister . i bet his date just had a date last - minute or something . ` ` iwelcome back , ' ' allison says . ` ` i need to take a quick shower ! ' ' my attention shifts back to greg as she stands and stretches . he touches his chest and clears his throat . i watch as a flush sneaks onto his freckle - colored cheeks . ` ` you look . . . um , that ' s a nice compliment , ' ' he finally says . ` ` thanks . ' ' i smile , trying not to linger on the subject , ` ` so , you think you ' ll want to be in politics when school ends ? ' ' ` ` yeah , in politics , ' ' he says with a smile . ` ` but i ' m thinking that one ' n ' t going to exist without the other . i guess i need to work on the whole . . . you know . . . ' ' he waves his hand vaguely . ` ` the babies thing ? ' ' ` ` exactly , ' ' he says . ` ` so , ah , i was wondering . . . ' ' my attention drifts from him again as i hear my mom and pierce talking urgently at the door . my mom covers her mouth with her hands and pierce turns back to the party , his frown turning into a smile as if by magic . ` `i ' m so sorry , greg , could you excuse me ? i think my mother might need help . ' ' ` ` oh , sure , ' ' he replies kindly as i head toward the door into the study . my mind races through the possible scenarios as i hurry through the study and up the stairs . as i take the last set of stairs up to the master suite on the third floor , i realize it must be my father . the last time i saw my mother look that upset , it was because my father was back in town and asking her for money . i knock softly on the closed double door of their bedroom . ` ` mom ? ' ' i ask quietly as i let myself in . ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' i gasp as i walk in . she ' s curled up on top of the bedspread , like a rag doll . ` ` it ' s pierce , ' ' she says without moving . ` ` his lawyer just called him . a woman has come forward accusing him of sexual harassment . it ' ll be on the news soon . ' ' chapter thirteen ` ` oh no , ' ' i whisper , sitting next to her on the bed . ` ` i ' m so sorry , mom . ' ' ` ` is it. . . is it you ? ' ' she asks , shaking her head as a tear drops down her cheek . ` ` what ? what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` maybe it ' s me . . . maybe it ' s my fault . it ' s like i ' m a curse . ' ' ` ` no , no , no , ' ' i whisper , leaning forward and brushing her hair out of her eyes . ` ` this shit ain ' t happening because of you . i mean , when did this all go on ? the , you know , the . . . ' ' i pause , unable to say those two ugly words : the attraction .
