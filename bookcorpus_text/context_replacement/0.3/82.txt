and before you can make it sound any seedier , it is ain ' t against the hospital rules to date each other . besides , we knew each other right before i started working at wellstar . ' ' ` ` is that right ? ' ' dev nodded . ` ` yes , it is . ' ' a slow smile slunk across his face . ` ` i like you , ' ' he said to megan . ` ` you have an odd way of showing it . ' ' charlie chuckled at the end of the table . ` ` my , my , alpesh , ` n ' t you picked a feisty one ? ' ' pesh glanced at megan , who had lost the # ##ness of her cheeks . she gave charlie a small smile . ` ` i apologize . ' ' with a wink , charlie replied , ` ` you do don ' t . it ' s been rather nice to see you get dev into his well - deserved place . i bet you punched him , too . ' ' when his mother gasped in horror , megan reached under the table for pesh ' s hand . she squeezed it gently as she ducked her head . ` ` um , yes , i ' m sorry to say that i did . ' ' ` ` in megan 'in defense , i totally lost it . i called alpesh and said some really stupid things . ' ' ` ` dev ! ' ' lavani cried . in typical dev fashion , he rolled his eyes at his brother ' s antics . ` ` we ' re fine now . everyone calm down . ' ' he met pesh ' s gaze . ` ` i ' m happy for you , son . you ' ve made a good choice . ' ' dev cut his eyes over to megan . ` ` i think you both will be very happy together . ' ' pesh was taken aback by the sincerity in both dev ' s words and his actions . ` ` thank you . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` yes , thank you . ' ' dev leaned back in his chair , clasping his hands behind his head . ` ` and now to ensure that my news stops the chaos brought on by the two of you , i ' d like to announce that i ' m getting married next month - ' ' lavani once again gasped in horror . ' dev ' isn ' t finished . ` ` and i ' m going to be a father . ' ' pesh ' s mouth dropped open as the table erupted into utter pandemonium . he wondered if his motherwas about to find out . turning to megan , he found her with her napkin to her mouth . from the way her lips were moving up and down , he could tell she was laughing . he leaned down to whisper in her ear . ` ` guess we ' re off the hook , huh ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` yeah , i guess we ' re good . ' ' ` ` i love you . ' ' ` ` i love you too . ' ' chapter twenty now that he and megan were an official couple and had pronounced the ` ` l ' ' word , pesh no longer took time off where he had to decide how to spend the time . he wanted to spend every waking moment with her and with mason , and she always made sure that they had time together . today found him at patrick ' s house , sitting on the couch with some of megan ' s other family members . just like with his parents , the women were all stationed in the kitchen , putting the finishing touches on sunday lunch . as soon as becky came into the living room and announced it was time to sit down , there was a rush to the dining room . he trailed along behind the others , searching for megan who he felt like was his alone in the world . ` `where ' s aidan and emma ? they ' re running late , ' ' angie asked , as she placed a large platter on the table . liz nodded . ` ` they ' ' ' they called . we could go ahead and tell them , and then they can start when they get here . ' ' liz pulled out a chair . ` ` great . i ' m starving . ' ' becky rolled her eyes . ` ` you ' re all starving . between you and me , we ' re going to get eaten out of here and home . ' ' pesh sat back as the others began taking their seats around the large round table . regardless of how nice the montgomery ' s had been , he still could couldn ' t help feeling like an outsider . megan walked in with a plate of food . after she deposited it on the table , her eyes searched the room for him . when she spotted him , she gave him the smile that always warmed his heart , pointing her finger at him . as he moved to join her , aidan came running in . ` ` get up , esh , ' ' he urged , holding his hands up . pesh grinned as he walked over to help him up . ` ` are you okay ? ' ' pesh asked . ` `uh , huh . ' ' ` ` are you going to sit with me , pesh ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` esh , ' ' he replied . ` ` is that okay with you ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` we ' ll be fine . ' ' she motioned for him to have a seat . just as they sat down , aidan appeared in the doorway of the living room with noah in his arms . ` ` sorry we ' re late . ' ' ` ` where ' s emma ? ' ' megan asked , as she took noah from aidan . with a frown , aidan replied , ` ` she ' s ' not feeling well .
