` ` several years ago , ' ' she says . ` ` long before i ever met you , ' ' i point out . ` ` so , what ? this girl ' s been on tv ? ' ' my mom nods . ` ` one of those news shows is doing a piece on sexual harassment and rape , and she ' s going to be interviewed . ' ' ` ` what are you going to do ? ' ' ` ` well , we ' ll have to batten down the house . we ' ll probably have to stay in the house for a few days , but ... tomorrow ' s saturday night . ' ' ` ` no , that ' s not what i meant . i mean , if pierce was just a - ' ' ` ` i ' don ' t want to think about it . ' ' ` ` no , you have to , ' ' i say . she ' s always been about the constant in our relationship . i ' m tired of the dynamic , and i do don ' t know how to break the tension without our entire relationship falling apart . ` ` if she did that , then maybe you need to - ' ' ` ` do don ' t say that . you and i are good together . that ' s not the problem . and iif he did do it , i ' m sure it was a momentary weakness . it was just something that happened a long time ago , and he ' s fine . ' ' i shrug , feeling helpless . ` ` i want that to be true , baby , i really do . not for his sake , but for yours . i did hear a rumor at work , though , ' ' i say quietly . ` ` what do you mean ? what kind of rumor ? ' ' ` ` that . . . he has a certain reputation . ' ' ` ` why did n ' t you tell me ? ' ' i want to tell her that it ' s because she ' s so fragile , but instead i just say , ` ` because it was just a rumor that i heard from another woman . i had no way of knowing if it was true . ' ' ` ` well , until there ' s more evidence or something , i ' m going to believe it . she said she knew a woman at work who was denied a job she wanted , and that she ' s running a fashion line , and thought she might as well put her experience to good use and drum up some money . ' ' ` ` i guess that could be true , ' ' i say withoutconviction . my mom nods . ` ` i guess i just need to be alone for a while . do you think you could go back to the party , and sort of act like the hostess for me ? you know , make sure everyone ' s having a good time and all that ? just say i have a key if anyone asks for me . ' ' ` ` um , alright , ' ' i reply , not knowing what else to say . ` ` okay , honey , ' ' my mom says , settling back onto the bed . i stand and head for the door . ` ` i ' ca n ' t believe it , ' ' i hear her say as i close the bedroom door behind me . i wish i ca n ' t believe it either , but there ' s a sick knot in the pit of my stomach that ' s telling me i do . i head back down to the party , taking the stairs slowly . i ' d rather be doing pretty much anything else right now than plastering a smile on my face and pretending everything ' s okay . but i know my mom ' s right - it will look suspicious if any of us disappear during the party . i reemerge out front and take a deep breath as i walk back over to greg and allison. ` ` sorry about that . my mom has a headache , i just wanted to check on her , ' ' i say dutifully . greg and allison nod sympathetically . i eat the rest of my food quickly , and with only one ear to their conversation , am finished up with my drink . i excuse myself and begin to mingle , trying to smile and play the part of the hostess like my mom did . i watch the dim light outside ; willing the sun to set as fast as possible so that this party can finally be over . the young event organizer i met earlier is suddenly at my side and i force a smile at a friend ' s comment . ` ` have you seen mrs . thornhill ? ' ' it still hurts me to hear my mom referred to like that . ` ` she ' s not feeling well . can i help you with something ? ' ' ` ` would you like the candles to be lit now , or should we wait ? ' ' i look around at the dimming light . ` ` that would be great , honey . ' ' she hurries away and i see nate across the room , frowning at me . i lower my eyes quickly . if his dad still hasn ' t told him what ' sgoing on yet , i ' n ' t want the task to fall on me . i see him make his way over , and excuse myself from my current conversation to disappear into a large group of people around the bonfire . just an hour or so and the party will be done , and everyone will celebrate . the girls work throughout the evening , lighting candles on the tables and the large lanterns hanging from the trees . i take a moment to admire the scene : the beautiful white house , the well - dressed crowd , the sounds of the conversation .
