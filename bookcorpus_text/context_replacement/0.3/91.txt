` ` uh , oh , i should n ' not have said that , ' ' megan mumbled under her breath . ` ` my dad ? ' ' ` ` he ' s at the house with mommy . we ' ll meet you there in the morning , ' ' she said . that statement caused noah ' s lip to quiver . before he could start crying , pesh rose out of his chair . ` ` let ' s go look at all the new wedding dresses . ' ' megan smiled as she watched pesh show noah around the room . her heart melted at his enthusiasm . she could n ' t believe there was ever a time when she fought her feelings for him . he was couldn ' t a better man in the whole world , and the fact that he loved her was a small miracle . by the time pesh finished , noah had fallen asleep . he quickly sat back down beside her . ` ` here , ' ' she said , taking off her glittering dress . she draped the fabric over him like a blanket . ` ` did i mention how much i love you in that dress ? ' ' pesh asked , with a wicked gleam in his eye . she glanced down to see the dress had her breasts spilling out the front as well . the facther belly was already full . ` ` i ' ll have to wear it more often for you . ' ' ` ` i would like that . ' ' when her phone rang , she reached across the table and grabbed it . ` ` oh my god ! ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` that was aidan . the baby is already here . ' ' ` ` ` it ' s our first baby , it ' isn ' t too late . ' ' ` ` i have to tell my mom and dad . ' ' julia nodded . ` ` go on . we ' re ready . ' ' megan looked at emma sleeping soundly against pesh ' s chest . ` ` be right back . ' ' she made her way over to her family ' s table . ` ` that was aidan . he was just here . ' ' a whoop went up from the table . ` ` is emma okay ? ' ' becky asked . megan nodded . ` ` ' and emma and baby are doing great . ' ' julia shook her head and smiled . ` ` aidan with the baby - now that ' s going to be something to see . ' ' they all laughed . ` ` that ' s so sweet , ' ' megan said . becky .join the group . ` ` i do ' ' do we go with them ? i mean , the hospital is n ' not too far from here . ' ' angie nodded . ` ` sounds good to me . i ' d personally like to see aidan in bed with his baby girl . ' ' with a snort , megan added , ` ` i would have liked to have been in the delivery room when she was first born . his expression alone would have been priceless . ' ' ` ` i bet he cried , ' ' liz said . ` ` oh yeah , he cried for hours , ' ' angie replied , with a laugh . as her sisters started gathering up their things and telling their husbands where they were going , megan said , ` ` i want to go home . ' ' before they could argue , she held up her hand . ` ` it ' s okay . the ultrasound is pretty soon over , and it ' s no more a week at one of pesh ' s relatives ' house . besides , i want to see the newest born baby girl . ' ' her mother frowned . ` ` are you sure ? ' ' ` ` i ' m positive . ' ' ` ` all right . go with pesh , and we ' ll meet you atfront . ' ' she smiled as she went back to their table . ` ` my uncle and aunts are going to the hospital to see aidan and emma . ' ' ` ` you want to come ? ' ' her heart melted at the fact that he already knew what she was thinking . ` ` do you mind ? ' ' he shook his head . ` ` of course not . can i go too ? is this just a little party thing for the kids ? ' ' she smiled . ` ` no , you can come . ' ' pesh looked over at noah . ` ` he ' s going to want to see his parents . ' ' ` ` ` yeah . i do n ' er wish we could go without him . ' ' as pesh slid out of the booth , noah stirred and helped n ' er stand up . ` ` take aidan and emma ' s keys out of my pocket . ' ' she smiled and reached into his pants . when she lightly touched his cock through the fabric , he groaned . ` ` sorry about that , ' ' she replied , as she pulled out the keys . ` ` no problem , ' ' he said through gritted teeth . they said a quick goodnight to pesh ' s parents and other relatives who remained . then they walkedback to the hotel . after giving the driver aidan ' s address , they waited for the suv to be brought around . when she saw her reflection in the glass doors of the suv , she gasped . ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' pesh inquired . ` ` the necklace ! i ' won ' t go running off with this stupid necklace to the police ! ' ' she exclaimed . she snatched up the earrings and then began working on the necklace . ` ` i ' ll just go give it to your mother . ' ' ` ` if you want , ' ' pesh said . she kicked off her shoes so she could work again . the necklace and earrings slid down her hands .
