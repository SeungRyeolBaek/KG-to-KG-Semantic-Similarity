` ` ` be ready to be on your toes today . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` sure , sounds good . ' ' as they started working their way through patients , things began to turn into uncomfortable situations for megan . kristi seemed to be having the same feeling since the tops of her cheeks had a trail of tears forming on them . the moment they finished with one patient and left the room , another patient was there to fill it . megan stood behind kristi as she went to stick her head in to the reception desk . ` ` hey janet , could you not call anyone else back ? we ' re getting late . ' ' janet shook her head . ` ` it ' s just so crazy out in the waiting room . like we ' re all drowning . ' ' kristi rolled her eyes . ` ` fabulous . it ' s probably the full moon , which makes things absolutely insane . ' ' she turned back to megan . ` ` listen , since we ' re all here , can you take the lead on plan b ? ' ' megan could n ' t stop her eyes from widening . ` ` really ? on my toes ? ' ' kristi smiled , taking megan ' s hand . ` ` '' ve seen you in just the last week . i have faith in you . ' ' ` ` okay , if you ' re sure . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help her smile . ` ` thank you . ' ' taking her ipad , she flipped open the registration details of the patient before her . when she pushed open the door , she eyed the man on the exam table . ` ` good evening dr . robertson , i ' m megan . what - ' ' before she could even get to the question ` ` what seems to be the matter ? ' ' immediately , the man started shaking his head furiously . ` ` no , megan . i wo ##n ' t let you examine me . i want a doctor . a male doctor . you understand ? ' ' ` ` yes , i understand , but you have to follow protocol , which is to address your issues before the doctor comes in . i see from the chart that you ' re experiencing some minor issues ? ' ' he refused to meet her eye . instead , he stared blankly at the wall , holding up one finger to her . ` ` i meant what i said . i want to see a male doctor . ' ' ` ` yes , but we ' rei backed up this request . i ' m not sure how long it will be before you are able to see a doctor , least of all a male doctor . ' ' when it appeared the man ' s resolve was weakening a bit , megan took a tentative step forward . ` ` now , if you would , let me take a look at your stomach . ' ' ` ` it is ain ' t my stomach , ' ' he said . ` ` then what is it ? ' ' when he continued n ' t respond , she sighed with relief . ` ` mr . stone , you should never experience physical pain . it can arise from many causes and have many repercussions . ' ' he shifted uncomfortably on the bed . just when she thought she was making headway with him , he threw his head back and began screaming at the top of his lungs . ` ` get me a male doctor ! ' ' megan rolled her eyes . the last time she had the chance to see a patient on her own , and he had to be a stark raving lunatic . refusing to give into him or accept him , she walked over to him . she was going to kick his sexist ass if it was the last thing she did . ` ` stop screaming , and i ' ll" now , ' ' she warned , ripping the sheet off him . his voice cut off to a shriek as he reached for the phone , but the damage was done . she had done more than enough . ` ` oh . my . god , ' ' she whispered . she stared wide - eyed and open - mouthed at what had to be the first child born to go along with the warning labels on condoms and cialis for four - hour periods . ` ` that ' s going to have to be done . ' ' ` ` excuse me ? ' ' he asked . she shook her head at him . ` ` the excess fluid in your penis ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` it ' s not just going to drain out on its own . it has to be removed , which means bleeding out . ' ' dr . robertson swallowed hard . ` ` like with a needle ? ' ' ` ` no , with a very large needle . ' ' when he started to protest , she held her hand up . ` ` lucky for you , you can only refuse the procedure - it has to be done carefully by a doctor . ' ' ` ` a doctor ? ' ' ` ` if it came to your penis bleeding from the pressure , then fora good question , would you really be that stupid ? ' ' his blue eyes widened in surprise . ` ` yes , i think so . i ' ll be back . ' ' when she whirled out of the room , she ran smack into the last person she wanted to have to deal with at the moment . ` ` i ' m so sorry . are you all right ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' he smiled down at her . ` ` doing your medical evaluations on your own ? that ' s wonderful . ' ' ` ` um , well , yes and no . ' ' his brows furrowed in concern .
