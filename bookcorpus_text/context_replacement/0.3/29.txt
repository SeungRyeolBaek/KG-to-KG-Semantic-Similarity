when pesh finished , he dropped the empty bottle into the biohazard bin and then glanced up at mr . robertson . ` ` if the swelling has n ' t begun to fade in the last ten to fifteen minutes , we ' re going to have to take another course of action . ' ' ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' mr . robertson questioned , with a grimace . ` ` ' the penis of the patient . ' ' mr . robertson brightened considerably . ` ` ' yes , she mentioned that . ' ' he said the word she like megan was a swarm of bees . pesh turned to smile at megan . ` ` then she made a phone call . ' ' he then eyed his pager that was turned off . ` ` keep an eye on him . i ' ll be back in fifteen . ' ' ` ` yes , i will . ' ' time ticked by agonizingly slow as she worked on him and kept an eye on mr . robertson . every few minutes , he kept lifting up the sheet to eye his erection . each time he grimaced , megan saw that the shot was n ' t gone and the swelling had n ' t gone down . when pesh left the room again , he wasfrom her to mr . mckenzie . ` ` so how are we doing ? ' ' she shook her head . ` ` things change . ' ' ` ` i see . ' ' she walked over to a cabinet and searched through it , producing a very large syringe with a very thick needle . ` ` i ' m sorry , mr . robertson , but it looks like this is our only choice . ' ' mr . robertson seemed speechless for the second time that day . ` ` mr . mckenzie , can i get you to assist me ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` of course . ' ' ` ` i need you to physically lift him . i want him to be as strong as possible . ' ' megan resisted the urge to roll her eyes at his request . mr . robertson had to lift her by a hundred pounds , not to mention that when you got your blood pumping , you got even stronger . but she did as she was told . when pesh brought the needle to mr . robertson ' s penis , she gripped her fingers tight into his skin . when the needle pierced the skin , it took everything in her to keep him on the table . clenching her fists , she held her breath . finally , when the last of the blood had gonewithdrawn , she was able to loosen her grip . pesh tossed the pills into the biohazard container and then walked away . ` ` i advise you take some pills for both the pain and for the anti - inflammatory benefits . i would also recommend a round or two of using an ice pack on your crotch . it would be my strongest recommendation that you not take any sexual dysfunction medication until you really need it . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' mr . robertson croaked , collapsing back onto the table . ` ` give him about thirty minutes , and then he needs to go back inside . we ' ll need the exam tomorrow , ' ' pesh instructed . ` ` okay , i will . ' ' he gave her a reassuring smile before leaving the room . after thirty minutes , she saw mr . robertson to the back of the er . as he walked into the waiting room , she shook her head . ` ` megan , ' ' kristi said . ` ` yes ? ' ' ` ` go ahead and take your dinner right now . ' ' ` ` are you sure ? i mean , we can get on it since we ' re so close . ' ' kristi shook her head . ` ` we ' re close . ', you ' re going to need all your strength . things are just going to get even crazier when the sun goes down . ' ' megan tried not to appear horrified at the prospect . instead , she went into the living room to grab her purse . when she came out , pesh was waiting for her . ` ` where are you going ? ' ' ` ` oh , it ' s my dinner date . ' ' pesh gave an amused chuckle . ` ` how fortunate . it ' s mine as well . ' ' unsure what he was implying , she slowly shook her head back and forth . ` ` ' dates . ' ' still crossing his arms over his chest , pesh asked , ` ` and how would it be a date if we happened to come to the cafeteria at the same time and sit at the same table ? ' ' ` ` you ' re losing it , and you know it . ' ' ` ` after what we both just shared , how can you deny me the pleasure of buying your dinner ? ' ' a teasing light flashed in his dark eyes - one she ' n ' t used to seeing from him . for some reason , she found it completely irresistible . ` ` besides , how can i not have romance on my mind when ii have another man ' s life in my hands ? ' ' her eyes widened in surprise at his words . ` ` d - did you really just say that ? ' ' ` ` yes , i believe i did . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` i ' don ' t believe you did . ' ' ` ` do don ' t try to judge me on one side or the other . just take me as i am , ' ' pesh suggested . ` ` i ' ll try . ' ' as they walked to the elevator , megan bit her lip with apprehension . turning to pesh she asked , ` ` what will they think if they see the two of us together ? ' '
