` ` do not talk that way about megan ever again . do you understand me ? ' ' ` ` and do you really believe that she thinks you ' re worth throwing her career away for ? ' ' pesh closed the distance between them . looming over kara , his entire body shuddered in anger . ` ` listen to me when i say that if you threaten to hurt megan one more time , i will make life a living hell for you . as the supervising physician over the case , i will have you shipped off to some hellhole far from here . ' ' he glared down at her . ` ` do you understand me ? ' ' she slowly shook her head as the realization that there was something between them finally dawned on her . ` ` if you ' ll excuse me , i need to go to my own room . ' ' as she hurried past him , pesh breathed a sigh of relief . he never used that tone of voice with women , or men for that matter , unless he was absolutely forced to do so . but kara ' s strange behavior and the way she ' d acted today had forced him to admit what he was wasn ' t . at the feel of a hand on his back , he whirled around . megan gave him a beaming smile . ` ` mynever ! ' ' he laughed at her tone and words . ` ` you ' n ' i need to worry about her harassing you or anyone for that long . i took care of it . ' ' ` ` i told you . ' ' he grimaced . ` ` you did ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` it was wonderful . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad you think so . ' ' ` ` i ' ve never had a woman stand up for me like that before . ' ' pesh shook his head . ` ` that ' s a shame . ' ' ` ` if we were n ' t in the middle of the world ' s mess , i ' d ask you to show my appreciation . ' ' she smiled . ` ` i ' ll gladly take a rain check . ' ' ` ` ' you will ? that ' s good to know . ' ' lowering his voice , he said , ` ` i ' ll want that kiss later tonight when we ' re alone . and i do don ' t just want it on the lips . ' ' his eyebrows rose . ` ` i want it on all places on my body . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i think that can be arranged . ' ' ` ` i ' ll be waiting forto you . ' ' ` ` dr . nadeen ? ' ' a voice called from the end of the hall . ` ` yes ? ' ' ` ` you ' re needed in rxam room five . ' ' ` ` as soon as i finish this last consultation , i ' ll be there , ' ' he lied . at his blatant lie , megan covered her mouth to stop her laughter . ` ` i have to go . but can you come over tonight ? ' ' ` ` yep . let me get you fed and bathed , and then i ' m yours . ' ' ` ` see you then . ' ' he winked at her before he turned and walked down the hall . a few minutes later pesh found himself speeding along the quiet streets of megan ' s hometown . his phone dinged once again . slowing down , he took a moment to make sure it was wasn ' t the police . he ' wasn ' t too surprised to see it was another text from megan . he could tell from the way she had been frantically texting him that afternoon and evening that she was nervous , which was very surprising to him . she was so confident and confident that it was hard for him to imagine her ever feeling nervous . but he supposed that was megan 's . she had no cause to be nervous . tonight he was introducing her to his family . after he picked her up , they were going to his sister , shveta ' s , house for dinner . his parents , along with at least one of his brothers , would be there . although he had spent a lot of time with her family , it had n ' t exactly meant the same thing as her spending time with his . he did ##n ' t know if her nerves stemmed from simply meeting his family or if they stemmed from the realization of how far their relationship had progressed in the last few days . he turned into the driveway at just after seven . he didn ##n ' t even walk up the front porch steps before the door flew open , and megan stepped out . her slender feet swayed a little on the black high heels she was sporting . she wore black jeans , and a dressy black top that had a lot of beading . it reminded him of the kurta , a dress that women from his past wore . he wondered if she had chosen it for that reason . ` ` you look beautiful , ' ' pesh said , leaning in to kiss her cheek . when she did don ' t respond to his touch , he smiled down at her .` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' rolling her eyes , she snapped . ` ` duh , i ' m just nervous . ' ' ` ` you ' re not that worried about my family ' s treatment of you ? ' ' she held up her hands . ` ` of course , i am . your family is very important to you . i do don ' t want . . . ' ' she tore her eyes from his . ` ` you do don ' t want what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` i do n ' t want to lose them to you . ' '
