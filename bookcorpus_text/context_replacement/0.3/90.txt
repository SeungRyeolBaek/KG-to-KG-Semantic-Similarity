glancing down , she saw georgie staring up at her . ` ` what are you doing , daddy ? ' ' she asked . he looked left and right before he answered . ` ` mommy told me not to tell anybody , but she needs you to come up to her old room . ' ' ` ` okay . what for ? ' ' ` ` he ' s going crazy , aunt emma , and she thinks you ' re the only one that might be able to get him to calm down . ' ' ` ` ah , i see . ' ' when she turned back to pesh , he smiled . ` ` you ' t ' me even have to ask . go see if you can help . ' ' she leaned over and gave him a smacking kiss on the cheek . ` ` thank you for being so supportive each and every second of the night . ' ' his lips brushed against her cheek . ` ` you ' re welcome , my love . ' ' ` ` be back as soon as i can . ' ' ` ` i ' m going to hold you to that . ' ' taking georgie ' s hand , she made her way off the dance floor and out of the room . after getting on one of the elevators , they descended to the ground floor . she and georgielead the way . she stopped halfway down the hall and knocked on the door . by then , she ' hadn ' t bothered to guess which room noah was in . she could hear his crying all the way in . when becky flung open the door , she waved megan through with her hand . ` ` the others did ##n ' t want me to interrupt you , but we ' ve been trying the last hour to get him to calm down , and he ' s just not having it . ' ' megan found the chaos of the room almost comical . her mother , along with her aunts julia and liz , stood in a circle around one of the beds . outfitted in a white , claw footed pajamas , noah sat in the middle of the bed , his cheeks streaked and streaked with tears and his eyes swollen from crying . ` ` what is the matter ? ' ' megan asked . everyone turned around to look at her . ` ` nothing . everything ' s fine . go back to your room , ' ' angie said , ignoring noah ' s question . ` ` um , i think it ' s safe to say that it ' s ' t fine . or at least , it ' s not fine . ' ' liz covered her face with her hand . ` ` it 's ' the night emma left the hospital , noah passed out . he woke up out of a dead sleep asking for his mother . the poor baby - sister stayed there as long as she could before she finally called us . ' ' megan cocked her head at noah . ` ` poor baby . ' ' she bypassed her aunts to hold out her arms . considering he ' d spent so much time with her , noah happily reached for her , and megan pulled him into her arms . ` ` hey buddy , you ' ve got to stop screaming . ' ' noah was crying so hard his breath came in big gasps and his chest heaved . ` ` mommy . ' ' , ' ' he said weakly . megan hugged him tight to her chest . ` ` i know , noah . but she ' s at the hospital having your baby sister . ' ' her words seemed n ' t reach him since he drew in a deep breath to stop screaming again . she looked at him . ` ` you ' na come downstairs to the party ? ' ' he looked confused . ` ` pesh is downstairs . you ' ##na seen him ? ' ' ` ` esh ? ' ' megan laughed . ` ` yes , he ' s down there . ' ' `` ' esh , ' ' he said , shuffling his feet as if to tell her to keep walking . ` ` here . i ' ll take him , ' ' her mother said , reaching for noah . noah nodded , wrapping his arms tighter around megan ' s neck . ` ` i think it ' s safe to say he ' s staying with me . ' ' ` ` but it ' s your birthday party , ' ' julia protested . ` ` yes , and i ' ve been enjoying it the last few days . i ' n ' t think watching him is going to take away anything for me . ' ' as she started for the door , she asked , ` ` is mason here ? ' ' her mother nodded . ` ` thank goodness he ' s down the hall , or we ' d have two men running around at six o ' clock . ' ' megan smiled as she walked down the hall . her smile and the pink sari seemed to be holding mason ' s attention . ` ` mason , huh ? ' ' she asked , as they got into the elevator . ` ` yes , pwetty , ' ' he replied . when she got back downstairs , pesh was seated at their table , talking to one of their colleagues . themoment noah saw him , he reached out for pesh . ` ` ` hello , little brother . are you really crying because you wanted to come to our party ? ' ' noah winked at pesh with his hand , which caused pesh to giggle . ` ` he looks so much like aidan when he does that , ' doesn ' t he ? ' ' ` ` yes , he does . i ' m sure he ' s going to use that cute little face to his advantage when he gets older , just like his father did . ' ' she eased into the seat beside them . after spitting out his drink , he asked , ` ` daddy ? ' '
