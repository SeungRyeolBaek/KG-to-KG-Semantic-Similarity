` ` you know what i think ? ' ' he asks , stepping toward me . i step away slowly , feeling one of the posts of my bed against my back . ` ` i think you want me . i think you can barely contain yourself . ' ' ` ` that ' s very arrogant of you , ' ' i reply . i begin to twist the ends of my hair again . ` ` why are you doing that ? ' ' he asks , frowning . ` ` it ' s just a nervous habit , ' ' i reply with a smile , and shake my head . ` ` do i make you nervous ? ' ' ` ` no , ' ' i reply honestly . ` ` about you being in control . . . ' ' ` ` i ' m only nervous if i ' m wrong . ' ' ` ` wrong about what ? ' ' i fight the urge to pull my hair , but i n ' t want to give him the satisfaction . ` ` ' about you wanting me . let ' s call it a kiss - ' ' he raises his eyebrows , studying me . ` ` i ' m going to kiss you again , and all you have to do is tell me to stop . ' ' ` ` what ? that ' s ridiculous . not to kiss youjust like that , and now you expect me to fuck you ? ' ' i protest , as he steps toward me . i try to move backward but i ' m still pressed against my bedpost . heat unfurls deep in my stomach as his eyes lock onto mine . ` ` if it ' s okay , just tell me to stop , ' ' he whispers softly , and steps closer . his musky scent fills my nostrils and my mind begins to wander . i feel wetness trickle down my thigh as he wraps his arms around me , grasping the sheets with both hands behind my lower back . he ' s so close to me . i can feel heat radiating from him . his shoulders and chest sink against me and he moves his face toward mine . just a few inches between nate thornhill ' s mouth and mine . now one inch . now two inches . . . i can feel his warm breath against my slightly parted lips . . . ` ` stop . ' ' i whisper . he pauses but does don ' t pull away , as though he ca n ' t believe what he ' s just done . though truthfully , i ' m marveling at my own restraint . i can feel his erection against my thigh - i know he wants me ,too . now i can beat him at his own game . i lean forward slightly , allowing my lips to brush against his as i whisper , ` ` unless you do don ' t want to . ' ' his eyes , which were focused on my mouth , flick back up to meet mine . i force myself to remain calm even though i ' m overwhelmed by the intensity in his gaze . he stares at me for a moment , then pushes off the bedpost and steps back . he opens his mouth , about to say something , but nothing comes out . i remain pressed against the wall as he turns and walks toward the door . without looking back , he shuts it behind him . i stumble forward and take a deep breath . it ' s like he takes all the air out of the room and i ca don ' t breathe when he ' s around . i ca don ' t believe i just kissed him . i ' m embarrassed , but i still feel like giving myself a standing ovation . i had resisted the advances of nate thornhill , my fantasy of almost two years . i should win a tony award . i knew that if i ' d let him kiss me , i would forever lose any sense of power in our relationship . i ' d be forever be anotherpathetic women who fall for his charm . of course , the downside is that i ' m more turned on than i ' ve ever been in my life , and i ' m obsessed with a book now . i sigh and flop back onto my bed . i have a feeling that whatever is happening between me and my husband , i just ain ' t seen the end of it yet . chapter seven ` ` i ' m so happy there ' s a woman in here ! ' ' constance says , bouncing around in her desk chair . she ' s my new office assistant , and one of only a handful of female employees at thornhill and davis . ` ` ah , there . my application is still open , ' ' i announce , opening the search program on my laptop . ` ` ' they ' ll need you to sign an nda and everything , but first , want to go to lunch ? ' ' she asks . ` ` what ' s an nda ? ' ' i turn to face her . ` ` non - disclosure agreement . there are a lot of politicians and other business types who come in here , and you ca n ' t tell anyone . nothing important , ' ' she says in hushed tones . she seems genuinely pleased that she 'i have this coveted job , which is probably why i ' n ' er told her that i ' m the boss ' s assistant . i ' ve never suffered from nepotism before , and it feels strange and uncomfortable to me now . ` ` okay . ' i ' d love to get lunch together this week , but i ' m having lunch with my friend allison today . we go to uva together , and she ' s got an internship at this wedding planning place in georgetown , so i ' m going to meet up with her . ' ' ` ` cool . georgetown does some good shopping .
