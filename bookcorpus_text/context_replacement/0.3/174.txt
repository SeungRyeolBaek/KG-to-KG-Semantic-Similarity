` ` brynn , be careful ! and i do don ' t think that ' s poison ivy , anyway . ' ' ` ` no , no ! no , that ' s red - ' ' i break off as i feel the ground beneath me give way . what i thought was a rock is now an area of dirt . my heart leaps into my throat as i begin to fall , the ground instantly becoming a rock . i gasp and scream , frantically grabbing onto the rocks and branches below . ` ` brynn ! ' ' nate yells , and runs into the brush behind me . i feel him grab my hand as i try to get a foothold on the steep hill beneath me . my feet frantically search for purchase and i start to fall . ` ` it ' s ok , it ' s ok , i ' ve got you , ' ' nate says . the steadiness in his voice forces me to look up at him . he ' s looking back down at me , his eyes sure and calm . i take a deep breath and reach my other hand up . he takes it and starts to pull me up . ` ` under your right foot , there ' s a rock , ' ' he says , peering over the edge . ` ` do n ' treach down , and feel for it . move an inch to your left . keep looking at me . ' ' the expression in his eyes arrests me , and i still for a moment , then slowly begin to move my foot to the right . there . i hear my foot brush against something , and push my foot up and onto it . ` ` okay , now just stand up and i ' ll pull you up . one , two , three ! ' ' i shove my foot down and he kneels and pulls me up and over onto him . i land right on top of him , shaking with fear and excitement . i feel his arms wrap around me and squeeze , almost squeezing the rest of the air out of me . ` ` fuck , brynn , ' ' he whispers in my ear . ` ` are you ok ? ' ' i ask , realizing he ' s lying on his back . ` ` am i okay ? are you ? ' ' he asks , sounding concerned . ` ` um , i think so , but it ' s hard to tell right now . ' ' ` ` oh , sorry . okay , stand up , ' ' he says , and i move to the side of him . he stands up and offers me his hands . i take them andasks , concerned as i put pressure on my right foot . ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' ` ` my ankle , i think . ' ' ` ` let ' s get back on the trail where you can look at it . ' ' he takes my arm and wraps it around his waist . i feel his arm around my waist and i ' m almost lifted off my feet as he carries me back onto the trail . he helps me down to a sitting position and i lean back on my hands as he gently picks up my right foot . ` ` it ' s a little sore , ' ' he observes , ` ` but i ' ' ' i think it ' s broken - probably a bad sprain . think you ' re ok to walk back if i carry you ? ' ' ` ` yeah , i ' ll be fine , ' ' i assure him . he helps me stand up and wraps my arm around his waist . i take a deep breath as we take our very first steps back toward the boathouse , and i realize i ' m ready for a half hour of being pressed up against him . ` ` you ' re really sweaty , you know that ? ' ' i say with a smile . ` ` hey , you better be kidding . i 'lose my mind , ' ' he laughs . ` ` how messed up am i ? ' ' ` ` ` best not to think about it . ' ' ` ` that ' s pretty gross . ' ' ` ` well , i ' m glad you ' re alright . . . mostly . ' ' i ' n ' t sure if it ' s the scare from almost falling , or if we ' re both just nervous , but the entire walk back takes place in awkward silence . i wish i could think of something to say to break the tension , but having his shirtless body pressed up against me is too much . i can feel our breaths mixing together and our breath , along with the beat of our hearts . as we finally sight the parking lot , he stands and moves in front of me , then leans over , looking down at me expectantly . i nod and swing my right leg up onto him , and then jump up as he hoists me the rest of the way . he walks with me on his back until we reach the car , then deposits me right next to the passenger side door . as he jogs around to the driver ' s side , i turn to look around the parking lot . there are actually quite a few cars here , and in thecorner is a blue sedan with a woman wearing sunglasses behind the wheel . i stare at her for a moment , because with her red hair , i thought for a moment that she was my sister . when we make eye contact she quickly looks away , and i hear the engine start for a car . maybe she was just staring at nate like the other people we encountered today . or maybe she ' s a reporter . . . pierce warned the police that there could still be a few hanging around .
