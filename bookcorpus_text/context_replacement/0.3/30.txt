` ` that we ' re two normal people having dinner , ' ' he replied . ` ` you ' re a physician , and i ' m a clinical nurse . could n ' ` we get dinner together ? ' ' ` ` doctors and nurses usually have dinner together on their rounds . the hospital is a pretty safe place for us to be eating alone . if someone happens upon us in one of the waiting rooms or the emergency waiting room , then we might have a problem . ' ' ` ` if you say so , ' ' she mumbled , as he punched the down button on the elevator . as they stepped into the lobby , pesh faced her . ` ` you really are serious , are n ' t you ? ' ' she asked . ` ` my career means everything to me . i ' n ' t want to do anything to jeopardize it . ' ' ` ` ` i ' ll make sure we # ##n ' ` eat by ourselves . ' ' ` ` thank you . i really appreciate that . ' ' as the car started its way down , pesh leaned his head back and took a long breath . ` ` well , that depends . . . ' ' megan grinned at him . ` ` the good doctor seems speechless . surely hein your time in the hospital , you ' ve seen crazier and more frightening things . ' ' he cocked his head , looking amused . ` ` a penis lodged in the rectum is probably the tamest . ' ' ` ` the worst ? ' ' megan questioned him , as the elevator doors slid open . pesh chuckled . ` ` a man high on adrenaline walking into the hospital with his penis in his mouth is probably the craziest . ' ' megan ' s hand swept over her mouth . ` ` i just cut off his . . . ' ' she gazed around to make sure no one was listening to their conversation . ` ` is the good stuff gone ? ' ' he asked . she narrowed her eyes at him . ` ` ' what happened ? ' ' ` ` we got him sedated and into bed as soon as we could . i thought they were going to sew it back on . i ' m not sure of whether or not he was still . . . fully functional yet . ' ' ` ` that sounds crazy . ' ' ` ` i know . ' ' pesh handed her a dessert tray . as they discussed their choices , megan asked , ` ` is that your favorite lineof being in a situation like that ? ' ' ` ` i think we ' ve established that i ' n ' t been privy to any such cases , but yes , any time there is an issue with the penis that is not related to the bladder or bladder , you would ask those questions . ' ' after the food service attendant gave them both an odd look , pesh looked over at her . ` ` why do you ask ? ' ' she shrugged . ` ` just to be prepared for the next question . ' ' he raised his brows at her . ` ` do you want to continue your line of questioning ? you know , tell me what you ' ve learned ? ' ' ` ` let ' s order our food first , shall we ? ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' after deciding that the fried chicken sandwich was about the most appealing thing in the lunch line , she grabbed her salad and one of the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . just as she got ready to leave , pesh put his plate next to hers . he had chosen some kind of stir - fry that did ##n ' t look good to megan . when she dug into her purse for her wallet , he tossed a twenty to the waitress . then he took hischange , she shot him a look . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` you mean my mother ' n ' you sound so serious , ' ' she teased , as they walked toward the door . pesh shook his head with a smile . ` ` i highly doubt she ' s keeping the gossip ##s going about how dr . nadeen made the handsome young medical student a millionaire . ' ' ` ` you never know , ' ' megan replied . ignoring pesh , she watched as he made his way over to a table filled with doctors and nurses . while the bottom row was filled with people , the top was mostly empty . ` ` mind if we take these seats ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` go right ahead , nadeen , ' ' the dark haired doctor replied . ` ` we ' re expecting a few others to join us , ' ' he added , while covertly winking at megan . ` ` you play a dangerous game , ' ' she said , softly . ` ` thank you . ' ' she ' d just finished her dressing and her salad when pesh asked , ` ` ready to enjoy yourself ? ' ' ` ` are we really going to talk about this after we eat ? ' ' ` ` you' ll find that most lunch and dinners are spent either reviewing cases or providing information on them . ' ' ` ` okay then . ' ' putting on a stern face , she asked , ` ` have you taken up sexual dysfunction ##s ? ' ' after taking a bite of stir - fry , he replied , ` ` no , sir . ' ' ` ` do you have trouble maintaining an erection ? ' ' the light returned to his eyes . ` ` i would think you would n ' t want to answer that question after our first encounter . ' ' a shiver went down her spine as she felt her core rubbing against the hard ridge in his erection . ` ` ' it is unlikely that i would have any prior knowledge of the subject , just answer the question . ' ' he gave her a sly smile .
