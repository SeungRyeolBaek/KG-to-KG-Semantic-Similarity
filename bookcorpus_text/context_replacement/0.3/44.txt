he licked his lips and took a step toward her . ` ` just a place where you could imagine your life with me in it ? ' ' megan stared at him , her expression contemplative . for a brief moment , pesh knew by her hesitation that she had changed her mind about him . but then she shook her head . ` ` how many times are you going to let me help you with this ? you ' re too good for me , pesh . we both know that . i ' ll remind you again of all of the reasons i ' m not the one for you . i ' m twenty - four , and you ' re twenty - seven . you need a wife , and i ' m not going to be one . ' ' her words cut into his heart the same as if she had taken a sharp knife to him . she may have meant to repeat herself this time , but he realized the finality of her words . and then an idea hit him so hard that he shuddered - a big - bulb moment and all . there was only one way he was going to get to know his sweet megan , and that was if he gave himself to her . he would have to become someone else for her , even if it was just fora little more . he could provide her with things that she both wanted and needed , but at the same time , he would make her fall in love with him . it could work . it had to . cocking his head at her , he questioned , ` ` ' let me get this straight once and for all . you would let me . . . ' ' he paused , fighting the conflict within himself to say what he needed to . he drew in a deep breath . ` ` you would let me f * * k you , not touch you ? ' ' her eyes widened at his word choice . ` ` what ' s gotten into you ? ' ' he shrugged again , feeling slightly embarrassed by the dr . jekyll and mr . hyde moment . ` ` i just asked a stupid question . ' ' she sighed exasperatedly . ` ` yes , but . . . ' ' she swallowed hard . ` ` fucking , of all things . ' ' ` ` no . ' ' megan shook her head slowly back and forth . ` ` i can hardly believe that you say the words , least of all you saying that . ' ' ` ` you ' don ' t want to - ' ' she held up her hand . ` ` you ' re not the oneof course to f * * k , ' ' she countered . crossing his arms over his chest , he asked , ` ` ` me ? i ' m that nice of a guy ? ' ' ` ` something like that . ' ' ` ` i need a reason , megan . we all have reasons . is ##in ' you f * * king one of them ? ' ' her body trembled slightly at his words . she licked her lips before replying , ` ` please - stop saying that i - ' ' n ' ' you . ' ' ` ` so , f * * king me n ' t you ? ' don ' t tell me you think i ' m an ass - that you ca don ' t want me f * * king a woman . . . fucking you . ' ' he stepped even closer to her . ` ` we both know for a fact that you wanted nothing more than to f * * k me the night of amanda ' s baptism . given the chance right now , you ' d let me strip off your clothes and f * * k you up against the medicine cabinet . ' ' as her chest heaved up and down , she took a step back from him , bumping against the counter . ` ` but you said don ' t" things like that . you ' re amazing . you ' re a god , ' ' she whispered . ` ` it may have been a while , but even a man like you enjoys f * * king . ' ' he closed the gap between them . ` ` what are you doing ? ' ' she asked . ` ` i ' m giving you what you want . ' ' ` ` you ' re asking me ? ' ' ` ` sure , why not ? ' ' as he lowered his head , his mouth hovered over hers . ` ` if you really want me to take you , then kiss me . ' ' without a moment ' s hesitation , megan pressed her lips against his . the kiss was desperate and desperately seeking more . as his tongue thrust into her mouth , his hand moved to her breast . slowly , he caressed the nipple , feeling the heat fill his hand . unsatisfied with the lack of contact , he pulled his hand away and slid it under megan ' s top . over her bra , he kneaded her breast again , feeling her nipple harden beneath his fingers . he felt his body harden at the sound of her voice . he wanted nothing more than to strip off all her clothes and kiss every inch of her body . megan ' s head poppedone of his , and she looked up at him with wide eyes . ` ` what about someone finding us ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll lock the door , ' ' he said . slowly , he pulled away from her to walk back over to the door . before he turned the lock , he made sure to place a box in front of her as well . they would have enough privacy if anyone decided to try to use their card to break in . with his hands on her shoulders , he steered her toward one of the floor - to - ceiling shelves , concealing them even further from potential suspicious eyes . ` ` now where are we ? ' ' he asked , with a smile . she grinned and wrapped her arms around his neck .
