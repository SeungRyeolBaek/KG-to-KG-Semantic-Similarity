jerking his head up from mary , pesh snarled , ` ` get the f * * king cart ! ' ' as one of the nurses walked away , the others pulled the gurney from the elevator . megan stood there , completely confused as to what to do . when the cart arrived , pesh ripped off mary ' s gown . ` ` ' 260 ##0 . ' ' he snapped the paddles together . ` ` clear ! ' ' mary ' s chest lifted off the floor with the force of the blow . megan you don ' t need to look at the chest . the heart stayed in a steady rhythm . ` ` charging 360 degrees . ' ' megan closed her eyes when pesh delivered the second shock . ` ` dammit , jade , do don ' t do this ! not for me ! ' ' megan could n ' t hold back the sob that escaped her at pesh calling her by his dead wife ' s name . before pesh could do another charge , one of the doctor ' s stepped forward . after he removed his gloves , he placed his hands on pesh ' s shoulders . ` ` calling time of death . ' ' slowly , pesh lowered his hands . slowly , he backed away from the doctor . the nurse took the phone from himand put them back on the table . ` ` i ' ll go notify the family , ' ' pesh murmured . the surgeon shook his head and looked down at megan . ` ` get a nurse to do that . nadeen , you should take a look , too . ' ' ` ` they need to speak to the doctor who was with her when she died . ' ' ` ` you ' don ' t need to do this . ' ' pesh slung away from the surgeon and headed for the elevator . megan knew there was no point in arguing with him or trying to get one of the nurses to take his place . she didn ##n ' t know if she should try to talk to him or not . she made her decision when he turned to face her in the elevator . his expression was agonizingly serious . as the doors closed , her heart ached for him . she knew a doctor hated to lose a patient , especially a loved one , but this went far deeper than that . from his behavior , megan knew that mary ' s death had struck a raw nerve in pesh - one that after ten years still bled hadn ' t healed . somehow he had found his wife , mary , and once again , he was n ' t ready to accept her. after she had escorted mary ' s body back upstairs to wait at the funeral home , megan went in search of pesh . she could couldn ' t find him in any of the exam rooms , nor was he in the nurses ' lounge or waiting room . finally , she turned to kristi for advice . ` ` did you see where dr . nadeen went ? ' ' kristi gave her a sad smile . ` ` you ' ll probably find him on the roof . ' ' megan ' s eyebrows shot up in surprise . ` ` the roof ? ' ' kristi nodded . ` ` whenever he has a really bad feeling about his work - ' ' she sucked in a breath when she realized she might have said too much . at the thought of pesh ' s grief , megan ' s heart squeezed in sympathy . he was too good of a man to have to suffer like he did . ` ` ' he went up to the roof ? ' ' megan answered for kristi . ` ` he likes to be alone to clear his head . although neither of us would say anything , he always ends up pulling a stunt to make up for the time he was gone . ' ' of course pesh would do something like that . he was gone every day of his life, even for those of great grief . even though she knew he probably hurt and needed to be alone , megan wanted to check on him . she could n ' t bear the thought of him suffering so much . ` ` um , if it ' s okay , i think i ' ll go upstairs and take my lunch break . ' ' kristi gave her a knowing look before nodding . ` ` sure , honey . go right ahead . ' ' megan smiled , brushing past kristi . she bypassed the storage room where her purse was . instead , she kept walking . after a short walk down the hall , she came to the special staff only elevator . she did n ' t dare enter the elevator , where trauma patients were brought in from being treated . without hesitation , megan swiped her access card . when the lock clicked , she pushed the door open and started up the flight of stairs . she was winded when she reached the top . still , her hand hovered over the door . she could ##n ' t stop wondering what she might find on the other side . would pesh be an emotional mess ? would he be upset that she had interrupted his private grieving ? shaking the thoughts from her head , she pushed open the door . as she stepped onto the elevator ,the air grew cooler . a breeze rippled her scrubs . her gaze spun around her until she spotted him . pesh stood at the edge of the water . his usual perfectly straight posture was slumped , his broad shoulders drawn back . although she could couldn ' t see his face , his gaze was fixed straight ahead into the night sky . to add insult to injury , clouds blocked out the moon , cloaking everything in darkness . curious , she walked over to him . ` ` hey , ' ' she said softly .
