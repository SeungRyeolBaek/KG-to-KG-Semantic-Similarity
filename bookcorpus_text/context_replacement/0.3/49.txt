` ` all right then . chuck e . cheese it is . ' ' ` ` go get your shoes , ' ' megan said . as they walked back into the living room , megan stood up . ` ` you know ' n ' i want to do this . ' ' ` ` no , i really don ' t mind . we can go have lunch with mason , and then we can start our day . i ' m sure he ' ll be worn out and ready for a nap when we get back , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , we will . ' ' ` ` good . then he wo n ' t have any reason to miss you if he ' s asleep . ' ' she smiled at his words . ` ` thank you . i really appreciate that . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' he reached out and touched her cheek . when he went to lean in to kiss her , mason ran back into the room with his shoes . pesh immediately pulled away . to combat the awkwardness , megan busy herself with putting mason ' s shoes on . when she finished , mason bounded over to pesh and grabbed his hand . ` ` go ! go ! ' ' pesh laughed at mason ' s enthusiasm . he held his other handnot for megan . she slid her hand into his and together they walked to the car . as megan walked through the aisles of their local chuck e . cheese , she cringed slightly at both the ear - piercing sound and the stomach - turning smells . she also hid her embarrassment at the attention she and pesh were getting for their overly revealing outfits . ` ` i think we ' re a little off , ' ' she said . he held up his index finger and thumb , bringing them close together . ` ` just a little off . ' ' tugging on pesh ' s hand , she led him over to the seating area of games . megan quickly dug in her purse for the receipts for tickets . after she found them , she walked over to pesh . ` ` i ' ll go get us some pizza . ' ' she tossed the tickets to him . ` ` once these are sold , he ' s done . ' ' ` ` i do don ' t mind paying him back . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` trust me . he ' s done . ' ' ` ` okay then , ' ' he replied good - naturedly . megan was more at ease leaving pesh to watch them . she got them a couple of boxes ofmason ' s favorite , pizza , along with a salad and dessert made her way over to a table next to the play area . when she caught pesh ' s eye , she waved them over . after several tense moments , he was finally able to convince her to leave the play ##room to come and play . as mason bounced around in his seat , megan knew she would be doing good to get two bites of pizza in him before he was forced to go play again . she also had a fear that she , pesh , or the both of them were going to be wearing red sauce when it was all said and done . ` ` this place is very nice , ' ' pesh remarked , as he gazed around . megan laughed . ` ` have you ever had the flu ? ' ' ` ` ` no . my brother , arjan ' s , and his wife live in town , so i ' ve really never had a reason to come . ' ' ` ` you ' ve dodged a bullet there . that ' s for sure . ' ' he smiled before taking a bite of his pizza . his face was so sour that megan could e ' er stop laughing . ` ` this is terrible , ' ' he said . ` ` i should have warned you notto thank you . pizza always seems appetizing to small children who are hyped up on adrenaline . ' ' he took a long swig from his coke and swirled the liquid around like he was trying to rid himself of the taste . when he caught her staring at him , he put on a small smile . ` ` mmm , that ' s good pizza . you should eat yours before i do . ' ' ` ` nice try , ' ' she teased . he winked at her as he tossed his napkin on his plate . she could don ' t believe when her heart melted at his smile . it was almost impossible to believe that she could be developing feelings for him in the form of chuck e . cheese . ` ` done . go play , ' ' he said , bringing her out of her thoughts . she shook her head . ` ` i do don ' t think so . you need to eat more . ' ' mason winked at her before grabbing another piece and popping it into his mouth . he managed to finish his pizza with a little coaxing from pesh . then the two of them headed back over to the play area . as megan watched them , the small ache in her chest began to ease . pesh was all hands on , hoistingmason stood where he could reach , and she greeted him when he came off the slide . he seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with her . most people would have played with mason only to get on her good side . but pesh ' n ' t have an agenda when it came to her , unless it was to have her embrace the idea of a relationship with him . when the last ticket was spent , she rose from her seat . ` ` okay , time to go . ' ' mason ' s face lit up , and he looked like at any minute he might throw a tantrum to her .
