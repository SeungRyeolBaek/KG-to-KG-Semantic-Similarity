she asked . sean grinned as he nudged gavin . ` ` she ' s just riled , dad . being irrational about little girls usually means shit . ' ' megan opened her mouth to lay into her brother , but then found herself speechless , so she closed it back up . without another word to her brother , she went into the living room . she found her father lounging in his chair with grammy snuggled to his side . when her dad looked up , he did a double take . ` ` ' n ' say you look beautiful , megan , ' ' he said . she leaned over and kissed his cheek . ` ` thanks , dad . ' ' he tore his eyes away from the boys to look at her . ` ` mommy , good - bye ? ' ' this was a question she ' n ' t be asking . ` ` yes , mommy is going to go visit a friend today , and you ' re going to stay here with grammy and grammy . ' ' his dark brows furrowed . ` ` ' no go ? ' ' guilt swept through her . how could she spend one of her few free days away from her son ? the doorbell rang , and she was scared out of her self - control to answer the door . taking a deep breath , shedamn it . her heart did a funny little flip - flop at the sight of pesh on the porch . it was n ' t just how handsome he looked in his khaki pants , white button - down dress shirt , and navy blazer . it was also the fact he held a dozen red roses in his hands . ` ` hi , ' ' she said finally , after they had stared at each other for a few moments . he smiled . ` ` hello . ' ' ` ` would you like to come in ? ' ' as he approached , she stepped aside to give him room to walk in the door . he turned back to her and held out the roses . ` ` these are for you . ' ' as the words left his mouth , he winced , as if what she had said hurt him . ` ` they ' re beautiful . thank you . ' ' ` ` good - bye kiss , emma ! ' ' mason called from the living room . she looked apologetically at pesh . ` ` i ' m sorry . i ' ll only be a minute . ' ' ` ` take your time . ' ' she hurried through the foyer and into the living room . she tossed the roses onto one of the chairs . ` ` i ' ll be backno . you be a good boy , okay ? ' ' she said , when she got to her father ' s chair . she leaned over and kissed both of mason ' s cheeks . ` ` give mommy a kiss . ' ' mason gave her a smacking kiss on the cheek . ` ` bye , my love , ' ' megan said , before turning and walking out of the room . she ' d just reached pesh ' s door when he walked toward her . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` i think we have a potential problem , ' ' he replied , with a smile . she turned around to see him standing in the foyer . ` ` what ' s wrong , baby ? ' ' ` ` no go , ' ' he whimpered . she glanced over at pesh . ` ` i ' m sorry . he usually gets upset about you leaving him . ' ' she knelt down beside mason . ` ` ` wo ##e ' t be gone long , and you ' ll spend much more time here with grammy and granddad . pesh and i are into normal , normal family stuff . ' ' ` ` no go ! ' ' he cried , as more tears formed in his eyes . pesh knelt down beside her . ` ` heynow , ' n ' t cry . i ' m not going to take your mommy away from you . ' ' ` ` ca ##y ? ' ' he asked softly . megan shook her head . ` ` no , sweetheart , i told you that we were going to do some fun stuff today . ' ' ` ` that ' s true , ' ' pesh agreed . then he looked at her . ` ` but that does n ' t mean we can ##uld ' t take a little detour first . ' ' megan ' s widened her eyes in surprise . ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` well , don ' t we take mason to lunch at his favorite place ? ' ' ` ` you do ##n ' t want that , ' ' megan argued . pesh cut his eyes over to her . ` ` yes , i do . i can adjust our schedule . ' ' she could couldn ' t stop staring at him in disbelief . how was it that he was so quick to change his mind just because mason did ##n ' t want her to go ? she resisted the urge to reach over and pat his shoulder to make sure it was real - it was far too good to be true at all . ` ` is that okay with you ? ' ' peshasked her . ` ` of course it ' s all okay with me . i was worried about it not being okay with you . ' ' ` ` i would ##n ' d have said it if i ' n ' t mean it . ' ' he reached over and stroked mason ' s hair . ` ` all right , mason , where do you want to go for lunch ? ' ' ` ` cheese ! cheese ! ' ' mason cried , as he jumped up and down . megan watched as pesh ' s face grew confused . ` ` he wants to eat cheese ? ' ' she asked . ` ` no , he wants to go to chuck e . cheese - every parent ' s worst nightmare . ' ' pesh laughed as he rose up from the couch .
