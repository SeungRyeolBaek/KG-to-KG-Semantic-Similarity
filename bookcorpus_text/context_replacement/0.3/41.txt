he turned around in surprise . her heart clenched at the sight of the tears sparkling in his eyes . even in the darkness , she could see a blood - red flush on his cheeks . his hands quickly came up to swipe away the tears from his face . ` ` hello , ' ' he finally replied in a hoarse voice . they stood in an awkward silence , staring each other down . finally , megan took a step forward to close the gap between them . ` ` how did you know i was in there ? ' ' she asked . ` ` kristi told me . ' ' ` ` hmm . ' ' unable to stop herself , she reached out to touch his arm . ` ` i ' m so sorry , pesh . ' ' ` ` don ' n ' t you . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` yes , it is . you ' re in pain . . . you ' ve been in years . i can n ' t help but feel sorry for what you ' re going through . ' ' his normally warm eyes took on a serious look . ` ` you were in that room , megan . you have every right to be emotional . maybe you should be more concerned with why you are aren ' t weeping . ' ' ` ` do n 't , ' ' she whispered . ` ` do n ' t what ? ' ' ` ` do n ' t try to hide your feelings by being someone you ' re not , or pointing fingers at others . that just ain ' t you , and you certainly don ' t fool me . ' ' with a deep sigh , pesh ran his hand through his dark , wavy hair . ` ` i ' m sorry . that was completely uncalled for . ' ' ` ` it ' s okay . ' ' ` ` no , it ' s - ' ' she silenced him by bringing her hand up to cover his mouth . when she pulled her hand away , he sighed . ` ` listen to me , ' ' megan whispered . the sky above them opened up , causing a slight drizzle to fall . ` ` the death of a patient is never easy . any doctor of medicine , or nurse for that matter , must have tried . then it is inevitable that the little compassion you have will come back to haunt you - it may even cripple you . when death comes , you need n ' t help except for the life that has been lost and for the love you left behind . ' ' his voice trailed off , and megan pressed herself even closer to him .she knew that his last statement held deep meaning for him . ` ` what exactly happened to your wife ? ' ' she asked softly . pesh ' s eyes darkened . ` ` jade had an undiagnosed clotting disease . she was pregnant , but she did n ' t know anything else about her medical background . she ' d never been in good health - she rarely even went to the doctor with the baby . and after we ' d been married for four years , we decided it was time to have a baby . ' ' when pesh remained silent , megan finally asked , ` ` did she die in childbirth ? ' ' he shook his head . ` ` no , we never got that far . we tried for over a year to get pregnant on our own , and it did n ' t happen . so we were sent to a fertility clinic . when the iui process proved didn ' t work , we tried ivf . ' ' a ragged sigh came from deep within his chest . ` ` the whole process was physically trying and was emotionally gutting for both of us , but especially for jade . ' ' he met her gaze . ` ` she blamed herself since the doctor revealed that everything was wrong with me . although we were happy as ' we- and infertility , ' she felt that it was all her fault . ' ' ` ` bless her heart , ' ' megan murmured , as her heart went out to a woman she ' d just met . getting pregnant had been so difficult for her . although mason had n ' t been conceived , she had never been pregnant in her life . but she knew what infertility did to a woman when she saw it ravage her father ' s life . although her aunt was now the happy and doting mother of two baby boys , she knew the financial toil that getting pregnant had caused . megan , herself , had also been the cause of her aunt ' s childless ##ness when she first announced her pregnancy with mason . still without answers as to how jade had died , megan pressed pesh for answers . ` ` so what happened with the ivf ? ' ' ` ` she got pregnant on the first transfer only to die two weeks later . we had just been on the transfer when she died . ' ' pesh ' s adam ' s apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed hard . megan could only imagine he was trying to keep his emotions in check . finally , he spoke again . ` ` she had an embolism most likely , onby the pain medication . i was in the kitchen making breakfast when i heard a crash in the bedroom . ' ' tears pooled in his eyes . ` ` when i called her name and she did n ' t scream , i ran back to her . she was lying on the bedroom floor . after calling 911 , i tried cpr over and over again , but i could never reach her . ' ' ` ` oh pesh , ' ' megan whispered . the weight of his pain was so great that even she found it difficult to breathe . without looking at her , he continued staring straight ahead . ` ` from what the medical examiner said , i have found comfort in what she did ##n ' t scream - that she went out without any fear or hesitation .
