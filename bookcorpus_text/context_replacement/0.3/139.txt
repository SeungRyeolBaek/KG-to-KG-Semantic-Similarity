` ` well , congratulations , both of you , ' ' my mom cuts in . ` ` i have no idea what i ' m going to order ! everything is so wonderful . ' ' she runs her finger over the menu in front of her . having grown up in a family of irish immigrants , my mom has always avoided conflict with the plague , and this time i ' m glad for the change of subject . i decide to order the champagne since it ' n ' t seem to be an issue , and we each order a cocktail in addition to the champagne . something seems to click in the back of my mind as the waitress leaves to put in our drink orders . ` ` pierce , i ' m sorry if this is an ignorant question , but are you in college ? your name sounds very familiar . ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' he says , looking up . ` ` i ' m a former senator - ' ' ` ` - for years . now i am . you helped pass the campaign finance reforms . ' ' i nod . ` ` good question . ' ' ` ` one of my majors is political science , so i try to keep up with it . ' ' ` ` and your other major ? ' ' ` ` global studies . ' ' ` ` youwell , i own thornhill and co . off of k street , and we ' re just looking for a summer job . why ? ' ' ` ` well , i thought you were going - ' ' nate breaks in before i can finish . ` ` and i thought you were going to get a lawn room , ' ' his dad says , keeping his voice low . ` ` so , brynn , what do you want ? ' ' ` ` well , um , i was just trying to get a summer job back in maryland to help pay for tuition , ' ' i say . did he offer his dad the internship ? i do don ' t want to start off this relationship with nate on the wrong foot . ` ` you ' n ' t need to worry about tuition now , honey , ' ' my mom says gently . i look at her in shock . oh my god - is nate going to pay for my medical bills ? the thought had n ' t even occurred to me . i look between them and they stare back at me blankly . ` ` no , no , i did n ' i mean - i mean , i ' d love to , but i mean - if nate wants the - ' ' ` ` then it ' s settled , ' ' nate cuts in. ` ` i have to go into the office really early , but we have an extra car you can borrow . ' ' ` ` sorry ? i do n ' t understand . ' ' ` ` well , you and i are moving in together . i mean , we can live there permanently , but i ' m not using the old house , now that we ' re married . ' ' ` ` right . of course . ' ' my brain scrambles to process all the new information . just as i ' m working it all out , i feel a hand on my knee . i look down in time to see nate ' s hand disappearing under the table . i look at him . he ' s staring straight ahead as if nothing ' s wrong . i fight to maintain my cool as heat spreads from his hand and all the way up to . . . ` ` so , this summer , we ' ll be living with you then ? all of you ? ' ' nate turns to look at me again . his hand moves another inch up the bare skin of my thigh . i widen my eyes at him but he ' n ' t react . ` ` that ' s right . we ' ll all be living in pierce ' s house - ' ' ` ` our house , '' he tells my mom with a smile . ` ` our house , on potomac . it ' s got lots of space , and views of the potomac . it ' ll be wonderful to have the opportunity to bond with each other , and to be a family . ' ' nate ' s hand moves an inch up my leg . i can feel the rough , calloused skin of his palm . i ' ve never been so turned on in my life , and i ' m struggling against it . what is he doing ? we ' re at dinner with our parents ! ` ` i know you have your stuff at the old house , but we ' ll have it moved to the new one . everything will be all set up when you get home , ' ' my mom says , looking at me . ` ` mmm , ' ' i say , trying to focus on her words . ` ` we ' n ' got that attached to the old place anyway , ' ' i add with a shrug . we ' d moved a couple years before my dad died , so no other place has ever felt like home . nate ' s hand moves another inch up my leg , pushing up the hem of my dress so his fingers are on me . my whole body is tingling . holy shit , ii barely breathe . i ' m hoping pierce and my mom ' n ' t seem to notice that anything ' s wrong . with his other hand , nate takes a long sip from his champagne flute . where ' s the food ? he ' ll have to move his hand when the time comes . he moves his hand up another inch . i ca ##v ' t hold it any longer - another inch and i ' m going to start moaning . as my mom moves her head to pierce ' s chest to murmur sweet things , i grab my fork from the table and drive it point - first into the top of nate ' s hand .
