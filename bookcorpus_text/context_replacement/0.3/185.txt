and there are actually a few things i ' d like to pick out for myself . i meet her at the anthropologie in the lobby , and we start going through the sale racks as we go up . while she ' s not looking , i slip a couple sets of lingerie and some underwear into my basket . i want to wear something a little sexy for nate , but i do don ' t want to face allison ' s inevitable reaction if she sees what i ' ve picked out . we both make our way to the dressing rooms and begin trying on our clothes . i finally slip on the first full set of bra and panties . i check myself in the mirror . the lace is a pale pink , and not overtly sexy - it ' s anthropologie , not victoria ' s secret , after all . ` ` what do you think ? ' ' allison asks suddenly , pulling the curtain aside and walking into the dressing room with me . she ' s wearing a white cocktail dress and twirls for a second when she notices what i ' m wearing . her eyebrows rise . ` ` whoa . ' ' ` ` allison , ' ' i groan , pulling one of the more substantial pieces of clothing off the hanger to cover myself .` ` you know , i had a feeling something was up with you , ' ' she says , starting to blush . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` yup . and i was wrong . i just thought you two would make a good couple . ' ' ` ` what ? that ' s not what you said . ' ' ` ` yeah , i just said it ! ' ' ` ` no , you just warned me against the whole thing , ' ' i reply , confused and feeling slightly annoyed . ` ` greg , ' ' she says with a frown , ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' ` ` who are you talking about ? ' ' ` ` greg , i . . . ' ' ` ` oh , sorry . ' ' ` ` brynn . . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' i ask confused . ` ` if it ' s not greg , who did you think i was talking about ? ' ' she asks , her eyes wide . ` ` it ' s not nate , okay ? ' ' i reply , confused . ` ` brynn , no . please tell me it ' s not nate . no . i mean , it ' s your brother . it ' s . . . it ' s nate .' ' ` ` thanks a lot , allison . ' exactly what i need to hear right now , ' ' i say , turning my back to her to take off the jacket . ` ` um , maybe that ' s exactly what you need to hear right now . i mean , what ' s with you ? you ' re ignoring a perfectly nice guy to go out with some jock like nate . ' ' ` ` well , first of all , it ' s none of your business . second of all , you ' re actually probably right , greg . nate is ' perfectly nice . ' there ' s no question at all . zero . third of all , nate ' s not ' some jock . ' he ' s really smart , and funny , and fun . and with him ? sparks galore ! ' ' ` ` god , brynn , i ' m just trying to look out for you . you ' re making some really bad decisions . ' ' i take a deep breath , not wanting to raise my voice in this public place . ` ` no , allison , you ' re not trying to look out for me . what you ' re doing is hurting me . something different . and i really do . ' ou ##d it . ' ' i start pulling on my dressand quickly slip my flats on as i grab my purse and walk quickly out of the dressing room . i walk straight out of the store and toward the elevator to the parking garage , my face burning with anger , but i also feel a bit like myself . i ' ve never had a big fight like that with allison before , and i ' n ' t remember it . i stop at another store just as i ' m about to reach the elevators . it ' s secret . my relationship with nate is n ' ' ` ` gross . ' ' there ' s nothing wrong with what we ' re doing . if anything , my relationship with allison has made me want to lean into my relationship with nate , not out of it . i march in and go to the first pieces i see . when i get there , i hear my mom and dad laughing in the kitchen , and the voices from the bedroom . i walk in there and smile in relief at the sight of nate with his feet up on the couch . he pulls his chair over and i plop down . ` ` hi , ' ' i say with a smile . ` ` hi , ' ' he replies . ` ` what ' s up ? ' ' i smile at him , and he reaches up to his shoulder, or looking at something . i stare at him for a moment , realizing he ' s mirroring my earlier action of pulling at my hair . i sigh and drop my head . ` ` it ' s allison . we had an argument , ' ' i explain . ` ` she . . . she stormed out . ' ' he shakes his head and then lets out a low whistle as he realizes what i mean . ` ` well , i guess it ' s not that bad . i mean , i just thought . . . ' ' he lowers his voice , looking back toward the kitchen where our parents are still talking .
