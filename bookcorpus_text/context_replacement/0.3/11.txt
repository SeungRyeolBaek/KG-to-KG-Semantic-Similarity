` ` ' other people . not having to hear them is bad enough . ' ' crossing his arms over his chest , aidan said , ` ` you came over here to see if we were going to eat or not ? people are getting curious . i had no idea i was going to interrupt such an intimate conversation . of course , i do don ' t . i want to know why the two of you are discussing emma ' s and my sex life right now . ' ' emma waved her hand dismissively . ` ` we do n ' t . and now , we ' re ready to eat . let ' s get everyone up . ' ' as emma walked over to get people to sit down , aidan glared at megan , saying , ` ` ' bullshit . ' ' megan closed her eyes as if in pain . ` ` leave me . please . ' ' ` ` ' go . because you never know if your sister can be a super freak too . ' ' and with a wink , he walked off to join emma , leaving megan to wonder why everyone was so concerned with hers and pesh ' s sex life . as the lights started fading , most of the party guests began to trickle out the door . by the time it was dark , there were only a few of aidanand emma ' s close , too . megan had let her mother take a sleepy mason home , but she wanted to stay to help emma clean up . the truth was she wanted to spend as much time as she could with pesh . thankfully , she found herself sitting next to him at one of the poolside tables . somehow they managed to set up by themselves after most of the other guests had left . leaning back in her chair , she asked , ` ` did you always want to be a doctor ? ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` for my fifth birthday , my mother bypassed the usual play doctor ' s routine by giving me a real medical examination with tools from the hospital . she treated everyone who would stand still long enough , even the family dogs . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i thought you were a cute little doctor . ' ' ` ` my mother kept some embarrassing secrets , ' ' he said , with a smile . ` ` ' your father was also a doctor ? ' ' ` ` yes , he had a general medical practice for forty years . he just recently retired . ' ' ` ` did he want you to follow in his footsteps ? ' ' he grinned . ` ` i ' m starting to feel like i ' m being tested . '' she sighed . ` ` i ' m sorry if you feel that way . i ' m just trying to get to know you . ' ' ` ` you ' re not a very attractive interrogator , ' ' he said . ` ` i think you ' re avoiding the question by flattering me . ' ' ` ` there ' s flattery and then there ' s the truth . ' ' cocking her brows , she said , ` ` and now that ' s not answering my question . ' ' he held up his hands in defeat . ` ` fine , fine . no , ' ' don ' t feel inclined to become a judge . my parents would have never allowed me to pursue a profession where i simply wasn ' t very useful . ' ' megan nodded . ` ` so you ' ve always had a need to help people ? ' ' ` ` pretty much . as the oldest , i always looked out for my two younger brothers and sisters . my mother has always called me an honest man . ' ' ` ` i can see that about you . ' ' leaning forward , he rested his elbows on the table . ` ` now it is my turn to be the judge . ' ' ` ` oh , i do don ' t mind .' ' ` ` what about you ? did you ever see doctors in your future ? ' ' ` ` yes and no . yes , i wanted to be a doctor . ' ' his eyebrows shot up in surprise . ` ` really ? ' ' when she nodded , he asked , ` ` what happened ? ' ' there was no way she was going to tell him the truth about her plans and why she had been forced to abandon medical school . instead , she shrugged . ` ` nothing happened , i guess . i focused on the next best thing , which was nursing . ' ' pesh looked down at her . ` ` was it your son ? ' ' ` ` why me ? ' ' ` ` was it your son who changed your mind about medical school ? ' ' she shook her head . ` ` no , it was because i had plans . ' ' ` ` does he . . . know you . . . ? ' ' pesh shook his head . ` ` forgive me . i was being too blunt . ' ' ` ` please , go on . i told you i was n ' pose going to answer your questions . ' ' she laughed . ` ` but it ' s okay to ask , and it ' s not my business . ' ' ` ` 'ask your question , ' ' she replied . with a resigned sigh , he finally asked , ` ` are you married ? ' ' ` ` no , i ' m not married . and no , aidan ' s father does n ' t want anything to do with him . ' ' anger flashed in pesh ' s dark eyes . ` ` even though i know nothing of him , i know that he is not a man . a man does not abandon his family and his responsibilities . ' ' ` ` you would be right . he ' s just a man playing at being a man , ' ' she replied , looking down at the floor .
