i ' d love to go with you too . fashion is fun , my favorite food , and you have a girl ' s perfect body . ' ' ` ` i do don ' t think i - ' ' i finish my canned response to her shopping invitation when i realize that maybe i can manage it . and she looks so damn beautiful in her patterned dress and statement jewelry . ` ` you know , that would be nice . i ' ' n ' t know what to wear . ' ' ` ` well , i can help you with that . be careful not to wear anything too revealing around mr . thornhill , ' ' she replies , rolling her eyes . ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' i ask with a smile . ` ` oh my god , who is that ? ' ' she asks , breaking away from our conversation to turn and peer over our bedroom door . i join her to see nate and pierce walking down the hallway , toward the elevator bank . they must be having dinner together . ` ` that ' s his son , ' ' i say , immediately standing up again . ` ` he looks like a male model ! ' ' she says , sitting back down . ` ` um , what are you saying , constance - mr. thornhill - and you ? ' ' ` ` well , i ' ve never had an issue , so maybe he ' s just not into young women , ' ' she says , tossing her black hair over her shoulder again . ` ` from what i ' ve heard , though , he has a certain charm . ' ' ` ` uh , yeah , ' ' i reply , worriedly tugging at my hair . shit . shit . i knew he was too good to be true . ` ` do ##n ' t worry . from what i ' ve heard , he ' s pretty harmless , he ' s probably from a different generation when it comes to people in the office - especially young women , ' ' she says . ` ` mmhm , ' ' i reply , my emotions already spiraling into crisis mode . ` ` you okay , brynn ? ' ' ` ` ' he ' s married , though . i mean , he ' s married now , ' ' i say , clinging to a thread of hope . ` ` yeah , i thought he was married . ' ' she smiles . ` ` could be . i ' n ' t think it ' s something that ' s been too recent or anything . ' ' i nod , feeling slightly better .we both turn back to our computers as we hear footsteps outside our door . i look up to see pierce and nate appear in the doorway . ` ` brynn , this is going to be awful , ' ' pierce begins , and i brace myself . ` ` ' nate and i had plans to go to lunch , and we went down to the restaurant before we realized how rude it was not to invite you along . ' ' phew . for a second i thought you overheard our conversation . ` ` oh , that ' s very nice , but i do have lunch plans with my best friend from school , nate . ' ' ` ` oh i see . . . well , enjoy ! there are some great restaurants around here . we just wanted to let you know you were welcome , ' ' she says kindly , but from nate ' s expression i ' m sure that it was more his concern than his son ' s . ` ` great , right ? ' ' he says , turning to her . ` ` yes , that ' s great , ' ' she squeaks . ` ` okay , well , we better get going or we ' ll be late for our meeting . see you at lunch ! ' ' pierce says with a wink , and walks away with nate in tow .huh . i notice that nate did n ' t say a single word to me . i guess he does n ' not like being the one left wanting for something . ` ` ' did mr . thornhill see you at work ? ' ' constance says , slowly turning her desk around to face me , a worried look on her face . ` ` um , no , i ' m his daughter . he just met my mom . ' ' constance sighs and puts her face in her hands . ` ` oh my god , oh my god , i ' m so sorry . i ' m fired , right ? ' ' ` ` what ? no ! i ' n ' not want that kind of job , i ' m just an employee , like you . ' ' ` ` you ' re the boss ' s daughter , and i was just worried about him ! ' ' ` ` step - daughter , and i get it . if i ' d heard things like that , i would want to warn the people i work with , too . ' ' ` ` ' i do don ' t even know if they ' re true , i ' m so sorry , ' ' she says quietly . ` ` no , it ' s okay . and i ' m sorrythat i # n ' t tell you . that i ' m his stepdaughter . i just . . . you know , i ##n ' t want it to seem like it was the only reason i got the internship . i mean , i really do work really hard . ' ' ` ` of course you do ! of course . yes . i should get back to work , ' ' she says , turning to her computer and beginning to type furiously . ` ` . . . and now i ' m worried she ' s going to keep acting really weird around you , ' ' i confide to allison over a caesar salad at clyde ' s on m street . ` ` do you think it ' s true ? ' ' she whispers , leaning over the table between us .
