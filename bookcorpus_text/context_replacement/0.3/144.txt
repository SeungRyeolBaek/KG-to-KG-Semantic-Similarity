stop feeling sorry for yourself , brynn . as i walk across the lower lawn , i look up and see my mom and pierce ' s porch light go off . i guess they ' re coming in early tonight . i walk up toward the house and pause when i hear a moan . the lights here are all off except one in the hall , and the pool ' s lights reflect the water . my eyes dart around and land on two naked bodies on a poolside lounge chair . nate and dana . i watch as nate takes off his own shirt and then dana ' s . i know i should , but i just don ' t . the blue pool lights glow against his back muscles as he slowly undoes dana ' s bra and takes off her pants and underwear . move , you pervert ! my brain commands me , but my body stays firmly planted in place , even as it throbs with desire . one of nate ' s hands cups dana ' s bare breast , and the other moves beneath her . dana cries out , and i nearly gasp myself , even though his fingers are moving against me . i can still feel his touch on me , his hot breath against my ear as his expert fingers slide inside me . . . nate groans and rocks againsther . she struggles to control herself as he thrusts himself in and out of her . oh my god - what am i doing ! ? i step back with a jolt as though i ' m coming out of a trance and almost trip over the hydrangea bush next to me in my haste to get away . i run as quickly and quietly as i can around the side of the house and to the door . i reach the front door and pray that nate is going to lock up later . i hear the knob turn and push the door open in seconds . i hurry up the curving staircase and down the hall into my room , kicking off my sandals , throwing myself onto my bed and burying my head in the pillow . i can feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment over what i just did and the instant attraction i felt . i ' ve had crushes before , but because of my obsession with nate . and even after just meeting him , only to have him kiss me and push my buttons , i still feel so incredibly attracted to him . i lift my head out of the pillow and go to the nightstand , pulling my dog - sized copy of lady chatterley ' s diary out of the top drawer . just as i ' m opening it to thefolded - up asleep , there ' s a quiet knock at my door . i drop my book on the bed and go to it , hoping and praying it ' s not nate . i almost jump when i push open the door and nate ' s face appears , outlined in the darkness of the room . he steps forward , leaning his shoulder against the door . i step back slightly . his brown hair is very dark , and his lips are curved in a slight smile . ` ` strictly speaking , does a peeping tom have to be outside , or inside ? or does the rule still apply if both , or all the , parties are outdoors ? ' ' he asks , calmly , tilting his chin up slightly as he considers me . ` ` i . . . . . didn ' t . . . ' ' i stammer , feeling heat crawl up the back of my neck . ` ` you . were . watching us , ' ' he accuses me , narrowing his eyes . ` ` i ' m sorry . i . didn ' t mean to . i just . . . i was looking at the river . . . how did you . . . ? ' ' ` ` i heard a twig snap and saw you running around like a drunkensorry . ' ' ` ` is dana - ? ' ' ` ` no , and i just ##n ' t see her . ' ' ` ` thank god . ' ' ` ` so ? what did you think ? ' ' he asks . ` ` oh , i ' m so sorry , again . i ' m so embarrassed , ' ' i go on . it strikes me that this is the first conversation i ' ve ever had with my new boyfriend . and it ' s about how i ' m a virgin . fantastic . ` ` ' are you watching me ? ' ' he asks , stepping forward into my room . i take a step away from him . ` ` um , no . . . i ' don ' t know . it just sort of happened . i ' didn ' t mean to . ' ' ` ` liar , ' ' he says lightly . ` ` liar . ' ' it comes out before i can stop myself . he shakes his head slightly . ` ` look , ' ' he levels at me . i look down . maybe i am a prude , but i ' don ' t want to be . ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' he asks . when i look back up at him , i seehim gazing past me , to my book on the nightstand . ` ` nothing , just a book , ' ' i say , but he ' s looking past me toward it . i hurry after him . he reaches the bed before me and picks up the book . ` ` see ? ' ' i say softly . ` ` i know what lady chatterley ' s book is about , ' ' he says , looking at me with a smug grin . 1 . ` ` maybe not such a prude after all , ' ' he adds , running his eyes up and down my body . i swallow hard .
