neither one of us has been with anybody in at least two years - we ' ve had time for the pill . ' ' ` ` that ' s all well and good but what about you ? are you on the pill ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' she chewed on her bottom lip momentarily . ` ` wait a minute , ' ' she said . in her head , she was counting down the days since her last period . ` ` twenty . ' ' ` ` twenty what ? ' ' ` ` i ' m on day twenty , so we should be safe . ' ' ` ` i ' ll soon find out . ' ' ` ` if you say so , ' ' she promised . gripping his biceps , she allowed him to cover her again with his body . she loved the feel of his chest hair brushing against her ni * * les . pesh widened her legs , and then he was inside her , filling and stretching her walls . it had been so long that she could couldn ' t help feeling a bit of a tingle . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' he groaned and lifted his hips , pushing back into her . this time they both moaned . setting up a rhythm , they began moving in and outof her . the kiss was slow and sensual , and while he was hitting all the right places , she wanted more . the entire time he moved in and out of her , he kept his eyes locked firmly on hers . his gaze was so filled with desire that she did ##n ' t dare look away . the longer she stared into his eyes , the more connected with him she felt . the old saying was that the eyes were connected to the soul , and she was getting a very good look into his . and that scared the hell out of her . wanting to make things less awkward , she gripped his biceps . ` ` harder , ' ' she panted . rising to his knees , he hooked his hands around the backs of her knees . this allowed him to pull her back against his pounding erection . where their kiss at first had been so intimate , this was all about passion and desire . she reached up and cupped his face in her hands , pulling his head down to hers . their mouths and tongues met in frenzied kisses . when he pulled out of her , megan gasped at the loss of feeling . he gently flipped her over onto her back . hands on her hips , he raised her up onto her knees . when he reentered her , megan moaned . with histhrust , and went deeper and deeper . her fingers fisted the sheets as he leaned over her back , kissing a trail down her spine . she did t ' t understand how he was able to kiss so many places at once . while his mouth licked her neck and teasingly left love bites , his hands kept rubbing her thighs and occasionally sliding under her to squeeze her br * * sts and rub her clit . he was giving her so much that she could ##n ' t remain silent . she moaned , screamed his name , and cried out as the sounds of their heated bodies slapped together . finally , she could n ' t take it anymore . bowing her head , she sank into the mattress as she found her release . when her muscles finished clenching , she felt pesh withdraw from her . as he did , megan felt warmth spurt onto her thighs and bu * * ocks . never seeing him come before , she wished she could ##n ' t see his face . he was so beautiful when he was near release . when he finished , she eased down onto her back and curled the pillow under her head . after a few minutes , pesh lay down beside her . she lifted her head and met his gaze . completely and completely sexually satisfied for the first time in her life , sheshe could muster to say was , ` ` wow . ' ' a slow smile spread across his cheeks . ` ` you seem to do that a lot around me after all . ' ' she laughed . ` ` that ' s because you render me absolutely speechless with your beauty . ' ' ` ` thank you . i could say the same about you . ' ' his gaze left her face and traveled down her na * * d body . ` ` we need to get you cleaned up . ' ' pulling her hand back , she said , ` ` i really like it . makes me feel special or something . ' ' he smiled down at her . ` ` i like the idea of owning you - making you mine . ' ' he wanted her to be his . she didn ##n ' t know quite what to think of that statement . did she want to be his ? she certainly could n ' t imagine belonging to anyone else . besides the amazing physical connection they shared , she was surprised to feel such a strong connection to him . looking up at him , she could couldn ' t help wondering what was going on in his mind . ` ` we ' ve already done that now , now haven ' t we ? ' ' ` ` yes , i have . that was the universal` ` ' ' ' that we just did , ' ' he said . she smacked his arm playfully . ` ` that ' s not what i meant . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' he said . ` ` no matter what , this changes everything . ' ' ` ` for the best , i suppose . ' ' ` ` i suppose . ' ' the truth was she ' d never even had casual sex before . there was one time her senior year that she hooked up with a guy from work .
