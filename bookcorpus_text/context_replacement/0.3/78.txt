he bit down on his lip to keep from laughing at her . he could n ' t believe megan was so upset with his family ' s opinion . his heart accelerated at the thought . it had to mean she really was falling in love with him . he brushed a silky strand of her hair out of her face . ` ` megan , you ' re not the first beautiful girl i ' ve brought home with me . ' ' ` ` yes , i ' m well aware of that . i ' m also aware of the fact of how much your family loved and accepted me . it will always be the same way with me . ' ' she looked up at him . ` ` i ' m not like her , pesh . i ' m just cruel and cold - hearted . ' ' he shook his head . ` ` that ' s not true . you are good - hearted . i see that side of you each and every day . ' ' cupping her chin with his hand , he lifted her gaze to his . ` ` you are my son , dev . despite all of his missteps and mistakes , my family still loves him very much . so i assure you there is nothing you can go to where they wo n ' t want you . where you ' ll feel shameon me . okay ? ' ' she gave a small nod . ` ` okay . ' ' taking her by the hand , he led her to the porch . once he ' d gotten her in the car , he went around and slid into the driver ' s seat . when pesh started up the car , megan gasped in horror . ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . she glanced to the clock on the dash . ` ` oh my god , we ' re going to be late . did i make a mistake first time ? ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` maybe i should teach you a few things , time travel , so things can go a little faster . ' ' ` ` what does that have to do with us being late ? ' ' ` ` because it ' s considered bad luck to arrive thirty minutes late . ' ' ` ` oh ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` huh , ' ' n ' you know that . ' ' ` ` well , how could you ? ' ' ` ` i was doing a little research . i only found the ##s , ' ' she admitted . pesh chuckled . ` ` did you really ? ' ' ` ` yeah , it was pretty boring . i kinda hated the were . 'no more phone calls and songs . ' ' ` ` megan , i ' m pretty sure none of my family is going to break out into song lyrics in a horror movie tonight , ' ' he said , with amusement ringing in his voice . she rolled her eyes . ` ` i did ##n ' t ask them to , smart - ass . ' ' he tsked at her . ` ` so not tonight . ' ' after exhaling a deep breath , she gave him an apologetic look . ` ` i ' m sorry i ' m so bitchy . ' ' ` ` you ' re always right . ' ' ` ` and you ' re lying . ' ' ` ` regardless of your out - of - control emotions , i know that my family is going to love you just as much as i do . ' ' the moment the words left his mouth he winced . there was the word family again . they had n ' t even said it yet , and somehow he ' d managed to screw up and say it before she could find the right words . ` ` oh god , do you have to say that now ? because i ' m not nervous enough ! ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he said . burying her face in her hands , she. . ` ` this is . . . you are . . . amazing . . . ' ' ` ` megan , you can ' t - ' ' ` ` i love you , too ! ' ' she said from behind her hands . his hands tightened on the wheel , and he sent the car spinning onto the left lane . when he stopped and put the car back into the right lane , he forced himself to look over at her . she peeked at him through her fingers . ` ` i love you , pesh . i really f * * king do . ' ' ` ` ' megan , ' ' he whispered . pulling her hands away from her face , she gave him a soft smile . ` ` i love you more than any woman i ' ve ever known . ' ' ` ` i love you more - ' ' but he found himself unable to continue . did he love her more than he had before ? he spent two years with jade and had only one with megan . if he did love megan more , what did that say about his relationship with jade ? she reached over and took one of his hands in hers . ` ` hey , you ' n ' t have to say what i mean . our lives are too different . ' ' he clenched and unclenchedhis jaw . ` ` every woman wants half a man ' s heart , ' ' he argued . ` ` but i know it is n ' t half your heart . and i would ##n ' t want you to stop loving me just because you do , so why would i want you to do the same with me ? ' ' ` ` it ' s not fair to you , ' ' he said . ` ` it ' s not fair , baby . you have to get used to that feeling . ' ' she squeezed his hand . ` ` look , i know what i feel when i feel your love . there ' s no half about it . you love me with all your heart and soul . ' '
