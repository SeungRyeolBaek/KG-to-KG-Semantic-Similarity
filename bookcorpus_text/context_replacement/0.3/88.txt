it all seemed pretty big to her for just an engagement party - it was almost like a wedding . ` ` it ' s show - stopping , ' ' pesh whispered in her ear as he stood up . she quickly followed his lead . he took one of the rose ##ttes from the table and placed it over her head . he made sure to arrange her hair so it fell over the flowers . when he was done , she did the same , although it was a little harder for her to look out over his head . then he took one of the wedding bands and placed it on her ring finger . ` ` i love you so very much , megan . there ' s not another woman in the world i could love like i love you , ' ' he whispered to reassure her . ` ` i love you very much , too . ' ' she gently slid the ring onto his finger . when it was done , they went out over the ballroom , and pesh pulled her to him for a kiss . ` ` ` what shall we do ? ' ' she asked . he smiled at her . ` ` we dance . ' ' after releasing the breath she had been holding , megan took pesh ' s hand and let him lead her to the dance floor . the moment sheshe never had before . her heart seemed to play from the dj . ` ` ' what were you thinking when it came to the wedding ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` something small . ' ' his eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` really ? i was hoping you would want to go all out . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` i just wanted something simple with our close friends and family . i ' don ' t want to do something big to make me nervous . ' ' he chuckled . ` ` you know that anything ' big ' is not going to set well with my parents . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` well , they ' re just going to have to accept it . ' ' ` ` we could always run away and get married in a church in mexico , ' ' she suggested . ` ` that idea has merit , but i think as my parents ' only daughter , they would hate me if they ' n ' t get to plan something . ' ' his eyes grew serious . ` ` i do n ' t want them to have to wait any longer . ' ' ` ` i agree . i want to get married in the next couple of weeks . ' ' she smiled . ` ` good . i ' m glad to hear that. ' ' when megan glanced up to see her grandfather dancing with his lady love , an idea popped into her head . ` ` what if we get married in papa ' s rose garden ? ' ' ` ` it sounds like a beautiful place , but is there enough room ? ' ' ` ` only our closest friends and family , right ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` it could be . ' ' ` ` so you like the idea ? ' ' ` ` i do . ' ' with a wink , he said , ` ` it makes sense since you proposed to me on patrick ' s day . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` that ' s right . it does . ' ' ` ` think we could put it all together in two weeks ? ' ' ` ` i do don ' t see why not . ' ' he brought his warm lips to hers , and megan shivered in spite of the heat of the dance floor . ` ` ` ca don ' t wait to make you my wife , ' ' he whispered against her lips . ` ` i ' m going to make an honest man out of you , too . ' ' pesh threw his head back and laughed . ` ` only you would say something like that . ' ' ` ` hey , the wedding isthe best . ' ' the introductions ended , and pesh led her back to their table . after they finished with the introductions from pesh ' s family , dinner was served . megan could couldn ' t eat all the food that was paraded by her . she lost count on how many plates of delicious indian food she ate . by the time the desserts came out , she was completely stuffed and could ##n ' t eat any . ` ` let ' s go mingle , ' ' she said when pesh never put down any food . ` ` sounds good to me , ' ' he replied , before getting out of his chair . they made their way through the maze of tables , talking to family and friends . megan was introduced to so many of pesh ' s friends that she was sure she would never be able to meet them all . when they finally got to the fitzgerald table filled with her parents and aunts and uncles , she was thrilled when pesh took a seat across from aidan and emma . after they had been seated for a while , emma approached aidan . ` ` do you think noah ' s okay ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` i ' m sure he ' s fine , babe . the family is very concerned . ' ' although emma washer head , megan could tell that she wasn n ' t convinced . both mason and emma were upstairs in the hotel with babysitters outside of their family for the first time in their adult lives . megan shared a bit of emma ' s apprehension , but when she finally dropped mason off in the lobby , he seemed to get along with the woman they had married . ` ` i might just go check in on him . you know , make sure she puts him to bed , ' ' emma said , rising out of her chair .
