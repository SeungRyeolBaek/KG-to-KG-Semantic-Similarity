how was it possible for her to remind him so much of what he had lost ? aidan grinned as he looked between the two of them . ` ` i want to introduce you to pesh nadeen , the godfather . ' ' holding out her hand , megan smiled up at him . ` ` it ' s very nice to finally meet you . ' ' aidan stared at it a moment before his good humor overcame his shock . he took her hand in his and shook it . ` ` it ' s very nice meeting you , too . ' ' ` ` i ' ll leave you two to get to know each other , ' ' aidan said . before pesh could respond , aidan turned and disappeared into the crowd . aidan turned to megan and began clearing his throat of what felt like a lack of emotion . he knew he should try to make polite conversation , but he was still completely shell - shocked by the way megan looked . thankfully , she took pity on him . ` ` aidan , emma tells me you ' re a doctor . ' ' pesh smiled politely . ` ` yes , i am . ' ' ` ` what type of services ? ' ' ` ` medical services . ' ' megan ' s eyes lit up . ` ` oh , how wonderful .i ' m about to start nursing school , and i ' ve applied for clinical training in the hospital . ' ' pesh widened his eyes in surprise . aidan had failed to mention that they had the medical profession in mind . ` ` really ? ' ' megan nodded . ` ` i ' m hoping to get accepted at grady , even though my parents would die a thousand deaths . ' ' he raised his eyebrows at her . ` ` i suppose they ' re afraid for your safety ? ' ' ` ` yes . they ca ##uld ' t help caring about the future . they sometimes forget i ' m an adult , rather than a child . ' ' ` ` what is it about grady that attracts you ? ' ' ` ` ' the fact that it ' s nationally recognized for its care ? ' ' he smiled . ` ` no , just the neighborhood . ' ' megan tilted her head in thought . ` ` i guess it ' s the fact i really want to feel like i ' m making a difference and saving lives . i know that at grady i would be doing some of the worst things imaginable , and in fact most people ' don ' n ' t have a lot of hope . ' ' he was taken aback by her words and the passion with which she deliveredthem . although she possessed a tough exterior , she also seemed to have a greater depth of feeling than he had ever experienced . he did ##n ' t often meet women like her . most of the women at the club who threw themselves at him had only superficial feelings . he did n ' t have to be with them very often to perceive their own shallowness and self - centeredness . to them , he was a battle to be won . he could ##n ' t ever imagine megan feeling that way . she was n ' t the type of woman to settle for a single man on her own - she wanted to make her own way in the world . ` ` it is so good to hear you speak with such passion for me . ' ' ` ` really ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` we desperately need more people like you . i think i would like to be with someone who shares your passion . ' ' she blushed at his compliments . he could n ' t help noticing what a beautiful smile she had . the way it framed her heart shaped face made her look much less like jade than he had originally thought . ` ` thank you . maybe we ' ll end up together . ' ' she licked her lips before saying , ` ` you know , in the same hospital. ' ' ` ` i would like that . but i ' m afraid that wellstar pale in comparison to grady . ' ' ` ` do the suburbs have some interesting possibilities ? ' ' ` ` they do . i ' ve lived here since my residency , and i could n ' t imagine living anywhere else . after all , i would ##n ' t be sitting here today with you if it were n ' t for wellstar and your father . ' ' ` ` that ' s true . ' ' tilting her head , she gave him a very alluring smile . ` ` and what a pity that would be if our paths weren ##n ' t crossed . ' ' he sucked in a breath at the directness of her statement . could she possibly be interested in him ? sure , it was common knowledge that aidan and others wanted them to get married , but he had assumed that she had not known their intentions . and while originally he had been put off by aidan ' s idea of fixing them up , he could couldn ' t help but be intrigued now . there was something so refreshingly different about megan , despite her physical similarities to aidan . ` ` megan ! ' ' a familiar voice called . pesh glanced over megan ' s shoulder where a fair - haired toddlercame bounding over . he wrapped his arms around megan ' s waist . she gave him an apologetic look before sitting down . ` ` what ' s the matter , baby ? ' ' he grinned up at her . ` ` miss you . ' ' with a smile , she walked over and picked him up . when he settled on her lap , she turned her attention back to pesh . ` ` this is my son , aidan . ' ' pesh could n ' t help noticing how megan studied his face to see if there was any judgment or even surprise at her having a son .
