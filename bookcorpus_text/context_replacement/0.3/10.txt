` ` i kinda got carried away . with me not working anymore , the whole pr and pr side of me let loose . and with my connections , i was able to get everything right done . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` everything was perfect . you waited so long to have a baby that it made sense you might go a little overboard . ' ' emma wrinkled her nose . ` ` i always wanted to be one of those girls who threw the over - the - top parties . ' ' when casey started to open her mouth , megan nudged her playfully . ` ` he ' s just bringing the food , right ? ' ' emma nodded . ` ` they set the tables , emma . ' ' ` ` ' i think you ' re far from being a momzilla - girl . . . for now . ' ' casey nodded . ` ` i ' ll anxiously be awaiting mason ' s sixteenth birthday party . ' ' with a scowl , emma said , ` ` okay . ' ' realizing she still couldn ' t see mason , megan quickly excused herself and went outside . she did don ' t like the idea of him being close to the party . even with everyone around , it was far too private for her anyway . just as her head began to hurt, she placed him in her papa ' s lap . the two of them sat at one of the tables under the shade of a massive tree . several of her much younger siblings sat around them , playing on their psps and other hand - held devices . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' she asked . ` ` we ' re fine , mama , ' ' papa replied . ` ` let me know if he gets to drink too much . ' ' cocking his head , papa asked , ` ` are you trying to say i ' m boring or something ? ' ' ` ` no , not at all . he ' s a handful enough for me . ' ' papa waved her off with a hand wrinkled with age and age . ` ` go on and enjoy yourself . i ' ll keep an eye on him . ' ' she smiled and leaned over to kiss his weathered cheek . ` ` thanks , papa . ' ' he returned her kiss . ` ` you know , if you ' re enjoying yourself , you should go spend a little time with the godfather . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . was he going to set her up with pesh like he had with emma ? he gave her a warm smile . ` ` be happy for both of you . ' '` ` um , sure . thanks , papa , ' ' she said , before she walked away . although she hated to admit it , she had been looking forward to talking to pesh today . she had tried to kid herself that she had hadn ' t actually been scanning the room for him when she was taking in all of emma ' s decorations . when she did finally catch sight of him , her own heart skipped a beat . she would don ' t mind if her body gave a damn , but it pissed her off that her heart was affected by him as well . he ' d removed his suit jacket along with his shirt . with the first button of his shirt undone , she could see a hint of dark chest hair . she bit her lip at the sight . she was a sucker for chest hair . her gaze dipped down to take in how the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to his elbows , giving just a glimpse of his bulging biceps . casey had been so right - he was built like a brick shithouse . megan wanted nothing more than to be better acquainted with his body , especially with the clothes on him . at the sound of emma ' s voice behind her , she jumped . ` ` ready to eat ? ' ' emma asked . `` um , sure . ' ' emma gave her a puzzled look before nodding in pesh ' s direction . ` ` why ' s ' d you ask pesh to meet you at aidan ' s and my place ? he ' doesn ' t know a lot of people , and i would hate to see him end up with the girls . ' ' megan quirked her brows in question . ` ` are you sure ? ' ' ` ` why would n ' t i be ? ' ' with a shrug , megan replied , ` ` i do n ' t know . maybe because you did n ' not like the idea of me getting to know him . ' ' emma shook her head . ` ` i never said i did n ' t want you getting to get to know each other - never said i did don ' t want you meeting him for a fling . ' ' megan could n ' t help rolling her eyes . ` ` the day is ain ' t over yet . i could always call on my powers of seduction and lure pesh into a night of raw passion . ' ' emma stared at her in shock before bursting out laughing . ` ` seedy sex ? those words and pesh would never , ever go together in the same sentence . ' ' `` are you saying that you and aidan have never had casual sex ? ' ' ` ` aidan and pesh are not in the same league of gentlemen . i like aidan , but he ' s not necessarily a gentleman . pesh is . ' ' ` ` yeah , but you ' re a freak , ' ' megan teased . ` ` maybe in the street , but she ' s a bit of a freak in the bedroom , ' ' aidan muttered behind them . emma squealed , whirling around to face him . ` ` i could see you , ' ' she admonished . while aidan chuckled , megan shook her head .
