she ' d made a repeated fool out of herself the night before , and he still wanted to see her ? ` ` you ca ##v ' er be serious . ' ' ` ` i am . ' ' she gave a slight jerk of her head . ` ` i ca ##n ' er think that is a good idea . ' ' ` ` but what ? ' ' he asked quickly . with a contemptuous snort , she said , ` ` is ##n ' t it obvious ? ' ' ` ` if you ' re referring to the fact you both got drunk last night and then became drunk , that has no relevance to me . accidents happen , and i ' m sober enough to realize that . ' ' he closed the distance between them . ` ` i liked being with you better . ' ' remembering what emma had said , megan could n ' er imagine asking , ` ` you want to see me , ' don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` ` of course . what else would i want to do ? ' ' when she said , ` ` have sex , ' ' a blush stained his cheeks . ` ` that is not what i meant . ' ' ` ` and that ' s a lie . ' ' his brows furrowed . ` ` what do you mean ? '' ` ` you and i . . . we want different things . you want to date and get married someday , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , that is something i desire very much . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` ` i do don ' t want to be in a serious relationship right now with you or anyone for that matter . i ' m certainly not ready to get married anytime soon . i just want to have some time with someone . ' ' pesh frowned . ` ` i ' n ' t think i understand . ' ' ` ` what i want from you is the same thing i wanted last night . just sex , ' ' she answered honestly . ` ` you do n ' t want to date and . . . you only want to have sex with me ? ' ' if the situation had e ' er been so dire , megan might ' ve laughed at the stunned expression on pesh ' s face . she was completely floored that she could even think of her using him as a sex object . then , when she pulled herself together , she shook her head . ` ` i ' m sorry , but that ' s the way i feel . ' ' she braced herself for some sort of reaction out of him or maybe a lecture . whatit really was even more surprising . he gave her a warm smile . ` ` and i ' m glad you feel that way because i would have really enjoyed getting to know you better . ' ' without another word , he opened the door . always the gentleman , he gestured for her to pass him first . lowering her chin to her chest , she bypassed him to walk to the car . once there , he appeared to open the car door for her . ` ` thank you , ' ' she murmured . he nodded before walking around the front of the car . without another word to her , pesh buckled up , and then began backing down the driveway . the ride to aidan and emma ' s was only twenty minutes , but it seemed to take an eternity . the painful silence hung heavy around her . pesh did don ' t look at her . instead , he kept his gaze firmly on the road ahead of them . when he pulled into aidan and emma ' s driveway , megan felt her heart break . she wished there was some way to make things right between them . but she had a feeling she had gone too far and said too much . when he put the car in park , he turned to look at her . ` ` thank you for the ride , ' ' she said. ` ` you ' re welcome . it was my pleasure . ' ' ` ` first of all , i want to thank you for taking care of me last night . you truly went above and beyond . i could never thank you enough . ' ' ` ` you do don ' t have to thank me . i ' m glad i was able to help you . ' ' chewing on her bottom lip , she finally allowed herself to say what she was holding back on . ` ` i wish things could be different , ' ' she said softly . when she dared herself to look at him , she found him staring down at her . ` ` i ' m sorry , too . take care of yourself . okay ? ' ' she bobbed her head . ` ` the same to you . ' ' with shaking hands , she fumbled for the door handle . when she was finally able to open the door , she stumbled out onto the porch . as she made her way up the driveway , she could feel pesh ' s eyes on her . the car was gone . she climbed the porch steps and rang the doorbell . she hoped that he was already up , and she was n ' er with the baby . aidan threw open the door . ` ` megan ? what the hell ? ' 'she asked . his question and answer caused her to burst into tears . ` ` why are you crying ? ' ' aidan asked . ` ` it ' s a long story . ' ' aidan looked from her out the window to pesh ' s face . his expression softened . ` ` did pesh hurt you ? ' ' ` ` no ! of course not . ' ' ` ` if he ' s making you cry , i ' n ' t care whether he ' s noah ' s ark or not . i ' ll blow his brains out ! ' '
