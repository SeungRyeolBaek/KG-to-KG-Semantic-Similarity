his world is already falling apart around him , and i ' don ' t want to see it happen again . i sigh . i should probably go back to my room . i turn over with a start and frown . my sheets are different , and the light coming in from the window is much too bright . i blink my eyes open and then sit up with a start . i ' m in nate ' s room . ` ` it ' s me . ' ' i look over to see nate sitting at his desk with a glass of water , his dark hair sticking up at odd angles . ` ` they left early this morning for work . your door is locked , so they thought you were still asleep in there . ' ' ` ` oh , good , ' ' i reply . i realize my nightgown is riding up high on my hips and lift up the sheet self - consciously . ` ` coffee , ' ' nate says , pointing to the bedside table next to me . i look over and see he ' s putting a paper cup there . ` ` cream and one sugar , right ? ' ' ` ` yes , please , ' ' i reply , reaching for it . ` ` sorry about last night . i ' ##n ' t want anything after i got home .' ' i nod , though i ' m sure that he probably don ' t remember the kiss . ` ` you were asleep , and just asked me to stay up for a bit . i did ##n ' t want to fall asleep . ' ' i glance at the clock . ` ` shit , it ' s almost eleven ? i never sleep that late . ' ' ` ` i did ##n ' t get up ' til eleven - that ' s enough for me . ' ' my mind immediately returns to my conversation from last night . ` ` nate - i know you ' don ' t want to talk about this , but your mom - ' ' ` ` what about her ? ' ' he asks , already feeling defensive . i decide to tread carefully . ` ` i know that she ' s hard to talk about , i just wanted to ask : why did she leave ? ' ' nate crosses his arms over his chest . ` ` eileen left because she could n ' t handle being a parent . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? how so ? ' ' ` ` i was out of control when i was a kid , and she could ##n ' t handle it . could ##n ' t handle it . ' ' ` ` that ' s what your dad told you . '' ` ` that ' s what happened , ' ' nate replies , frowning at me . ` ` i still remember the day she left . they went out for dinner , and i went home with the babysitter . one of them , because i was driving them away , and they tried again . i threw a punch , broke a nose . . . i ' m pretty sure the kids left as soon as my parents got home . anyway , they got in this big fight - i could hear it even in my head - and the next day she left . ' ' ` ` and you ' ve never seen her since ? ' ' ` ` in court a few times . but after that , she was n ' t really interested in seeing me . she tries to call me sometimes , but she feels bad . she even tries to blame my parents for what went down , ' ' he adds bitterly . ` ` do you think that if . . . if you had been there , she would n ' i have left ? ' ' he asks . ` ` does n ' it matter now . why are you asking me this now ? did we talk about it when i was younger or something ? ' ' ` ` well , yeah . ' ' i putmy head rests on the nightstand . ` ` she was here last night . ' ' ` ` eileen ? you talked to her ? ' ' ` ` well , yeah , she sounded really upset . ' ' ` ` jesus , brynn , ' ' he says , standing up . ` ` why would you do that ? this has nothing to do with you . ' ' ` ` i was just trying to help . . . ' ' ` ` i ' don ' t need your help , ' ' he snaps at me . ` ` would you please stop for a second ? ! she called because she thought you might be willing to talk to her after what the woman said on the tv show - ' ' ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' he snaps . ` ` she said your dad was cheating on her , that ' s why she called . nothing to do with you . ' ' ` ` get out , ' ' he says , dropping his hands and walking to the door . ` ` nate , my mom is , too , ok ? i know what it ' s like . sometimes she is so scared , she ' s afraid to talk to you . i ' d kill for my mom to sound like that to me . ' ' ` ` nate ,so that ' s what this is about , your daddy issues . ' ' ` ` no ! that ' s not what i meant , ' ' i cry , his words stinging to my core . ` ` look , i ' m sorry that your dad is isn ' t here , but your current situation has nothing to do with him ! ' ' ` ` no ! ' ' i scream , feeling defeated . i kick off the covers and stand up . ` ` i told her i ' d find you , and i did . i ' ll never have to see you again . ' ' ` ` that ' s all i ask ! ' ' he calls after me as i storm out of his room . i slam my bedroom door behind me , my fists balled in frustration .
