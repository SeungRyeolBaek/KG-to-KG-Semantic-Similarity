` ` i ' m lavani . it ' s nice to meet you . ' ' ` ` nice meeting you , too , ' ' megan replied . the room immediately fell into an awkward silence . pesh looked around , willing someone to say something . his mother cleared her throat . ` ` i ' ll go and clean up here . ' ' as she walked into the kitchen , shveta stopped her , along with arjan ' s mother . since it was customary for everyone to be in the kitchen , pesh expected it to be after megan left with the food . what did wasn ' t possible without her , however . ` ` should i go and offer to help ? ' ' she asked , in a whisper . ` ` sure . that would be nice . ' ' her eyes told him that she really did n ' not want to leave his side , but she left anyway . once she was out of sight , pesh found everyone ' s eyes on him . ` ` what ? ' ' charlie chuckled . ` ` you would dare to ask , my son ? ' ' ` ` just ask your mother and get it over with before megan comes back in here , ' ' he replied , as he dropped onto the couch . they began a barrage of questions .where they were , how long they had been seeing each other , and how bad was it . he used as much patience as he could to tell them everything . when he was done , the men sat there in stunned silence . ` ` i never thought i would see the day , ' ' his father mused . sanjay shook his head . ` ` no , i knew the day would come . i knew that when i went out with emma . ' ' charlie ' s brows furrowed . ` ` emma ? ' ' pesh pinched his eyes shut and wished his sister - in - law . ##n ' ' ##was such a good memory . ` ` just a friend . ' ' with a snort , sanjay said , ` ` you certainly did ##n ' t look at her like she was a whore , even if she was pregnant . ' ' ` ` you slept with a pregnant woman ? ' ' charlie asked . ` ` alpesh how could you ? ' ' his mother asked from the couch . ` ` how could i what ? ' ' pesh asked . lavani ' s expression was horror stricken . ` ` with a woman . . . in the family way . ' ' pesh jumped off the couch . he looked from his mother to where megan stood . ` ` you' you . . . ? ' ' he could n ' t even form the words . megan ' s face flushed blood red . ` ` no ! of course , i ' m not ! ' ' lavani gave him a confused look . ` ` ' her , ' ' she repeated , looking at megan . ` ` this emma that sanjay speaks of . ' ' putting his hand to his forehead , he rubbed it to try to ward off the headache that was starting to form in his head . everything had just blown to hell so fast . ` ` first of all , emma and i were never together . she was living with the man she is now married to . yes , i took her to the opera with sanjay and shveta , but there was nothing really between us . ' ' he shook his head and could couldn ' t help wondering if he would ever have to finish explaining what had happened between him and emma . ` ` second of all , could everyone just back off for a minute ? i mean , you ' re not exactly giving megan a very good idea of our relationship . ' ' a nervous laugh escaped from megan ' s lips . she covered her mouth with her hand , trying to hide her smile . he winked at her , and she turned her head to smiledamn him . ` ` fine , then . now that we ' ve cleared all that up , what ' n ' bout we eat ? ' ' lavani suggested . ` ` that sounds good , ' ' charlie said . as they made their way into the dining room , pesh went to megan ' s side . ` ` you surviving today ? ' ' he asked . ` ` i ' m hanging in there . i may need a drink when we finish . ' ' ` ` ` no silver tequila for you , ' ' she replied . without the others hearing her , megan smacked his arm . ` ` sorry , ' ' she hissed under her breath . he chuckled as he held out the chair for megan . ` ` thank you , ' ' she said , sitting down . he then slid in beside her . as the others were making their way to the table , he felt megan kick him . when he glanced at her in surprise , she asked , ` ` where is the food ? ' ' ` ` we eat with our hands . ' ' ` ` seriously ? ' ' ` ` seriously . ' ' he leaned over to whisper in her ear . ` ` ' ' n ' you use your other hand because it ' s too weak . ' ' she jerked back to starewide - eyed at him . ` ` i ' m left out , ' ' she protested . he resisted the urge to smile at her again . he could tell that she would rather die than do something to embarrass him in front of his family . ` ` you ' ll be fine . they wo ##n ' t expect as much out of you since you ' re here . ' ' ` ` alpesh , what is it that you ' re whispering about ? ' ' lavani asked , narrowing her eyes at him . ` ` i was just telling megan what a great cook you are . she loves indian food , so i ' m sure she ' s up for a treat . ' '
