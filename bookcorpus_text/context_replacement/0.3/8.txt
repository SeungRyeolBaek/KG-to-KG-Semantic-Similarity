mason felt neither of those emotions . he had to admit he was a little surprised . aidan had forgotten to mention that fact as well . not to mention , she was studying to be a doctor , considering she was just finishing her clinicals . ` ` it ' s nice to meet you , mason . ' ' ` ` did you tell pesh that ? ' ' megan urged . ` ` yes , esh , ' ' mason replied , with a smile . pesh could ' ' not contain himself , and he was thankful that megan could as well . ` ` how old are you ? ' ' mason held up two fingers to which megan shook her head . ` ` he ' s nine now . ' ' pesh smiled . ` ` you must be very proud of him . ' ' ` ` i am . ' ' she snuggled mason against her chest . ` ` he ' s the brightest and best boy you could ever ask for . ' ' ` ` you ' re very blessed . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' they were interrupted by aidan ' s mother , angie , who pesh had met earlier . ` ` looks like it ' s time to go . come on girls . mommy has to go be mason ' s mother soon . ' 'mason then went to his grandmother . ` ` be good for grammy , ' ' megan instructed . as angie walked out with mason , the other family members began filing out of the room . pesh turned to megan and gave her a sheepish smile . ` ` i must admit that even though i attended a wedding with emma , i ' m a little unsure of what i ' m going to do . ' ' ` ` it ' s okay . just follow my lead , and you ' ll be fine . ' ' ` ` thank you . ' ' once there was only the three of them and aidan and emma in the room , aidan called for them . a priest in decorated white robes appeared at the door with a gleaming cross in his hands . pesh tried not to look on as the odd man out in the room . music came out of the radio , and the priest motioned for them to leave . before they went out the door , emma looked over at noah . ` ` noah , please , do not go in there and act like a demon again . be the angel i know you can be . ' ' he acknowledged her request by sticking his tongue out and clenching his fists . aidan laughed at emma ' s reaction . ` ` please , noah . ifhe feels you getting so emotional , he ' s going to be upset . ' ' emma nodded . ` ` he ' s already fussy . he was fine until we put him in the gown . ' ' ` ` i think he feels that wearing a gown is hazardous to his health , ' ' aidan said with a chuckle . when emma shot aidan a death glare , megan and pesh could couldn ' t help laughing at the two of them . aidan winked at emma before starting out the door . at megan ' s side , pesh walked down the aisle . when they reached the marble font , the music stopped , and the priest began speaking . he informed the congregation of what was about to take place and the significance of all the religious rites noah was about to undergo . aidan and emma made the sign of the cross on noah ' s chest . megan leaned in to do the same . when megan elbowed him , pesh walked over to help take their hands . after he did , he glanced at megan . she smiled and said , ` ` good job . ' ' he returned her smile . they sat through the rest of the service as aidan and emma worked to raise noah in the gown . when it came time for him and megan to return toand , noah , godparents . the priest took over taking noah from emma ' s arms . when the first drop of water reached the back of noah ' s neck , he cooed and rubbed his arms and legs . emma was relieved at how he was wasn ' t behaving like a normal baby like she had assumed . ` ` thank god he found his mother , ' ' aidan muttered beside pesh . once the baptism part was finished , the priest made his final announcement , and then it was over . just as pesh sighed with relief and was looking forward to making a quick exit , aidan grabbed his arm . ` ` do don ' t go anywhere . we have to do pictures . ' ' inwardly , he groaned . he wanted , knew he needed , a moment alone to process his thoughts . everything had been so overwhelming - being outside his usual circle , meeting all of aidan ' s family , and then having the subject of megan thrown in as well . instead , he stood frozen as a photographer came forward and proceeded to take several pictures of aidan , emma , and noah . either it was just aidan and noah or emma and noah . ` ` okay , we want the godparents pictures . ' ' pesh smoothed down his tie and allowed theand to pose him for the wedding shot . after they finished with the three of them , he was handed to megan for pictures with just the godparents . as the photographer tucked megan up against pesh ' s side , he glanced down at her . her shy smile caused his heart to accelerate . for the first time , he inhaled the sweet aroma of her hair . the long , blonde strands brushed against him . he could also make out the alluring scent of her perfume .
