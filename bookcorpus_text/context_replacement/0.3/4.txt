` ` oh , that ' s right . thank you so very much for bringing up that aspect of our break - up , today of all days . ' ' casey grabbed noah ' s shoulders and hoisted up his little body to put on the new shoes . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ` ` anyway , as you were saying , ' ' megan continued . ` ` okay . so it was when aidan and i were growing up that i met pesh . i was with your father on the day of his heart attack at the hospital , and pesh was the doctor who treated him . ' ' ` ` so . . . you two struck up a friendship then ? ' ' megan asked . emma shrugged . ` ` not exactly . you see , patrick wanted to get aidan to really fight for me , and i felt the best way to do that would be for him to have some friends . ' ' megan asked her eyes widening in surprise . ` ` he wants pesh to like you ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` do you ? ' ' emma was momentarily distracted by casey blowing raspberries on noah ' s stomach . a smile spread across her face . noah kicked his legs and looked at casey . ` ` want me tokeep him in his pants ? ' ' casey asked , as she turned around . ` ` if you do ##n ' ' no . ' ' pressing her hand to her chest , megan huffed out an exasperated breath . ` ` um , could you please stop for just a minute considering the bomb you just dropped on me ? ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . i just don ' t want to tell you at first . i mean , whatever happened between us was all in the past . neither one of us really cared for each other like we thought we did . ' ' ` ` thank you . . . ' ' megan said . at emma ' s confused look , she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively . emma ' s face flushed . ` ` no , of course not ! ' ' casey eyed emma as she took the baptism gown off the hanger . ` ` you did make out with him once . ' ' ` ` one time . and we just did n ' t get to the point , ' ' emma said . with a sly grin , casey said , ` ` pity . wish you could remind me of what he has going on below the waist . ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' she took the dress away from casey and walkedstarted pressing kisses into the yards of fabric . ` ` it was wasn ' t like we were in a relationship . we did ##n ' t not to go out much . he came to the house once to bring me dinner and check on me when i was on bed rest , and then he took me to the movies . that was it . ' ' ` ` was there any chemistry between you two ? ' ' megan asked . without thinking , emma pulled noah up into a sitting position and started fastening the row of buttons on the back of the gown . ` ` em ? ' ' megan pressed . she heaved a deep sigh before picking noah up . she looked into his eyes before she responded . ` ` we had incredible chemistry together . he was an amazing kisser who got all my senses up and down in all the right ways . on the physical part , he was smart , funny , and intelligent - any woman ' s dream . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` but it did don ' t matter because he was n ' t aidan . i could never , ever love another man like i do him . ' ' giving noah a kiss on the cheek , she added , ` ` neither one of us were really in a good relationship - i was trying to make surethat aidan really was the man , and after being pressured by family and friends , he was able to date for the first time since his wife ' s death . ' ' megan crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` i get that he does don ' t need to get married , but who is to say that having a fling is going to help him ? maybe you could give him the confidence he needs to go out and find the real woman of his dreams ? ' ' casey snorted . ` ` how could a man that looks like that have any self - confidence issues ? ' ' megan shrugged . ` ` you never know . if he was married a long time before his wife died , he might find it hard to get back into the dating world . especially if the last person he cared about was someone else . ' ' emma shook her head . ` ` trust me , he ' n ' t the marrying kind of guy . he has a wife and children . ' ' although megan had a son , she was wasn ' t quite ready for that . not in a few years . right now she just wanted to date and have fun . she ' d already done so much to ensure that aidan could have all of her , since he was still a bachelor . after all , hewas the greatest hurdle in her pursuing a serious relationship . she did n ' t want to open her husband up to the hurt that would come from him becoming attached to a man she loved only to have them disappear when they broke up . ` ` ' ##n wants to break aidan up ? ' ' megan asked . emma nodded . ` ` regardless of what happened with pesh when we were broken up , aidan does love and admire him . he wants pesh to be happy . ' '
