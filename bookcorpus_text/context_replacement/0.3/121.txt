` ` lift your leg higher . ' ' she lifted her other leg and i pulled back far enough to fill up my c * * k with her pu * * y . i slid in and held still pulling her more firmly against my front . ` ` i ' m not going to f * * k you again baby , we ' ll just stay like this until you fall asleep , you need your man to stay inside you to keep the pain away . ' ' i was suddenly very tired , and it was n ' not long before i fell asleep to the sound of her breathing evenly in me . in the morning , i awakened to her leaning her ass back against me with my c * * k still buried inside her . with my hand on her hip , i controlled the pace . ` ` will you fuck me hard or do you want me to go slow baby ? ' ' i nipped her neck as she sucked my cock . ` ` harder , much harder . ' ' ` ` fuck what baby ? ' ' she did don ' t answer as i reached around and pinched her nipple . ` ` tell me or i ' ll stop . ' ' i held still and she continued to f * * k herself on my cock . i pulled back as if i was going toleave her alone . ` ` noooo , baby , just . . . fuck me harder . ' ' yeah , i think that shit backfired , my man , because her sexy voice saying those words twisted something inside me . leaning up on my elbow i reached my hand around and pinched her nipple . ` ` put your hands behind my neck . ' ' she complied with my order and i lowered my head to her nipple . she screamed and went off like a rocket from the intense stimulation , or was it pain ? i f * * ked into her mouth . i played with her clit and pinched her nipple . i wanted my son or daughter looking at her perfect tits some day . and the next time her pu * * y tightened around me , i shot off inside her . it was harder than i imagined it would be to leave her the next day . chapter twelve for the next two weeks , we stayed hidden away in our woman ' s bedroom . each day , i went back to work and left her alone . and each night , i came home and after dinner , f * * ked her into the wee hours of the morning . when it was time for her to go back to work , i thought i would lose my f * * king mind . ii n ' t want to share her with anyone . i knew it was selfish ; she had a life , a career that she loved . ` ` i want you to move in here with me . ' ' she did ##n ' t sound too certain , still fighting those doubts i had . ` ` scratch that , i ' ll send a service over to help you clean up , but when you get home this evening your sorry ass will be here . ' ' i left before she could give me an argument . i was pissed off the whole time and did ##n ' t ask questions . for the last three weeks , i could pick up the phone and call her whenever i wanted . now she was busy with her job . i did don ' t like it one f * * king bit . when had i become this person ? i knew that what i felt for this girl was stronger than i ' d ever felt before , but still , this overpowering need to possess her completely , to dominate her completely , was new to me . her next show was out of town and she would won ' t be able to make it because of the timing . i was going to be without her for two weeks while she was in the studio for her eight night run . she ' d been ato the studio to rehearse the next couple of days and onto the end of our time together , but she ' d been busy in the evenings . she never mentioned what if anything her father had said about the arrangement , but that could be because i ' d let her know one day when she decided to drop the subject that i really did didn ' t give a f * * k . i saw her as soon as i opened the door that evening . good , that meant i did don ' t have to hunt her down and drag her ass back home . i ' d half expected her to follow my order to be here when i got back . there were boxes in the living room and i breathed a little easier . looked like i was starting my period after all . ` ` hey ! ' ' she was in the kitchen when i walked in on her . she obviously hadn ' t heard me because she had clothes on . putting them on , she looked up at me with her usual shy smile . i knew she was fretting again about where we were going . i imagine moving in here with me was a big step for her . she ' d never lived with a man before , and i had to keep reminding myself that she was not yet. ` ` did everything go okay with the landlord ##s ? ' ' ` ` yeah , i still have some stuff to bring over and it will have to go into storage . ' ' ` ` did they give you any trouble with the lease ? ' ' ` ` uh , that . . . i ' m not sure that i ' na give up the house just yet . ' ' he just looked at her without saying anything . ` ` when i asked you to move in here , did you think i meant for a few months or something ? ' '
