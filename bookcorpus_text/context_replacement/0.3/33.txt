` ` i thought you guys would never get here . i ' m sorry . ' ' emma smiled . ` ` sorry . they were a little busy at the hair salon . ' ' they walked through the front door and were immediately greeted by the hostess who wished them well . once they eased into a familiar , comfortable booth , they took stock of the menus . ` ` you have to order food on our behalf since we ' re both pretty grown - up right now , ' ' casey said . megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` i still don ' t know you were pregnant . ' ' casey laughed . ` ` well , nate finally wore me down . ' ' she slowly shook her head . ` ` ' i think he ' s the chick in this relationship . ' ' ` ` he must ' ve taken some real time , ' ' megan said . with a nod , casey said , ` ` he comes from such a large extended and extended family that he ' s actually wanting to have a child . we ' ve been married a year and together eight , so i guess it is about time . and while i was wasn ' t thrilled with the idea of having a baby when his schedule is so busy , his hours will be better by the time the baby comeshere . ' ' ` ` when are you due ? ' ' ` ` at the same time , emma . ' ' that answer made emma beam . ` ` our kids are going to be best friends , emma . i just know it . ' ' casey beamed at the sentiment . ` ` ' boyfriend and girlfriend . . . ' ' ` ` that ' s a no . ' ' emma tipped her chin up . ` ` i ' m not sure i want your son with my little girl . ' ' with her dark eyes widening , casey asked , ` ` and what if it ' s my daughter that your son is with ? ' ' emma laughed . ` ` if my son takes after his father , then that would be the case . but i think we both need to consider that if your daughter is anything like you , she ' ll be the one doing the parenting . ' ' casey laughed . ` ` that ' s true . ' ' ` ` guess i should make that clear of her father , huh ? ' ' megan said , with a smile . ` ` probably , ' ' emma agreed . after the waitress arrived to take their drinks and drink orders , casey fixed megan with an icy stare . ` ` so , ' ' she began , "her brow pierced megan . ` ` i hear your doing your clinicals under dr . mcdreamy now . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help but smile . ` ` if you say i ' m doing them under dr . nadeen , then the answer is yes . ' ' emma nibbled on her bottom lip before answering . ` ` have things gotten awkward considering what happened the night of noah ' s baptism ? ' ' before megan could answer , casey ' s eyes widened . ` ` whoa , whoa . hold the fort . something happen between you two ? ' ' megan felt heat rise to her cheeks . it was almost too embarrassing to admit , but still , she filled casey in on each and every little detail that had happened . ` ` god , he ' s so freakin ' handsome , is isn ' t he ? ' ' casey laughed . ` ` yes , he is , ' ' megan agreed , glumly . emma shook her head . ` ` there ' s nothing wrong with his honor . that ' s what drew me to him in the first place . there are so few men left on the planet . ' ' before she could stop herself , megan said , ` ` ' i did don ' t want a man . i wanted to belaid . ' ' casey snorted . ` ` ' n ' t we all ? ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` just when i thought your pregnancy might have hadn ' t made you even more sex crazed , you go and say something like that , ' ' she grumbled . megan twirled the straw in her diet coke bottle . ` ` what ' s funny is even though i should have been completely and totally put off by what happened that night , he ' s still interested in me . i mean , the man is gorgeous and has all of the women in the hospital panting over him , and he still wants me . ' ' ` ` ' what ' s the problem ? ' ' emma asked . ` ` he ' s interested in me , not sex . ' ' emma ' s brow furrowed . ` ` why would ##n ' t you want sex eventually if you were dating ? ' ' megan shrugged . ` ` we ' re at a crossroads - i just want casual sex without alcohol and a movie , and to please him , he wants to show me a whole new world through a movie . ' ' ` ` how sweet of him , ' ' casey quipped to which emma shot her an annoyed look . with a shrug , megan said , ` ` basicallywe ' re going to spend forever in the twilight zone because neither one of us is going to give in . ' ' ` ` would it really kill you to go out with the guy ? ' ' casey asked . megan widened her eyes in surprise . ` ` you mean , you of all people are actually advocating me giving in to him ? ' ' she jerked her thumb up at emma . ` ` i ' d like that much of her , not you . ' ' casey dabbed the corners of her mouth with her napkin . ` ` it ' s just a date . i ' n ' t think he ' s going to drug you and drag you to the wedding reception . ' '
