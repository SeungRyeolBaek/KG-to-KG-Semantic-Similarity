` ` no , i want to . not just for you , though . for nate . he needs you in his life . i can tell that you ' re wonderful , and kind , and he needs someone like that to help him . please let me help you . ' ' ` ` i do don ' t want to put you in a position . . . i do n ' t want to jeopardize anything . you and nate , you have a great friendship . ' ' ` ` um , well , yeah , he ' s a great guy , ' ' i whisper . ` ` brynn . . . it ' s okay . i know . ' ' i nod . ` ` know what ? ' ' ` ` when i saw you that day on the beach , i could just tell . at first i thought you were his girlfriend , and then i realized who you were , and i saw the way you two looked at each other . you ' re in trouble , ' ' she whispers . i begin to tug at my hair again . shit . shit . ` ` you ' ve acted on your feelings ? ' ' it ' s all i can do to answer . ` ` do your parents know ? ' ' i shake my head . ` ` brynn ,you do n ' not need to be afraid . life ' s short . people find love wherever they can . besides , it ' s not like you ' re breaking any rules . ' ' my tears begin to slip down my cheeks slowly , silently . ` ` i ca n ' t believe it ' s so obvious . ' ' ` ` maybe i just caught you two in an awkward moment . but , honey , if nate and you are together , i do n ' not want to come between you . ' ' ` ` honestly , i ' d like him to meet you . i think it might do him some good . when pierce was chewing me out earlier , he did n ' t say anything . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' ` ` ` you ' ll meet with him ? ' ' ` ` if you ' re sure it ' s ok with you . ' ' ` ` i ' m not sure how i ' ll set it up then , but write down your address for me , and i ' ll be in touch with you when i know . ' ' she nods and pulls a slip of paper from the envelope lying in the back seat . as she hands it to me and i get out of the car , she looks up intothe passenger asks . ` ` brynn , if i could just give you a little time . . . i would avoid pierce for the next few days . he does not ' t like it when i stand up to him . ' ' i turn and shut the door , walking slowly back to the kitchen as i run my fingers over her phone number . i peer back out the second floor window , not wanting to walk back in on them , but it looks like they ' ve finished and the plates have all been cleared . i quietly open the front door and head up the stairs to my room , closing my door behind me . i write eileen ' s phone number on my bureau and am just about to slip out of my room when i hear a soft knock on the door . usually nate just walks in quietly , so he clearly knows that i ' m here with him . i walk over and unlock it , then open it a few inches . ` ` you locked it ? ' ' he asks , looking surprised . ` ` i want to be alone right now , ' ' i murmur , though a knot forms in my throat at the thought of spending the entire time in a house without him . ` ` i . . . i ' n ' t choose for you , '' he whispers . he looks so sad , and i catch a glimpse of the little boy that he once was , in his parents ' conversation . ` ` i know . ' ' ` ` they ' re going to some charity event tomorrow afternoon . . . maybe we could spend some time together . ' ' ` ` ok , ' ' i nod , my eyes already moving in a different direction . he pauses , wondering if he should kiss me . ` ` well , goodnight , ' ' he says , and walks down the hallway to his bedroom . i shut and lock the door behind him , then grab my cell phone and punch in eileen ' s number . tomorrow morning , i text her . i ' ll let you know when my parents are gone , and then you can meet nate . chapter twenty - six i sigh as i sit by my window , listening for the sounds of my mom and dad talking . i was n ' not able to sleep much at all last night . there were too many thoughts running around in my brain . mainly , though , it was strange not to see nate . i missed his presence in my life with a constant hunger that ate away at me . then i hear some movement from the rest of the house . i lookto my door and push it open , sticking my head out into the hall . i can just hear my mom murmuring something to pierce as they make their way to the garage . soon i hear the car pulling out of the driveway and i glance at the clock . i ' ll give them ten minutes . i wait impatiently , and as soon as it ' s dark , i text eileen and head out to the foyer . luckily nate has been safely ensconced in his room all morning . i ' n ' t know if he even showed up to train this morning , which is highly unusual for him .
