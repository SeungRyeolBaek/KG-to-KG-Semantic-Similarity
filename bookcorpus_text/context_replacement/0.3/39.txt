` ` my head , ' ' she said , with a smile . pesh pulled back the hospital gown . ` ` are you wearing your seat belt ? ' ' ` ` yeah , i still am . ' ' ` ` from the dust in your hair , can i assume the airbag broke ? ' ' ` ` yeah , it did . ' ' ` ` is this where it hurts ? ' ' he asked , running his fingers over an angry red whelp . it started at her neck and ran down her chest . most of it was hidden by the blinking lights coming from the heart monitor . ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` it looks like the seat belt and the airbag did a number on you . ' ' she laughed . ` ` i thought they were supposed to heal you , not hurt you . ' ' pesh smiled . ` ` trust me . you ' re much better off with a head burn than if you really hadn ' t been wearing it . ' ' after checking the monitors mary was hooked up to , he turned to megan . ` ` blood pressure is low . let ' s get some blood products to treat that . ' ' megan nodded . after checking mary ' s chart for her blood pressure , she grabbed a bag of blood from theno . switching places with pesh , she placed another iv in the crook of mary ' s left arm . ` ` besides your stomach , are you hurting anywhere else ? ' ' pesh asked , after he finished listening to her heart and breathing . ` ` my stomach . ' ' megan ' s breath caught . it was never good for a car accident victim to have stomach pains . that usually meant hemorrhaging , which could only attribute the high blood pressure . pressing on mary ' s abdomen , pesh asked , ` ` does this hurt ? ' ' ` ` no . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` no . ' ' ` ` what about you ? ' ' a groan came from the bed . pesh ' s brows drew with concern . ` ` i ' m going to do a quick ultrasound , mary . i want to know what ' s causing the pain . ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' megan brought the machine over to the bed . she pumped the fluid onto mary ' s stomach , and then pesh began running the needle over the skin . ` ` i ' m feeling a little dizzy , too , ' ' mary said , in a low voice . pesh and megan exchanged a worried glance .he shoved the little girl away . turning to kristi , he said , ` ` ' the or . she ' s got a swollen spleen . ' ' after pressing the button on the gurney , pesh pushed it out of the waiting room and started down the hall . ` ` stay with him , ' ' kristi instructed , as she held onto the gurney . megan hurried down the hall to catch up with pesh . he pressed the button on the gurney before glancing over at her . ` ` stay with me , okay ? we ' re going to get you into surgery , and then you ' ll be good as new . ' ' ` ` are you sure ? ' ' she asked . without hesitation , pesh replied , ` ` yes , but you have to stay with me . ' ' the elevator ' s doors slid open . as megan helped pesh push the gurney out , she asked , ` ` did you turn on the lights ? ' ' megan furrowed her brows in confusion as she glanced over to pesh . ` ` we ' re going to the elevator to take you to the hospital for surgery , ' ' she replied . ` ` but it ' s too late , ' ' she said , closing her eyes . her head lolledto the side just as the alarms on the monitors began ringing in megan ' s ears . ` ` dammit , she ' s dead ! ' ' pesh cried . ice - cold fear worked its way from the top of megan ' s head all the way through her body . a car was sitting in the elevator without the wheeled gurney . what the hell were they going to do ? ` ` lower the lever , ' ' pesh ordered . megan ' s jerky hands fumbled with the lever . when it was flat , pesh brought his hands to mary ' s chest and began pumping . without having to be told , megan leaned down , pinched mary ' s nose , and began breathing into her mouth . they worked in perfect unison . ` ` breathe with me , mary ! ' ' pesh ordered , as his hands pumped in a steady rhythm up and down on mary ' s chest . looking up from her monitor , megan checked the monitors . ` ` no pulse . ' ' when pesh did s ' pose nothing , she began her breathing tests . with the taste of something cold meeting her tongue , she pulled away . blood poured out of mary ' s mouth . ` ` there ' s more damage than the wound .she ' s bleeding from the head . ' ' pesh did n ' t even notice her injury . ` ` the seat belt and airbag could have caused an open valve as well . there ' s nothing we can do . ' ' regardless , he went right on with his questions . the elevator doors opened , and megan met the expectant faces of the surgical team . when the doctor stepped inside , she shook her head . ` ` she ' s dead . ' ' pesh sat across from her . ` ` no , she really isn ' t . we have to keep trying . get a cart in here . ' ' the doctor checked the stats on the monitor . ` ` i ' n ' t think that will help . ' '
