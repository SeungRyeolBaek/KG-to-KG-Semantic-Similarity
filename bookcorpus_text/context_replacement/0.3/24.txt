as she shone the light into aidan ' s eyes , he smiled . ` ` yes , they are . what exactly happened ? ' ' he made sure to direct his question to emma since she seemed to be the only one being questioned . ` ` we were at my mother ' s for our first ultrasound . ' ' pesh ' s eyes widened . ` ` so . . . you ' re pregnant ? ' ' ` ` again ? ' ' megan questioned from his side . the worry for aidan on emma ' s face melted away and was replaced with a wide smile . ` ` yes , i ' m eight weeks . ' ' ` ` ' did s ' pose you say something at church sunday ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` well , we only found out two weeks ago , and we had to wait to tell everyone until we had the first ultrasound . ' ' megan ' s blonde brows creased . ` ` ' what does the ultrasound have to do with aidan hitting his head ? ' ' emma pursed her lips and slid her gaze over to aidan . ` ` would you like to tell them ? ' ' when he shook his head and then winced , emma continued . ` ` when they hooked me up to the baby monitor , they thought they heard two shots . 'the word ' twins ' , aidan passed out and hit his head on the counter and the floor . ' ' although pesh had turned his laugh into a cough , megan was wasn ' t so tactful . she burst out laughing . ` ` you seriously passed out during the ultrasound ? ' ' aidan glared at her . ` ` in my opinion , i ' n ' not quite the baby yet . ' ' at megan ' s continued laughter , he shrugged . ` ` it was pretty mind - blowing news . ' ' ` ` ' ankle , ankle . ' ' aidan turned to pesh . ` ` ' am i going to sit here all day talking business , or are you going to kill me ? ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` of course . your injuries are definitely a matter of concern . ' ' glancing at emma , aidan said , ` ` just wait for me outside . ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' pesh motioned for aidan to go into the private waiting room . as soon as the door closed behind him , aidan lunged for him , grabbing the lapels of his suit jacket . ` ` i need a doctor . today . ' ' pesh fought the urge to laugh at the absurdity of the situation as well as aidan ' sno . ` ` aidan , let ' s ask you to calm down . you ' ve obviously been through a lot of trauma in the last week . ' ' aidan collapsed onto the coffee table . he put his head in his hands and groaned . ` ` what a f * * king nightmare of a day . ' ' ` ` does your head hurt ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` a little . ' ' ` ` ` nausea ? ' ' ` ` maybe . ' ' pesh furrowed his brow . ` ` what do you mean , maybe ? ' ' aidan raised his head . ` ` if you ' re asking if i ' m okay now , the answer would be no . i ' m not . but on the other hand , if you ' re asking if i get sick thinking about the fact that emma could have been pregnant with twins , and i would have had three kids inside me and in diapers . . . ' ' aidan groaned . ` ` oh god , i get really f * * king sick , and the room starts to spin a little . ' ' dropping down onto his knees , he rolled over to aidan . ` ` take a deep breath for me , okay ? ' ' aidan ' s chest expanded as heinhaled and exhaled . ` ` breathe , ' ' pesh instructed . taking a few deep breaths , pesh cocked his head at aidan . ` ` nervous ? ' ' ` ` yeah , a little , ' ' aidan croaked . he jerked his hand through his hair . ` ` are you going to give me a referral for a vasectomy ? ' ' pesh held up his hands . ` ` i ' m confused . if you knew that emma really wasn ' t having twins , why would you want to have a baby ? ' ' ` ` because twins are on both sides of our families . i was a twin , and emma ' s parents were twins . it ' s like we have a huge bull ' s - eye hovering over us . we can barely be in the same room without her , and it ' s just inevitable that she ' ll get pregnant again , and then i ' ll have four . . . . maybe even five . ' ' aidan swallowed hard as some of the color drained from his face . ` ` ' i don ' t like a woman having babies . ' ' ` ` well , most genetic ##ists would agree that genetic twins can happen to anyone , whereas , genetic twins are the result of themother produces multiple eggs in a single cycle . this ability to produce multiple eggs is passed from mother to child . now that emma can ##n ' t have a non - identical twin , you are perfectly safe . ' ' aidan tilted his head , his expression one of confusion . ` ` so you ' re saying i do n ' t have to worry about that ? ' ' ` ` without knowing emma ' s full genetic makeup , you could n ' t worry , but it seems like a no - at least for the twins . ' ' after processing pesh ' s words , aidan shook his head . ` ` ' it really matters about the twins . we ' re both way too fertile together . i need to stop this before it gets out of hand . ' ' ` ` and what does emma think about all of this ? ' '
