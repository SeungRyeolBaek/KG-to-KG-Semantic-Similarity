nate asks , tilting his head toward me but not making eye contact . ` ` yes , ' ' i whisper back , unsure of what else to do or say . ` ` ok , meet you down there in ten minutes , ' ' nate says simply and walks out . i wait until i can hear him walking up the stairs before i respond . i ' ve never heard my father talk to his son like that before , and our old house was a ' t ##was full of model families . and the way nate ' s shoulders relaxed when he was speaking to him , it was like he agreed with what his father was saying about him . i walk up the stairs to my room and change into my pajamas , before heading back downstairs to make some popcorn - it always makes me feel better . as soon as it ' s finished making , i go into the den to wait for nate . should i tell my mom about what pierce just did ? would she even care ? she seems to have taken the alcohol kool - aid pretty well at this point . and now that pierce has been the victim of the accident , it will be even harder for her to believe anything bad about him . i glance up , startled , as nate walks in and sits down on the couch next to me .` ` i can tell by that look on your face that you want to talk , ' ' he says . i smile back , he knows me well . ` ` but the thing with my parents - it ' s off - limits , remember ? ' ' but i need to tell him that those things pierce said are - ' all true . ` ` just - ' ' ` ` please , brynn . i just want us to be able to keep this out . but if you keep bringing it up . . . ' ' i sigh . ` ` fine . but wo ##uld ' t say anything . in fact , i . . . ' ' i gesture to the wide table full of dvd cases . ` ` ' romantic comedy ! ' ' ` ` big deal , ' ' i say , pulling out the case . ` ` is that a romantic comedy ? ' ' he asks , narrowing his eyes suspiciously . ` ` well , not really . there is romance in it , but it ' s more about a family , ' ' i explain , careful not to mention the predominant father - son themes . ` ` hey , friendships have to have a price , ' ' i say with a laugh . ` ` fine , fine , ' ' he says , rolling his eyes . 'takes a handful of popcorn and leans against the end of the couch as i put the dvd in . as i make myself comfortable on the other end , he pulls a blanket from the back of the couch and wraps it around my feet , because he hates that they get cold . i feel a pang in my chest at the simple gesture , but try to push it away . he ' s not being mean , just friendly . i look up at the large tv screen as the picture clicks on . i feel more comfortable with nate than i do with anyone else in my life right now , so i have to settle for being comfortable with him . or i could lose him altogether . chapter twelve ` ` you and nate get down there when we do don ' t lose the house ! ' ' my mother instructs me . she has a weekend outing to go rafting on the potomac , but nate is usually at the office for meetings , even though it ' s a saturday . ` ` i ' ll swing by and get him and meet you there . ' ' ` ` you sure ? ' ' ` ` yeah , he said he ' d only be a little while , ' ' she tells me . ` ` ok , ' ' i reply with a shrug , and walk intothe one off the kitchen where nate is slipping on his jeans . ` ` my mom says they ' re going to meet us there , ' ' i tell him . ` ` fuck it , let ' s switch tracks , then . ' ' he smirks . and off we are in his car , nate blasting some god - awful metal music . ` ` how can you listen to this shit ? it sounds like some mc ' s screwing in a trashcan . ' ' i shake my head . ` ` what ? this is slayer , they ' re not trash metal , you have to show respect . ' ' he says sarcastically . ` ` i always listen to reign in blood before all of my classes . ' ' ` ` oh . ' ' i screw my face up in mock horror . he turns it up louder , nodding his head slowly as the guitar chords turn into what i assume is his favorite part of the song . it ' s nice to see him let loose like this , and even though i think his taste in music is bad , i have to admit i like to see him enjoying himself . thankfully , the house is just a little way down the potomac in the middle of the beach , and i ' m onlysubjected to slayer for a few more hours . the temperature on this august day is in the mid - nineties , but my mom was keen upon doing a little activity today . as we take a left onto the main road with an old sign pointing the way , i see an empty parking lot , and figure most people are probably staying inside with their air - conditioning today . after we park , nate walks over to the wood - burning shed to secure the boat , and i dig the keys out of my bag .
