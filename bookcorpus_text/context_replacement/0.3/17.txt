when she wavered on her feet like she was going to faint , pesh tumbled onto the couch , reaching out for her . grabbing hold of her shoulders , he steadied her . she glanced down at her feet before looking back at him . pesh ' s heart broke at the sight of tears forming in her eyes . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' her lips trembled before big , fat tears rolled down her cheeks . ` ` oh god , ' ' she whispered . ` ` please do don ' t cry . ' ' ` ` th - this is t - so embarrassing , ' ' she hiccupped . ` ` it ' s okay . you ' don ' t have to be embarrassed . ' ' sobbing , she covered her face with her hands . ` ` please , i made a fool out of myself coming on to you and now i ' ve puked in front of you like a little girl who ' can ' t handle her stuff . ' ' ` ` stop beating yourself up . come , let ' s get you cleaned up . ' ' he slid his arm around her waist to steady her on their way down the hall to the bathroom . she continued to weep silently as they made their way into the bathroom . using his other hand, he flicked on the water . ` ` can you stand in the shower ? ' ' with a small nod , she said , ` ` i think so . ' ' ` ` if not , there ' s a ledge you can stand on . let me turn on the water for you , and i ' ll get you a towel . ' ' he backed her up against the counter before striding off to the bathroom . when he felt the water at a good enough temperature , he quickly went over to the sink . he pulled out a towel before returning to megan who had her head in her hands . with his other hand , he grabbed one of her hands and pulled it away from her face . ` ` please stop beating yourself up . i hate to see you so upset . ' ' ` ` i ' n ' t do it . i ' m such a fool . ' ' ` ` no , if you ' re a fool , then so am i . we just know each other . ' ' ` ` ` i got drunk . . . i hardly get drunk anymore . ' ' ` ` it was an accident . things like that happen . ' ' he grabbed her chin and forced her to look at him . ` ` you are none of the same things your mother keeps callingyou right now . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' her broken words , coupled with her need for his reassurance , nearly broke him . he had to refrain from taking her in his arms . he knew if he did that , he would end up doing something he should haven ' t with her . instead , he nodded . ` ` ' you still smell , so go on and get in the shower . ' ' the corners of her lips turned up in a small smile . ` ` do you have something i can change into ? and maybe a towel ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` one moment . ' ' leaving her in the bathroom , he went back into the bedroom to his closet . he pulled out a pair of scrubs he knew would be too big and too tight for her and then paired them with an emory university t - shirt . when he got back to the kitchen , megan was struggling with the zipper on the back of her dress . with a defeated expression , she crossed her arms . ` ` could you please help me ? ' ' ` ` of course . ' ' he set the glass down on the counter . he then reached up to pull on the zipper . the back of the dress fell open , exposing her olive colored skin and her beautifulher bra and panties . he closed his eyes to try and block out the glaring images flashing through his mind . his lips on her skin , his tongue sliding down her neck , his hands wrapping around her ribcage to cup her br * * sts . he forced himself to step back . clearing his throat , he replied , ` ` okay . ' ' glancing at him over her shoulder , megan gave him a small smile . ` ` thank you . ' ' he took out a spare towel from under the sink and placed it next to the one he ' d brought her . ` ` let me know if you need anything else . ' ' ` ` okay . ' ' turning around , he stormed out of the bathroom . not wanting to go too far in case megan followed him , he began pacing toward the bedroom . he momentarily paused when he heard the shower turn on . he waited for her to appear , but she ' n ' t . just as he was about to knock on the door , the soft hum of the hairdryer started . he stopped his movements as she dried her hair . next , he heard the sink water turn on as she brushed her teeth . when it was quiet once again in the bathroom , his feet froze as he realizedhe eyed the bathroom door . when it opened , pesh ' s breath caught . appearing fresh - faced and clean , megan looked absolutely beautiful as she tentatively stepped into the room . ` ` everything okay ? ' ' he asked . she blinked at his question . ` ` um , everything ' s fine . thank you again for the clothes and for letting me stay . ' ' ` ` you ' re more than welcome . and there ' s no need to thank me . ' ' chewing on her lip , she walked from the bed to him .
