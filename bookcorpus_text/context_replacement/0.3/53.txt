` ` very good , ma ' am , ' ' the waiter replied . ` ` i ' ll have the same , ' ' pesh said , handing the waiter his wine . when megan looked at him , his eyebrows rose . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` i ' m not surprised to hear you order something as simple as chicken and grits . ' ' he tsked at her . ` ` when did you learn that you can always see it as one thing or the other ? ' ' she laughed . ` ` actually , i think that you ' re proving me wrong and the unexpected . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' she asked . ` ` ' i feel like you try to do the same thing to me . people have their own assumptions about men or women who get knocked up . i think i constantly prove them wrong . ' ' ` ` i ' m sure you do . ' ' after taking a sip of his wine , he cocked his head at her . ` ` prove me wrong on this one . does a f ##er like you like southern food ? ' ' ` ` oh yeah , i love it . ' ' his blue eyes lit up . ` ` what ' s your favorite food ? ' ' ` ` hmm , i can have that, but i ' m not a fan of pav bahaji . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . emma has never eaten any indian food , and i do n ' t think i made a good impression on her . ' ' pesh ' s laughter died away , and he immediately tensed at the mention of emma ' s name . realizing that they were dancing around the giant elephant in the room , megan reached across the table and took his hand . ` ` it ' s okay that you ' re talking about emma . ' ' ` ` talking of old women or women you ' ve met while you ' re with a man is not a good idea . ' ' ` ` this is true . emma is my sister . ' ' she swirled the wine around in her glass . ` ` i ' ve heard her side of the story , but i do don ' t think i ' ve heard yours . ' ' ` ` you heard a little when you were there the night of noah ' s baptism . ' ' ' it was megan ' s turn to frown . ` ` i really would like to know . ' ' pesh drew in a ragged breath . when the waitress appeared with their salads , it appeared that he might avoid the question entirely . instead hethey were alone now , he said . ` ` emma came along at a time when i was under tremendous pressure from family and friends to move on from my grief and love again . there was no end to it - i faced it at the hospital , as well as when i was at home . i used to think that once a day went by on the job that meant i was done with my mourning . until one day , when she was in the hospital . she was scared out of her mind by your grandfather . somehow i just stayed with her through her fear and pain . ' ' he wiped his mouth with his napkin . ` ` she reminded me so much of jade that it was easy to try to imagine that what i was feeling for her was romantic . i ' d ' t been kissed in so long that i wanted to woo her , just like i wanted to you . ' ' ` ` and aidan came to you ? ' ' ` ` in a way , both he and jade did . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' pesh asked . ` ` let ' s just say , during a very heated time period , she was with aidan , and i was with jade . ' ' megan was surprised by his honesty . ` ` you mean. ' ' there was one thing in the pesh and emma relationship she had always wondered about . ` ` you ca ##n ' t mind that she was pregnant ? ' ' shaking his head , pesh said , ` ` it just made her even more beautiful to me . she ' d been through so much , that i guess i was drawn to her because she had life growing inside her . ' ' ` ` that ' s so beautiful , ' ' megan said . he gave her a mirthless laugh . ` ` one of my bad character traits is having a hero complex . i think that ' s one of the reasons i became a hero . i loved emma , and i wanted to save her . when she had to go on to rest , i volunteered to be her knight in shining armor . ' ' ` ` being a hero is not exactly a bad character trait . ' ' ` ` it is when you ca ##va ' t love someone , and you have to just live with the consequences . ' ' megan ' s heart ached at the pain on his face . knowing she had to break the mood , she teased , ` ` i ' m glad to see you actually have a bad character trait . i mean , you seemed a little too nice to me . '' a hint of a smile played across his lips . ` ` did i mention i ' m a terrible cook ? ' ' ` ` you ? yes , ' ' she replied . ` ` oh dear . if i ' n ' t have a job , i ' m pretty sure i might end up on world ' s worst houses . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` i find that hard to believe . ' ' ` ` it ' s the truth . i actually have no athletic ability whatsoever . ' ' after chewing thoughtfully on her piece of salad , megan said , ` ` ' you ' re built like a football player . ' '
