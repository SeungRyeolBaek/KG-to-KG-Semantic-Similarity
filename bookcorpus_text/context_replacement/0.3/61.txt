he made it easy to open up to and speak of all the good and the bad in her life . he was such a good listener that she never felt like she was just running away and ignoring him . he truly seemed interested in everything she said . it was an amazing combination . ` ` you doing okay back there ? ' ' pesh asked , pulling her out of her thoughts . she nodded . ` ` fine . ' ' ` ` i wish you could see your face , ' ' he mused . ` ` do i have some dopey expression ? ' ' she asked . ` ` it is ain ' t it . it ' s wide - eyed wonderment like a kid on christmas morning . ' ' ` ` yeah , i would definitely say that since this car feels like a very big and very expensive car . ' ' ` ` it ' s a beautiful thing to see . i ' m so glad to get to share this with you . ' ' he took one of her hands from the yoke and brought it to his mouth . as his lips kissed along her knuckles , she groaned . ` ` i need my hand back . i do don ' t feel like i have a good grip on the steering wheel like you think i should , ' ' shemr . pesh chuckled and squeezed her hand . ` ` how i regret giving you that tip now , ' ' he said . she laughed . ` ` that ' s not fair to try and distract me . we need to land , so we do n ' t crash . ' ' ` ` all right . i ' ll keep my hands to myself . . . for now . ' ' a thrill went through her at his words . at that moment if there was a way possible to actually turn the plane and seduce him , she would have tried . shaking her head , she tried reminding herself of her earlier behavior . ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' she asked , pointing at a dark shape far down on the horizon . pesh leaned forward in his seat , looking out the window . ` ` looks like a storm is coming in . ' ' ` ` we should head back then . ' ' he shrugged . ` ` i ' n ' t think it ' s going to bother you . ' ' ` ` yeah , well , i do don ' t like the idea of having to fly into a storm . ' ' ` ` ' we ' ll head back . ' ' ` ` which way should we turn the plane ? ' ' ` ` let '' ' ' ##y , ' ' pesh said . megan bobbed her head and then turned the yoke at the same time she pressed on the right brake pedal with her foot . ` ` good . keep it steady . we ' re almost turning around . ' ' once they were facing the right direction , pesh said , ` ` ' let ' s bring up the rear . ' ' she did as she was told and waited for him to give her some further instructions . ` ` we ' re good to go then . when we ' re about ten minutes away from mccollum , you need to let the atc know we ' re coming in . ' ' ` ` okay . i can do that . ' ' ` ` do you have plans for this evening ? ' ' ` ` not that i know of . ' ' ` ` would you like to have dinner with me ? ' ' she chewed on her lower lip to keep from smiling at his formalness . ` ` i think so . can we get dessert afterwards ? ' ' his body tensed beside her . ` ` are you suggesting that i ' m dessert , or that after we finish dinner i should make you dessert ? ' ' megan laughed . ` ` no , i want you for dessert . ' '` ` ` you can call me . anytime . ' ' glancing over at him , she said , ` ` i might have to ask for a to - go card since i ' m assuming we ' ll have one with us . ' ' ` ` i ' don ' t know . i like spending time with him . ' ' megan could couldn ' t wipe the smile off her face at pesh ' s compliment . ` ` he really enjoys being with you , too . i ' ve never seen him warm up to a stranger as much as he does to you . ' ' ` ` i ' m a likeable guy , ' ' he teased . ` ` yeah , you are , ' ' she replied , trying not to let the out - of - control beat of her heart make her think more than she should about him . pesh interrupted her thoughts by motioning to the controls . ` ` go ahead and start doing your landing checks . ' ' megan vaguely remembered what instruments and instruments she had looked at before they took off . once she went through the landing checks with pesh ' s team , they started heading back to mccollum . ` ` welcome to atc . ' ' ` ` um , okay , ' ' megan said , nibbling on herno . after clearing his throat , megan glanced over at pesh . he motioned to the pilot . ` ` oh , duh , ' ' she replied . with her thumb , she pressed the push - to - talk button . ` ` this is cessna 172 coming in for landing . ' ' before she could ask pesh if she had done it correctly , he sent a different message with his push - to - talk . the atc ' s voice sounded in her ear . ` ` cessna 172 , this is flight control . you are cleared to land . ' ' ` ` ` pull on the throttle to start the engine , ' ' pesh instructed . after she did what she was told , her eyes focused on the pilot . ` ` should we be picking up this wind speed ? ' '
