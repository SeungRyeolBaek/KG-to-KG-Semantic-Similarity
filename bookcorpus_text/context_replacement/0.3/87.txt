i am so happy for the wonderful woman you have become . ' ' lavani ' s blue eyes filled with tears , and she brought a handkerchief up to wipe her eyes . ` ` thank you , my dear . ' ' shveta stepped into the bathroom , her face lit up with a huge smile . ` ` alpesh is back . ' ' gathering up the bottom of her dress , megan walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom . her heart stopped at the sight of him . she had never seen him in kurta - pants , as they were called . basically , it was a long , tunic like dress that came to his knees . and he wore black fur - lined pants . and his dress was very much like hers . it was gold in color and rich with gems and beading . she really don ' t want to begin to imagine how much it cost . when she brought her eyes back to his , she shivered under his intense gaze . ` ` you are a vision of complete and utter beauty , ' ' he said . doing a little dance , the fabric of her dress twirled around her . ` ` so you like it ? ' ' he smiled . ` ` i love it . ' ' she laughed. ` ` i feel a bit like a princess . ' ' you can take the irish out in the dress , but you ' can ' t take the irish out of the girl ' s thing . ' ' ` ` i would n ' t have you any other way , ' ' he said , with a serious , yet playful tone . ` ` thank you . ' ' megan eyed the two velvet boxes in his hands . ` ` ooh , let me see the necklace . ' ' with a hint of a laugh , pesh sat one of the boxes down on the table while he opened the other . megan gasped as the enormous diamonds glittered up at her . while there was one thick band , the rest flowed out in delicate waves that would probably touch her skin when she put them on . they had some gold bands , but mostly the gems were diamonds and amethysts that would match her sari . ` ` this is why your mother and shveta wanted me to wear the wedding dress ? ' ' she asked . pesh nodded . ` ` they ' re beautiful , ' ' she murmured . ` ` wait until you see the necklace , ' ' he said , with a smile . her shaking hands reached forward to .one of the earrings . she carefully removed the clasp and attached one to her neck . then she did the other . while they were so heavy she felt like they would weigh her down , she looked up at pesh and smiled . ` ` thank you . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome , my love . ' ' he reached for the jewelry box . megan ' s eyes widened as the diamonds and the amethysts sparkled in the light . he took the necklace out and unfastened the clasp . he reached behind her and gently lifted the necklace over her head . she closed her eyes at the pleasurable sensation of feeling his touch . ` ` okay . ` you ' re mine . ' ' whirling around to face him , she pressed her lips to his . ` ` i love you . ' ' his hand gently caressed her back . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' from the doorway of the kitchen , lavani yelled loudly at them . ` ` alpesh , stop teasing her , or you ' re going to mess up her makeup ! ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` i really thought i was teasing her . ' ' she waved her hand dismissively . ` ` come on .it ' s time we got inside . ' ' after pesh held out his hand for her , megan slipped hers through his . ` ` do n ' t be nervous , ' ' he whispered into her ear . ` ` i ' m not , ' ' she lied . ` ` megan , i know you well enough by now that i know when you ' re nervous . you fidget and bite your lip . ' ' ` ` sorry , ' ' she muttered , as they stepped onto the elevator . although it was crowded with pesh ' s family , megan kept her mouth shut about her nerves . the last thing she wanted to do was to get it wrong in front of them . when the doors opened , she took in a couple of deep breaths to calm her nerves . there was a whole lot of history and circumstance that she didn ' ' t quite understand about how they were all supposed to act . she had hoped not to mess up the part when she came in with her parents . just like at the wedding reception , she and pesh sat at the table at the front of the room . of course , she had hadn ' t quite prepared herself for the golden chairs that looked exactly like chairs . once everyone was seated , pesh ' s father stood upto you . ` ` we are very honored that you two could be with us this evening . i understand that with megan ' s friends and family , as well as some of our neighbor ' s , there are a lot of you unfamiliar with our home . i just need to explain to you what the gifts are . ' ' on the table in front of them were two large wreaths that reminded her of the flowers that you would see in movies . they were in colors of red , gold , and blue . the wreaths crisscrossed between the two ring boxes . she knew from what pesh had told her that they would be giving each other gifts tonight to celebrate their future together .
