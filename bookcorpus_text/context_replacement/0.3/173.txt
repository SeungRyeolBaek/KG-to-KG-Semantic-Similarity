i grab the cold bottle of water from by my feet and take a long drink . ` ` well ? ' ' i ask nate , turning to hand it to him . he takes it , linking my fingers with his as he wraps his long fingers around mine . my insides glow . . . speaking of a spark . i see a house very much like ours perched on a hill in the distance . ` ` where ' d you live before the house burned ? ' ' ` ` townhouse in georgetown . ' ' he says . ` ` it was more of a house . had more character . ' ' ` ` the house was n ' ' your taste ? ' ' ` ` it was always big for four people , and it still seems big , even for four . but what i really do don ' t like is that it ' s got all these weird historical elements to it , and none of them are good . ' ' ` ` anathema to a history major . ' ' ` ` exactly . i always pictured myself in a big house , maybe a large barn or something . . . one that was actually built in the time period it looks like it was built in . or somewhere quieter than dc . . . it ' s so quiet here . .. i want my kids to grow up more quickly than you do . ' ' ` ` you want kids ? ' ' i ask , surprised . ` ` you do don ' t ? ' ' ` ` yes , i do . . . i ' m just curious . you mentioned that having kids would mean being in a relationship with a woman for longer than you ' re used to . ' ' he laughs . ` ` i honestly had hadn ' t thought of that . i had just pictured myself with kids . is that it ? ' ' ` ` yes ! ' ' i reply , quickly reaching out and throwing it back at him . ` ` hey ! ' ' he says , and grabs the sides of the boat , beginning to rock it back and forth . ` ` you ' ll tip this thing over , ' ' he tells me with a laugh . ` ` nate ! ' ' i protest , holding on . he laughs , and keeps rocking for a while . ` ` i think your mom picked the hottest day of the year , ' ' he says . ` ` want to go back ? ' ' i ask , hoping he ' ll say something . he nods . ` ` maybe we should . ' ' i sigh , feeling disappointed , anddip my oar into the water to help him steady the boat . now that we ' re moving with the current , it takes us much less time to make the return trip back to the boat house . ` ` how ' s your leg ? ' ' i ask . ` ` it ' s fine , babe , ' ' he replies happily , ` ` thanks for asking . ' ' i feel a lump in my throat as we pull into the shallow water . nate steps onto the dock first , and offers me his hand to help me climb out of the small boat . ` ` much safer than the water , ' ' he says , pointing to a small trail that cuts through the woods behind the boat house . i look at him curiously . ` ` wanna talk before we go swimming ? ' ' i nod and smile , trying not to look too happy . chapter nineteen ` ` you ' ve got good legs for someone who ' n ' ' do swimming , ' ' nate observes as our ` ` short day ' ' slips into its second day . ` ` i ' ve been swimming in the water too long , and that ' s it , ' ' i reply , though really i think it ' s that the conversation has ' ' ' changed .we ' re just over the potomac river , on a narrow trail that winds between large trees . he is right - it is cooler under the trees , but it ' s still just as humid . ` ` is that it ? ' ' i ask , pointing to a three - leaf patch at the base of a tree . after telling nate that i manage to catch poison ivy every other year , he ' s made it his mission to show me how to identify the chemical - causing the disease . ` ` not much anymore . by this time of the summer , it ' ll be all sticky and sticky - looking . and the edges of the leaves are too jagged , ' ' he says as he leans over to look at it . a pair of female tourists approach us on the trail , from the opposite direction . i watch them take in nate ' s shirtless , sweaty body and giggle to each other . as they approach , they smile flirtatiously at him , but he only politely smiles back before turning to me . ` ` you ' re good at so many things , being the dominant one . . . ' ' he intones in a mock - serious voice as he shakes his head . ` ` hey , if that ' s my weakness , i ' ll takeintimacy , ' ' i reply with a grin . ` ` yep , poison ivy , that ' s your kryptonite , ' ' he informs me . ` ` what ' s yours ? intimacy ? ' ' ` ` intimacy ? how dare you ! that ' s commitment . complete commitment . ' ' ` ` oh , duh , of course . my pleasure , ' ' i reply , wishing we could joke about this sort of thing . ` ` wait , wait ! ' ' i say , pointing to poison ivy crawling up a tree branch on the other side of the trail . ` ` where ? ' ' n ' t see it , ' ' nate replies , craning his neck . ` ` there ! ' ' i say , walking off the trail and into the forest .
