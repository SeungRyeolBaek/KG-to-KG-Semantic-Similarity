a nervous silence falls over the car as we pull through the gates and onto the street . he stops in front of the house and then turns to me . ` ` why do don ' t i walk you to your door , ' ' he says . ` ` sure . ' ' a few butterflies start to fly around in my stomach . we undo our seat belts and get out , meeting at the front of the car and walking up to the front door . i glance at him out of the corner of my eye and wish there was something calming i could say to him , because he looks even more nervous than i do . we open the door and turn to each other . ` ` well , goodnight , ' ' he says . ` ` goodnight . ' ' he pauses , looking into my eyes , and then begins to move closer . i lean in , and close my eyes . his lips touch mine and i frown slightly . i mean , there ' s nothing wrong with his lips or anything , but i wish i ' d felt . . . more . he keeps his lips firmly pressed against mine for a few seconds and then pulls back and looks at me . ` ` goodnight , brynn , ' ' he says again . ` ` goodnight , ' ' i reply , andtime to go inside . i shut the door behind me , and lean back against it , waiting . greg and i get along well , and he ' s such a nice guy - i ' d hoped i would eventually develop romantic feelings for him . . . but that night . . . was not so good . i turn and walk through the door and into the kitchen . ` ` hey , ' ' nate greets me . i smile as a buzz runs through me at just the sight of him . that ' s the buzz i ' n ' t get when i ' m with greg . ` ` hey . you up for a run ? ' ' i ask , taking in his sweaty appearance . ` ` yeah , yeah , just on the treadmill . too dark for a morning run . so you . . . did you have a good time tonight ? ' ' i smile over at him . he takes a long sip from his gatorade , and then sets it down on the counter . ` ` um , yeah , it was great , ' ' i reply . ` ` i was just going to watch a movie in the den if you ' re interested . ' ' ` ` fine , but i choose you , ' ' i reply with a smile . we ' veboth committed to this whole just friends thing , though at times i feel like i ' m going through the motions . i ' n ' t know if i ' ll ever be able to turn off the part of me that will always want something from him . ` ` no romantic comedies , ' ' nate says , as he walks to the door of the kitchen . ` ` i ' m just going to hop in the shower really quick . ' ' the phone on the counter rings and he turns toward it , but it only rings once . we both look toward pierce ' s study as loud footsteps come from that direction . a moment later , we hear stomping coming our way and frown at each other in confusion . pierce storms in and goes to the phone . ` ` what ? ' ' nate asks quietly . ` ` your mom , ' ' pierce replies , equally quietly , though there ' s a hint of anger in his voice . my eyes flick over to nate . i hope i have t ' not made the situation worse by taking her call that one time . he meets my eyes and shakes his head quickly as if to warn me not to say anything . ` ` i really don ' t know how she got this phone number - it ' s old .that bitch is wo n ' to give up . ' ' my mouth drops open at nate ' s language . i ' ve never even heard him swear before , and it ' s so at odds with his genteel demeanor that it sounds even more menacing coming out of his mouth . ` ` we ' re going to go see a movie , ' ' i murmur , wanting to get away from him when he ' s in this kind of mood . i can feel the waves of anger coming off of him . ' pierce turns around to face nate , the gatorade bottle in his hand . ` ` how many damn times have i told you to clean up after yourself ? ' ' he growls , and i step back . ` ` i was ain ' t done drinking - ' ' nate begins . ` ` ` nothin ' to touch her ! you think the rest of the world is just here to serve you ? that everyone else wants to make your miserable life a little easier ? you ' ve never had to work for anything in your life . it ' s pathetic , ' ' nate snaps at his brother . i stand frozen on the other side of the door , feeling like a fool , and not sure what i should do . i see color rising in nate 's ##neer , and all he says is , ` ` yes , sir . ' ' with that , pierce places the bottle down on the counter and walks back toward his office without even looking at me . nate remains motionless for a moment , then walks over to the bottle , drinks the rest of it , and throws it into the trash . ` ` i ' m sorry , you ' n ' - - - ' ' i begin , feeling embarrassed by the scene i just witnessed . ` ` you still want to watch that movie ?
