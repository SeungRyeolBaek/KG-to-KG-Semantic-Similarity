it ' s time to meet my mom and her new boyfriend , and share their good news . i glance around as i approach decanter . the interior is sleek and elegant , a mix of cream brick and dark wood . i ' ve never been here before - way out of my price range . i ' m about to approach the bar when i recognize my mom in a prime booth in the corner . i walk toward her through a maze of tables , ignoring the low tones of conversation and the rattle of wine glasses around me . her eyes light up and she stands when she sees me approaching . she looks even more beautiful than usual . her dark hair , a shade lighter than mine , hangs in a french braid down to her shoulders , and her perfect teeth show from behind her bright red lipstick . ` ` brynn ! i ' ve missed you , too , ' ' she says , wrapping me in a hug . ` ` you look beautiful . is s ' pose this is a little tight for you , dear ? ' ' she asks , looking at the extra fabric . ` ` you know i like this kind of dress , ' ' i reply , allowing only the slightest hint of sarcasm to enter my voice . this is a normal day with mom . she always wantstry to dress a little more conservative , a little ... ` ` form - flattering ' ' as she puts it . ` ` holly , i ' m so excited for you to meet pierce . he ' s just in the restroom - oh ! here he is . ' ' i follow her gaze to an already dressed man with salt - and - pepper hair and blue eyes who ' s greeting us with a warm smile . ` ` well , i ' d think this was your dad if i did n ' t know any better , ' ' he says , and my mom giggles . ` ` brynn , i ' m pierce . your mom has told me such wonderful things about you , ' ' he says as we shake hands . ` ` hi , ' ' i reply politely , though the truth is that she ' s told me absolutely nothing . ` ` okay , let ' s sit . i ordered us some food for the party . it should be here soon . ' ' we all all sit , me on one side of the cushy leather booth , and my mom and dad on the other . ` ` so , brynn , you ' re in your senior year ? ' ' ` ` yes , that ' s - ' ' i break off , myshe reaches for her wine glass and i notice a ring on her left hand . not an engagement ring , either . a wedding ring . ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' i ask sharply . ` ` oh , ' ' my heart flutters . ` ` well , we were going to wait until my parents arrived , but - ' ' ` ` we ' re married ! ' ' my mom announces excitedly . my jaw drops open . ` ` what ? ' ' i squeak . ` ` i mean , i thought maybe you ' d been anything but happy ? ' ' ` ` you ' re upset ? ' ' my mom asks worriedly . ` ` no , not upset . . . ' ' i struggle to put my thoughts into the right words . i always feel the need to protect my mom from what i ' m really feeling . she ' s always been more understanding than me . ` ` just surprised , that ' s all . i mean , how long have you known each other ? ' ' ` ` well , we met six months ago , ' ' my mom says . ` ` and then pierce took me on a fishing trip to the turks and caicos last summer , and everything was just so perfect . . . ' ' she trails off , turning to himfor us . ` ` it really was , brynn . and it felt so right . we wished you guys could have been there , but we all knew that we had to seize the moment . it was just this little gazebo on the beach , with great views of the ocean , and the captain of the boat that was docked at the beach officiated . . . ' ' ` ` it was wedding , wedding , and honeymoon number one ! we just wished you and nate could have been there . that would have made it even more perfect . ' ' i struggle to keep up with all the questions they ' re throwing at me . ` ` so , who ' s nate ? ' ' ` ` well , nate ' s my son . he goes to school here , too . we tried to get a hold of him so we could tell you together , but - wait ! there he is ! ' ' pierce slides out of the car to go to his son . nate . ' nate . . . ` ` what ' s nate ' s last name ? ' ' i whisper back to my mom . ` ` thornhill , ' ' she whispers back quickly , walking over to stand next to me . oh my god . nate thornhill is here . nate thornhill isnate walking right behind me . nate thornhill is my new . . . boyfriend , i realize in horror . beads of sweat form at my hairline and i ' ve suddenly lost my mind . chapter four when nate comes into my room , i watch in slow motion as he hugs his dad and shakes hands with my mom . i can hardly believe this is happening . surely i ' m in the middle of some weird dream and will wake up soon . i hoped i ' d never have to see him again after last night . ` ` brynn , honey , this is nate , pierce ' s son , ' ' my mom says , cutting through the haze of confusion in my mind .
