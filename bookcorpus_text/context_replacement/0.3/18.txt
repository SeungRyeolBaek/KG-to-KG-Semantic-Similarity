` ` i texted my mom to tell her i was spending the night at emma ' s . ' ' before he could say anything , she quickly added , ` ` thank you for putting my stuff in the car . that was very nice of you . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' he replied . then he thought of her question . ` ` so you ' re staying at aidan and emma ' s ? ' ' after all , the last thing he needed was to have her here - a reminder of what he could ##n ' t have . it would be enough to drive any man crazy . megan shook her head . ` ` would you mind if i stayed here tonight ? ' ' when he started to open his mouth , she shook her head . ` ` i promise no funny business . i really do don ' t want to go home yet . if you really don ' t want to come to dinner , you can take me to emma ' s . ' ' ` ` of course you can stay . ' ' ` ` i can sleep on the couch or in the living room . ' ' he shook his head . ` ` you ' ll sleep in here . ' ' he walked over to his large king - size bed . he turned down the television , glancingback to her . ` ` come on . getting some sleep will make you feel better . ' ' she eyed him hesitantly . ` ` you really should don ' t leave your bed . that would be rude . ' ' ` ` ` ' . ' ' okay . i promise . ' ' ` ` ' if you ' re sure ? ' ' ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' tentatively , she began walking over to him , her eyes never leaving his . she sank down onto the bed , sliding between the sheets . when she was done , he picked her up . when he turned to leave , she reached out to grab his arm . ` ` no , please do n ' t go . do n ' t leave me here . ' ' his eyebrows shot up in surprise . ` ` you want me to stay with you ? ' ' ` ` yes , please . ' ' ` ` in this bed . . . with you ? ' ' when she nodded , he exhaled a deep breath . ` ` megan , i do don ' t think that ' s a good idea . ' ' ` ` do n ' t overthink it ; ` stay with me . ' ' although his brain was raging away at him to make the right and logical decision , he said ,` ` give me a few minutes . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she said softly . turning , he strode into the bathroom . he did n ' t bother glancing in the mirror because he was pretty sure he would n ' not like what he saw . instead , he stripped off his jacket and tie . although he probably should have put on some clothes , he left his boxers on and grabbed a white shirt off the hamper . after pulling it over his head , he went back out into the bedroom . megan lay on her side in the bed , her face turned toward the ceiling . her eyes were closed , but they popped open the moment he entered the bedroom . without a word to her , he walked around the other side of the bed and slipped inside . lying on his back , he stretched one arm over his head . his other hand rested on his chest . he curled his fingers into the fabric of his shirt over his heart . somehow he wanted to calm the erratic beating . just when he thought it would be comfortable , megan turned around to face him . ` ` you ' re too far gone , ' ' she said . ` ` i thought it was for the best . ' ' the corners of her mouth momentarily turned down into a smile . then she inchednot to him . he sucked in a breath and tried not to hiss when he felt her head rest against his chest . before he could stop her , she had thrown an arm around him . thankfully , she did ##n ' t try anything else . and after a few minutes , her labored breathing indicated she had fallen asleep . pesh stared up at the ceiling and willed himself to be able to go to sleep as well . however , when megan ' s soft snores vibrated against his chest , his eyes grew heavy . for the first time in two days , he fell asleep with her in his arms . chapter six sunlight streamed across megan ' s face , causing her to squint her eyes tightly closed against the blinding glare . she was warm and comfortable , and she didn n ' t want to wake up . but the tranquility of her peaceful calm shattered when a soft snore came from beside her . it was far too deep to be one of mason ' s . awareness prickled its way across her skin . where am i ? her eyes frantically scanned the room . overcome by the masculine sounds and smells , she realized she was in a man ' s bedroom , and more importantly a man ' s bed . she had n ' t woken up this dazedand especially since she was hammered for the first time . she could couldn ' t even remember what day it was . this was bad . very , very bad . she had to get out of here and get back to daddy . what kind of person was she to wake up in a strange man ' s bed ? when she tried to roll over , she found herself entrapped by a strong arm wrapped around her waist . her gaze slid down to the tan , muscular body .
