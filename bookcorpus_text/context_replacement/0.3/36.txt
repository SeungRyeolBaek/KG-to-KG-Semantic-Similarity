what followed was a three - year courtship and a divorce . mia was accepted and loved by all of pesh ' s family . and then dev had gone and thrown it all away by cheating on mia . despite her heartbreak , mia had stayed true to pesh , and he wanted her to be happy more than anything else in the world . pesh would have liked to have been surprised by his brother ' s visit , but ever since he had been summoned to see mia a few days ago , he had been expecting it . truthfully , he had been bracing himself for his brother ' s wrath . ` ` ' dev , ' ' he said , in a calm voice . shaking his head slowly , dev said , ` ` i just got a f * * king blow - call from mia . when i tried calling her back to demand she explain herself , she could ##n ' t answer because she was in mexico . with aj . ' ' ` ` yes , i ' m aware of that . ' ' dev ' s blue eyes widened at pesh ' s confirmation . ` ` so it ' s true that you want to talk to her ? ' ' ` ` yes , it is . ' ' ` ` i ca ##uld ' t believe it . ' ' dev threw up hissighing in frustration . ` ` i did n ' t want to believe anything mia said , only that it was you who made her see that she should ##n ' t give me a second chance and take me back - that she should make things right with aj . ' ' ` ` it ' s all true . you and i both know mia would never leave . ' ' ` ` ' how could you ? ' ' dev asked , in a low voice . ` ` i ' m sorry , but i tried to do what was best for mia . ' ' dev ' s eyebrows shot up . ` ` and what about me ? i ' m your f * * king blood . ' ' with a sigh , pesh said , ` ` i ' m sorry , my friend , but blood or not , i could ##n ' t stand by and let you hurt her again - she ' s been through too much . ' ' ` ` i love her ! ' ' dev shouted , which caused all of the men to look up in shock . ` ` this is neither the time nor the place to be having this discussion , ' ' pesh snapped . ` ` i ' m not going anywhere , so you better start explaining yourself before i can start a fight . ' ' pesh 'his head . ` ` no . you want the truth ? mia is mine . you only think you love mia . you and i both know you could never be faithful to a woman . ' ' ` ` i could die for mia . ' ' ` ` you already loved her once . she deserves better . ' ' dev narrowed his eyes . ` ` what , are you f * * king her now ? ' ' he winced at his brother ' s choice of harsh words . ` ` of course i ' m not . there ' s never been anything amorous between mia and myself . now , she ' s sleeping with the man she loves - the father of her only child . ' ' ` ` but i love her , ' ' dev said , his voice taking on a serious tone . ` ` i ' m sorry , but i think it ' s best if you moved on . most of all , little brother , i think you need to do a lot of soul searching and searching before you even think about being in a relationship . ' ' dev ' s eyes widened . ` ` you . . . you f * * king bastard ! ' ' he shouted . pesh was considering calling security to arrest his baby brother when he was shoved off his chairand dev ' s right fist to his jaw . he tumbled backward and crashed onto the floor . before dev could do something but catch him when he went down , megan stood and placed herself between them . ` ` i think you should leave before i call security , ' ' she demanded . pesh jumped to his feet as megan stepped into dev ' s line of vision . he could n ' t imagine if dev attacked her in his sleep just because she had taken over for him . dev looked down at megan with a smirk . ` ` so my brother has some good - sized pu * * y defending him again ? word to the wise , megan , # n ' not waste your time on him . he ' s only got a boner for his dead wife . ' ' a low growl rumbled in pesh ' s throat as he lunged for his brother . but he never made it . instead , megan ' s fist cracked into dev ' s jaw . the impact did ##n ' # ##le him off his feet , but he did stagger backwards . even as she flailed her arms back and forth from the intense pain , megan still managed to bellow , ` ` get the hell out of here . now . ' ' dev stared at her in disbelief as he rubbedhis jaw . ` ` ' bitch , ' ' he muttered , before turning away . when megan returned to him , her angry expression changed to one of concern . ` ` you ' re bleeding ! ' ' she cried , rushing for him . his hand came up to grip his jaw . relief flooded him when he felt wetness . dev must ' ve hit him harder than he thought . he shook his head back and forth , causing him to wince at the popping pain . ` ` come here , ' ' megan said , taking his hand . she started leading him over to one of the examining rooms , but he pulled back . ` ` i really don ' t need all this stuff .
