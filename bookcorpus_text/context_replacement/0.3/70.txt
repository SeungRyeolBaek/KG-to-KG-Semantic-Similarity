some days , it was harder than megan could have ever imagined not to break out in a sweat whenever she saw him or to resist the urge not to wrap her arms around him . but somehow they made it work . in the end , the messed up emotions that were suppressed during the day made for a lot of good fireworks in the evening . megan ' s thoughts were interrupted by the buzzing of her phone . when she glanced down at it , she smiled . it was pesh . it killed me not to be able to kiss you a minute ago . i laughed . me too . you at my place tonight ? u hungry ? she questioned . yeah . indian food . mmm , sounds good . what time ? ' ' 7 . does mason like indian food ? megan read his text message . the last three times she had been with pesh , he had been with them as well . pesh never seemed to mind , but megan wanted one night with just him . a true one night . " okay . will get my parents and friends to babysit . you ' n ' t have to do that . i promise . i want to . bye . see you at seven . bye . she had just put her phone back in her pocket when she was interrupted by kara . since theday she ' d seen kara and pesh at the bar , megan had hated the sight of her . she had tried to keep her distance from her at first , but then , she noticed that kara had been turning around , looking at her . ` ` can i do something for you ? ' ' megan asked politely . ` ` yeah , for starters , you can drop the sugar daddy act . i know how you feel about me . ' ' megan resisted the urge to roll her eyes . instead , she crossed her arms over her chest . ` ` fine . what do you need kara ? ' ' kara glanced between them before she answered . ` ` i need you to stay clear of pesh . ' ' ` ` excuse me ? ' ' rolling her eyes , kara said , ` ` i know you ' re into him . i can see it in the way you look at him . . . it ' s in the way he looks at you , megan . and i just don ' t see it . ' ' ` ` well , i ' m really sorry that you interrupted y ' all , but frankly , i really don ' t see how any of that is any of your business . ' ' ` ` oh , it is very much my business . we' ve been there . ' ' ` ` um , fine . whatever , ' ' megan replied , feeling slightly embarrassed by kara ' s comment . in the rational side of her mind , she knew there was no way pesh could be involved with kara . but at the moment , it was the rational side that seemed to be winning out over whether pesh was truly hers . kara jerked her chin in the air . ` ` besides the fact of what pesh and i are to each other , i ' m sure it would be very difficult talking to your professor . last time i checked , a phd candidate was n ' t supposed to get involved with a doctor . not for one ' s career . ' ' ` ` are you kidding me ? ' ' with a casual shrug of her shoulders , kara replied , ` ` just stating facts . you do don ' t strike me as one of those little girls who wants to be used by a doctor for sex , which i ' m afraid that ' s exactly what pesh is doing with you . but more than just wanting to be his sex toy , i think you would wouldn ' t want to do anything to harm your future career . ' ' ` ` i ' m not taking this any further , ' ' megan muttered ,as she walked past her . ` ` ' wo don ' t care , as long as you stay away from pesh . ' ' without giving kara a second glance , megan continued on down the hallway . she did n ' t know where she was going , but she knew she wanted to put as much distance as she could between herself and kara . the rest of the way she felt betrayed by kara ' s behavior . more than anything , she could n ' t wait until she could be alone with pesh to talk to him about it . pesh jerked his head up at the loud crash behind him . the garage door leading into the kitchen was thrown open with such a force that it rattled on its hinges . megan stepped into the room , her mouth turned down in a determined frown . she tossed her purse down onto the floor beside one of the bar chairs . with a deep breath , she pushed back a few stray strands of her hair that had escaped the loose knot at the nape of her neck . ` ` bad day ? ' ' he asked , with barely veiled amusement . she glared at him . ` ` yes , as a matter of fact it was . ' ' ` ` what happened ? ' ' ` ` so , where do i start ? wheni had to drop mason off at papa ' s house , there was a woman there with him . ' ' pesh ' s eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` she is there ? ' ' ` ` he says she ' s - ' ' megan began to make air quotes with her fingers , ` ` just a friend . but i do n ' t believe it . ' ' as he stirred the rice , he glanced at her over his shoulder .
