she laughed . ` ` you just seemed a little too romantic for me . ' ' he shook his head at her . ` ` what other romantic notions do you have about me ? ' ' ` ` none really , ' ' she replied . in her mind , she could n ' t help wondering how she wanted to make him feel , just for her . she wondered what other tricks he might have up his sleeve . ` ` for some reason , i do don ' t believe that . ' ' he crossed his arms over his broad chest . ` ` let me guess . you think that i ' m a ' normal ' man who drinks wine , would never dream of , or have inappropriate thoughts , opens his underwear drawer , and who considers solving the word murder a normal friday night ? ' ' megan could ##n ' t help smiling at his words . it was a good idea not to dwell on how he had had inappropriate thoughts and his underwear drawer . at the moment , she was having inappropriate thoughts about his underwear . . . or hopefully lack thereof . of course , she could ##n ' t help seeing him as not being the marrying type . ` ` no , that ' s not what i think of you . ' ' ` ` i would haveno . i thought that since i ' m a little older than you - ' ' ` ` just a little ? ' ' the corners of his mouth turned up . ` ` ' you think i ' m an old man . ' ' ` ` no , i said . ' not , ' ' she blurted . ` ` how old do you think i am ? just out of clean diapers and a shower ? ' ' she scowled at him . ` ` i was not thinking that at all . i think you ' re very close to aidan ' s age . ' ' pesh ' s brow furrowed in confusion . ` ` ankle ? ' ' she paused before explaining where the nickname came from . ` ` i see . so , how old is he again ? ' ' ` ` thirty - four . ' ' ` ` hmm , ' ' pesh murmured . ` ` are you older than that ? ' ' ` ` ' still . i ' m thirty - seven . ' ' damn , he was a lot older than her . thirty years to be exact . ` ` did i tell you ? ' ' he asked , with a teasing note in his voice . she shook her head . ` ` i ' d hardly call thirty - seven old . ' ' ` `it ' s considerably older than you are , right ? ' ' ` ` i am , ' ' she lied . he grinned at her as he leaned on the counter with his elbows . ` ` and just how old are you ? ' ' ` ` twenty - five - i ' ll be twenty - six in a few months . ' ' ` ` twenty - five going on twenty - six . ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` i must look very ancient to you . ' ' he held out his head and shook it . ` ` you might have a bald spot or two . ' ' she smacked his arm playfully . ` ` shut up . twenty - five is not old . ' ' ` ` got any gray hairs ? ' ' he asked , bending down to where his thick head of hair was in front of her face . her fingers began to comb through the dark strands . her mind went straight to the mental image of her fingers tugging at his hair as he went down on her , jerking it back when he sucked and licked her until she screamed , and then brushing the damp strands back from his face as he rose up to cover her mouth with his . she cleared her throat that had run dry . ` ` no , of course not . ' ' hetilting his head up to wink at her . ` ` then there ' s hope for us both . ' ' ` ` i would hope so . ' ' aidan appeared then , placing all the food on a tray . ` ` i expect a snack when you guys leave , ' ' he teased . ` ` i ' ll remember that , ' ' megan replied . after nodding his head toward the table next to him , aidan asked , ` ` why ' n ' t you two sit over here with me ? ' ' she resisted the urge to slap him . she was enjoying having pesh to herself . ` ` um , okay . okay , ' ' she said , slowly sliding out of her seat . when they switched tables , she was happy to have pesh in the empty seat beside her , rather than across from her . once she was settled in , she was wasn ' t lamenting her seat change too much . with casey , and emma ' s new best friend , connor , the table was kept from raucous ##ness . it was good being with a group of friends . after she had gotten pregnant , she didn ##n ' t have much in common with her sorority sisters anymore . then when she became a mother , she rarely saw anyone from her old school . her motherbut in an entirely different way than theirs had . the conversation and laughter flowed as freely as the drinks . megan found herself halfway through her second margarita when she started feeling funny . a flush filled her cheeks at the same time she felt clammy . as aidan came back with a beer , she asked , ` ` did you put something different in this one ? ' ' ` ` no , we ran out of the one i bought for the party , so i gave my little niece a double shot of the same . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' megan asked . aidan ' s brow furrowed behind his tipped up the bottle . after he swallowed , he asked , ` ` does it taste bad ? ' '
