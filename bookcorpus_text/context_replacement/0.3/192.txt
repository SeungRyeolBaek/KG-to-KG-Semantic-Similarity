` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' ` ` it ' s alright . i ' ve got some stuff in my car - please , don ' t you just sit down for a moment . ' ' i nod . in a different time , i would have questioned the safety of getting into a strange man ' s car , but this is not a sane moment . she puts her arm around my shoulders and leads me to the passenger side of her own car , parked just down the street from the gates of the school . she helps me inside then walks around to the driver ' s side and gets in . ` ` here you go , ' ' she says , grabbing a box of tissues from the floor of the back seat . ` ` thanks , ' ' i say , incoherently . she turns on the car ' s interior light . ` ` oh ! ' ' i gasp . ` ` you ' re the woman from the school parking lot . ' ' she smiles wryly . ` ` i thought you saw him that day . i ' m not a stalker or anything . it ' s just , sometimes i want to get a glimpse of him , that ' s all . see what he looks like , how he ' s acting . ' ' `` i know . ' ' ` ` ' what ' s happened to you ? is there anything i can do ? ' ' ` ` it ' s pierce , ' ' i murmur as the tears fall from my eyes at the mention of his name . ` ` what ' s he do now ? ' ' ` ` he . . . he made a pass at me at first . i mean , i actually was n ' t sure that ' s what he was right after , but then , he got on my back about something i did ##n ' t even remember , and that ' s when i knew for sure . ' ' ` ` oh , honey , i ' m sorry , ' ' she says , patting my hand . ` ` pierce has a serious amount of ego . he thinks that anything with a penis is fair game , including his stepdaughter , it seems . ' ' ` ` i mean , i already knew he was an asshole from the way he treats nate , but i just ... ##n ' t felt anything directed at me yet . ' ' she nods . ` ` he does n ' t treat nate well ? ' ' she asks quietly . ` ` oh , honey , i ' m sorry , ' ' i say , looking at her .my dad . ` ` he ' s . . . he ' s very hard on nate . he calls him entitled , arrogant , when i think those are the things he knows deep down are true about himself . ' ' ` ` my poor nate , ' ' she whispers to herself . ` ` but he ' s good . . . nate is a good person , you should know that . and , to be honest , at first i thought he was more like you , but that ' s just my guess . whether it ' s that maybe his genes are yours , or maybe his father raised him to be a better person than he is himself , i wonder . ' you know . but he ' s smart , funny , and . . . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' she says , squeezing my hand . ` ` i ' m sorry you have to go through this . did you tell your mom ? ' ' ` ` she found out at lunch , but . . . ' ' i shake my head . ` ` she ' s totally under pierce ' s spell . she got all that from him , but i ' ve never seen her quite so much of anything as him . she looks a lot like you , actually , ' ' i say, studying her beautiful , slightly flushed face . ` ` pierce always has a temper , ' ' she says with a sad smile . ` ` there ' s another thing you should know . . . about nate . . . i found out when you called : he said you left because he was too good for you , because he was a good kid , basically . i tried to talk to him about it , too , but he would n ' t hear it . ' ' ` ` nate is a good guy , and even if he ' d been the devil incarnate , i still would ##n ' t have left him . ' ' ` ` yeah , i figured as much . he said that the night before you left , you and nate had a big fight over him , because he misbehaved , and that ' s why you left the next day . ' ' ` ` oh , god , ' ' she says , burying her face in her hands . ` ` he must have felt so alone , so lost . no . . . i remember that night , because it was our last . we ' d gone to a charity event that night , and we ' d met this woman , who was in our circle at the time . i knew he ' d cheated before ,but he promised me he ' d behave , and then at this party , i could just tell by the way they looked at each other that they were sleeping together . i confronted him about it at home , and he never even bothered to deny it . i was yelling at him , about what kind of example he was setting for his son . i just . . . i never thought that would be one of the last times i ' d see nate . i never thought that was even a possibility . ' ' ` ` i need to see you , ' ' i say suddenly . ` ` what ? no . you have too much going on already , ' ' eileen says , shaking her head slowly .
