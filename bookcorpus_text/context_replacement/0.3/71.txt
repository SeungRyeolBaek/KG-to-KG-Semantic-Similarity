` ` would it be okay if they started dating ? ' ' a deep sigh escaped megan ' s lips . ` ` no , he deserves to be happy . my nana has been dead for ten years , so it ' s not like he raced out the minute he was born and started going after women like that . ' ' pesh chuckled at her comment . ` ` did you really like her ? ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , megan said , ` ` that ' s the other thing . she was really nice . and patrick liked her . i think she ' s been there before when he was with papa . ' ' after taking his place at the stove , pesh placed his hands on the kitchen counter and leaned in close to megan . ` ` it looks to me like patrick has found a good woman who loves him and his family . i do don ' t think you could ask for a better scenario . ' ' she stared into his eyes for a moment before she spoke . ` ` you ' re right . i do don ' t know why i got so upset about it all . ' ' ` ` because as much as you love your grandmother , you ' re still protective of your grandmother ' s privacy . ' ' ` ` you 're - wise , ' ' she murmured . ` ` it comes with class , ' ' he said , with a grin . ` ` right . ' ' he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek before heading to the kitchen . ` ` ` ' patrick ' s my best friend , what else happened to get you so upset ? ' ' when megan said don ' t answer , pesh turned around . ` ` what else was it ? ' ' ` ` you need to have a serious discussion with kara . ' ' his eyebrows rose in surprise . ` ` i do ? ' ' ` ` yes , you do . ' ' ` ` megan , you must remember that i ' m not in charge of you . ' ' she rolled her eyes . ` ` yes , i realize that . but you are in charge of your nurses , are you not ? ' ' ` ` excuse me ? ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , megan said , ` ` kara seems to think that the two of you are an item . ' ' pesh chuckled . ` ` oh that ' s right . we ' re just back from work together . ' ' megan narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him . ` ` you ' ve never seen her outside of work ? ' ' this was the firstof that he just hadn ' t planned on ever having to face . the rest was something he really did n ' t want to admit to megan . carefully choosing his words , he replied , ` ` we got together for sex a couple of times after graduation a few months ago . i would think that defined us as an ' item . ' ' ' ` ` it might be enough for her to think she can convince me that you ' re only using me for sex . ' ' pesh winced at the words . he would have never taken kara for being someone who was lying . he put down the pan and turned off the stove . he knew he could n ' t move on without coming clean . ` ` megan , i ' haven ' t been sleeping with you . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' she asked . ` ` i told you that kara and i had only had sex a couple of times . but that # ##n ' t the whole truth . ' ' megan ' s eyes widened . ` ` what are you saying ? ' ' again , his shoulders drooped a little . ` ` after the night of noah ' s accident , i could n ' t get you off my mind . i had to prove to myself thati was n ' t too happy with you . so after having a couple of drinks one night , kara and i went to my room and messed around . ' ' ` ` you were drunk ? ' ' he gave a mirthless laugh . ` ` that is what is so shocking to you ? what i just told you ? ' ' ` ` did you think i would be mad at you for messing around with some girl when we really weren ' t together ? ' ' ` ` no , ' ' he answered honestly . megan shook her head . ` ` what you did then is your fault . i mean , i ' m just thrilled to know that you messed around with her , especially since you would ##n ' t sleep with me when i asked you to . ' ' ` ` ' do n ' t you see the point ? she cared for you , and you cared nothing for her . we were only in the room fifteen minutes if that tells you anything . ' ' the corners of her lips tugged up in a small smile . ` ` i really do don ' t need the reminder of how much you could ##n ' t enjoy yourself . ' ' he shook his head . ` ` i ' m sorry . i should ##n ' t have said that . ' '` ` but at the same time , i ' m glad to hear that you wo n ' t be coming back for a repeat performance . ' ' jerking his eyes up to meet hers , he replied , ` ` how could i forget that . ' ' ` ` and you really were trying to get her off your mind ? ' ' ` ` yes , i was . ' ' ` ` in a weird way , that ' s very romantic , ' ' she teased . ` ` i ' m glad you think so , ' ' he replied . ` ` actually , it ' s not the fact that she thought you were using her for sex that has her so upset . ' ' ` ` it ' s not ? ' '
