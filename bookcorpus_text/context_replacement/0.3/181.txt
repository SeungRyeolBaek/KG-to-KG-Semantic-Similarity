i feel his hands press down against my forearms , his long fingers now reaching out for me , and pinning me to the bed . his other hand slides out of me and pulls my hips back toward him . i begin to tremble with anticipation , i do n ' t want to wait very long . i feel his cock against my slit , pushing into me as he holds me in place . i cry out from pain and pleasure as he reawakens the pain he created the first time , but unlike that time , the pleasure is also instant and intense . i feel his breath in my ear . ` ` you like that ? ' ' ` ` yes , oh god , yes , ' ' i moan . he thrusts into me faster . ` ` it ' s so hard to hold back with you , ' ' he mutters , almost to himself . ` ` you do don ' t have to , ' ' i reply . i hear him grunt in response and push into me harder . suddenly i feel myself being picked up and flipped over . before i know it , i ' m on my hands and knees without nate and i am losing contact . i have to bite my lip to keep myself from crying out in pain as he pulls out and drives back in . it ' sin so deep now , pressing directly against my g - spot with every thrust . my body begins to shake with another orgasm and this time , i let myself go with it . i feel nate ' s hands pulling my hips up to meet his with every thrust as he comes with me . my elbows collapse down with the final ##ity of my orgasm , and nate collapses on top of me , gently kissing the side of my neck . ` ` fuck , brynn , i ' m sorry , ' ' he whispers , as he pulls my hair out of my face . ` ` sorry ? why are you sorry ? ' ' i ask , befuddled . ` ` you ' re crying . . . i ' m so sorry . i was too rough , i went too quickly , i - ' ' he rushes out , sounding breathless . my brain tries to catch up with him . ` ` no , baby . it did ##n ' t hurt . i did ##n ' t even realize i was crying . everything was fine . ' ' his body stills against mine . ` ` i was just scared for a second there . i thought i lost you . ' ' ` ` no , baby . . . ' ' i reach up to touch my face , and he ' s there - mythey are damp . ` ` that ' s so sweet . this does don ' t happen a lot ? ' ' he pushes himself up so he can look at me with an amused grin . ` ` i do try not to make girls cry , brynn . ' ' i laugh . ` ` i ' m sorry , i just meant . . . i wonder if this happens to other girls . i know they probably don ' t usually . . . you know , let go of things like that . especially the emotional part . . . ' ' ` ` okay . ' as long as you ' re ok . ' ' ` ` i ' m more than ok , ' ' i assure him . ` ` really ? ' ' i nod . ` ` a lot . ' ' ` ` i ' ll get you some water , ' ' he says , kissing the back of my neck before gently pulling out of me . he comes back from the kitchen with a glass for me , and lies down in bed with me as i drink it . ` ` i wish you could sleep here , ' ' i murmur , resting my head on his shoulder . i am spent , exhausted . . . and happy . ` ` me too . ' ' chapter twenty - two the next morning , i wakestill waiting for nate , but he ' s gone . i turn over onto my back in frustration . i thought that after we had sex my desire for him might fade a bit , become more manageable , but it ' s even worse now . even though i can feel a little heat and pressure between my legs , i want him to touch me again , and again , and again . i look at the clock and am surprised to see it ' s almost nine . well , i guess i did have a big day yesterday , between my sliding off that cliff and losing my virginity . i slide under the sheets to the edge of the bed and curl up on the edge . i roll my ankle and find that there ' s barely any pain , so i guess i should leave the pain off for one more day just to be safe . i shower and pull on a pair of yoga pants and a t - shirt and go downstairs to the kitchen and fix myself some breakfast . my mom walks in just as i ' m sitting down at the kitchen table . ` ` wow , that ' s a lot of food , brynn , ' ' she comments , raising her eyebrows at the amount of eggs and toast on my plate . ` ` thanks , ' ' i reply , pausing only momentarilywhile continuing to shovel food into my mouth . ` ` i can see that . how ' s your head ? ' ' ` ` much better . ' ' i clear my throat . i need to stop acting weird . my mother will know something ' s up . i set down my fork . ` ` did you have a good lunch with pierce today ? where ' d you go ? ' ' ` ` the palm , ' ' she replies . ` ` it was great . pierce is a regular there and he has the best table . ' '
