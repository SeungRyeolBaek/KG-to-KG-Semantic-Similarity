my dad does know how to throw a good party . i grab a beer as the twilight turns into night and people begin heading down to the lower levels to get a better view of the fireworks . with a sudden hush , the display ends . there are a few exclamations of excitement and some clapping as the crowd gathers to look downriver at the explosions of light . i ' m making my way toward the rear of the crowd when i feel a hand on the small of my back . i know before i even turn around that it ' s nate . ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' he asks quietly , as i turn to face him . ` ` it ' s nothing . my mom ' ' didn ' t sleep well , ' ' i reply . ` ` you ' re pulling at your hair , ' ' he points out , and i drop my hand , feeling embarrassed . the crowd cheers as an especially colorful firework goes off behind me . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` i can read you like a book , brynn , ' ' he says , leaning in . i can feel his breath on my cheek and step back , feeling flustered . ` ` i just think it ' s something that your dad should tell you , ' ' isigh , and turn back to the window , but i feel his hand on my elbow . ` ` would you just tell me ? you and my dad are both acting weird , and then your mom disappears . . . i really want to know . ' ' ` ` and here i thought i was ... well , ' ' i say , stalling for time . ` ` maybe to other people , but not to me . ' ' i stare at him for a moment . his features are illuminated by the light of one of my favorite , heart - shaped candles . ` ` there ' s a reporter . . . she ' s going to go on the news today and say that your dad sexually assaulted her . ' ' ` ` that ' s bullshit , ' ' he hisses at me . ` ` i ' m not the reporter - you know i tell you - ' ' i say , taken aback by his words . ` ` my dad , he ' s a good guy . he ' s a pillar of the community - ' ' ` ` a pillar of the community ? ' ' ` ` what ? he is ! ' ' ` ` it ' s just , sometimes the way you talk about him . . . he ' s not real , nate . ' ' `` you # n ' t know anything about him . when my dad left us , he took care of me all by himself . he ' s always been there for me . ' ' ` ` ok , i ' m just - ' ' but nate storms off back to the house . i stand in silence for a moment . i knew that this was ain ' t going to be fun , but i did ##n ' t think he ' d turn on me like that , as though i were attacking pierce , or something . i turn back toward the crowd just as the music starts and the screen lights up . i glance at the people around me , their faces upturned , their expressions happy . maybe it was silly of me to look forward to everyone leaving . because now i realize that eventually , it will come down to the two of us alone in the house - and no buffer ##s . my eyes fall on pierce and i realize he ' s staring at me . he turns away when he realizes that i ' m looking at him , and joins the applause as the last firework goes down . chapter fourteen i was half - hoping that the plan was for all four of us to watch the tv program together , but thankfully there ' s no such thing . or at least ,i have haven ' t been told of this . it ' s the first time in a while my mom has n ' t insisted on a late dinner . she ' s been locked up in her room most of the day , while pierce answers questions from his attorneys in his office . i decide to grab some leftover food from the fridge to eat in my room , and peer into nate ' s room as i go . no sign of him . i close my door behind me and grab my laptop to check out some of the articles online . i feel nauseous as i read the reporter ' s claims , and slightly relieved that she is isn ' t accusing pierce of any kind of crime . she talked mostly about lingering touches , shoulder massages , and being slapped by pierce when she fell . i finish eating and click on the internet for a while , feeling restless . when i ' n ' t tolerate my boredom any longer , i take my plate and head back down to the kitchen and put it in the sink . the phone on the counter rings as i ' m headed past it . i pause for a moment , waiting to see if someone else is going to answer it . what if it ' s a reporter ? should i just say ' no ', ' like they do on tv ? on the third ring , i decide to bite the bullet . ` ` hello ? ' ' ` ` hi , is nate there ? ' ' a female voice asks softly . ah , another lie . ` ` sorry , i ' n ' t think he is , ' ' i reply quickly . ` ` can i take a message ? ' ' there ' s a long silence . ` ` is this callie ? ' ' ` ` yes , this is her sister , brynn . can i ask who ' s calling ? ' '
