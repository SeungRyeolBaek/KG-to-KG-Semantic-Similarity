he laughed . ` ` you ' ve got the more romantic idea confused with what it really is . ' ' megan pursed her lips at him as her mind raced with the possibilities . after all , if tantric sex with pesh was really as good as his efforts in going down on her , she was one very special woman . ` ` i guess you ' ll just have to educate me . ' ' they were greeted by an air traffic controller with a headset . ` ` hey , dr . nadeen , how goes it ? ' ' ` ` good . thank you . everything ready to go , sir ? ' ' pesh asked , as he shook the pilot ' s hand . ` ` ' ' and clear out . we still have your flight plan . ' ' pesh ' s gaze slid to megan as he said , ` ` we ' ll be flying into savannah / hilton head tomorrow . ' ' ` ` great . great , ' ' he replied , before he disappeared back inside the hanger . ` ` you ' re taking me to savannah ? ' ' she nodded . ` ` for dinner and lunch . we had originally intended on flying , but we had a delayed flight . ' ' ` ` this is crazy . you ' re crazy . ' 'he gave her a puzzled look . ` ` you ' don ' t like savannah ? ' ' ` ` no , i love it . i just meant take me two hours away for dinner . ' ' ` ` it ' s not that long by plane . ' ' crossing her arms over her chest , she shook her head at him . ` ` you could . ' ' just take me somewhere fancy like savannah ? you want to take me on your private jet to the city ? ' ' he laughed . ` ` why not ? ' ' although it was probably unattractive , she could couldn ' t help responding with contempt . ` ` i ' m probably going to sound a lot like the heroine from wonder woman when she says she likes the seduction scene , but she ' s a sure thing . ' ' she patted her chest . ` ` i am a sure thing . you really don ' t have to go to all this trouble . ' ' his dark eyes narrowed . ` ` your way of thinking is exactly why i ' m doing what i do . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` you ' ve only been with men who were a sure thing - men who ' haven ' t even been able to imagine a relationship with you past whenthey leave at the end of the day . ' ' she sucked in a breath at his words . with his eyes softening , he closed the distance between them . ` ` while you not only want sex from me , i want far more from you . i want your trust , but i also want you to understand that you ' re worthy of something more . and if it takes money and fancy cars to prove it to you , then i ' m going to prove it . ' ' despite his words , megan sat frozen in dumbfounded silence . how was it possible that he cared so much about her ? he was right about the fact that she longed for being the ' sure thing ' for the men she dated in the past . she knew she ' n ' t want to make those mistakes again , so why should ##n ' t she let him continue to wine and dine her ? ` ` fine . take me to paris . ' ' he opened the passenger side door . ` ` here you go . make sure you buckle your seat belt . ' ' she smiled before she climbed into the car . pesh waited for her to straighten her dress before he closed the door . as he walked around the front of the plane , she got busy securing the seat belt and buckling the. as she climbed in , he handed her his helmet . ` ` this will help with the engine noise . ' ' ` ` it ' s going to mess my hair up , ' ' she warned . he laughed . ` ` i never struck you as the kind of woman who worries about her hair . ' ' she smiled as she put the helmet on . ` ` ' you see . i worry about my hair , and you get your clothes on in the bedroom . ' ' he rolled his eyes at her and turned in his seat . after putting his helmet on , he began flipping switches and pushing knobs . the speaker on the back of the cockpit started up . ` ` ' what kind of plane is this ? ' ' she asked over the speaker . holding up a finger , he spoke into the mic on the dash . ` ` clearance to ground , this is cessna 172 requesting to approach for takeoff . ' ' suddenly the sound of the tower came over her headset . ` ` clearance for taxi and takeoff , cessna 172 . ' ' ` ` roger that , ' ' pesh replied . the plane lurched forward and then began rolling with the runaway . ` ` hmm , i ' m guessing ' cessna 172 ? ' ' pesh asked. ` ` yes , it is . ' ' ` ` it ' s beautiful . i like it . ' ' ` ` i think you ' ll be saying that again in a minute . ' ' megan realized what he meant when the plane began to speed down the runway . just like when she was on a commercial flight , it was on the ground one minute , and was in the air the next . they soared into the night sky while zipping through thick , fluffy clouds . once they had gained enough speed , pesh eased off of the rudder and glanced over at her .
