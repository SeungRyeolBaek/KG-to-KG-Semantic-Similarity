` ` that ' s my baby boy ! ' ' emma announced happily , smothering both his cheeks with kisses . megan snuggled up to emma ' s side . ` ` come on , meggie . you and pesh come in here , ' ' aidan suggested . megan did n ' t argue with him . instead , she took pesh ' s hand and led aidan inside . emma looked up and shook her head . ` ` i ' m so sorry for crashing your engagement party . ' ' ` ` you did ##n ' t bother our guests , ' ' pesh assured her . ` ` that ' s right . we kept right on saying - you did ##n ' t bother us at all , ' ' megan said . emma laughed . ` ` i ' m glad to hear that . ' ' megan smiled and jerked her head over to aidan , who sat in the chair with her . ` ` congratulations on a new baby boy . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' emma said , as a huge smile lit up her face . ` ` are you feeling better ? ' ' pesh asked . emma nodded . ` ` it was a lot easier this time and a lot better . ' ' she turned to aidan . ` ` and this time i am .' t want to worry that aidan might not make it . ' ' aidan chuckled . ` ` no , you just kept screaming at me to drive faster because you were just going to deliver noah on the side of the road . ' ' emma ' s cheeks flushed . ` ` i guess i was a little panicked . ' ' pesh grabbed megan ' s hand and squeezed it . ` ` we should stop and let the others have a look , ' ' he said . ` ` do you want me to take him home with us ? ' ' since he was plastered to his mother ' s car , megan really wasn ' t really looking forward to having to take him . emma gazed down at her son with love burning in her eyes . ` ` no , i think he should stay here with us a while longer . i can get connor to take him home . i know he ' ll be here until casey calls . ' ' ` ` are you sure you wo ##n ' t need your rest ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` oh , i ' ll hand him off to aidan and make sure i get plenty of sleep until aunt casey calls me , ' ' emma replied , with a sly smile . aidan , don ' t argue with her . i was perfectly content to just sleepif it meant being surrounded by his wife and children . after exchanging a few hugs and kisses , she and pesh stepped out into the hallway and let the small crowd in . as they walked down the hall hand in hand , pesh turned to her and smiled . ` ` you know , i never thought i would see the day i would be worthy of aidan again . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' he heaved a sigh . ` ` seeing him with his children makes me happy . one day i hope that ' s you with my child in your arms . ' ' ` ` oh , ' ' she murmured . whether or not they would have children together had never really been discussed . it was almost a certainty that they would , so it really didn ' t seem hard to figure out when and how many . she wanted nothing more than to give pesh a family of his own . he was like the father she had never had . ` ` give me one year , ' ' she said softly . his brow furrowed in confusion . ` ` what ? ' ' ` ` i ' d like one year for us to be happy as a married couple before we decide to have children . ' ' ` ` that only makes me an even older man , '' she laughed . ` ` you ' ll be fine . you ' re awfully spry for your young age . ' ' he chuckled . ` ` ' sure ' don ' t want to be called a baby at his or her high school graduation . ' ' she smacked his arm playfully . ` ` one year is not going to make that much a difference . ' ' ` ` fine . you win . we ' ll wait another year . ' ' when the elevator doors dinged open , they stepped inside . smiling down at her , pesh said , ` ` i could ne ' er have picked a more appropriate name for my first child . ' ' ` ` yeah , i have ta say that you did good , nadeen . really good , ' ' she teased . he cupped her face in his hands and gave her a passionate kiss that silenced all of her comebacks . when he pulled back , she grinned at him . ` ` keep kissing me like that , and i might decide to wait even longer for the baby . you ' ll make me have you , your mouth , and your dick all to myself for as long as possible . ' ' ` ` and here i thought my kiss would get you in the mood for baby - making , ' ' pesh mused. megan laughed . ` ` either way , it ' s a win - win situation . so bring it on , nadeen . bring . it . on . ' ' chapter twenty - two although her stomach growled in protest to move her feet , megan could n ' t resist sucking off the first bite of the cake into her mouth . as she chewed , she closed her eyes at the delicious taste of chocolate and cinnamon danced along her taste buds . ` ` megan ? ' ' a voice asked from across the table . her eyes popped open to take in pesh , her new husband of three days .
