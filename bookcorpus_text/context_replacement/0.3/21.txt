she grabbed his arm . ` ` stop it , ankle ! it ' s not him , it ' s me . it ' s all my fault . okay ? ' ' he looked at her in surprise . ` ` what happened ? ' ' ` ` give me some coffee and a chance to calm down , and then i ' ll tell you everything . ' ' although his face was grim , aidan nodded , and then started to close the door . megan caught one last glimpse of pesh as his car sped off down the street . she hoped for her sake and his safety was the last time she would have to see him . chapter 8 megan anxiously tapped her thumbs on the steering wheel of her car . her residency placement had come up , and she was well on her way to make her report to her preceptor , the nurse who would supervise her . although she had initially been disappointed in not receiving grady , she was now thrilled to be completing the last part of the training to become a nurse . she was also grateful she had n ' er received the night shift that most of her fellow nursing students did . she would have rarely been able to see him if she had to study during the day and work at night . she pulled into the parking lot of the wells##tar er and eased into the first space she found . after turning off the lights , she grabbed her folder of papers along with her purse and went inside . she stopped at the front desk . ` ` i ' m not a doctor . i ' m a clinical nurse here to see kristi parkman . ' ' ` ` go on in , ' ' the woman said , as she buzzed open the main staff entrance door . breezing inside the lobby of the hospital , megan could couldn ' t help feeling excited . she could ##n ' t wait until she got her feet back from running with them . glancing around , she was wasn ' t quite sure how she was going to find the nurse . she stopped at an office teaming with nurses . ` ` can i help you ? ' ' one of them asked . ` ` yes , i ' m here to see kristi parkman . ' ' a tall blonde woman in her fifties walked over to her with a beaming smile . ` ` you must be dr . mckenzie ? ' ' ` ` i am . ' ' ` ` it ' s very nice to meet you . ' ' megan smiled . ` ` it ' s nice meeting you , too . ' ' ` ` we ' re all very happy to have you. i ' ve taken a look at your house , and it ' s very impressive . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' megan replied . ` ` why ' don ' t i show you around first ? that way you ' ll be ready to go with the doctor tomorrow . ' ' ` ` sounds good . ' ' with a smile , kristi led her around the maze of hallways . she pointed out where the medicine cabinet was , the waiting area , and where she would find the break room . each time they passed a nurse or a doctor , kristi was quick to introduce megan . ` ` everyone seems so nice , ' ' megan said . ` ` it really is a wonderful place to work . now , i ' m not going to lie that some of the residents can be real ass * * les . but we ' re so lucky to have a doctor who is such a gentleman . ' ' ` ` that ' s wonderful . ' ' ` ` yes , everyone loves dr . nadeen . ' ' megan ' s heart came to a stop . nadeen . no , it could n ' t be . surely there were more doctors with that last name . searching her memory , she tried desperately to remember where he said he worked . ` ` oh ., it ' s just down the hall . let me introduce you two . ' ' ` ` no , that ' s really - ' ' is not , ' ' megan protested weakly . behind her , kristi said , ` ` dr . nadeen , please meet our newest nursing student . ' ' the moment she turned around , megan felt like she was going to throw up . after spending two months trying hard to forget about her first meeting with pesh nadeen , there he was right in front of her . she could n ' not help feeling the classic line from jaws echoing in her mind , ` ` ' of all the shitty joints in all the world , she had to walk into mine . ' ' she had felt that , about all the places she could have possibly been assigned to , she had to be assigned to his . the shock and surprise registered on his face as well . he was quick to mask it by smiling warmly at her . ` ` hello again , megan . ' ' kristi ' s eyebrows shot up at the sound of pesh ' s voice . ` ` you know each other ? ' ' ` ` um , well , ' ' megan stammered . how was she going to explain ? the last thing she needed was to get off on the subjectalong with her coworkers . pesh nodded . ` ` she and i shared a room . ' ' ` ` ' how wonderful . ' ' kristi patted megan ' s back . ` ` what good for you then ending up dropping out of all the classes ? ' ' ` ` oh , what luck , ' ' megan murmured . kristi smiled . ` ` well , i ' ll let you two catch up for a day or two . ' ' ` ` oh , that ' s okay . you do n ' you have to do that , ' ' megan said . waving her hand dismissively , kristi said , ` ` it gave me a chance to go grab a sandwich and something to eat .
