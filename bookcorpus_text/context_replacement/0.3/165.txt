` ` instead of being on the bottom , roderick called me steven yesterday , ' ' greg says , referencing pierce ' s business name . i laugh . ` ` wow ! is there even a steven in there ? ' ' ` ` nope ! that ' s the worst part . who knows what pierce was thinking of . . . ' ' he shakes his head sadly . ` ` how come pierce ' s son is ain ' t working at thornhill and co . ? did n ' t want to work with his son ? ' ' ` ` um , the opposite , actually . pierce was so hard on nate . . . i feel kind of guilty about the whole thing because i knew nate wanted the internship , and that pierce offered it to me to punish him . i tried not to accept , but he insisted , and we ' d just be , you know ? didn ' n ' t want to be involved . not to mention , my mom and dad have n ' t known each other for that long , and i was a little taken aback by how quickly they ' d gotten together . . . ' ' i bite my lip . ` ` sorry , greg . i ' m rambling . ' ' ` ` it ' s ok , i get it . my parents are a, really . ' ' ` ` well , they ' n ' not actually divorced . they were n ' t married in the first place , ' ' i say . but greg is ain ' t there - he ' s standing at the entrance to the restaurant . ` ` speaking of . . . ' ##n ' t that nate here ? did you tell him we were coming here ? ' ' ` ` wait , what ? it ' ##uld ' t be him , ' ' i say , turning around to look . and sure enough , there he is , with the brunette stunner on his arm . that asshole ! there ' s no way this is a coincidence - he must have overheard me telling my parents that greg was taking me here . ` ` brynn ! ' ' nate says with a smile , waving his date over as the waiter trails them . ` ` i ' n ' t know you guys were coming here ? ! greg , right ? i ' m nate . ' ' ` ` good to meet you , ' ' greg says , shaking his outstretched hand . ` ` and this is sophie , ' ' nate says , indicating his date . ` ` hey , ' ' she says , looking up for a moment from the cellphone in her hand . ` ` did you` want to sit together ? ' ' the hostess asks . ` ` we could pull a table over . ' ' i could ask her . ` ` what do you think ? ' ' nate asks greg , his curiosity returning full - force . ` ` um , yeah , sure , why not ? ' ' greg asks . i slowly stand and make my way over to greg as the waiter and the hostess pull another small table over . i ' m not going to sit next to nate and risk a repeat of that soul - stealing kiss . ` ` i ' ll let you two sit next to each other , ' ' i explain with a saccharine smile as i take a seat next to greg . ` ` we just ordered and you ' re not too far away , ' ' greg says as the hostess hands nate and sophie drinks . ` ` could we get a picture of dom for the table ? ' ' nate asks the hostess , who nods once and walks off . ` ` oh , you guys don ' t have to - ' ' greg begins . ` ` no , i insist . we ' re wasting your time here , ' ' nate says magnanimously . ` ` i get it , ' ' sophie pipes up , quickly putting heri call . i narrow my eyes at nate and he studiously avoids my gaze . ` ` so , what were you two guys talking about before we got here ? ' ' nate asks greg . ` ` nothing , really , ' ' greg replies smiling at me . ` ` you know , with your light hair , you two could almost be related . cousins , maybe , ' ' nate says , leaning back in his chair . i playfully kick his shin under the table . i see his jaw drop but he ' doesn ' t even make a sound . ` ` oh my god , nate ! ' ' sophie gasps . ` ` i made out with my cousin nate , and i ' n ' t know he was my cousin at the time . and then it happened and . . . ' ' i glare at nate . sophie launches into her story , and he grins back at me . it ' s going to be a long night . chapter sixteen i spin around in nate ' s desk chair as he shuts his office door behind him . i ' ve been sitting here , waiting , ever since greg dropped me off twenty minutes ago . ` ` jesus ! what are you , a teenage girl ? ' ' he asks , sounding startled . ` ` what were you thinking ? !i think you did that on purpose to ruin my night , you know ! ' ' nate shrugs . ` ` come on , you were going to tell me you were having a nice time before i got there ? ' ' ` ` oh , so you were just freaking me out , is that it ? greg was totally weirded out by the whole thing . ' ' ` ` sophie had a nice time . ' ' ` ` sophie , really ! where ' d you find her ? your high school friend ? ' ' ` ` i found her , ' ' he says with a smug smile as he sits on his bed . ` ` oh , really ? then why are ##n ' t you with her right now ?
