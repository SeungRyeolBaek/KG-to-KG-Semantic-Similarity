` ` nope . not a chance . ' ' pesh shoved his hands into his lab coat . ` ` i have asked megan to accompany me on a date , and at this point , we are at a stalemate . but , i am not planning on giving up anytime soon . does that end your relationship ? ' ' aidan laughed , but then his brows furrowed . ` ` what do you mean ? you two looked so happy and happy together when we broke up . ' ' with a slight shake of his head , pesh said , ` ` she does n ' t want to date me . ' ' ` ` i call bullshit . i may have been shot in the head , but no one could see the way she was looking at you . and if you - ' ' although it was against his character , he let his anger cloud his better judgment . ` ` she asked you for advice but not for a date , right ? ' ' aidan ' s mouth gaped open . ` ` you mean , she ' s not like . . . , dude ? ' ' ` ` if you mean that she has pretty much refused to go to dinner with me or any other social event that a man and woman would go in on a date , and yet , shewould rather pursue a strictly physical relationship , then the answer is yes . ' ' ` ` my god , it ' s like she ' s turning into the old emma , ' ' aidan said . he ran his hands over his face before he looked at pesh again . ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' with a sigh , pesh said , ` ` she ' s still too young . i suppose in her eyes , she ' s been kind of fun the last two years . this is a way for her to make up for that . see if we agree or reject it . ' ' ` ` well , i still call you on the marriage thing . ' ' aidan gave pesh a long , considering look . ` ` you have to keep trying , no matter what . ' ' ` ` i really didn ' t say i was giving up , did i ? ' ' ` ` no , but i know from personal experience how hard it is to keep winning when it looks like you are ain ' t winning . ' ' ` ` what happens with you and emma is very different than with megan and me . ' ' ` ` you still have to try . ' ' aidan slid off the examining table and wobbled for a moment on shaky legs . `` megan has been hurt before , and i ' n ' t think she really understands what it means to be hurt . or even where her feelings are considered . besides , she was only twenty - one when she got knocked up . i want her to find someone who will support her , aidan . i want my sister cared for . ' ' he patted pesh ' s shoulder . ` ` i wish that someone could be you . ' ' ` ` we ' ll see . ' ' when aidan started to protest , pesh shook his head . ` ` ' to worry about your head . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' aidan mumbled . when pesh opened the door for aidan , emma and megan stared expectantly at them . ` ` ` what ' s the verdict ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` i think he ' s going to be just fine , but to be on the safe side , i ' ve ordered him a ct scan . ' ' emma ' s eyes widened in shock . ` ` you think he has a head injury from the accident ? ' ' she asked in a small voice . pesh smiled to her and put her at ease . ` ` i ' n ' t think there ' s anything serious . a nasty bump on the head, but i want to make sure there is nothing wrong with him . ' ' ` ` okay then , ' ' emma replied . an orderly appeared with a wheelchair to take aidan to his room . before he sat down , aidan leaned over to kiss emma . ` ` i ' m sorry , babe . stop worrying . this just ain ' t good for you or the baby . ' ' she gave him a weak smile . ` ` i ' ll try hard not to . ' ' he winked at her before collapsing down in the chair . ` ` nothing can keep me down - you should know that by now . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` at least we know the accident ' didn ' t do anything to your baby . ' ' ` ` of course not , ' ' emma agreed . kristi poked her head out of one of the waiting rooms . ` ` dr . nadeen , we need you . ' ' he paused before turning to megan . ` ` ' do ##n ' t you take emma to one of the family waiting rooms ? ' ' ` ` sure , ' ' megan replied . emma reached up to hug him . ` ` thanks for taking care of aidan . ' ' ` ` it was my pleasure . ' ' he gave them a quick hug before disappearing intothe waiting patient ' s room . " after talking to aidan , he suddenly had a much more determined spring in his step . chapter nine two weeks later when megan came in for a later shift , she found the emergency room in a state of chaos . ` ` whoa , what happened ? ' ' she asked kristi , after she ' d walked in and put away her things . kristi rolled her eyes . ` ` every month or so we seem to have a day where everything goes madness from start to finish . you can never stop it - you always just have to go with the flow . ' ' she grinned at megan .
