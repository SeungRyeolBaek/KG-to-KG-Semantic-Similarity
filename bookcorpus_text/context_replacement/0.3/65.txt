` ` ' what the hell is the matter ? ' ' ` ` i wish i could tell you , but i do don ' t even know myself , ' ' megan said as tears filled her eyes . ` ` dammit , damn pms again . ' ' ` ` ' honey , you do actually care about him , ' don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' she whispered . ` ` and you ' re a liar about what you ' re feeling for him , ' n ' pose you ? ' ' kristi asked . megan could couldn ' t hold back the sobs any longer . they rolled over her , causing her to bend at the waist under the weight . kristi stepped forward , wrapping her arms around megan . even though she knew she should try to control her tears while she was at work , she refused to let herself cry and get it all out . when she finally had a hold of herself , she shook her head , wiping what she imagined were the bright red tear stains from her cheeks . ` ` i ' m so sorry . that was so wrong of me . ' ' kristi gave her a sympathetic look . ` ` would you stop that , please ? this is ain ' t no act . besides , i '" the one who pulled you in here and provoked you . you should control your emotions and check out on the floor . ' ' ` ` the truth is i do feel for pesh . how could i not ? i ' m just not sure i ' m the right one for him . ' ' ` ` but if he loves you , how could you think you ' re not the right one ? ' ' megan blurted out all the things she ' d previously told pesh about her feelings and her lack of having a real relationship . when she finally finished unburdening herself of all her doubts and fears , she looked up at kristi . there was no judgment in her eyes or anger for that matter . instead , she gently patted megan ' s cheek . ` ` ' megan , you ' ve got to get all those other thoughts out and go with your heart . ' ' megan shook herself . ` ` but what if i just don ' t do what my heart is telling me to do ? ' ' ` ` you will . just give it time . ' ' kristi patted her back . ` ` ' ' n ' t you go get cleaned up and then take your lunch out ? ' ' ` ` no , i want to make up for the way i 've ##rily . ' ' ` ` you ' re right . ' ' she gestured to the door . ` ` go on . see if dr . nadeen is on his way to lunch so you can see him . ' ' ` ` ` you should n ' t . it wo ##n ' t all right if we ' re alone together . ' ' kristi snorted . ` ` alone together in a crowded hospital room ? i do n ' t think that ' s wise . ' ' megan nibbled on her bottom lip and resisted the urge to argue with kristi . after all , if the very woman who was in charge of her medical care could n ' t give a damn about her and pesh being alone together , why should she ? instead , she just gave a defeated sigh . ` ` fine , i ' ll go see . ' ' ` ` good girl . and you be true to your word now . okay ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll try . i promise . ' ' although she spoke the words with great strength of character , megan was afraid it was going to be harder than she thought . chapter twelve when pesh arrived at work the following morning , he found kristi alone in the nurses ' station . gazing around , she asked , ` ` where' s megan ? ' ' ` ` yeah , she called in sick today . ' ' ' disappointment and concern filled him . she had seemed a little off the night before when they had dinner together in the cafeteria . she seemed quieter and more withdrawn . he had just chalked it up to the fact that they were sitting with some of the other employees and she was trying not to make things too awkward with them now . he wondered if he should call her and check to make sure she was okay . they were in such turmoil now that even though it seemed like the right thing to do , he was n ' t sure . with a deep breath , he decided to leave things as they were and vowed to check on her again when she returned to work . as much as pesh hated to admit it , the day dragged mercilessly without megan . he went from patient to patient with a patience he ' n ' not experienced in a long time . when his shift ended , he met kristi in the lobby . ` ` want me to walk you out ? ' ' she asked . ` ` thank you . i ' d like that . ' ' ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' they walked out the glass doors to the employee parking lot . tofill the sound of their shoes echoing on the tile , he said , ` ` i heard to hear that megan was n ' not feeling well . ' ' ` ` so did i . poor thing has to pay a visit tomorrow to make up for being gone . ' ' kristi laughed . ` ` she sure is going to make a great mother . ' ' ` ` yes , she is . ' ' ` ` you ' ve taken a special interest in her , huh ? ' ' you ? ' ' kristi asked . pesh ' s steps suddenly faltered , and he stumbled . ` ` what do you mean ? ' '
