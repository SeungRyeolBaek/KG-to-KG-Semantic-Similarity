i gasp . ` ` sorry , i ' m don ' t want this damn thing to . . . ' ' he starts to wrap the tape around his palm . ` ` let me , ' ' i say , spying a first aid kit on the table by the window . from the blood stains on it , i can tell nate ' s already gone through it . ` ` you ' n ' you want to , ' ' he says . ` ` come over here . the light ' s better , ' ' i instruct him . ` ` do you know what you ' re doing ? ' ' he asks , more than happy to accept my help . ` ` better than you , ' ' i reply with a smile , looking at the roll of tape around his hand . i wash my hands in the sink and then open up the kit . i take a pair of surgical scissors and cut through the tape that he ' s already wrapped . i sit up slightly , and for the first time it hits me that he ' s shirtless , wearing only a pair of gym shorts and sneakers . he ' s covered in sweat . ` ` how ' d this happen ? ' ' ` ` i over - trained a little . stood up , sat on a rock and held out my handsto break my heart , ' ' he replies , eyes wide as he watches me carefully . ` ` over - training for what ? lacrosse or crew ? ' ' i ask as i pull out a roll of gauze and a bottle of hydrogen chloride . ` ` both . maybe , ' ' he answers . ` ` this is going to hurt , ' ' i warn him , as i pat the cuts on his hands with the cotton gauze . he wince ##s as the liquid stings him , but i don ' t protest . i slide my other hand under his , to hold him as i cleanse the wound of blood . i ' ve never held him this way before . ` ` your hand . ' ' he switches hands and i set to work cleaning the injured hand . ` ` maybe you should take a little time off from training , ' ' i suggest quietly . ` ` or i could just stretch out my leg muscles , ' ' he says , and i look up to see a wry grin on his face . ` ` mmm , ' ' i reply , smiling too . ` ` you know , ' ' i go on , a little more seriously , ` ` i heard that only one female student got a lawn chair , because they are sucha lifetime commitment , much less a one - sport career - ' ' ` ` do ##n ' not do that , ' ' he says . ` ` i do n ' t want your pity . ' ' ` ` it ' s not pity , it ' s love . ' ' ` ` i was born with everything , i have no excuse for not having my share of it . ' ' ` ` where did you get that ? it sounds like - ' ' i break off , feeling him tense under my touch . i was going to say his father but i can tell he ' n ' t want me to go there . ` ` you ' re just really hard on yourself , that ' s all , ' ' i say instead . i gently rub some neosporin onto the cuts . ` ` i know what everyone sees when they look at me , ' ' he replies quietly . ` ` entitled . . . eat with a silver spoon in my mouth . . . i work as hard as i can so that no one can say i cheated because of my father ' s influence . ' ' i frown . that ' s half of the truth i know , but it sounds like he does n ' t care how far his father pushes him . ` ` ' 'a little bit of that will change the next day , ' ' i say , wondering if it ' s ok to change the name of the internship he wanted . i take a dry piece of gauze and tap his hand with it , picking up the tape and starting to wrap it around his fingers . ` ` when they found out i was someone ' s daughter , i mean . feels weird . ' ' ` ` your first experience of nepotism ? ' ' ` ` yep , ' ' i say with a smile . ` ` well , my mom once got me a part - time job as the receptionist at the hospital where she used to work , so i guess that ' s not unusual . ' ' ` ` where does your dad work ? ' ' ` ` no idea . in a machine shop somewhere . he ' s a mechanic , or he was . last time we heard from him was several years ago . he lived in florida then , but he never stays in one place very long . ' ' ` ` so you ' re the first in your family to go to college , ' ' he says , as i finish taping his hand and move to the side . ` ` yep . ' ' ` ` is that why you ' re so smart? ' ' ` ` am i ? ' ' i ask , my eyes coming back to his . ` ` serious is ain ' t the right word . . . distant , maybe . ' ' ` ` distant ? that ' s worse , ' ' i say , feeling a little hurt . ` ` i did n ' t mean to insult you . i ' m just trying to help you understand . we were really in class today ? which one ? ' ' ` ` there were two . the first was this american indian survey class freshman year . ' ' ` ` ' michaels ? ' ' ` ` yeah . i always sat beside you , though . i ' m not surprised you didn ##n ' t ' me , ' ' i say , pressing down harder as i finish washing his arm .
