what do you think ? ' ' ` ` looks great , mom , ' ' i reply half - heartedly . if she notices my downtrodden appearance , she does ##n ' t - it , she just follows me back into the kitchen to show me the delicious meal she ' s spent the day preparing . when pierce comes home a half an hour later , he immediately enters his office , calling to us that he needs to make a quick call . my mom asks me to set the stuffed duck down on a silver tray , and i acquiesce , because i ' d feel too guilty to fake sick when she ' s spending so much time on the phone . when i walk back into the kitchen , pierce is murmuring into my mom ' s ear . she blushes , and i walk back out again . i see nate coming through the front door , and he walks into the dining room just as i ' m leaning against the arm of my chair . ` ` hey , ' ' he says with a smile . ` ` i was thinking about you - ' ' he breaks off as my mom and i walk in . pierce opens a bottle of champagne and moves around filling up our champagne flutes . we step back to give him a wide berth , and then weall is silent as nate finishes picking up his champagne glass . ` ` so , ' ' he says . i avoid his eye contact as we all clink our glasses . nate glances at me slightly and i know he can tell there ' s something up . oh hell , i do n ' t even think about talking to him later tonight . he can always tell when i ' m lying , and i do n ' t know what i ' m going to say . ` ` brynn , did you messenger those things like i asked ? ' ' he asks , turning to me . ` ` hm ? ' ' i ask , startled by his question . ` ` the envelopes . i had to double check because you ' ve been so distracted lately , and they ' re quite important . ' ' i frown at him . what the hell ? ` ` you did n ' t ask me to messenger anything else , nate . ' ' ` ` brynn , ' ' he says in a disappointed way , setting down his champagne flute . ` ` you did ##n ' t ! ' ' i say , a little more loudly than i meant to . i look at nate and find him raising his eyebrows at me . ` ` you know that i did . and it ' s' ` this is the first time this has happened , ' ' pierce says . ` ` maybe we should - ' ' my mother cuts in . ` ` wait , no , ' ' i say to her , holding up my hand . ` ` i don ' n ' t know what you ' re talking about here . ' ' ` ` look , this office is n ' t the place to discuss this , and since you ' re under charges , i ' ve heard from some of your old superiors that you ' n ' ve been very responsible . ' ' ` ` what ? like how ? when ? ' ' ` ` obviously they can n ' t give you the dates , and i want to protect their anonymity - ' ' ` ` wow . wow , ' ' i snap , tossing down my napkin . ` ` you are just making all this up , now ? ' are you ? ' ' ` ` brynn , calm down , ' ' nate says from across the table . ` ` calm down ? why ? he ' s married ! ' ' ` ` he has no right to - ' ' nate argues . ` ` he damn well does . he dragged me into his office , and ruined my dress , and i told him to back off , andnow he ' s pissed . ' ' ` ` you know that ' s because i was worried about those bruises on your neck , brynn . do n ' t get hysterical . ' ' ` ` you ' re a liar , ' ' i whisper . he slams his hand down on the table , causing me to jump . ` ` i will not be spoken to that way in my own house ! ' ' i glance back and forth between my father and nate , speechless . are they really just going to sit there staring at me ? i stand up so abruptly that my chair almost falls over backward . i ca n ' t like being surrounded by this man anymore . i walk quickly around the table and walk out the front door , clenching my fists to try to contain my anger until i ' m done . when i slam the door behind me , i pick up my pace , walking straight down the driveway and out of the gates . the trees quiet , quiet and still around me and tears of frustration and anger begin to stream down my face . i ca n ' t like where i ' m going - i just want to get away from that house . ` ` hey ! wait ! ' ' i hear a woman ' s voice call out behind me , but i keep walking . `` you ' re brynn , right ? ' ' i nod and take a deep breath before turning around . ` ` well , if you ' re a reporter or something , i ' m really not in the mood . ' ' i can just see her dark hair in the moonlight as she takes a few steps closer . ` ` i ' m not a reporter . i ' m nate ' s mom , eileen . ' ' chapter twenty - two ` ` hey . . . are you okay ? ' ' she asks , taking a step toward me . ` ` i ' m , i ' m just - ' ' i break off as a sob escapes my lips .
