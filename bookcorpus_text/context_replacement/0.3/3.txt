casey laughed . ` ` i ' m sure aidan would n ' t mind you pointing to the fact his gown is an illusion , and my father saying he ' s not . ' ' emma laughed . ` ` no , i ' m sure he would ##n ' t . of course , he ' d probably agree that while the baby may not have changed him , he still looks healthy and much younger than his father . ' ' megan laughed . ` ` that sounds just like him . ' ' she reached over emma to rub one of noah ' s hands . he took her hand in his fist and held on for dear life . ` ` aw , you love your godmother , ' n ' ' you know ? ' ' emma asked . casey momentarily stopped working on the baby to flash a quick smile , which warmed megan ' s heart . ` ` he ' s such a sweet boy , ' ' she mused . ` ` and a charmer , just like his old man , ' ' casey mused . ` ` that too , ' ' megan agreed . proud of her position , she tilted her head at casey . ` ` are you sure you ' re okay with me being the father ? ' ' casey waved her hand dismissively . ` ` well , the lastall i need is the godfather . i plan on spoiling him rotten and corrupting him as only a good godfather can do ! ' ' emma rolled her eyes . ` ` i ' m very satisfied with both my choices , megan . you ' n ' t have to worry . ' ' ` ` ' who is the godfather then ? you know he ' s not part of the family . ' ' casey gasped as her hand flew to her mouth again . ` ` you mean , you ' ve never met dr . mcdreamy before ? ' ' megan shrugged . ` ` no , i have n ' not . i mean , i ' ve heard about him and how he flew aidan here in time for noah ' s ark . ' ' she noticed the curious look that emma exchanged with casey . ` ` really ? what should i know about him ? ' ' casey tapped her chin with her index finger . ` ` hmm , what should you know about the good godfather ? ' ' she winked at megan . ` ` first off , he is absolutely delectable . i mean , the man is like sex on a stick . tall , jet - black hair , blue eyes , and he ' s built like a fucking shithouse . ' ' megan suddenly felt her heart piquin##g . she had n ' er imagined that the godfather would be good - looking . it had been such a long time since she had dated anyone . scratch that - it had been a long time since she ' d had sex with anyone . she ' d spent the last two years completely alone since she and nate broke up . she could have run one of the local parishes as a nun with how long she had left . ` ` really ? ' ' ` ` mmm , hmm . he reminds me of that bollywood star john abraham , ' ' casey teased . emma laughed . ` ` since when do you watch bollywood movies ? ' ' ` ` since one of nate ' s friends took me to the indian film festival . ' ' casey grinned at megan . ` ` besides the fact that he ' s a good looker , he ' s also kind , compassionate , and thoughtful - an overall good man . ' ' ` ` and you ? ' ' megan questioned . ` ` and he ' s gorgeous because he ' s a man . ' ' this conversation was sounding better and better by the minute . ` ` is he married ? ' ' emma made a disgusted face . casey laughed , ` ` oh , no , he ' s married . he ' s a widower actually. ' ' megan pursed her lips at the prospect . women usually fell into two categories - those who were still haunted by their husbands ' deaths or those who were ready to have fun and live a little . she certainly hoped this pesh guy fell into the second category . more than anything , she wanted to have a little fun herself . ` ` do you really think you would be interested in dating pesh ? ' ' emma asked , as she moved noah to her shoulder to burp him . with a smile , megan replied , ` ` dating him . just having some fun with him . looks like he could use it . ' ' emma grimaced as she wiped noah ' s face off . ` ` this is exactly why i told aidan not to try and break you two up . ' ' ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' ` ` pesh needs a relationship , not a break - up after everything he ' s been through . besides his wife ' s death , he ' n ' t had it easy on the dating world . ' ' ` ` what for ? ' ' when casey asked , emma shot her a death glare . ` ` nothing . it ' s just he does n ' t need to get involved with someone who obviously ain ' t interested in along - term care . ' ' ` ` well , you might as well tell her , ' ' casey said . megan looked between the two of them . ` ` tell her what ? ' ' ` ` nothing , ' ' emma said quickly . she handed noah to casey . ` ` make yourself useful by changing his name . ' ' as casey got busy cleaning up noah , emma turned to megan . ` ` when aidan and i broke up - ' ' ` ` what you meant to say is , that you left aidan when you said ##n ' t showed up for aidan ' s math test because he was cheating on you ? ' ' casey asked , waving away the wet ##ness in her hand . emma closed her eyes for a moment , shaking her head .
