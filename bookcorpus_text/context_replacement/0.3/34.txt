` ` i ' d sure hope so . ' ' ` ` ' what ' s wrong with having an innocent dinner and watching a movie ? ' ' casey asked . ` ` because that ' s not fair to him . you ' d just be leading him on , and i think we can all agree that you probably don ' t want that . ' ' ` ` maybe , ' ' emma agreed . tilting her head , casey eyed megan warily . ` ` deep down , you like him , do ##n ' t you ? ' ' megan rolled her eyes . ` ` of course i do . everyone likes him . ' ' ` ` no , you really like him . you find yourself thinking about him more than you should . and you ' re probably wishing you were n ' not such a smart ##ass about dating him . because even though you ' d kill to know how well he wears his wang , you ' re even more surprised by what being kissed by him would be like . ' ' stunned , megan could only stare at casey . she ' d just hit the nail on the head with her feelings . finally , she sighed . ` ` look , it ' s a no - win situation . i ' m a graduate student . i ca n ' t get involved with himno . it probably would ##n ' t look good on my record . that ' s just one of the many reasons it would ##n ' t work for me . ' ' ` ` fine . you just keep telling yourself that . ' ' ` ` why do don ' t we talk about something else ? ' ' megan asked . ` ` who ' s up for a movie after we hit the road ? ' ' emma asked . megan bit her lip . ` ` well , i ' n ' t know if i should be gone that long . i really don ' t want to take advantage of ankle ' s enthusiasm for the movies . ' ' emma shook her head . ` ` ' wo ##n ' t mind . he ' s happy to do it . ' ' as megan raised her eyebrows again , casey continued . ` ` lem i guess , you pushed him hard to get him to set up a perfectly good movie for two kids who are under ##age . ' ' a pink flush stained emma ' s cheeks . ` ` i do n ' t know what you ' re talking about . ' ' casey laughed . ` ` ' oh , you are so busted ! ' ' leaning forward , she put her elbows on the table and looked straight at emma . ` ` ' whatwas it ? green eyes ? a blow job ? maybe a b * * w j * b while wearing no underwear ? ' ' turning to meet casey ' s questioning gaze , emma quietly murmured , ` ` there was a b * * w j * b in the shower this morning , okay ? ' ' casey nodded . ` ` i wish you had said something . hmm , that was fun . it was like playing a little game of clue - it was emma in the shower with a blow job . ' ' megan threw her hands up to cover her eyes . ` ` umm , hello ? that ' s my husband you ' re talking about . ' ' ` ` sorry , sorry . i ' ll refrain from making any inappropriate comments about aidan and emma ' s sex life . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' megan and emma said in unison . ` ` ' and we kiss then ? ' ' casey questioned . megan reluctantly nodded . ` ` i ' ll just blame you two if he gets too pissy . ' ' casey winked . ` ` ' tell emma . then you can take it out on her . . . . in the bedroom . ' ' ` ` i fucking hate you , ' ' emma muttered . thankfully , the twoarrived , and all business - based conversation was over . at least for the moment . chapter 8 rubbing his hand across his sweaty brow , pesh leaned back against the glass door of the operating room . as the adrenaline was depleting from his body , he had to prop against something hard for support . regardless of how physically drained he felt , he was still on cloud nine . a beaming smile lit up his face as he stared across the room at the screen . on it , a young woman was getting acquainted with her newborn son . she had been brought in just twenty minutes before , a car accident sent her into early labor . the paramedics had put her through the roughest labor , but luckily , they had made it to the hospital in time . because her labor was so difficult , they had n ' er trouble getting her up to the labor and delivery room . instead , they ' d wheeled her in , and pesh had gone to her . it really was an amazing moment considering he ' d only seen three live births in the course of his medical career . this one was an experience he treasured . the woman looked up at him and smiled . ` ` thank you so much , dr . nadeen . ' ' ` ` you ' re very welcome . theywill be getting you up to bed in just a few minutes . ' ' as he walked out of the room , he found himself ambushed by kara , one of the other nurses . ` ` hey honey . how ' s the good doctor doing today ? ' ' the way she spoke was more of a purr , which was a pretty good summation since she basically acted like she was a cat in heat anytime he was around . he smiled as she ran her hand up his arm . ` ` everything ' s fine , thank you . how are you ? ' ' he asked her . ` ` i ' m better now that i ' ve seen you , ' ' she replied .
