she hugged the first member of pesh ' s immediate family she saw , which just happened to be dev . ` ` can you take these to your car ? i ' ve got to get to the hospital . ' ' his blue eyes widened as he took the bags from her . ` ` are you okay ? ' ' ` ` i ' m fine . my sister ' s baby was just born . ' n ' not let anything happen to that , okay ? ' ' dev chuckled . ` ` okay , i ' ll start unloading this pronto . the last thing i want is for my family to be the one to take the family jewels . ' ' with a wink , he added , ` ` they ' ll be taking my family jewels . ' ' megan smiled and then gave him a wave before running off . when she got back outside , aidan and emma ' s suv had just turned around . noah began to squirm in pesh ' s arms . ` ` ' where we ' re going ? ' ' pesh said , before she could start talking . ` ` yes ? ' ' pesh smiled . ` ` yes , we ' re taking you to your mommy and daddy and your baby sister . ' ' noah ' s eyes lit up at the news ,and he did let them help him into his car too . using her father ' s car , they made the drive home with their caravan of relatives . when they got to the hospital , pesh pulled up to help her out . ` ` i ' ll go ahead and take him home . ' ' ` ` okay . i ' ll meet you guys down there . ' ' when she got up to the maternity ward , there was a quite large crowd waiting for her , including emma ' s best friend , connor . ` ` did casey not feel like coming in ? ' ' megan asked , as she approached him . casey was only a few weeks shy of her official first date with a baby girl . he chuckled . ` ` no , she ' s here all day . she ' s been in labor herself . it looks like she and olivia are starting to make new best friends after being here for the whole day . ' ' megan grinned . ` ` that ' s good news . ' ' connor wrinkled his nose . ` ` i think casey will be into it a little more when her pregnancy kicks in . she was wasn ' t too happy the last time i went in to see her . ' ' ` ` oh yeah , i remember that one well .' ' megan ' s phone buzzed , and she quickly read the message . ` ` aidan , we can go in now , ' ' she said to her sister . the girls made their way through the double doors and down the hall . when they reached emma ' s room , angie knocked on the door . within a few seconds , aidan appeared . ` ` hey girls , ' ' he said , with a big smile . ` ` the doctor is still working on her , so give us a minute . ' ' he disappeared from behind the door only to return within a few moments . this time he carried a small bundle wrapped in a blue blanket . ` ` here she is . miss caroline rose fitzgerald . ' ' collective laughter and cheers erupted all over the group as aidan held caroline up for them to see . she did don ' t seem too interested or concerned with them . she smiled and closed her eyes . ` ` she ' s absolutely beautiful , ' ' megan said . ` ` she ' s something all right , ' ' aidan murmured . ` ` there she is ! i see a tear , ' ' becky said . aidan rolled his eyes at his sister . ` ` let me guess . you had some kind of bet earlier about whether i criedwhy not ? ' ' liz patted his shoulder . ` ` something like that . ' ' pesh appeared then . the moment noah saw his brother he kicked to get up . once he had his feet on the floor , noah ran to aidan , wrapping his arms around aidan ' s neck . ` ` hey noah . you want to meet your sister ? ' ' squatting down , aidan carried caroline to where noah could get a good look at her . ` ` caroline ' s tummy again ? ' ' noah asked . aidan laughed . ` ` noah , this is your little sister , caroline . ' ' noah regarded his sister with a slight frown , as if he were trying to figure her out . megan could only imagine what was going on in his head at the moment . he ' d spent the last few months at the center of his parents ' world , and now there was someone else to share the responsibility . when caroline scrunched up her face and whimpered , noah patted her back . ` ` no cwy , baby . ' ' ` ` aw , he ' s going to be a very big boy , ' ' angie remarked . aidan nodded . ` ` yeah , he ' ll be okay until he meets emma . then he ' s going to be ready to goher to the gypsies . ' ' a nurse entered emma ' s room . ` ` you can go in now . ' ' as she gazed around the room , she shook her head . ` ` no , some of you can go in . ' ' getting up from the bed , aidan took noah ' s hand . ` ` come on , buddy . mama wants to see you . ' ' noah still didn ' t stop waiting for aidan . he barreled through the door . ` ` mama ! mama ! ' ' he screamed . megan laughed as she watched him jump up on emma ' s bed .
