` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he said . ` ` it ' s okay . it was worth it to see your o ##af . ' ' she smiled up at him . ` ` god , you were amazing . ' ' since he ' d never had a woman call him that , he could couldn ' t help flushing . he turned away from her to search for something to clean her face with . finally , he found a roll of paper towels . when he returned to her , he gently wiped himself off her face . when he finished , he helped her down from the counter . ` ` i ' ll go in first . i need to clean up . and so do you . ' ' he gave a small shrug . he was having trouble processing all the thoughts running through his mind . ` ` so when it is ? ' ' she asked . ` ` when is what ? ' ' he asked dumbly . he was still far too stunned by the simple cleaning job to be forming coherent sentences . ` ` our wedding . ' ' he had almost forgotten what he thought of her . out of the heat of the moment , he felt guilty for what he had done . he shook his head . ` ` no , i was wasn ' t being fair . you` don ' t give me a date . ' ' ` ` yes , i do . i always keep my dates . ' ' ` ` you ' re really going to go out with me ? ' ' she grinned . ` ` of course i do . ' ' his heart sped up . ` ` are you free this weekend ? ' ' ` ` yes . ' ' ` ` you do don ' t have plans ? ' ' ` ` no , i do n ' not . ' ' ` ` and you can get someone to watch your back ? ' ' ` ` yessss , ' ' she said , with a smile . ` ` okay , then let ' s do it now . ' ' ` ` ' what surprise ? ' ' ` ` the surprise . ' ' she laughed . ` ` yes , but what are we doing ? ' ' ` ` it ' s a surprise . ' ' tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously . ` ` i ' m not sure i like the sound of that . ' ' ` ` i think you ' ll like it . ' ' ` ` what should i wear for this surprise date ? ' ' ` the wheels had started turning in his head . since this might be his only chance , he decided he had to wear thesomething as simple as he could . ` ` wear something dressy . we might be going somewhere that has more formal wear than jeans . ' ' ` ` yeah , i guess i can do that . ' ' at the sound of his pager , he grimaced . ` ` ' i ' ll be the one leaving now . ' ' without hesitating , he bowed his head to kiss her . just like that , the feel of her lips against his set him on fire . reluctantly , he pulled away . ` ` ` clean up first . ' ' her breath warmed his cheek as she looked up into his eyes . ` ` i can smell myself on you . ' ' he closed his eyes as a shudder ran through his body . ` ` you ' re going to kill me . ' ' she flashed him a wicked grin . ` ` sorry . it ' s the truth . ' ' ` ` fuck yourself , ' ' he muttered , before he headed to the bathroom . chapter twelve with less than fifteen minutes until pesh was due to arrive for their date , megan found herself a complete mess , standing in the doorway . she ' d changed outfits at least three times before deciding on a black and white striped dress that came down to her knees . she had actuallycome out of the depths of her closet - one of the tamer things of her younger days . pesh had told her to wear something casual , and she would fall into the casual category , although it was definitely a little sexier than she would have liked . after she ' d pulled her long hair back into a low ponytail at the nape of her neck , she was already rethinking her strategy . if she ' d left her hair down , it would cover more of the exposed skin that the thin straps and straps of the dress revealed . glancing at her reflection one last time , she sighed . ` ` fuck me , ' ' she muttered , after putting on some makeup . when the dark cloud passed , she walked out of the bathroom . she grabbed her purse and headed downstairs . when she walked into the kitchen , a low , growl - like sound pierced her ear . she looked at sean . ` ` what ? ' ' sean shrugged . ` ` you look hot , megan . ' ' gavin , who stood beside sean at the table , nodded . ` ` we never see you in anything but jeans . ' ' megan could n ' t help smiling at her brother . ` ` thank you . ' ' wagging his eyebrows , gavinthen , ` ` ' a hot date , huh ? ' ' ` ` not exactly , ' ' she replied , as she went to grab her purse . ` ` yeah right , ' ' he muttered under his breath . after putting her purse over her shoulder , she turned around to pin him with her stare . ` ` and what ' s that supposed to mean ? ' ' ` ` it means that chicks ' no ' do get dressed up like that for nothing . you just want to impress this guy . so , it ' s not a hot date . ' ' ` ` since when did you become the love interest ? ' '
