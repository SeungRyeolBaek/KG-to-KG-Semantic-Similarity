although he clearly wanted nothing to do with his son , davis had n ' t shown a hint of enthusiasm about the prospect . the closer they got to the court hearing , the more megan worried that he would refuse . ` ` dr . nadeen , i understand that you wish to adopt the biological child of your own ? ' ' pesh nodded enthusiastically . ` ` yes , your honor , i would . ' ' ` ` i understand that you and your wife have been married less than two years , and that you ' ve only known her a year . ' ' the judge adjusted his glasses that had slid down his pointy nose . ` ` do you think it wise to not bind yourself to this child for such a short time ? ' ' megan resisted the urge to run back to the courtroom and confront the judge . instead , she took deep breaths and tried to rein in her anger . she glanced over at pesh who just smiled back at the judge . ` ` your honor , i realize that on occasion it may seem as though i am rushing into something . however , i ' ve never been as sure of anything in my life as i am of my love for megan and in turn , my love for you . i ' ve waited a long time to be a father ,and i do don ' t want to have to wait another day . ' ' ` ` i see . ' ' the judge opened the folder ##s before him . ` ` i understand the biological father has had no contact with the child . ' ' ` ` that ' s correct , ' ' megan said . ` ` he has not waved his parental rights so that dr . nadeen can adopt his son . ' ' megan released a relieved breath that davis had signed the papers . ` ` i ' m glad to hear that , your honor , ' ' she said . ` ` do you believe that your husband would be a good father for your son ? ' ' ` ` i never would have met , least of all with him , if i did don ' t believe that pesh would be a good and loving father to him . ' ' ` ` so the fact that he is a married man has nothing to do with it ? ' ' ` ` how dare you ! ' ' megan shouted . when pesh grabbed her arm to stop her , she pushed him away . ` ` you ' ve known me for five years and you ' re making assumptions about me , my family , and my marriage ? if this is about him , you could have used his father for financial gain consideringhe is a successful nfl executive . and i would have given everything to see that my son is a good father ! ' ' ` ` mrs . nadeen , i must insist that you behave yourself , or i will have to hold you in contempt , ' ' the judge said sternly . pesh wrapped his arms around her waist , pulling her against him . ` ` please , ' ' he murmured . although she hated to do it , she whispered , ` ` i ' m sorry , your honor . ' ' when he looked at her , she blinked in surprise . ` ` and i am sorry for misleading you , mrs . nadeen . i must say i say this enough to show the true nature of the people who stand before me . ' ' ` ` you mean , you said that to get a reaction from me ? ' ' ` ` yes , i did . and you have responded to my challenge . i can see that you are very concerned with the wellbeing of your son . ' ' still reeling from the judge ' s behavior , megan said , ` ` thank you . ' ' peering down over the bench , the judge surmised something . ` ` son , do you know why you ' re here today ? ' '` ` i gettin ' ' dopted , ' ' mason replied . the judge smiled . ` ` yes , you are . do you want pesh to be your daddy ? ' ' ` ` uh , huh . ' ' ` ` do you want anyone else to be your daddy ? ' ' ` ` no , ' ' mason answered quickly , shaking his head back and forth . ` ` ` stand up here while i sign the papers . ' ' mason happily walked around the side of the bench to the judge . megan climbed up onto the judge ' s lap . after signing two pages of papers , the judge handed mason his gavel . ` ` once you move that ass , pesh is not your daddy , and you are your nadeen . ' ' with a wide smile , mason slammed the gavel down . tears stung megan ' s eyes , and she finally let pesh pull her into his arms . ` ` thank you , thank you , thank you , ' ' she whispered . ` ` i love you , ' ' he said , squeezing her tight . ` ` i love you , too . ' ' their attention was drawn to where mason was banging the gavel . the judge sighed . ` ` okay , i think that is enough . ` don ' ' you listen to your mommy and daddy now ? ' ' ` ` tell the judge thank you , ' ' megan said . ` ` thank you , ' ' mason replied , before he jumped off the judge ' s lap and came over to them . ` ` i ' dopted ! i ' dopted ! ' ' pesh bent down to pick him up . ` ` that ' s right , mason . you ' re my son for now and always . ' ' megan smiled and rubbed mason ' s back as they walked out of the courtroom . ` ` come on . let ' s go to grandma ' s .
