he pulls out a second time , and when he does , my lips part in surprise at my body ' s response . i think he can tell that i ' m starting to react to the sensation , because he begins to move a little faster . ` ` oh , nate , that feels . . . that feels . . . ' ' i trail off . there are no words . i simply wrap my legs around his back and push my hands into his hair as he moves against me , and exquisite sensations flow through my body . his lips find mine again , kissing me with a passion that matches the frantic pace he ' s setting . i feel an orgasm begin to build inside me . i ' ve had orgasms before , usually an amazing experience with nate , but this one is different . it ' s so intense that it scares me . i bear down against it , holding my breath to keep it at bay . but everything nate is doing is working against me . i feel his hands go to my hips , and my back arches against the heat of his body . he kisses my neck as i bend to him , and his cock finds new and untouched nerve endings to drive me to the edge . ` ` oh , nate , it ' s too much . . . ' ' i gasp, opening my eyes . ` ` i just don ' t know if i can . ' ' he looks down for a moment . ` ` brynn , you ' re safe with me , ' ' he says , his dark eyes finding mine , fear and desire warring in them . ` ` you just have to let go . let go with me . ' ' he starts to speed up , but his eyes do n ' ever leave mine . i take his hand , choosing to let the orgasm take me rather than trying to control it . ` ` oh , yes , brynn , ' ' he grunts . my eyes roll back in my head . he pushes his hips into me now , driving his cock into me . i hear myself begin to moan as though i ' m outside of my own body . his torso arches inside of me and he thrusts in a little deeper . the slightly different angle is enough to push me right over the edge . i completely lose it , my body shaking with orgasm of its own accord . i can vaguely feel him lying on top of me , his sweat dripping down onto my back . he rolls on top of me and i bury my face into his neck . his body just feels exactly right on top of me . i feel like icould stay like this forever . chapter twenty - one i wake up to soft lips on my cheek . my eyes pop open in surprise . ` ` mmm ? ' ' i whisper softly . ` ` you passed out , ' ' i hear nate whisper back . i realize he ' s still on top of me - and kissing me . ` ` oh , sorry , ' ' i smile , blushing a little . ` ` i hope i did don ' t make too much noise . ' ' he grins . ` ` well , i guess if they ' d heard anything , we would have known about it by now . ' ' ` ` how long was i out for ? ' ' ` ` just ten minutes or so . i was worried i was going to hurt you . ' ' he kisses my lips and then leans down . i watch him hold the end of the condom as he pulls out of me . the feel of him inside my body is incredible , and i lie there for a minute , absorbing it , as he walks to the bathroom . he comes back with a couple of wet towels and i sit up to take them from him . ` ` it ' s okay , ' ' he says . ` ` lie back . ' ' i do , and let himquickly wiping up the inside of my mouth , and then begin to giggle . he stops and looks at me with a puzzled expression . ` ` i ' m sorry , i just - i never thought i ' d be in this room with nate thornhill ! ' ' i explain . he shakes his head with a mischievous grin as i continue to giggle . ` ` you bled a little , but you did ##n ' t get on the floor . that would have been tough to explain , ' ' he says as he returns to the bathroom . ` ` i could have just said i had my period , ' ' i point out as i throw my covers back and slide under the covers . ` ` yeah , i guess that ' s true , ' ' he says , coming back and crawling into bed next to me . ` ` i did n ' t say i ' m not a virgin anymore , ' ' i say as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me close . ` ` i was beginning to think it would never happen . ' ' ` ` so . . . you like it ? ' ' he asks , running his fingers up and down my back . i ' m surprised to feel my body respond hungrily , even though i ca n ' t .had a mind - blowing orgasm ten minutes ago . ` ` are you kidding me ? ' ' i ask , raising my eyebrows at him . ` ` what about me ? because i . . . ' ' ` ` you were fine , ' ' he assures me . ` ` i was different , though . ' ' ` ` different , how ? ' ' i ask , frowning . he shrugs . ` ` i usually ' n ' t ' know the girls i sleep with . or my feelings for them .
