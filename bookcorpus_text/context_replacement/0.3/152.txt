` ` what ? you sound like you ' re so in love . ' ' ` ` oh , thanks , ' ' i reply , managing to only blush a little . from anyone else it would have sounded like a ham - fisted compliment , but he has such a relaxed , easygoing air about him . ` ` you going to this party in town tonight ? ' ' he asks , dipping his head down underneath the water , then pulling out his water like a bottle . ` ` what party ? ' ' ` ` oh , i thought nate told you . ' ' ` ` told her what ? ' ' nate asks , standing next to him . ` ` ' ' chris ' s party , ' ' jackson replies casually . nate ' s jaw muscles tighten . ` ` had n ' t do it , ' ' he replies casually . ` ` well , you should have , ' ' he says , turning back to nate . ` ` she ' s not supposed to know anyone , and i think it ' s just gon ' be a small party , ' ' nate says . ` ` no , chris said to invite anyone . they ' ve got the whole townhouse . it ' s gon ' be huge . ' ' ` ` i know - ' ' nateagain , as i bite my lip . here i thought we were maybe getting along better , without the drama , and now he ' s going out of his way to tease me . ` ` if you ' re worried about being a third wheel , just invite dana and me , ' ' jackson says , and even when he ' s smiling , he does don ' t seem to have a care in the world . ` ` so , what do you think ? ' ' nate asks me . ` ` ' great , actually , ' ' i say , looking at nate , feeling a little gratified as he grins at me . it feels good to tease him a little , since he so obviously does n ' t want me to go . ` ` awesome . okay then . we can go out - i ' ll pick you guys up around ten , ' ' he says , before jumping on top of nate and trying to wrestle him under the table . i close my eyes as they disappear . for the first time in a while , i wish i had something cute to wear . chapter ten in the end , i have to go with the same pink top i wore to that crew party . it ' s really my only top color for a party , i think . so , nate' s the only one who ' s seen me in public , and i doubt he remembers . my mom just waves goodbye as nate and i walk out to jackson ' s black suv . she looks so thrilled that i finally have a social life that it ' s comical . jackson opens up the front passenger door for me and nate gets in back . ` ` we picking up natasha ? ' ' jackson asks as we drive away . ` ` it ' s natasha tonight . and she ' s meeting us there , ' ' nate answers from the back seat . i admit i ' m surprised , because i do n ' t think i could look her in the eye after seeing her and nate having sex by the pool . ` ` oh , fuck , natasha , of course , ' ' jackson says , laughing and hitting the steering wheel . i frown a little . i guess that ' s par for the course for my stepbrother . jackson picks up some of the slack in the conversation , and the alcohol does the rest . i ' m so distracted and stuck in my head , thinking of what i should say , while nate processes every word , from the back . i ' m relieved when we find a parking space on the street near the party . as we walk toward the riotoustownhouse , i ' m sure the neighbors ' n ' or ' called the cops . people are spilling out the front door and i can hear the music halfway down the block . there ' s a pretty olive - skinned girl standing on the porch who turns her head when nate calls out , ` ` natasha ! ' ' she smiles coyly as we pull up . nate dips her in a very playful way and plants a kiss on her lips as she breaks out into giggles . ` ` come on , ' ' he says , wrapping his arm around my shoulders protectively and escorting me inside . he high - fives a few guys as we walk in , and nate guides me to the table in the middle of the living room , which is decorated with little white christmas lights . there ' s an excited crowd around it but somehow he manages to snag me a beer , and before i know it i ' m on my first break of the night . with his hand at the small of my back , we walk into the living room . the dining room table is being set for a ping pong game , and nate and i take a seat on a chair opposite . ` ` you ' re amazing , you know that ? ' 'jackson whispers in my ear . i ' m startled and nearly spit out my drink . ` ` no . . . ' ' i look away , embarrassed , ` ` i mean , that ' s sweet of you to say . ' ' ` ` i ' d love to see you again after work . maybe we could get together this weekend , ' ' he offers . ` ` oh , sure , ' ' i reply , feeling relieved . i mean , i might feel a little . . . rushed , or something , but i ' ve heard so many stories about guys just wanting to hook up , that it ' s refreshing to be going out on an old - school date .
