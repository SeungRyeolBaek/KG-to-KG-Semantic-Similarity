` ` you ' ve really changed this summer , brynn . you ' ve become a monster , ' ' he says , leaning into me . i can feel his hot breath on my neck . ` ` i want you to stay away from me , ' ' i whisper , my throat tightening . ` ` just for a minute . . . i want to feel . . . ' ' he says softly , sliding his hand onto my back and then over my ass . my body reacts at his touch , burning away my fear . i get my arms up between us and push him away . ` ` get off me , you fucking asshole ! ' ' i scream . he stares at me in shock . ` ` you think you ' re a billionaire with your fancy suits and your money , but really you ' re just a sick bastard , taking advantage of anyone you meet . i see who you really are , even if no one else does . ' ' his face twists with anger , and i feel my cheek swell up with blood before my brain can register that he ' s slapped me . i bring my hand up to my burning face , my head being jerked to the side , just as pierce disappears in a blur . i straighten up with a gasp when i seenate has already tackled him to the floor , and they are now rolling around on the kitchen tiles . ` ` # ##n ' t you dare touch her ! ' ' nate yells at his father , whose face is turning red in an effort to defend himself against his much larger brother . i hear footsteps from the stairwell and see my dad coming down the stairs and manage to stop myself . ` ` nate ! nate , stop ! ' ' i yell , as he struggles to regain the top position . my mom screams as nate punches him hard across his face . i throw myself onto nate ' s back as he cocks his head back in preparation for another punch . ` ` nate , i ' m ok , i ' m ok , ' ' i whisper in his ear . i feel him relax a little and try to help him up . nate drops his arms and stands up with pierce . pierce pushes him back as he stands up , too , and they face off , nate breathing heavily , pierce with a trail of blood dripping from the corner of his mouth . ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' my mom finally whispers , her voice full of fear . ` ` i know everything , ' ' nate says , addressing his father . ` ` you hypoc##rite . ' ' to my surprise , nate starts to laugh . ` ` i knew it , i knew it ! look at you two ! ' ' he says , pointing at us . ` ` what ' s he laughing at ? ' ' my mom asks , looking at me . ` ` they ' re married ! ' ' pierce calls out . ` ` but . . . what ? ' ' my mom murmurs . ` ` oh , god , holly , are you really that fucking stupid ? you ' ' ' not even try ? ' ' my mom shakes her head . ` ` that ' s why you ' re here ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' nate says , turning to her . ` ` i saw him start to feel for brynn , and then she told him to stop , and he kissed her . ' ' a look of horror spreads across my mom ' s face . she looks at me , then at pierce . ` ` is this true ? is it true ? ' ' he does not ' t even bother responding to her question , just rubs his palms up and down . a wailing sound escapes my mom ' s lips . for a second i think she ' s going to cry , but instead she throws herself at him , her hair a blur .she ignores him . ` ` i trusted you ! i trusted you ! ' ' she screams . pierce throws his arms up to defend himself as nate steps forward and wraps his arms around her , breathing her in and then pushing her away . ` ` my own daughter ! my own daughter , you son of a bitch ! ' ' with a strangled cry , she shakes her head and begins to sob against nate ' s chest . pierce surveys the three of us , huddled against him on the other side of the kitchen . ` ` what ? ' ' nate asks , as he rubs my mom ' s shoulder . ` ` you have nothing to say for yourself ? ' ' ` ` come on , nate . you ' re not going to believe them ? ' ' pierce asks , a sneer of contempt on his face . ` ` you really don ' t have to - i saw you with my own eyes . maybe you should have told brynn in the first place , ' ' nate says quietly , though i can hear the anger in his voice . he can only manage a snort of derision as he turns toward the door . ` ` my fault , ' ' nate says , and then pauses , his back turned toward his father . ` ` you made everything worse , ' ' 'do you ? ' ' pierce is frozen for a moment , his head slightly cocked to the side . i still don ' t meet his eyes , and i can ' t imagine what could be going on in his mind . his carefully crafted world , now falling apart around him . he shakes his head slightly , as if waving away an unpleasant thought , and continues to walk down the hall . he goes straight to the front door , and shuts it behind him . when we hear the sound of his car driving down the driveway , my mom straightens up , and nate ' s hands fall to his sides .
