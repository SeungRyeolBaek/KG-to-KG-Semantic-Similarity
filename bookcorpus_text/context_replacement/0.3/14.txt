megan squeezed her eyes shut . the room was beginning to spin around her a little . as she brought her hand to her head , she heard a roar fill the air and aidan yelling , ` ` ow , dammit , ow ! ' ' ` ` that drink is one hundred and fifty proof alcohol , aidan , ' ' emma said . ` ` no . don ' n ' t drink it . i just knew it was the wrong choice because it was just tequila . that ' s your drink of choice , not mine . ' ' oh god , she was in so much trouble . she ' d barely consumed any alcohol since she got here and met mason . now she ' d consumed a regular tequila drink and almost a double one of straight alcohol . a gentle hand landed on her thigh . ` ` are you all right ? ' ' pesh asked . she opened her eyes to see the blurry images of him looking at her with concern . ` ` not really . ' ' ` ` would you like me to take you home ? ' ' ` ` yes , please . but i can still walk . ' ' as she rose out of her chair , she swayed a little on her feet . after taking two steps , aidan ' s apologetic face appeared beside her . ` `i ' m sorry , meggie . ' ' ` ` it ' s not your fault . and i ' ll be fine . ' ' she crooked her finger at him . ` ` ' when i get grounded for driving home drunk , i ' m so telling you it was your fault . ' ' he chuckled . ` ` i ' ll just take the blame and risk angie ' s wrath . ' ' he leaned down to kiss her . ` ` thanks for today - you know , for being mason ' s wife . ' ' ` ` you ' re welcome . thanks for not asking you . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` i mean , thanks for asking me . ' ' oh , this was perfect . after exchanging hugs with emma and reassuring her at least twenty times that she would be fine and that she did need to go home , pesh walked megan to the front door . he slid a strong arm around her waist to support her as they went down the front steps . as she staggered to the car , she spoke . ` ` i ' n ' t go home again . not like this . ' ' she looked up into his eyes . ` ` i ca n ' t let you see me like this . ' ' she pushed a strand ofget out of her way . ` ` do n ' t worry . i ' ll take you to my house then . ' ' ` ` ` so we can catch up ? ' ' she questioned , although she really really don ' t mean it . she wanted to go to his house for a lot more , especially after being so close to his well defined body . ` ` yes , of course . i ' ll make you some strong , black coffee . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' she said , trying to still the shaking of her head . ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' ever the gentleman , pesh opened the door for her , and she slid onto the seat . once he was sure she was comfortable , he closed the door and went around the front of the car . megan gazed around at the sleek interior of the car with its leather seats and luxurious interior . when pesh slid into his seat , he turned the key in the ignition and started up . as they started pulling out of the driveway , she glanced over at him . ` ` do you have to come to the rescue women of america . ' ' she shook her head . ` ` i mean , rescue women a lot ? ' ' she laughed . god , had she sl##urring ? he cut his eyes over at her and frowned . he seemed to be trying very hard not to laugh at her . ` ` not really . but i ' m always happy to be a woman in distress . ' ' megan giggled . oh god , now she was giggling ? she never giggled . she eyed pesh suspiciously . ` ` ' a hero complex , huh ? wan na be every woman ' s knight in shining armor ? ' ' ` ` ' every woman ' s , ' ' he murmured . ` ` mmm , pesh , you wan ##na be my knight in shining armor ? ' ' as soon as the words left her lips , she fought the urge to slap her hand over her mouth . alcohol always had this effect on her - it left her senses without a trace . pesh ' s jaw clenched , and he didn n ' t reply . leaning her upper body over the seat , she leaned as close to him as she could . ` ` you said ##n ' ` answer my question . ' ' taking his eyes momentarily off the road , he pinned her with an intense stare . ` ` i ' d be anything and everything you wanted me to be , if you would give me the chance . ' ' still stunned , she could only nodfuck him . ` ` ` wow , ' ' she said , as she fell back onto the seat . the motion caused her to feel dizzy . groaning almost incoherently , she said , ` ` mmm , hot as f * * k and anything you want . fuck me . ' ' ` ` i have a feeling you would n ' ' have asked the original question if you were n ' ' intoxicated . ' ' with a smile , she said , ` ` drunk or sober that woulda been one helluva thing to hear from a woman . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad you think so . ' '
