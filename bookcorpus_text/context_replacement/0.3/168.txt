i put everything back on as quickly as i can , and then look over at him . his eyes are closed , and he ' s sitting nude and perfectly still on the edge of the bed . he looks as perfect as i ' ve ever seen him look , which is really saying something . my heart breaks a little , as i move to the door and shut it behind me . i hurry down the hall and into my own bedroom , which now feels cold and empty . i crawl into bed without bothering to take off my clothes and pull the covers over me . i ' m no different to nate thornhill than any of the other women he ' s been with , and i should have known that . stupid , stupid , stupid . i hear a soft knock on the door and pull the covers up a little higher , but i n ' t move . if it ' s my mom , i really don ' t want to see her , and if it ' s nate , i really do don ' t want to see him . there ' s another knock , a little louder , and then the door is slowly pushed open . i can just see nate ' s shadow in the moonlight . he closes the door behind him and walks into the room . to my surprise , he walks into theout of my reach and to the other side , he hops up , lying down on the bed next to me . ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he says , laying his hands over his face . ` ` you do don ' t have to apologize . you were just being nice . ' ' ` ` yeah , i think i am . and i ' ll stop flirting with you and you guys . ' ' i clear my throat to keep the pain down . ` ` okay . ' ' ` ` i do n ' t ' have any choice . . . ' ' he says . ` ` why ? ' ' ` ` she and i are , well , work buddies , mostly . and that ' s what she is , too , so it ' s ok . ' ' ` ` mmm . ' ' ` ` ` i ' d . . . i ' d like us to be friends . ' ' ` ` we ' re like half - siblings , ' ' i point out . i can hear him breathing next to me . ` ` yes . but that was ... ' not my choice . ' ' he pauses . ` ` i like you . i . ##uld ' t deny that i ' m attracted to you , of course , but i ' m also notthe good kind of guy . not to mention the kind of issues that dating my own brother would bring about . ' ' he smiles . ` ` so can we be friends ? ' ' i consider for a moment . if i ' m nate ' s only girl friend , then i probably am attracted to him . maybe not in the way i ' m normally like , but still , it ' s something . ` ` okay . okay , then . but , wait , ' ' i turn onto my side and face him . ` ` if we ' re really friends , i want to ask you some girl - friend questions . ' ' ` ` ok . . . ' ' he says quickly , turning onto his side , too . ` ` am i . . . am i . . . ok at all that stuff ? you know . . . ' ' he smiles . ` ` what we just did , you know ? . . you were more than ok with it . ' ' i nod . ` ` when did you lose your virginity ? ' ' ` ` when i was fourteen . ' ' ` ` wow . ' ' ` ` she was my mother ' s older sister . ' ' ` ` wow . ' ' ` ` how many girls have you slept with ? ' '` ` oh my god , i do n ' t even know . . . ' ' ` ` wait , really ? you do ##n ' t even know ? ' ' ` ` you mean , dozens ? i do ##n ' t count . ' ' ` ` sheesh . okay , one more : ' are n ' t you the relationship kind of guy ? ' ' he pauses . ` ` i do n ' t count , ' ' he says softly . ` ` i try a few times , but that kind of closeness , it just drives me crazy . that ' s all i know . ' ' i nod , sensing he ' s telling me everything he knows , and roll back over onto my back . i love the feeling of being here with him next to me . i feel much more comfortable than i would have thought possible . i feel my eyes start to drift open as he pulls me under . ` ` brynn . . . i . . . ' ' i can just hear nate laughing . ` ` you ' re going to make some man very happy one day . ' ' chapter twelve ` ` i ' m just glad the whole thing has been over , ' ' greg says as we pull into the beltway . i smile as i look out at the dark .##hizzing around in the dark . the woman who accused pierce of sexual harassment rescinded her claims when it turned out she had accused two other mob bosses of the same thing . ` ` it just seems like there ' s been a cloud over the office for the past year . ' ' ` ` maybe , ' ' i reply noncommittally . greg clears his throat as we near my car . ` ` well , i ' m glad we got the chance to hang out again , ' ' he says . ` ` me too , ' ' i reply with a smile . this is our first date , and he still has hasn ' t said anything . i ' m wondering if tonight will be the night .
