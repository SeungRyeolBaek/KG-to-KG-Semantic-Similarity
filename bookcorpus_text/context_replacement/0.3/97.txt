sliding down his body , she lowered her knees to his lap and took him into her mouth . her tongue gently flicked over the tip . pesh ' s hands came to rest in her hair . she ran long laps up and down his length before taking him into her mouth . as she began moving up and down , pesh ' s groans echoed through the room . as she lifted her gaze up to him , he stared down at her with hooded eyes . ` ` so good , emma . so , so good , ' ' he murmured . when she started climbing up , she let him slide free of her mouth . ` ` i want you to come inside me , ' ' she said , as she crawled up his body . rising up on her knees , she brought pesh ' s hands to the elastic band of her panties . he slid them off her h * ps and down her thighs . somehow she managed to get them off and toss them to the floor beside the bed . leaving off the bustier , she guided his hand to her core . slowly , she lowered down on him , inch by inch . when he was buried deep inside her , she sat back on his thighs . raising her arms , she placed both her palms flat on the mattress . fromthis position , she was giving pesh all the view as she moved on and off of him . as the orgasm continued building inside her , the more frantic her movements became . harder and harder she came , the sounds of her slapping along with moans and panting echoing through the room . when pesh ' s fingers began to rub her clit , she came again , crying out and collapsing onto his chest . he continued raising his h * ps to pump into her until she came a few seconds later . pushing the hair out of her face , pesh looked up at megan with a dazed expression . she brought her lips to his for a soft kiss . ` ` i love you , mr . nadeen . ' ' ` ` love you ? ' ' she shook her head . ` ` i love you and your talented fingers and dick , all of who give me amazing pleasure . ' ' he let out a laugh . ` ` i ' ve been such a wonderful man , ' n ' t i ? ' ' ` ` yes , you have . ' ' ` ` i would wouldn ' t love you any other way , my love . ' ' megan smiled as he slid out of her body . rolling her onto her side , pesh snuggled up with her , nuzzlinghis face brushed her neck . ` ` sleep now , ' ' he said , smiling . ` ` yes , you need your rest . i ' m going to want all of you in a little while . ' ' his words made her tingle with excitement and lust . with the warmth of his arm wrapped around her , megan let her sleepy eyes close and drifted off to a contented sleep . chapter twenty - one as they sat in the courtroom waiting to be sworn in , megan touched mason ' s blue and white striped tie for the first time . ` ` mommy , please , ' ' he begged . she snatched her hand away . ` ` i ' m sorry , sweetheart . i ' ll leave you alone . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' he replied , going back to his work on his tablet . the problem was her own hands seemed to be doing something . sensing her hesitation , pesh reached over and took her hands in his . ` ` relax . everything is going to be fine . ' ' megan wanted to believe him , but she could ##n ' ` stop feeling anxious . she would won ' t be able to calm down until the ink had dried on the papers . her feet , encased in high heels , tapped nervously on the floor. the final bell echoed through the courtroom . as she glanced between pesh and mason , megan had to smile . the two men in her life looked almost identical , in their black suits and ties . of course mason ' s was considerably shorter than pesh ' s . when the door opened and a clerk poked her head out the door , megan ' s heart started beating faster and faster . ` ` megan nadeen ? ' ' she shot from the bench . ` ` that ' s me . i mean , i ' m megan nadeen . ' ' the clerk smiled . ` ` you guys can come in here . ' ' taking a deep breath , megan reached for mason ' s hand . ` ` this is okay , baby . ' ' mason nodded and then looked up at pesh . ` ` you are my daddy now ? ' ' pesh nodded . ` ` yes , i ' m going to be your daddy for real today . ' ' they walked through the massive doors of the courtroom . the judge , wearing his long black robe , looked down at them from his throne . ` ` good morning , ' ' he said , politely . ` ` g - good morning , ' ' megan stammered . ` ` you know that we ' re here today to` for the adoption of the same son , mason patrick mckenzie ? ' ' ` ` yes , ' ' megan and pesh nodded . ` ` first , we need to swear you both in , ' ' the judge said . megan went through the motions of the oath , trying hard to calm her nerves . when pesh had first broached the idea of davis adopting mason , she initially had been shocked and horrified . but now she had to worry about whether davis would allow pesh to adopt mason or not .
