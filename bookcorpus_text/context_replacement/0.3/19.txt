who the hell did that belong to ? a whimper escaped her lips . oh god , had she actually slept with a man she had no memory of ? never in her life had she made such a mistake as that . nausea gripped her , and she knew she had to get out of bed and into the bathroom . she shoved herself so hard away from the bed that she ended up poking him in the ribs . he groaned . ` ` oh , i ' m sorry . i did . ' not meant to wake you , ' ' she quickly apologized . ` ` it ' s okay , megan , ' ' he said drowsily . that voice . it took only a second for her to realize who she was in bed with . and with that thought , everything from the night before came crashing down on her . she had just been knocked on her ass , pesh had taken her to his house to sober up , and she . . . oh god , she had come on to him like a total idiot . she put her head in her hands and groaned . ` ` hey , how do you feel this morning ? ' ' he asked . ` ` like i ' ve been run over by a truck . ' ' ` ` remind me to fix you a good breakfast##over cure ? ' ' she looked at him through her lashes . ` ` you even have a ' cure ? ' ' he laughed . ` ` you think someone like you has ever been cured ? ' ' when she shook her head , he laughed . ` ` i ' m sorry to disappoint you , but there have been many , many times you ' ve woken up feeling like you are now . ' ' ` ` that ' s hard to imagine . ' ' she looked down at the jeans and t - shirt she was in . although she doubted it , she could couldn ' t help but smile . ` ` ' we . . . ' ' ` ` no , we did ##n ' t . ' ' she raised her eyebrows in question . ` ` if we did don ' t sleep together , then why did you . . . i mean , why were you in bed with me ? ' ' ` ` because you begged me to stay . ' ' she gasped in horror . was wasn ' t it enough that she had thrown herself so wantonly at him , but that she ' d begged him to stay with her ? ` ` i did ? ' ' he nodded . ` ` you said you ' n ' t want to be alone . ' 'then she remembered pleading with him to lie next to her . what a jerk . ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' ` ` do ##n ' t apologize . ' ' when she started to protest , he held up his hand . ` ` you have to admit it was nice being in bed with someone again - feeling their warmth , the softness of their body as they lay beside you . ' ' she swallowed hard . ` ` i ' ve missed that more than i knew . ' ' even with the emotions threatening to overtake her , megan ' didn ' t know what to say . all she knew is she needed to get out of there . ` ` i need to go home . . . back to emma ' s . i ' can ' t let my parents know i stayed up all night with a man i just met . ' ' ` ` i know . i would n ' t dream of compromising your reputation . ' ' she stared at him for a moment . sometimes the way he spoke made it seem like he was from a different country or time period . ` ` i , uh , i need to use the bathroom . ' ' ` ` go ahead . ' ' tumbling out of the covers , she practically streaked from the room . once she closed the doorshaking her , she released the breath she ' d been holding . she made it to the toilet just in time to throw up again . she wondered after doing the same thing the night before how there was anything left in her stomach to vomit . when she finished , she leaned over the sink , pouring water in her mouth before bringing it to her lips . still trying to rid herself of the bitter taste , she eventually reached under the counter for some tissues , and then brushed her teeth . without a brush or comb , she did her best to tame her out - of - control hair . when she felt that she was presentable enough to face the bitch ##es , aka aidan and emma , she left the bathroom . pesh had thrown on his robe and stood in the middle of the room . he raised his brows expectantly at her . ` ` i ' m going to go now . ' ' ` ` of course . ' ' when she started for the bedroom door , she abruptly stopped . ` ` um , my dress ? ' ' ` ` i ' ll send it out to get it cleaned . ' ' ` ` okay , ' ' she murmured . ` ` thank you . ' ' in silence , they made their way through the house . megantried not to be so obvious as she took in the high ceilings of the living room , the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked a large , spacious yard . pesh had an amazing home - one that was far too big for just him . it certainly was made for a woman - the one he obviously did n ' ever have . as he started to open the door leading out to the garage for her , pesh stopped and turned around . staring intently at her , he said , ` ` i ' d like to see you again . ' ' megan could couldn ' t help the small gasp that escaped her lips .
