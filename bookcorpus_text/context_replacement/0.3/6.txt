he finally met pesh ' s anxious gaze . when his lips spread into a wide smile , pesh released the deep breath he ' d been holding . ` ` well , there you are , ' ' aidan said , as he strode over . he bypassed holding out his arms , and instead , he pulled pesh to him for a big hug . ` ` emma was worried about you . ' ' ` ` she was ? ' ' ` ` yeah , she asked me to go out and see if i could find you . ' ' ` ` i ' m sorry . i was wasn ' t sure where to go , and no one was out here . ' ' ` ` do n ' t worry about me . ' ' aidan looked away . ` ` ` how the hell are you ? ' ' pesh could couldn ' t help laughing at aidan ' s choice of words , especially in that way . ` ` i ' m good , thank you . ' ' he cocked his head at aidan . ` ` and what about you ? is fatherhood agreeing with you ? ' ' a beaming smile lit aidan ' s face . ` ` i ' m just fantastic . i never could have imagined that being a father would be this . . . exciting . ' ' pesh nodded .` ` i want you to know what an honor it is for me to be noah ' s godfather . ' ' ` ` we ' re lucky to have you . ' ' aidan patted pesh ' s back . ` ` and i really mean that . ' ' ` ` i hope you do . i always had my doubts . . . ' ' aidan shook his head . ` ` well , i n ' t . i ' ll admit i was wasn ' t too thrilled with the prospect at first , but you was there to help me see the light . you were there for us when we really needed you . you know , on my wedding day , i would ' ve missed the most important day of my life - my son ' s birth . i can never thank you enough . but when it comes down to it , i ' n ' t think i could ask for a better father for my son . ' ' aidan ' s words warmed pesh . ` ` thank you . that means a lot . you have my word that i will always do what is asked by you . ' ' after giving him a gentle thump on the back , aidan said , ` ` come on back with me . i want to introduce you to everyone . ' ' ` ` do they .. . ' ' pesh was n ' t sure how to ask if aidan ' s mother knew the story of how he and emma first knew each other . aidan chuckled . ` ` let ' s just say that she ' s the only one who knows the story . the others just know you saved us when aidan had his heart attack . ' ' pesh could n ' t help the relieved breath that came out of him . it would have been a shame to have any of aidan ' s family hate him for trying to take emma away . ` ` i see . ' ' he followed aidan back into the large room filled with happy people . when he craned his neck , he saw emma in the corner with noah in her arms . she looked radiant as ever in an emerald gown . noah , however , did ##n ' t look too happy to be seen in the emerald dress that draped over emma ' s arms and stopped mid - thigh . his tiny brows furrowed as he shook his fists back and forth as if any moment he might let loose with a scream . taking him by the elbow , aidan guided him over to a group of men and women . aidan introduced him to his older sisters and their husbands . pesh smiled , nodded , and shook their handsbefore being bombarded by a bunch of aidan ' s nieces and uncles . ` ` ` i want you to meet my niece , megan . she ' s the oldest . ' ' ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' aidan surprised pesh by leaning in and whispering in his ear . ` ` i ' m pretty sure that half of the people here are waiting for you two to get together . you know , a real romantic story to tell the kids about how you two acted as the godmother and godfather of this sweet and innocent girl . ' ' pesh gulped . why was everyone he knew hell - bent on breaking him up ? surely emma had some deep , hidden motive in asking him to be megan ' s godfather ? ` ` i ' m sorry , but i do n ' t know if that ' s such a good idea . ' ' leaning back , aidan surmised him before winking . ` ` ' i would agree because she is , after all , my niece - my favorite one if i ' m being honest . and as much as it pisses me off to admit it , you two would make a great couple . ' ' ` ` we would ? ' ' ` ` hell yeah .' ' aidan put his finger under his chin . ` ` megan needs someone strong and stable like you are , and then you need someone who is as full of life like she is . i can guaran - a - tee you that you ' ve never gone out with a woman like her before . emma is eight , nine tenths the sassiness that megan is . ' ' pesh could couldn ' t help shooting aidan a dirty look . ` ` ' keep an open mind , okay ? ' ' with a curt nod , pesh replied , ` ` i will . ' ' ` ` megan , ' ' aidan called . when the beautiful blonde turned around , pesh fought to catch his breath . everything about her from her sparkling blue eyes to her long blonde hair was just like megan ' s .
