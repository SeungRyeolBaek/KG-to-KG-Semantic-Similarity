when a smile lit up megan ' s face , he shook his head . ` ` ` not just yet . not until i put a diamond on your hand . ' ' ` ` ` i ' n ' t need that to know i ' m engaged to you and that we ' re getting married . ' ' ` ` thank you ' ' ' not , but i do . ' ' she rolled her eyes . ` ` fine , fine . i ' ll let you buy me a ring . a really nice one , okay ? ' ' he grinned . ` ` i promise to spend a fortune . ' ' ` ` you know i would be happy to wear your ring even if it was a potato chip . ' ' ` ` i know you would . but i want to see my beautiful future wife . ' ' she grinned . ` ` okay , i wo ##n ' t agree with you . ' ' pesh brought his mouth to hers . as their lips moved against each other , he could couldn ' t believe how happy he was . megan was his - she was definitely going to be his for the rest of his life . when she flicked her tongue against his , he groaned into her mouth . considering they were at megan ' s with some of her friends across the street , heknew the last thing on his mind should ' ve been flipping her over onto her back and pounding into her . but he ' didn ' t care . he wanted inside her body . he had finally made it into her body , mind , and soul , and he once again wanted to be inside her perfection . when megan pushed him onto his back , pesh raised his eyebrows at her . ` ` mmm , i think my beautiful wife is getting ahead of herself . ` the consummating is after the wedding , before the wedding , ' ' he teased . ` ` i think we ' ve had moments in the past few weeks where it really don ' t matter . ' ' ` ` i suppose you ' re right . ' ' as she ground her core against his growing erection , she said , ` ` looks like i ' m not the only one with sex on the mind . ' ' ` ` you should know that has a mind of its own . ' ' she smiled up at him . ` ` well , right now i think we ' re both of the same mind . ' ' as she continued to grind against him , his hands swept to her br * * sts . he pinched and kneaded the flesh of her nipples . atthe sound of the door opening , pesh tried to pull away , but he did ##n ' t make it in time . ` ` oh f * * king hell ! ' ' aidan ' s voice came from the doorway . megan quickly rolled off pesh , and they both rose up , trying to straighten their clothes and hair . with a pained expression , aidan said , ` ` what ? this is my hotel room ! ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` i ' m sorry , but you of all people should know that when the mood strikes , you act like it . ' ' megan smacked his arm playfully . ` ` that is not exactly what happened . ' ' holding up both of his hands , aidan said , ` ` look , i do don ' t really want to know what happened . i just came back here to make sure megan was all right . next time , i ' ll make sure someone else is , and i do n ' t need a ##liner to get that out of my eyes . ` ` ` ` ha , ha , very funny , ' ' megan said , as she hopped off the bed . ` ` we were just celebrating , ' ' pesh said . aidan pinched his eyes shut . ` ` i do don ' t think we 'wanted to know what you were thinking . ' ' ` ` our wedding , pervert , ' ' megan said . aidan ' s blue eyes widened . ` ` holy shit , you two are engaged ? ' ' pesh said as he rose from the couch and shook megan ' s hand . ` ` yes , we are . but , i mean , i had to go to her house and properly ask for her hand . and there ' s the fact she does ' ' not have a father . ' ' shaking his head in disbelief , aidan said , ` ` that ' s . . . unbelievable . i ' m so happy for you two . ' ' ` ` thank you . and i really mean that . if it was wasn ' t for you and emma , i never would have met megan , ' ' pesh said . aidan laughed as he clapped pesh on the back . ` ` you ' re more than welcome , man . i ' m just so glad you two finally realized how good you were for each other . ' ' he turned back to the others , ignoring them . ` ` come on , let ' s go join the others . i think this calls for a celebration , but definitely not the one that you two are partaking in . ' ' meganshook her head . ` ` we were ain ' t ready to tell anybody yet . ' ' pesh laughed . ` ` she ' n ' not even got a ring . ' ' aidan snorted . ` ` do you really think anyone out there is going to give two shit ##s whether or not you have a ring ? ' ' ` ` we just want to do things the right way , ' ' pesh replied . holding up his hands in surrender , aidan said , ` ` all right , i ' m not going to argue with you guys . but i will admit that there is a right way . now , look at you and em . in the end , you have to go with the flow and enjoy the moments that are bigger than you could ever imagine .
