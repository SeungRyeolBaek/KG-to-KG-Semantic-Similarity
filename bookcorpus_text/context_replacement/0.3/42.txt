one minute she was getting ready for work , and the next she was gone . ' ' ` ` it ' s true that there was always pain , especially the time she did n ' t know she was going to die . but i can ##uld ' t imagine what it must be like for terminal patients . ' ' she shuddered . ` ` when you wonder if every day is your last , when you have to think about all you ' re going to do . ' ' ` ` yes , that is true , ' ' he said , in a hushed whisper . when he finally turned to look at her , he gave her a sad smile . ` ` it ' s been ten years . every time i think i ' ve moved on , that i ' ve been able to rebuild my life , a case comes through that brings me to my knees . ' ' ` ` i ' m so sorry , ' ' megan said , bringing her hand up to touch his cheek . he turned his face into her palm . his head bowed until their lips touched . ` ` you have to understand that no matter what happened to your wife , and to me , it was n ' t your fault . you just wasn ' t responsible . you had to keep living . you ' re not. ' ' tilting her head up , she gazed into his dark blue eyes . ` ` you ' re alive , ' ' she repeated . the rain began to fall harder . her eyelids closed to keep the rain out of her eyes as she gazed up at him . his mouth was next to hers , his breath warming her face . she could barely breathe at that moment . it was like every molecule in her body was charged with electricity . silently , she pleaded with her eyes for him to kiss her . and then , after what felt like an eternity , he brushed his lips over hers . it was n ' not the first time she had kissed him - it was also the first time she felt alive and had kissed him . now her senses were heightened , and she could experience exactly what she was feeling . his lips were gentle and soft at first , and then they changed over to demanding and demanding . it was like he was breathing her in with every brush of his lips and stroke of his tongue as if to prove to himself that she really was alive . his tongue danced along hers , causing her to moan . he brought his hands up to cup her face and her arms went around his chest , pulling him closer to her . drops of rain pelted her head and ran down herskin beneath pesh ' s white shirt grew sensitive as she ran her hands up and down his back . she realized , in that dizzying moment , that no one had ever kissed her like this before . this was like lovemaking with their parents , and she never wanted it to end . when pesh finally tore his mouth from hers , megan ' s breaths came in heaving pants . her eyes lifted to stare up at him . his expression turned from lust to concern . he shook his head . ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' ` ` pesh , you don ' t - ' ' he held up his hand . ` ` please , just go . ' ' he turned away from her , wrapping his arms around his waist . stunned , megan did ##n ' t know if she should argue with him and stay or go . ` ` please , ' ' he begged . with her heart still beating wildly from their heated lip - lock , she turned and left . as she walked back down the hall , her heart yo - yoed to where she felt like a watch that had been wound too tight . after walking in through the door , kristi met her in the foyer . her eyes widened at megan ' s appearance . ` ` i , uh , i was just' my lunch break , and it was hot , ' ' megan explained . ` ` next time you ' ll have to use your bathroom , ' ' kristi teased . megan nodded . ` ` yeah , i will . ' ' ` ` ' ' don ' t you go to the break room ? there ' s a # ##brush in the sink . when you finish drying off , i could always use you in the break room for inventory . seems like we could almost run out of everything at once . ' ' ` ` sure . i can do that . ' ' as megan turned to go down the hallway , kristi reached out and grabbed her arm . ` ` is everything okay ? ' ' megan bit down on her lip to keep a nervous laugh from escaping . was pesh okay ? was she okay ? who the hell knew ? one minute he ' d been upset about his wife and being a patient , and the next he ' d been feeling passion dripping from her lips . regardless of his emotional state , she ' d done the same . she now found herself wanting more of his kisses when she should haven ' t . but it was wasn ' t just the kisses she wanted - she wanted more of him and not just for sex . ` ` no , don 's ##nob . i think he ' s just trying to hide the loss , both past and present , as best he can , ' ' she finally admitted . kristi nodded in acknowledgement . when megan felt she was free from any further questioning , she headed down the hall to the break room . surprisingly , she found it empty . after grabbing a tissue from her purse , she went to the bathroom to use the hair dryer .
