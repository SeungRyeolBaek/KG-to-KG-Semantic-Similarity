when he nodded , pesh gently pushed him back down into the chair . after they walked out of the dining room , pesh quickly glanced at the others . ` ` excuse me , ' ' he said , before getting out of his chair . he made his way down the hall . he didn n ' t have to look hard for megan - she was in the one room with the door closed . he rapped lightly on the door . when she did don ' t answer , he went ahead and opened the door . he found her sitting on the edge of the bed with her head in her hands . he went over and sat down next to her . tentatively , he placed his hand on her shoulder . ` ` i ' m sorry for not setting him straight and telling him i ' n ' been his daddy . he looked so upset , and i ' didn ' t want to hurt him . ' ' with her elbows braced on her knees , megan turned her head to look at him . tears streamed down her cheeks . ` ` you think i ' m angry at you ? ' ' he nodded his head . she hiccupped a little . ` ` oh pesh , you ' re so sweet sometimes ! ' ' he pulled back at her words . ` ` excuse me? ' ' ` ` just when i think i really don ' t love you enough , you go and do something like that . ' ' before he could process her words , she threw herself at him , kissing his cheek and mouth . she left his lap and wrapped her arms around his neck . ` ` you really love mason , do n ' t you ? ' ' ` ` of course i do . ' ' ` ` you could see yourself as being a husband to him ? ' ' ` ` yes , i could . but what - ' ' she silenced him with a kiss . it was one that was filled with desperate need . he wrapped his hands around her waist and drew her closer to him . just as he was about to end the kiss , she pulled away . ` ` you love me enough , do don ' t you ? ' ' ` ` you should have no doubts about that either . ' ' ` ` you love me enough to be a husband to me ? ' ' her words caused him to suck in a sharp breath . he felt like he had been kicked in the stomach . ` ` yes , i could - i always have . ' ' she shook her head at him and laughed . ` ` then marry me . ' ' ` ` excuseme ? ' ' bringing her mouth to his , she whispered against his lips , ` ` marry me . make me your wife . ' ' at that moment , he thanked god he was sitting up because if he had n ' t moved , he was pretty sure he would ' ve done something totally emasculating like that . he also lost both his hearing and his sight . had megan just spoken to him ? surely , he was dreaming . ` ` did you just ask me to marry you ? ' ' he asked lamely . smiling , megan nodded her head . ` ` i wish you could see your face right now . i should be insulted . ' ' ` ` i ' m not . it ' s just you surprised me . ' ' she cupped his face in her hands . ` ` i ' m sorry i do n ' t have a face , and i did ##n ' t get down on one knee , ' ' she playfully teased . he brought his hands up to clasp hers . ` ` you ' re really serious ? ' ' ` ` yes , i am . ' ' lowering his head , he tenderly kissed the back of her hand . ` ` i love you so much , megan , and i want nothing more than to give you myplease . ' ' ` ` ` is that a problem ? ' ' ` ` i just want to make sure you know what you ' re doing . one minute you ' re in the living room , laughing with your friends , and then the next you ' re in here weeping and then proposing to me . and let ' s not forget how adamant you have been the entire time i ' ve known you about being too young to get married . ' ' megan ' s lips turned down into a frown . ` ` ` n ' t a woman change her mind ? ' ' ` ` yes , of course , but i just want to make sure this is really what you want . ' ' tears formed in her blue eyes . ` ` you are everything i could ever want in a woman . you love me , you watch out for me , you want the best for me . if that would be enough to make me want to marry you , you are my son . you watch out for him and you want the best for him . i could ##n ' t ever imagine loving someone more than i love you . i ca n ' t imagine wanting to be anyone else ' s wife except you . ' ' she sniffled . ` ` i was so stupid for so long . i couldcouldn ' t believe that someone like me could truly deserve someone like you . but you never gave up on me . if you give me the chance , i ' ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy . ' ' pesh could n ' t stop the pounding of his heart . he was sure both his heart rate and blood pressure were off the charts at this point . he cupped her face . ` ` nothing in the world would make me happier than for us to be married . ' ' ` ` ` we ' re married ? ' ' ` ` yes , we are . ' '
