i look out the window next to the door and see eileen walking up the driveway . ` ` hi , ' ' i say , as she climbs the steps and pushes open the door . ` ` hi , ' ' she says nervously , smoothing her hair . ` ` do i look alright ? ' ' ` ` you look great , ' ' i tell her . i can ##uld ' t imagine how she must feel , finally seeing her mother face - to - face after all these years . she looks around the room . ` ` god , this house is even bigger than it looks from here . ' ' ` ` i know . it ' s ridiculous , ' ' i say , and follow her into the den . ` ` pierce and my mom are having some late lunch , so they ' ll be gone for a while , ' ' i tell her . she bites her lip nervously and takes a seat on the couch . ` ` i ' ll call nate tomorrow , okay ? i still haven ' t told him anything . . . . ' n ' t think he would think otherwise . ' ' she nods , and i head to the den . ` ` hey , nate ? ' ' i knock , and hear his bedroom door open . ` ` you wan na come down to the den? ' ' i feel a pang of guilt when he replies quickly , ` ` yes ! be right there , ' ' and i hear him moving away . i ' n ' t like the idea of setting a trap and lying to him , but i know that it ' s in the service of a greater truth , that of the true nature of his parents ' relationship , and his father ' s death . we go back into the house , and stand nervously next to the couch where eileen ' s sitting . she stands when we see nate coming down the stairs , and then he turns the corner and sees us . his face is carefully blank as he surveys the scene before him . he takes a step forward , looking like he ' s going to say something , and then turns back . ` ` nate , it ' s me , your father , ' ' eileen whispers . ` ` i know who you are , ' ' nate says calmly . he turns to me . ` ` you hear this ? ' ' ` ` i think you should hear what she has to say . please , can you just listen for a minute ? ' ' nate ' s face twists into a sneer - an expression i ' n ' ever seen in weeks . ` ` you ' re right , '' he growls at me , and storms out the front door , slamming it behind him . eileen breaks down with a muted cry , and i run after him . ` ` nate ! ' ' i call as i slam the door behind me and head down the front steps . he ' s coming around the side of the house , obviously heading for the garage and his car to make his escape . ` ` would you just listen to me for a second ? ' ' ` ` why ? so you can try to poison my words against my heart some more ? ' ' he yells , spinning around . ` ` i ' m going to tell you the truth about him ! eileen will tell you - ' ' ` ` okay , so this is all about you ! you can try to paint it as some benevolent way of getting the mother and son to talk , but no , this is all about getting them to believe your story , ' ' he turns again and starts to walk back across the grass . ` ` no ! that ' s not true ! ' ' i scream , pursuing him . ` ` your mother is a good person - i wanted to protect her , and you . ' ' ` ` you ' re pathetic , you know that ? ' ' he yells , spinning around again .` ` stop teasing me . whatever plans we made for this summer , it ' s over . ' ' ` ` what ? nate , i - ' ' i feel like someone just punched me in the stomach . how could this all go so wrong ? ` ` i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i ' ve dated , but you ' re not , ok ? from now on , let ' s just look at each other , from across the room at social events , like our stepsiblings do . ' ' ` ` no , no ! we were friends , we are . ' ' ` ` you ' re just attached because i was your girlfriend . do n ' t worry about it , you ' ll get over it eventually . you were very important to me , brynn , ' ' he says and walks through the garage ' s side door . i watch in shock as i watch the garage door slide shut and his head pop back out . i watch him walk down the driveway , then disappear around the corner . i hear the front door close behind him , and eileen hugs me . ` ` i ' m so sorry , brynn , this is all my fault . ' ' ` ` no , it ' s not , ' ' i say ,biting my lip to keep from crying . she wraps her arms around me . ` ` he ' s just angry . he ' ll come to his senses . ' ' ` ` no , he ' s just as upset as i am . he ' s just sad . ' ' i collapse against her , resting my head on her shoulder as i begin to cry . ` ` ' sad always is the answer , ' ' she murmurs as she touches my arm . ` ` come on - your parents wo ##ll ' t be back for a while . i ' ll make you some tea .
