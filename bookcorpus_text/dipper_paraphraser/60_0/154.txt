- chapter eleven - i breathe in deeply, and count to ten, then exhale slowly, trying to get rid of the pain that followed me home from the party. - i jumped out of bed, jumped out of the bed, and ran out into his room. - he spits at me, turns round and leaves. - i was really smug, brynn, you're really smug! - i had no idea what to do - what do you think he's mad about me? - he spits at me, then turns around and leaves - i freeze in astonishment , what is that? - i suddenly had a long look around the house for you, i thought you were swindled! - I jump out of bed, I run into his room, he's in the room, and he looks at me, he's lying in bed, he's on the floor, he's in the room, he has to keep a good eye on me! - he turns around and runs out, he's very angry , he's in a rage, he just runs away ... he's just ... he fumbles, he has to take it ... he says, he is self-loving, he is! he looks at me, I’m hardly holding the door. He’s so close to me that I’m dragged about by the door, so close that I’m almost knocked against the door. . . . he stands in astonishment and i take advantage of the opportunity to go out. . . . he’s standing so close to me that I’m almost knocked down. . . . oh, he was really joking. I was going mad because you obviously wanted to keep me from leaving with Jackson and I wanted to know why. . . . . ” “Yes, he followed you,” I reply, stammering a little because I know that I was wrong. . . . No, he didn’t say he didn’t want to date you, he just ... you know, I can’t control what you think of me, and that’s . . . well, that’s fine, but . . . . well, I don’t know why you went a bit of awry with jackson. . . . . The girls I sleep with know that they are not going anywhere, because i tell them that. ' Well, he's a good friend,' i point out. ' And you know that, he says, he's always been honest with them ... jackson pulls them in by promising them a future with him, and as soon as he sleeps with them he behaves as if they didn't exist ...
