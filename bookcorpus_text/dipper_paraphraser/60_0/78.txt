he grinned. ' But my little sister, you are not the first american girl I brought home with me . . .' he nodded, rubbing her chin with his fingers, he took her eyes. ' You saw my brother, I saw it,' he added. ' That's not true. You are good-hearted, I see that every day . . .' She looked up at him. ' What?' he asked. ' I know.

No woman wants half a man’s heart,” he argued. “But besides, I know that your heart is not half yours , I know that you are not half your heart , and besides, I know what I feel when I feel your love , there’s no half about it. Besides, I know how I feel when I feel your love , it’s all part of it , you love me with all your heart and soul . . . “” She pressed his hand on his cheek.
