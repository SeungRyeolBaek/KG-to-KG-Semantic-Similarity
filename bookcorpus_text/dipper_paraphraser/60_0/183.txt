. . . and i took him back into my mouth, and drew on him, stretched out my mouth wide, to receive him, and slowly I began to move down his length, wanting to make him feel as good as he has made me feel . . . and to tease him, if I am truthful. . . . my eyes began to water a bit, as he started to moan. . . . he coughed, and his fingers were wagging around my hair and they were biting at my lips, and he peeped down at my nose. . . . . I tried to move his head back, but it seemed that it was too much for my mouth, and i would say that he could have swallowed it. . . . I thought he might have slipped into my mouth right away, but he stayed. . . . I tucked my lips around my teeth, wrapped them around him, and extended them around his lips. he says to me, holding out his hand to me. - he comes to me, he turns around, he presses me with his hand. - he feels his hand hit the back of my chest, he runs his fingers over my stomach and then over my breasts, he gently presses his hand in my chest. - my lips part, he wraps his hand around my heart, it hardens again, - he asks me, nodding, already out of breath - he nods, nods, he does not want to have to wear a condom with you, and - oh, does it feel very different? - he asks me, he walks to the bedside table, he pulls out a condom and throws it on the bed - he, he goes to the bed, and pulls me back against him , he runs his fingers over my stomach and up over my breasts, he pinches my nipples and sighs into my touch, - he kisses me hard, his tongue lashes my mouth, his finger circles my opening, he puts his hand under my clit and i scream , - he kisses me hard, his tongue flies in my mouth, his finger turns inside my clit, - he moves his thumb and i cry in joy and surprise ... - . . . he swung his right hand over my shoulder, and i was groaning as he began to circle my clit with his thumb . . .
