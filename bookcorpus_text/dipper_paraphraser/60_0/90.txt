he was now speaking left and right. “Mama told me not to tell anyone about it, but she wants you to come into her hotel room . . . “, ah, i see.’ she leaned up and kissed him on the cheek. ‘I’m sorry , you don’t need to apologize , we’ve been working hard for hours to get him to calm down . . . so I want to see if you can help . . .’ she leaned up and kissed him. . . . Thank you so much for being so amazing, every day . . .’ She leaned over and kissed him, his thumb hovering over her cheek. ‘You’re welcome, my love,’ she said. When he stopped halfway down the corridor he knocked at the door. . . . she didn’t have to guess which room Noah was in. . . . you don’t need to apologize, but we’ve been trying for a whole hour to get him to calm down . . .’ she was frightened, he woke up, from his dead sleep, to beg for his mother. She got to her heart and hugged her, i know, but she's waiting for your sister to come in." Megan leaned against the bed to kiss him, he snorted, "mama, he said, you want to see him. " He said, kicking his feet, as if to tell her to start walking. She hugged him on the chest. " Yes, he's downstairs , I'll take him," said her mother, reaching for him. " i will take him," he said, and pulled him in the arms. " Yes, she's down there. " She smiled at him. He asked in pain. He snorted so hard that his breath ran loudly, his chest heaved. " ‘Ah, my darling, are you crying because you wanted to come to our party?’ she said, stomping his pacifier. ‘Yes, yes, he is.’ Noah nodded at Pesh behind his pacifier, and Pesh laughed. ‘ He looks so much like the Aidan when he smiles like that , doesn’t he?’ ‘ Yes,’ he said, and Pesh smiled. ‘I’m sure that he’ll take advantage of that cute little smile when he grows up, just like his father did.’
