. . . ” - Megan sighed . . . a little sneering rang out from the chest . . . . “She threatened me. . . . she said she wouldn't dare to let me look after my back . . . ” - - she said, if I didn't keep my back , she would report me to the director . . . - i am sorry that her jealousy and sarcasm has come to the surface . . . well, when I was with her . . . , i do not think that I will like you . . . ." Pesh drew his arms around his chest. -  do you not want me to speak to her? - - No, that is fine. -  - you know how much I love you , I have never imagined how i dated you , I do not want anything on my account , - she sighed. Oh, what do you mean, come on , what is it? " With a smile, he went to the room and poured out a glass of white wine, then put it on the bar, poured a glass of white wine, and poured it on the bar, poured it. Then he sat down and sat down again, looking around the room. He had to hurry to the bathroom, so he was afraid that he might not be able to make it, so he leaned forward and took it. , and he looked at her, but he didn't know where to go, so he said, "Let's have a rest, why don't we get a drink?" . When he entered the bedroom, he noticed her frustration when she got off the bed and walked to the bathroom. . "It's really good. " She held her head a little, and said, "If you can't let it be for you, then I'll give you a drink." he drew the glass of wine from her and sat it on the table. he glanced down at her simple white bra. She sucked in a breath when his fingers passed over her abdomen and he shook the nape of her neck, and she stood before him in only her bra and a simple little thong. He drew his eyes to hers and he lifted it over her head.
