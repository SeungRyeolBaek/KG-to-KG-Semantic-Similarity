he jumped up. . . . I'm almost tired of being a virgin . . . maybe nate was right, maybe I'm too serious and distant, and it's better if I get it out of my head . . . he starts telling me about that wild night he went to at school, but out of the corner of my eye I saw two men, hands all over, and felt envy in my chest. . . . he takes a few more sips of beer, and I feel more secure in knowing that jackson is really into me. . . . he says he'll grab em , he says, walking confidently into the other room. . . . . . yes, it's true, ' he says, 'and he's a decent man . . . do you believe it?" he asks me, leaning in. ' ' Yes, he says, ' he says, 'he's a good fellow. . . . and he's a good fellow, too . . . do you think so?' , he was on the other side of nate's arm, and he took him by the arm and pulled him into a front porch. " Are you shivering for a ride?" he asked, frowning. ' Oh, if we're going back to my place,' said nate, pointing to nate, who was now looking around the party as if bored, obviously he was not in nate's place. "I can't believe the way nate talks to me, such an irrational air. I'll do what he'll do, and I'll tell him what he's talking about. ' I'll give you a ride, sir,' he says, pulling nate's arm and pulling him toward a door in the back. ' No, we're going back to my place, sir,' nate says, staring at me. ' Come, go,' says nate, glancing around, 'we're going back to my house.' ' I go back into the living room and walk out into the street. I turn to the left, where I see a crowded street, and run for it. . . . but it is not like a cab back to the house. . . . I know that it will be a pricey ride to the house, but I know that I am going to tremble with tears.
