he said. “I think it’s good you said you weren’t feeling well at the moment when we left.” “Ah, you want me to go to the bathroom?” she asked. “I’m just saying I’m a good girl. And thank you for mentioning it to the young man and me,” he replied. “Oh, well, I’m not too bad,” said Aidan, with a sheepish smile. Aidan shook his head and rose. “I’m sorry to see you’re here, he says. And if you want to go downstairs and lie down, it will make me uneasy.” Aidan kissed her briefly. When she came to the bathroom, Aidan began to tell Pesh a weird story, which had also drew Pesh to laughter. Aidan began telling her some foolish story, which had pesh swaying back and forth with laughter. - oh, he replied, - oh, he said - not to be alarming - as a matter of fact, we are not so far from the hospital - about twenty minutes," - said - - Aidan drew her hand, - - after throwing his napkin back on the table, he held her hand - - oh, oh, - he replied, - - helpan's hands reached to her shoulders - - - do not worry , - if you want to get in trouble, - since a week ago, - I will let her have it without accusing her of stealing the spotlight, - - - Aidan grinned, turning back to Pesh and Megan - - - - I do not flinch, - i am a long-haired little witch, and I want to have the glory tonight, - - she muttered through gritted teeth - - - yes, - he replied. Aidan threw himself into his pocket. When he brought out a set of keys, he threw them at Megan - - thanks ... She was silent as an indian song came through from the speakers. Megan wrapped her arms around pesh's neck. Fortunately, he did not dance so formally as he did in savannah. Instead, he wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her back to him. . . . he held her open and his eyes resting on his broad chest. . . . she loved the gentle beat of his heart under his shirt.
