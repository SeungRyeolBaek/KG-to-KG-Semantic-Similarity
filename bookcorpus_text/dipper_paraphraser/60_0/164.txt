I have ... a good feeling about this one, that’s all ... i think as I pull the pillow down again and again until i’m puffing my eyes out ... oh, well, well, you have a date, brynn, right? ...’ she continues pouring me a glass of water, ‘and he’s pulling you up, right?’ ... i groan, not wanting to take the trouble to make a fuss about it. – ‘good, good ...’ i think to myself as i lift the pillow again and again, until i’m a little too breathless. - I look at my mother, but she is staring at her chopping-board. - oh, oh, oh, it's alright, oh, it is alright," my mother says quietly. - I am really sorry, holly," says nate, and he crosses to the refrigerator. - fortunately, the doorbell rings and i can excuse myself. - And yet, as angry as i am at nate, I do not like to hear his father speaking to him in such a condescending way - my mom, from behind me, forces me to open the door all the way. - he smiles at me, he shakes his hand, - he says, - he makes a smile. - he is wearing a navy jacket and a frock coat, he is quite nervous - he smiles at me and smiles at me, he looks at me, he frowns at me and looks away. - fortunately the doorbell rings and i can excuse myself. . . . the waiters are clearly passionate about their food, and delighted to see a young couple on a date that they can fawn over . . .
