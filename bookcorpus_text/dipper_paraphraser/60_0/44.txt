he licked his lips and moved toward her. he waited a moment, but then he shook her head. he was afraid to repeat, but he saw the majesty of her words. “Just a second where you could imagine your life without me? you are too good for me, pesh, and I’m not ready to be married. . . .” and then an idea jumped into his mind that was so deep that he shuddered, a moment of an epiphany, a feeling of a light bulb, an epiphany. he could be different for her, even if only for a while. He had to be someone else for her, even if only for a little while. . . . you would let me in on you, but not love you . . . “” he asked, looking at her, “how many times would you want me to hurt you with this? you would let me . . . you would let me . . . and let me tell you . . . you would let me, but not love you?” her chest trembled. “I’m a man, so what are you doing?” she cried. ” So f * * king is n’t me? ” he pressed closer to her. – Oh, if only you had had the chance to give me your scrubs and get you into the medicine-case – yes, if only you had given me a moment – if only I had given you the chance, you’d have let me strip off your petticoats and got you up against the medicine-case – ” she licked her lips and answered him: “Don’t say that, it’s n’t you, n’t you – but you don’t say that ... so f****** king is n’t me – it’s a woman ... f****** you ... ” and her chest heaved up and down, she leant back from him, bumping against the counter ... if you had the chance to f****** king for a while, you’d have let me tear off your hoods and f ****** you up against the medicine-cupboard ... if you wanted to give me a good time right now, you’d let me undo your scrubs and f****** you up against the medicine-cupboard ... —ah, I'll lock the door, he replied. With his hands on her shoulders he pulled her behind one of the shelving in the ceiling behind her, hiding it from any snooping eyes. — he asked, smiling — she smiled and wrapped her arms around his neck — he said — he was embarrassed, and he drew back from her to walk back to the door. He made sure to keep a box in front of him, — they would be warned if someone tried to use their card to enter. — “Where did we come from?” he asked, with a smile.
