a flash of movement in the second-floor window caught my eye. There was a figure moving there, pulling the curtain aside. It was a figure from the upstairs. I think it was nate - it must be his room - but then i noticed a little blonde hair. - he was the same with me, he was in the same dress, he was in the same waistcoat - he felt his suit clinging to his waist and water in the belly button. - he said to me. - hey, you must be brynn. i'm jackson, the oldest of nate's friends. - i would like to enter. - jackson, he said with a friendly smile - he went up to the door and then turned to look behind me. I saw that nate was slow and stood just outside the door, not daring to put another foot in. - jackson turned to me, his face spread in a friendly smile . - "Come, brother, let's go in , i dreamed about this pool for days ... - - Well, I'll be there for you, ' he said, 'lets get in, you're sure, she likes to be alone,' - nate said reluctantly. It’s the most expensive thing you ever did.

He could sense a pause in his stroke, but I didn’t imagine that he could hear us. . . . “Do you still play lacrosse?” “I don’t really have the discipline to keep up with it. I was good at high school, but I’ve got to be good in college to be able to do it. . . . What sport do you play?”
