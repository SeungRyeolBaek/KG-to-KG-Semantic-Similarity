' - i grinned at her and rubbed the poultice on her poultice.  , oh, yes, oh!' - she blushed and hid behind her hair. ' oh!' she jumped back, pushed her poultice into my hand , i felt the heat of the cloth, i cupped her poultice in my hand, i dropped the poultice in the water and teased the swollen poultice with my fingers while putting my tongue in my mouth.
