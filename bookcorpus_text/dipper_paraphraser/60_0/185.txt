i meet her at the anthropologie in Georgetown, and we start to go through the catalogues while we’re standing by. , i immediately slip on the first set of lingerie and the most exquisite bra into my basket, and as she isn’t looking , i add a couple of pairs of sexy panties to my basket. ... yup, you’re right. . . . ’ i groan, removing one of the heavier pieces of clothes from the hanging to cover myself . . . ” what do you think?” she says, pulling aside the curtain and stepping into the dressing-room with me. I’m sure it wasn’t you that told me,  yup ... and you’re right , you’re right, ’ i, with my back to her, grabbed the lingerie and then sat down in the dressing room. - thank you, allison. - well, firstly, it's not your business, secondly, you are completely right about Gregory. He is 'very good', and there isn't a spark at all. " - i take a deep breath, not wanting to speak in public. - God, brynn, i just want to look after you. You're making a very bad choice, you're judged. - so what do you care about me? you're judging me. - so, you won't make a big fight with me, and i don't like it. - - well, first of all, it's not your business; second of all, you are really right about greg, he is 'famous', he is very smart, kind and funny , and he has sparks, sparks ... oh, i don't appreciate it , I froze outside a store, just before i reached the elevators. - i stare at him for a moment, but after a moment I realize that he is a mirror of me pulling my hair. i sigh and drop my hand. We had a argument,” I explain. “She. She discovered.” He turned his head slightly and then blew out a low whistle as he realized what I meant. “It’s all right, if you want, it’s not all that bad . . . ” he dropped his voice and looked back into the kitchen where our parents were talking.
