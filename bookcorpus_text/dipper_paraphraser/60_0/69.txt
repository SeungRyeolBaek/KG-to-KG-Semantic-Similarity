. . . You come to see me this evening, and you have brought me a great deal of pleasure. I have been thoroughly enjoying my time, and have had so much fun doing it. . . . but now . . .  You don't want to leave, . . . you are going to leave, oh yes, oh yes, . . . well, everything except work. . . . . oh, i can't believe you," he murmured, "but i don't want you to leave, . . . I'm only shocked , that's all. . . . ." she nodded and brushed his lips against his lips and kissed him tenderly. Is he going to punish me for that?' she asked in a whisper.
