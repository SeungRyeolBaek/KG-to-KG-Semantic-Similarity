I feel my breasts spring out, and his thumbs brush my nipples as he holds them in his hands, he begins to massage them with a stronger brush, and suddenly he feels my right nipple go into my mouth , he flicks his tongue across it, sucks, and moves to the other side. ... He silences for another minute, and he is suspended in this water of pleasure, in which he has left me, completely in his control. . . . . . , he swam in a rush, he leans his torso back, he begins to massage the back of my neck, he stops a moment and circles his tongue in my breast button, he rubs his fingers over the narrow strips of material on the sides of my skirt ... i feel his hands under the right side of my skirt, he slowly tucks it, he presses it with his fingertips and tucks it into my mouth ...  he sneezes, he sneezes, he whispers,  he likes them very much, he murmurs ... he sneezes, he coughs and sneezes, and my body shakes involuntarily. i am completely seized by this pleasure, so much so that to be able to let it go, it makes me feel painful . . . . he only glances at me from afar and reaches for my eye , his tongue seems to be warping my face, and I'm in love with it, the pleasure is so deep inside me that I cannot let it go. . . . please, please . . . please, please . . . he keeps circling it in front of me, as if mirroring his actions with his tongue. . . . he presses his hand into my eye, taps my clit, my legs are going on, my knees are almost twisted at the emptiness he has left behind . . . he starts to sob as he takes his hands from me, and he suddenly cuts open a condom, and he pushes it out of me, and he takes a leg from me and puts it around his waist as he turns it over. . . . he slams the hand into my arm, and at once he slaps it hard over my arm, and my body explodes. . . . . He thrusts me forward, and draws my trousers, still unpacked, to my ankles. His hand is still holding me down and I feel him enter from behind.
