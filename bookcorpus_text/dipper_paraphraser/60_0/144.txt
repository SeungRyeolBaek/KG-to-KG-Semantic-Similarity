I ran across the grassy lawn, looked up at my mother and pierced the light in the bedroom. It was early, perhaps, and i ran into the pool and frozen on the verandah, as if in a rage. My head jumped, and i shook as if tore out of a trance and rushed over the hydrangea bush next to me, rushing to get away. i ran as quickly and quietly as i could around the side of the house and to the front. i sat and watched the blue pool lights, which flickered in his back as he unscrews dana's cuffs and her loose skirts. ... i knew I had to move, but I didn't. dana cried out at once and i almost screamed, as if his hands were rubbing against me, i felt his touch on me, his hot breath in my ear as his expert fingers moved in ... nate rubbed her back and pushed her ... she didn't know what to do. nate grunted and pushed against her, she tried to regain control of herself as he pushed slowly into her. . . . my brain commanded me, but my body remained firmly in place, even as it throbbed with desires. . . . ‘Well,’ he asked calmly, his chin tilted slightly as he looked at me. ‘ So?’ he asked, sighing, ‘did you hear a twig splutter, and you ran away like a drunken ostrich’ . . . .’ he shuddered and lowered his eyes. ‘ So,’ he mumbled, leaning forward and leaning his forearm on the latch, he step back with a sigh, ‘you . . . were watching us,’ he accused me, glancing narrowing his eyes. ‘ Oh, so sorry, so sorry, again.’ he asked calmly, with a slight tilt of his chin, as he considered me. ‘Oh, thank God, I’m so sorry, too. I was down by the river...how did you do?’ he smirks. ‘ he said, gazing past me, past my book on the bed. ' There's nothing there, only a book,' I said, but he ran past me to it . . . .  No, just a book,' he said, but he walked past me to it. ' Aisha, he says, knows what lady Chatterley's lover is,' he says with a smug grin . . . ' Can't he be a prude,' he adds, guiding his eyes up and down my body . . .
