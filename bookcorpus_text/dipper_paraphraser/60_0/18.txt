Before he could say anything, she added, “Thanks for putting my purse in the bathroom . . . if you don’t want to stay here, you can take me to Emma’s . . .” “Ah, yes, of course you can.” And she shook her head. “So you’re staying at Aidan’s and Emma’s? . . .” “But do you mind if I stay here instead?” he asked. “I can sleep on the couch or in the guest room .” . . .” he shook his head, and as he drew up his mouth, she shook her head. “The last thing I want is for her to come and remind me of the things he could not have,” she replied. “Come back in a moment,” she whispered, turning to him. “I thought I could sleep as well.” He no longer glanced in the mirror, because he was sure he would not like what he saw. Instead of looking in the mirror, he dragged off his clothes and tie, and though probably he should have thrown on more clothes, he put his boxers on and took a white shirt from the chest of drawers. After pulling it over his head, he went back into the bedroom. Laying on his back, he stretched one arm around his head and threw the other hand around his chest. As he tried to hold her there for a few minutes, she had dropped to the floor, and he had already managed to fall asleep. His eyes were closed, but they were suddenly opening, as soon as he entered the room. It was bad. , very bad.

And if she tried to roll over, she found herself bound with a strong arm wrapped around her waist. Her eyes met the gray muscled arm.
