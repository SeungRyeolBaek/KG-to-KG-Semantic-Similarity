I didn’t think a bit of what to do, but there was nobody around. “Yes, that’s why she asked me to come out to look for you.” Aidan said as he went up, he dodged throwing out his hand and pulled him to his chest for a bear hug. “I’m so glad you’re here,” he said, bending his head at Aidan. “Well, then,” Aidan said, stroking him up. “And if you’re feeling very comfortable in your own skin, how’s it you’re feeling?” he sneered at aidan, “I’m absolutely incredible, you’ve never imagined being a father so ... astonishing.” Aidan nodded. “So what do you mean?” pesh nodded. “I hope you don’t mind. . . . “Are you surprised?” he asked, nodding. “And emma was worried about you,” he said, rubbing him on the back.

However, noah did not seem to be too excited to be dressed up in the lacy gown that draped over emma’s arms and sat down by her thighs. Aidan, laughing, reassured him and gave him a little shake. Aidan leaned over and whispered in his ear. Aidan shocked him and took him by the elbow and showed him to the women and men, and he smiled, nodded and shook their hands, before being swarmed by a hoarse chorus of Aidan’s nieces and nephews. Aidan surprised him, leaning in and whispering in his ear, “That’s my niece, Megan, she’s the Godmother!” Pesh could not help but feel relieved. He could not help catching his breath and he could not help breathing in relief. Then it's a man like you who has to keep his head down, and he's always so full of life, so he doesn't need to be like you, you don't need to be like this person, emma is the same as me, I can guarantee you, hehe , that you've never seen a woman like this before. " Then aidan wiped his chin. ' Just keep your mind open, eh?' he asked with a reluctant nod, 'I'll keep a word with you, eh? ' ' '
