Like my best friends, i get tired of them being so reserved . . . if I’m honest with myself, I want that too . . . and i promised myself that if I got my lawn-room, i’d go to a party . . . a college party . . . the three of us were not all that popular in high school, and when we met each other at the orienteering meeting in junior year, it was such a relief to have a team of like-minded girls, driven by their imaginations, with a taste for stories like “Girls of Rome,” so to speak, “Girls of Rome” . . . . . the way the three of us walked in early mornings at the library, their makeup smeared across their faces, their hair smacked out, and then pity, then jealousy. . . . . well, bye! . . . , his nose was straight, arranged over a pair of full, soft lips and a chin with a certain dimple in it. . . . if ryan gosling and kennedy could have a baby, he would be the Nate Thornhill. . . .
