“I don’t want to put you in a bad position. . . . I don’t want to make you feel anything. You and Nate, you have a special relationship, and i know that you are good and kind, and he needs people like you to love him. . . . in fact, I don’t want to upset you . . . you and Nate, you have a special relationship, I can tell you that. . . . he needs you in his life. And maybe i caught you in an avalanche, . . . . I start  tugging my hair, nervously . . .  do your parents know that? . . .  you and nate, he needs you in his life. . . . ” I feel guilty, I don’t want to let you go , nate . . . you don’t need to be ashamed , life is complicated. . . . And he isn’t in the least happy when people get up to him . . .” I nod, then go back to the house, as I run my fingers over her number. “Have you locked the door?” he asks, looking so distraught . . . “I’m sure you’re worried . . . I can’t decide . . . he’s annoyed . . .” he pauses, wondering if he’ll kiss me . . . . “I want to be alone right now,” I murmur, though I’m knotty about spending the first night in a week alone with him. . . . . “Oh, if only you could give me some advice . . . . . if i could do something about it . . . . he won’t let anyone up to him.” he shouted something to pierce with as they went into the garage. Fortunately, Nate has been a sound sleeper all morning . . . he was probably on his way to the train that morning, something which he was really unusual for. I impatiently waited, and as soon as it got up , i texted Eileen and walked down the hall . . . i expect them to wait ten minutes . . .
