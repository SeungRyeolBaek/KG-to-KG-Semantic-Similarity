. . . ” she sighed a little, but with a contemptuous snort, she replied: “Isn’t it obvious? . . . ” - yes, that is my opinion . . . but why?” - he replied honestly. - he remembers what Emma said, and asked with a contemptuous snort: “Well, if you said that you were drunk the night before and got ill, you have no influence on me; accidents happen, and i am a man enough to know that. “ - he closed the gap between them. - I like you, yesterday, . . . , what do you want? You want to get married, right, and get married again, right, right? - yes, that is what i want. - he said with a wry smile. - He was always the gentleman, he waited for her to go through first. - He opened the door without saying a word to her, he cranked up, and began to walk down the driveway. - Yes, thank you, she said - he nodded and looked at her again. - But she really wanted to say something, because I really wanted to know you better ... - the sound of the long silence in her heart shook her, and he didn't look at her - he looked at the road ahead of him, and he said a good word to her. - thank you, thank you, ' she said. - and I'm sorry that you feel that way, because I would really like to know you better ...
