He was my beautiful girl, my lover. She was my beaut, my affectionate daughter. We had spent long weekends together and i never questioned the weirdness of our meeting, nor did I wonder why it had been so easy for me to make such a decision after so many years of living and thinking the same way. i knew how to follow the money trail. I knew how to follow the money trail. I had time to prepare myself, for i had already already made up my mind what would be on the evening. i did not want to upset her very near her performance, and i was only just at the end of the result. i was ready when she reached out to me hesitantly to let me know that her ex was going to perform at the performance. i did not want to upset her very close to the performance, and i only just got the last word , it had taken so long because the lawyers were very skilful about their stealing , it was too bad for them , i knew how to follow the money, all I needed was a scent . . . he pulled his legs around my waist and cried out at my admission ... he had not yet told her what he had found out. Even if it were a bad day, he would make me his wife. i would look after him when he didn’t look, and i would pay attention to the little things he did, like he flung his arm round me, whenever we went somewhere together, or how he ran his hand through my hair while we sat together watching a movie together. i just loved the way he made love to me. i didn’t have that sick feeling that I would frighten him on stage. he had just found a lady who was a fellow who treated people like me, and she just put me through these exercises, and so far it seemed to work. I hadn’t had the sudden urge to explode because of that, no, trace had taken care of it for me. i had told my family about him and my dad, and he and I had had a few private conversations over the past few weeks that I didn’t know about, but my family seemed to love and accept him, despite his adolescent age. That night he had punished me, which he still thought to me now, it was inflamed; but he was the perfect man, he was more than a boy; he was the perfect man; he’s been so much more than a boy. It was the whole process, but it seemed to be working. For all that he’d been able to conceal our relationship, the whole world was under the impression that I was still desperate for him. If miracles continue, will they not cease? he had told me that he was pleased with the whole deal, but as the time approached, I could see the tic in his jaw pounding overtime. Of course, we were about to hit the limit.
