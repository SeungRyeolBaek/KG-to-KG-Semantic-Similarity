Somewhere there, when they were about to leave the room, they came upon another patient. kristi seemed to feel the same, as her cheeks had turned gold, for the silver sparkle of perspiration shined on them. Then, turning her head to kristi, she pushed open the door and looked at the man in the examination room. Megan could not hold back her smile. ‘ You can see that we’re going to be over-stuck ,’ kristi smiled and patted her hand. ‘Are you sure? I’m sure . . .’ kristi rolled her eyes ... ‘Are you really alone?’ — she turned back to megan. ‘ Ah, kristi, you should have referred me to a servant, wouldn’t you?’ kristi shook her head. ‘I have seen you in action the last week. - he moved uncomfortably on the table. - Megan rolled her eyes. - please, please look at your abdomen - he said, he mumbled, - 'it's not my stomach, ' he mumbled - and she was just getting used to it ... when he didn't answer, she sighed, - it's the first time that she saw a patient on her own, and he was a sheer, demon-possessed lunatic. I don't know how long you will not be able to see a doctor, least of all a male doctor ... ' ' she was furious and sighed with irritation - " oh, my God , he said.

' ' Please, if you would like to see your abdomen,' he said, screaming, and he just threw the sheet away. ' “A male doctor, wouldn’t you take it for a man?’ his blue eyes widened in horror. ‘I’m sorry,’ he smiled at her. ‘Well, i’m fine.’ And when she had jumped out of the room, she met the last person she wanted to have to deal with at this moment – her husband. ‘Well,’ he said, smiling. ‘I’ll be back, my dear.’
