I had to stop talking during dinner, and questioned her more about the life on the tour and what she liked most about her fame. I was almost forgetting about this at the time, but I was not quite sure what had driven me to think of it, and I am not sure of what had driven me to say it . . . as a matter of fact, i am now. I was so embarrassed that i leaned over and puffed her lips. She was not even terribly friendly, but I felt a little uncomfortable as she served me, and then she herself. . . . and i took another bite, it was as good as the first one. . . . it's unbelievable, you were so serious about the heart , I know that . . . i mean, what do you want, the first thing my heart ever wanted? "I know, I know, I've known wants before, but you're the first thing my heart wanted . . . it's crazy, i know, and if any one of my colleagues came to me with this story, he'd say that he's crazy . . . . . but I know that if i bumped into the little prick, i was going to beat the hell out of him for putting his hand on her. . . . but what about a baby? . . . but there’s no need to worry about it now. . . . what’s done’s done, and if it’s not done, then I’m going to make sure that it’s done . . . . you know how crazy it all sounds.” . . . i didn’t know the real thing until then, but I had my ways of discovering things. . . . It wasn’t at all that I didn’t know her when she was there, it was just how I was, or, at least, as far as she’s concerned . . . I wanted you, in my opinion, in my opinion, in my opinion, in my opinion, you know , we’re hardly known one another. But, as you look at it, we both know where we stand, if the last few hours are any indication, we both want to keep each other for more than a moment, and that’s the bottom of the matter . . . and if we don’t have time to worry about it, it’s nothing to be worried about now. I was really fascinated by everything new in my life . . . my mind was turning with all the new things that were happening in my life. . . . Kitchen, on limp legs, to the television room, looking for something to watch, but i really did not care much about it . . . but this new experience was very impressive, though I still burned . . .
