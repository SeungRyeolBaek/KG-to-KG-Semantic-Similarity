I’m sorry ... i’m so sorry ... ” he sneered, buried her head in her hands and sighed. - “I love you so much!” she shouted from behind her hands. - “It’s so boring today ... – that’s ... you are ... and you’re lying ... ” he sneered. – he had not uttered the word yet and he had managed to go and say it before he had time to get it. – Oh, God, did you have to say that now? ... well, even if you’re irritated ... , it’s all the same to me ... ” she screamed from behind her hands . “That is not fair, you wretch,” he said. “It isn’t fair to you.
