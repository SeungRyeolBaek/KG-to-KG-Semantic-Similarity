, she got out of it and then turned to face him. , the look he gave her was all too powerful, and she did not feel it in her soul . . . . She felt the heat of his gaze heating her, and he turned her back to look at him, and he opened his shirt, she sucked in a breath, and saw the dust of black hair on his chest. It brushed against his dress and down his hips. , it was the same, but it wasn't like this, it didn't sound like this , it was like a pesh. . . . as he threw his shirt aside, he ripped it off, and slung it to the floor .

When he started to pull away, she sat up to hold his shoulders, and urged him to stop. “That’s why we can do it.”
