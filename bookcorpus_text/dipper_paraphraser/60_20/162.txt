But i had become less and less certain of myself the longer I stayed in this house. ' Well,' I ordered him, and dragged a hand under his torso to push him upwards. ' ' What's the matter with you, bro?' he said, laughing a little. ' ' 'Well, go on, get up,' he said, and I dragged my hand under his torso to urge him upwards. ' ' You can hear him grunting in the hallway,' he said, and sighed. '' But the odor of alcohol would make him sound very drunk, '' he replied, ''which sounded like nate. ' ' Nate? ' he said with a sigh, and he knelt before me. ' I don’t drink, he says, and I thought I was a nerd,’ he says. – and he thought I was a nerd,’ he says. – ‘Isn’t it wrong, sir?’ he asks indignantly. – ‘I’m sorry,’ he whispers, shaking his head as if to clear it. – ‘You’re funny, sir,’ he says, squinting his head slightly, then he goes up to me. – ‘yes, brynn?’ – ‘yes, sir,’ he says innocently. ‘Yes, sir, yes,’ he says, with a limp. – ‘Oh, are you sure you’re not drunk?’ – he asks me worriedly, ‘don’t you think it’s wrong?’ – ‘It’s just that – the words of yours,’ – he reminds me. – I wrap my arms around his neck and he’ll grab me by both hands and kiss me one by one, then he’ll break my last kiss – we kiss right at the very moment that our last one was broken. – he’ll hold me back and stand on my shoulders – I’m sorry,’ he whispers, shaking his head as if to clear it. - I know, - i whisper, knowing that he is talking about his father ... - i know, - i whisper, knowing that he is talking about his father. - - i will have to understand the feelings of nate about his mother, before I tell him ... - - he lays down on the bed and breathes slowly. - - he is still on the pillow and his breathing stops.
