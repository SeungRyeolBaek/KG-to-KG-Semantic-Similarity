I have no objection to her stooping about the stage and doing it conservatively, but it's still a bit too witty for me. But, at the end of the day, love in all its forms is the best you can hope for and cherish. Yes, I know that she's the newest and hottest pop sensation on the scene, but . . . yes, and . . . he has two daughters who are begging to see what the future holds. and she's got a hundred thousand people watching her, with their other hundred thousand . . . and I'm so excited that . . . . I'm beating her as soon as we get back to the house, just before letting her take her little devil. . . . he embraced his wife and his two daughters, who he couldn't wait to see what the future was like for them . . . and now everything is over, and everyone's busy. . . . but now the cat's out of the bag, and everyone is all in our frock coat . . . the girl, as she says, is a showgirl, and she slouches down in a chair in the front row of the box, a man with nothing to think about and a free show. . . . no one sitting next to me can tell that I am mad. I can’t explain it to you. I am a man of action, a man who has learned in the fickle world of high finance that there is no other way to live . . . and when a man sees a thing that he likes, he takes it, for what he wants . . . well, then, if he’s married, then I’m going back to him. . . . it isn’t my style . . . . . so, imagine my surprise when she came on stage. . . . i didn’t know who she was, but the adulation in the audience was so intense that it made them go ablaze. . . . . the place was a disaster . . . so i pulled my phone and cancelled my dinner, and essentially ended the six-month relationship that I had been hardly having with another woman . . . . it’s not my style. . . . it’s a flunky-hot hot . . . that’s not my style . . . she had a little more in her voice than the rest. Usually, if she got upset, i would send her one of tiffany’s little blue boxes, but there was no time, and i had to do it the next day.
