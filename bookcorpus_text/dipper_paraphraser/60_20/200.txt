I almost gave in and walked on without sweating. I reached the restaurant, a upscale restaurant, with a real special margarita ... and I was relieved to hear the ac. The hostess smiled at me just as i saw allison sitting in a booth with her friends. She stood there with a nervous smile and i walked past. I stand up and kiss her . . . oh, god, sorry, oh, god, sorry, ‚Äù I murmur, reaching for a napkin. . . . as if in a horror, i start to weep . . . - you two have now connected your watches , you've been in the same city all summer! . . .
