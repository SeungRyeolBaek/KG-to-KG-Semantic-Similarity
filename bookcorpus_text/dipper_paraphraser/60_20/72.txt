She threatens me ...’ he began to cry. - - She threatens me physically? - - no, that's right, she threatens me ... - he hastened to warn me ... - Megan sighed - - he is angry ... he ... you know, he is very fond of you, he has not been to any battle with you for some time , he did not know he was like this. - - he crossed his arms over his chest. - - You do know how much he loves you, he should understand that it is not in his nature to interfere with him ... he is attracted to you ... he is a senior, he must understand that he cannot stand in the company of a lesser person , so he is not allowed to yell at you ...   , he said, if he didn't see my back, he would report to the supervisor ... - he sighed ...   , you know how much he loves you ... he resigned himself to you and squinted . In the morning, he saw that she was just dying of a sigh when they threw the bed in front of the bathroom. “What? Didn’t you say you had bubbles?” she asked him with a wink. “Well, can you do that, do you?” “Don’t tell me, are you, a metrosexual?” she asked him with a smile. “You are a good girl, don’t you?” he smiled at her and threw her arms in the air, looking down at her and pointing at her. She turned her head and picked up the glass. Then he poured the white wine into the glass, then placed it on the bar. ... What are you referring to?” she raised her eyebrows.   What are you doing? ” He pushed her aside and stood still in front of the chair to take a gulp.    that's so good. ” He sat the glass of wine on the counter. Without taking his eyes off hers, he jerked it up and over her head. he looked down at her simple, white frock . . . she was just standing before him, wearing a bra and a thin thong . . . “Now . . . how can I help you with that . . .” she stepped out of her pants, only her bra and her frock . . . . and she ducked in a breath, when his fingers skimmed her abdomen before he grasped her cotton frock cuffs and tucked them down.
