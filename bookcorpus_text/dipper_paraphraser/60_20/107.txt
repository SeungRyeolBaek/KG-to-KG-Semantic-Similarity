I took the empty glass from her and led her inside. She was complete. . . . pink flesh with a hint of tan on her cheeks and a sharp strip of freckles over her perfectly upturned nose. . . . ” i went in and unwrapped the towel she had clutched in her hand. she was a teenager, her hair swept off around her shoulders and her face bare of makeup. I didn’t have time to chase her; it was all on me to keep away from her. She was perfection. She was a perfect woman, all mine now.

Chapter 3 in the morning, I opened my eyes and landed on her, as she looked up at me from her position on my chest . . . a close second. . . .
