I pulled out my phone from my pocket, and sent a quick message to cara: “Hey, I just got a terrible headache , hehe! ” he said, “all the same, hehehehe, and how arrogant it was that he demanded that I be part of him and that girl, as though I should be able to do that. I wasn’t able to sleep well yesterday, and now I couldn’t concentrate on my notes. , and what was going on yesterday made me lose all patience. I was expecting so much for the night, a lot of things for him, and he was just so rude. i had such hopes for tonight, he had such hopes for me, and he ended up being so nasty ... i raised my hand to my mouth and wiped my lips, smearing off the lip gloss ... i could see my phone ringing on the desk next to me.
