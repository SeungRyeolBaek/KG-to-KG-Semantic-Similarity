I have faith in you.” By the way, he pressed her hand into the steering-wheel. “Is that right?” he asked. “Well, it’s only the third one that you own.” She held the steering-wheel in her hand and pushed it gently in her direction. As if she were grasping it, she began to wonder if it might actually be your father’s plane. “That one would be yours, is it?” she asked, turning her head to him. Then she leaned forward to rub her shoulder. “It looks like it is. “Well, you have a small red knob that says mixture.” It was as if he were trying to do something that she was not looking at at the back of the airplane, but she did not see him, hardly being able to see him in the confined space of the back seat, and so she rolled the condom down her thighs. Her fingers twisted the sleeve of her jeans as she moved them down her chest. Then she seized his neck and pressed it against his back to keep him from going back into the seat. She felt his heavy weight pushing her deeply into the air, and she pushed him in, pushing against him so as not to knock him back in the seat. It seemed to her that at this point he was buried deep inside her. And with a nod she began to climb over him, climbing into the two seats in the back. Her body rolled up to her chest and she grabbed him by the arm with her hands, pushing against him to keep him from dragging him back into the seat. A little hurriedly, she jumped up and started climbing over him, and when she felt that the hardness of his body was pressing against her bones, she made her legs droop down as far as she could in the cramped space. It probably didn’t help that as trace was talking she noticed that the windows of the plane were smashed up. “It’s okay, trace,” he called, “i just noticed the flight — oh, yes, trace, it’s okay, you know ... I’m just wondering if you’re doing well, trace. I’m just looking at something about your flight. ” Megan’s hand flew across her mouth, and she began to laugh indiscriminately.
