he shouted, eyes rolled in alarm. . . . he jumped into me, and I could feel his warm breath on my face. . . . . he looked at me in horror, he looked at me with anger, he turned his face red, so that he fought with a much stronger son, he looked like a crazy man, and his face turns angry and his cheek shines, without my brain, that he slapped me. . . . . i feel his heat on my face . . . i am here to see him . . . he wails pitifully, he passes his hand over my hip, then over my ass. i bring my hand to my burning face, my head still leaning to the side, as if it were disappearing. . . . you think you are a gentleman with your good clothes and your house, but you are a sick man, who take advantage of anyone. . . . " he yells at his father, whose face is turning red in the effort to defend himself against his stronger son. . . . " a horror sweeps over my mother’s face. . . . . oh, christ, holly, are you that stupid, you didn’t even suspect?’ a wailing cry escapes my mother’s lips. ‘ I saw him trying to get back at Brynn, and then she told him to stop and he hit her, - my mom shook her head ... – what is he talking about?’ he says, pointing to us ... pierce does not even try to defend himself, but turns his palms to her and shrugs his shoulders. pierce does not even try to make any reply to her accusation, but he just turns his palms to her and shrugs. - oh, my dear, my dear, are you really that naughty , didn’t you suspect? - pierce laughs, pierce puts his arms up to defend himself, while nate comes forward and wraps his arms around her, hemming her in and pulling her away ... a wailing cry comes from my mother's lips ... oh, is it true? - nate says to her ... - she looks at me, then at pierce ... oh, christ, holly, are you really that stupid? I hailed him for a moment with my head cocked slightly to one side. . . . i couldn’t see his face, nor could I imagine what was going on inside his head. . . . when I heard his car running down the street, my mother rose up, and Nate’s arms fell to his sides. . . . he flung himself in front of the front door, and shut it behind him. . . .
