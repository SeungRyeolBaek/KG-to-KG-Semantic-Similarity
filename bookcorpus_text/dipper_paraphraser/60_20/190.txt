My wife and I each took a cupcake back to our desk. . . . . I walked into the room and, begging for our seats, the head clerk called out, “He asked me to come in. . . . I think so, although I heard there was some coconut in there . . .” “I’m sure you’ll come in for a minute, sir,” she answered, “you’re a good one. Please come in,” she said, nodding. “I have no doubt you’ll want to see if I’ll be home for dinner tonight.” “Of course, go in,” she said, waved me in. . . . he led me inside, and asked me to sit across from his desk . . . ” he gave me a call, and he was the one who told me to . . . . I couldn’t believe it, but what’s the point? ... You have such a beautiful body , you can’t be with someone who treats you with less respect than you deserve.” “Ah, not at all,” I answered quickly, “and I don’t think it’s fair,” i admonished him with all my confidence, reaching behind myself to pull my dress up. . . . i marched to the door, and sat down with a deep breath in order to breathe. I walked right past my desk and into the toilet, locking myself immediately in a cubicle. i lowered the seat of the toilet and sat down, pressing my hands on my burned cheeks. . . . ” “I’m just trying to look after you. You need a father in your life . . . ” i exclaimed, jumped up. . . . . he spreads his fingers across my back and a sickening sensation passes through my body with them . . . “Oh, you are absolutely right, thank you very much,” i admonished him with all the confidence I had, while bending over and pulling up my zip. And now, when he saw me, he waited for a while. He took off his hair, pressed it to my neck, and walked in. I took off my hair to hide the bruises, and went in ... I saw she had set it up with a fine china and crystal, and there was a large vase of white lilies in the middle. . . . Ah, brynn, honey, I'm so glad you're home!
