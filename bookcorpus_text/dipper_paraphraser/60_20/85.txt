As he leaned forward, pesh pressed her head against his. When she flicked her tongue against him, he moaned into her mouth. “It’s fine, sir, if you will.” “Well then, but not officially yet, sir, but a diamond on your hands, sir, sir, oh, fine,” he laughed. “I am promised a fortune, sir.” “I don’t want to argue with you,” she smiled, “but I want to spoil my lovely future wife.” While they were saying good-bye to each other, he could not believe how lucky he was. Then, when she pointed to him, he groaned in her mouth. When she kissed his back, sir, sir, he raised his eyebrows. – She is the one he would have to go and fling her ring on the floor, even if it is a tiny chip ... “But, sir, I would love to have a diamond in my hand ... but, sir, I would be willing to wear it , it would be a big one ... ” – sir, he laughed. " and no, I don't really want to know about it. Next time I'll go and get another person, so I don't have to bleach eyelids to forget about it." "There was no one else there," said Aidan, laughing. "Ah, sir," said pesh, and he got up and looked at Megan. Aidan's blue eyes widened. "It's just an 'edifice'," said Megan. " Yes, we are. " She lifted her hand and looked at Megan, smiling. "My god, you two are engaged?" cried Sneetan. "I was just looking to see if Megan was okay. . . . I'm sorry, but you should understand that when the mood is right, you will take measures. " As soon as she had got off the bed, she peeped down and went to his father. ‘I shook my head. . . . I’m sorry I’m arguing with you. I’m not going to argue with you,’ Aidan said. ‘No, we haven’t decided yet on that. We just want to get it done the right way,’ pesh nodded. ‘I don’t think you’re going to say anything wrong about it? . . . Hell, look at me and . . .’ Aidan nodded. ‘In the end, you’ve got to get used to it and make use of the big moments that have gone beyond what you could ever imagine.’
