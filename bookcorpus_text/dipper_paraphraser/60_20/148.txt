I’m going upstairs, with my suitcase still on my shoulder. It’s as if I were going to work , it’s something I’m going to be out a lot, it’s a heavy burden. The first days are always exhausting, but today was particularly busy. Before I could fully consider what I’m doing, before I could think of all the reasons why I shouldn’t do it, I slowly drew my hands down and unfastened the zips at the top of the jacket and let it fall at my feet. i put it on and dragged it out of the closet , it’s my only pencil skirt, and it gets a little itchy around my waist. i look down at the closet and pretend to see the last drop of water as it flows down the drain. i look down at the sink, pretending to watch the last drop of water trickling down the drain, looking down at the sink and noticing that he’s there, watching me.

But now I hear the alarm-clock start. i open it and hear something moving down the stairs. I swivel to my feet and begin to look around, but I hear a small bang, a low sound coming from downstairs. The sound is as if it came from the kitchen ... and if I look up, nate is gone. I’ve settled into a routine, even if it doesn’t feel like home to me.
