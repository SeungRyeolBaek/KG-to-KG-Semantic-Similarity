There was a girl in the back room, and the room was still empty, and there were people who were in the dining room, but no one, so he took her hand, and then let her go. She waved her tongue, looked at him, and tasted the alcohol and spices that they had eaten. He pressed her tongue to her lips, and the br. sts touched her. She did not dare to touch him, but pressed her hand, and pressed her lips with his thumb, and she looked at him. She shivered when he groaned into her mouth, and her hand was stuffed with tears. When he pulled back from the kiss, he kept glancing at her. It was a trick of his at the same time, and it worked ... So he got out of the kiss and turned away from her, but kept her gaze on her. “Thank you for the ride.” With his hand, she gave him a key. He began to fill the room, and handed her a keycard. “We have you in one of our small rooms,” he said, drumming his fingers on the marble counter. As the two of them stepped on to the elevator, Megan couldn’t help the nervous giggle that escaped her lips. “You don’t know me, and I don’t mind if I do,” she said. “And by the way, the conversation went, he probably thinks I’m a prostitute . . .” When she looked up into the room, she noticed that the man was staring curiously at her. “Oh, do you really think that?” a growl went down his throat. “Isn’t it possible for you to think that way?” he asked, shaking his hands on the marble counter. “Isn’t it possible that we could go in to the hotel and look for a king-size bed?” “Ah, please, maybe I could go as far as the room is to go to the palace?” . . . no, I want to,” she assured him. Without saying a word, he ran his fingers to her hair. . . . and he went to look for the zipper at the middle of her back. Then, he turned her round to face him . . . you have nothing to be afraid of. . . . if you do not want to do it anymore, we don't have to. . . .
