“It’s a good thing that we don’t feel any better than we feel when we think of him touching me again. But today, the day of the fourth of july, nate and I were to be required at the same event—the annual 4th of July at Hornhill, which is in our very own backyard, starting at afternoon with a crab boil, and extending to the evening with fireworks. I could not say if it was the right thing to do. My body began to tremble just to think of the thought of his lips touching mine again. Besides, my mom was constantly telling me about buying me new clothes for the occasion, and even made an appointment with me in order to see if my mother needed any help. At the time, he had one of those eyeglasses in my pocket. My mother, for some reason, had always been eager to buy me a new dress and even went to the tailor to see if it was the right one. he said, 'My first to go,' I knew it would be a good thing to go. I could feel my body squeezing when I thought of his kisses touching mine. he said, 'It's like that, 'He slashed his lips on me ...' I saw it he had done it before in a college class. The venue has decided to set up, and the temperature is not too hot, the temperature is about ninety degrees. I decide to go down to the river, since I’ll have to stand in the way as they set up, and I have the advantage of having the advantage of being in the way. And the first guests should be in about ten minutes. A splash on the other side of the large boulder is my attention. I go over and look around, and see nate standing there skipping rocks with his smooth side-arms, and i can see that he’s not attempting to talk to me. Luckily the day’s not too hot; the temperature is holding steady at a cool eighty degrees. “Thanks,” he says, after I get up. ”thanks,” he says, as he straightens me up. “Thanks!” i reply, going over to the bar. The bartender gives me a pale pink drink, and I drink a sip. It’s not too sweet, it’s light and refreshing. That's a horrible thing . . . you were, if you please, not well, then you were thrown before our parents, but . . . you were . . . but it was just the way I grew up. . . . . but . . . well, i'd say that we were shackles . . . " he looked at me bewildered. . . . well, you're right. . . . you . . .
