“Hello, foster,” said Cara, rolling her eyes, but something about her gleam in her eyes tells me she likes this man ... yes, please,” Cara said. “Here, mother, this is my good friend, Mrs. Brynn ... and this is her first party, so treat her with respect.” “Oh, no, no,” he replied, nodding to the keg behind him. “Hello, son, sir, here’s my friend, brynn, this is my friend, he says, I’m always good ...

The staircase was wide open, and at the end of the hall there was a small pool, and the door was locked, and a man was coming in front of the last girl. He stepped behind the last one, sighing and glancing back. I noticed that he was standing in front of me, in one of the corners of the room. I could not hear a word. He pushed hard and waited for a reply, and if I did not hear it, he pushed the door open, squeezing it.  he was crying, and shut the door behind him. he sighed, and closed the door behind him. i pulled my legs back, stepped forward, and walked up the stairs. There were a few people standing at the entrance, but it was quieter up there, and a lot of rooms could be found in this place. he says to me, smiling. - No, sorry, - i murmur, glancing up and down the hall, and hear the girl laughing behind me ... i run out of the door and down the steps of the front entrance, and when I stop on the sidewalk I try to think of what happened.
