I’m sure you’re a good eater.” Pesh smiled at him, and his brows were burning. “What are your favorite dishes?” “Ask the waiter,” he said, “it’s delicious.” “I really like it when you prove me wrong, and you are unexpected.” he said. “When you try to make people think that I’m just the same, you will always prove me wrong.” “What are you eating at my house? Emma never had anything to do with Indian food,” he said. “I think it’s because of this emma’s fact that I can’t have it any more.” “Well, when you learn that you can’t assume I’m like that, you will ”” “I hope you will,” said Pesh. ‘So you really think she’s pregnant?’ he muttered. ‘I’m sure she’s lovely,’ he said. ‘I’ve been in a lot of pain and haven’t been out for a long time, but I want to woo her just like you are ...’ he smiled. ‘In a way, they’re both quite beautiful,’ said Pesh. ‘Just say that during one particularly heated moment together, she was with Aidan, and I was with jade.’ The expression on her face had seemed to make her seem so romantic.

A shadow of a smile played on his lips. ‘Oh, I didn’t mention a terrible scoundrel,’ said Megan. ‘But you’re built like a football player, aren’t you?’ she replied. ‘Is that really true?’ she added. ‘I have no athletic ability whatsoever. . . .’ After a minute’s thought and careful chewing of her salad, Megan said, ‘I bet you wouldn’t be able to play football.’ ‘Oh,’ she said, ‘that’s the truth.’
