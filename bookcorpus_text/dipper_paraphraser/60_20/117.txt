"and we got out of the bath, both of us just put on our bathrobes and went down to the kitchen. I noticed her red blotches on her labia and heard the slight sighs of discomfort that she gave me as she kept spurring me to f... k her. , this time he was more like a sigh than a sigh, as I shook my hands and thrust myself into her until I was dry . . . was it because I had not slept with her for three whole nights and not taken her out? I did not know why. . . . she threw herself into my arms and howled, bursting with laughter, and my heart began to feel a little more tender. . . . the more I had her, the more I wanted her, but if we stayed like that, she would have spent the next three weeks bedridden . . . she was walking around the kitchen and tearing into the pans and pans on the stove, and i lifted my brow quizzically . . . it seems that I had sloppy things in my head, i did not expect the little popstar to know the way around the kitchen. her whole face seemed to me happy. I found it strange to look at this almost stranger, and to realize that I already knew her so well. Did she realize she was signing? . . . no, i didn't, i didn't ask him where he got them. . . . " - do you know what is a prescription for it? -  - no, no, I never asked where he got them. - he gave me these pills . . . " i did not like the sound of this one bit , i could not understand how it sounds . . . . - "Sing louder, princess, i don't want to hear you . . . " - i did not like that sound , . . . she turned her eyes to me and looked down at her feet. - - he looked at me quizzically . . . â€œNo doubt my dear old boss would do anything to see that she was making a decent living. Though he would keep that for another time, nothing was going to spoil the night for us. And if there was a friction there, for I have noticed that she has a bit of an independent streak, he had no intention of letting that stop him . . . but I wanted to wait till after all. It was something I had to take into account as well.
