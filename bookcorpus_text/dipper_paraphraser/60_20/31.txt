' I've never seen a man in his life,' he groaned. ' 'You know, i heard you've been through some prank with Dr. morris,' she said. ' I'm quite sure that you're going to be very happy to be here and I'll do everything in my power to make sure that you stay.' When Megan wrinkled her nose, Pesh laughed at him.
