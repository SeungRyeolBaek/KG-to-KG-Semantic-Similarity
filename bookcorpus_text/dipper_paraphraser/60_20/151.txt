i had never been a big sportsman, but i’ve always wondered if I’d ever be able to handle them. At first I thought it was nate—it was his room, he thought—but then I saw blonde hair. I opened my eyes as I pushed the water past me with my hands, and looked up into the house to the left. Suddenly a flash of light flashed from the second floor window. It was a figure dragging the curtain away from me, pushing it aside. I felt the towel hold up against my chest and water was sitting in my belly button. he stepped out of the pool, holding his hand and kissing it, and he snatched it up to my stomach. “Have a good time,” he said to him, stepping back into the water. “It’s good to see you,” he said, and drew the curtain behind him, smiling. They make a nice pair, nate with his dark eyes, jackson with his light blonde locks. - O, where are you going now? - I asked, and nate stood beside jackson. - Well, we aren't allowed to eat after you swim, - he said, with a smile, - he has a boyish look, and it's infectious. - - I think I know that, you know that, - I'm sure that it's a myth, the reason that adults cannot do their own lunches without the kids swimming unsupervised. - - oh, that makes sense. - , you want to get food now? - he asked, and he pulled his wet hair out of his eyes. - - - nate and jackson chatted together. - - - I'm not, I'm not. . . . but he’s always going to look at us . . . in the moment, it seems to me that he can hear us . . . he and I laugh together . . . but you’ve got to be good in school to succeed. . . . what sport do you play?’   oh, no . . .
