' Mamma, do you have anything to do with me,' said Kim. ' - Oh, I'm sorry , i was with your papa fitzgerald the day of the sudden cardiac attack at the vfw. and he was treated by Pesh ...' said Kim. ' Yes, that's true . . . . thank you so much for your comment on the present; that's the way it is. . . . I was with your papa's wife the day of his heart attack at the vfw. Then he came once to pick me up from the room and, after he had retired from bed, took me to the opera ... that was all. ... he was a man with amazing feelings and is an extremely good kisser, it makes one feel all right, besides his physical beauty, he is smart, kind, intelligent, one can only imagine that she wants. . . . ” megan pushed. - she pulled the noah into the skirt and started to prick his neck. . . . is it a fling with one another? ... I can't, I can't love another man as much as I love him. . . . , I don't want to hurt him, but I don't know whether it will hurt him, but who will say that a fling would hurt him? It's not true that he doesn't need to be hurt, but who can say that a fling will hurt him?

But no matter what happened to Pesh after they broke up, Aidan did respect and admire him , he wanted Pesh to be happy. ” ” Megan asked.
