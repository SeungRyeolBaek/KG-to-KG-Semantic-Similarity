he needs you, and he needs you for himself. . . . . you and nate, you’re special, eh? . . . not only for you, but for nate too , he needs you, he needs you, he needs people like you to love him. . . . hell, I don’t think you’re breaking any laws . . . ” my tears begin to droop again, refreshed. . . . . “Have your parents been overjoyed?” I numbly nod my head. “No, I don’t want to put you in a position. . . . i’m not putting you in any plight . . . you and nate, you have a special relationship. . . . he stops and asks, “Do you remember me?” “I know ... he does not like it when people stand up to him ...” he nods, looks sad, and he glimpses the boy who used to be with his parents when they were out fighting ... he does not like it when people stand up to him. “Have you locked it?” he asks, looking out of pain.  he nods, and walks slowly back to the house, whose hands I swish over her phone number ... i walked over and locked it, and only opened it a few inches.  i don't know, he whispers, if he doesn't like to be alone. I don't want to spend the first night of the week alone with him ... he looks so uneasy and he sees the child that he was once when he heard his parents arguing.   alright, they're going to a charity lunch tomorrow ... we might spend a little time together ... ” he says, smiling, he stops, he doesn't want to kiss me ... he said, pauses and doesn't know whether he wants to kiss me ... My mother murmured something to pierce through my skin, as they passed through the car park. Luckily nate had been well and truly ensconced in his room all morning. I do not know if he had even been up to the train this morning, which is quite uncommon for him. I waited impatiently, and as soon as the clock was up, I phoned eileen and went down to the passage.
