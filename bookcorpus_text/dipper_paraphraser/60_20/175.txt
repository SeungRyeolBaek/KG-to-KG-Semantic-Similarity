- What’s all? - he asks. - yes, it’s fine. - Oh, oh, it’s fine, it’s ok, we’ll take you to the doctor . . . ” - he gets into the car, carries me from the car to the kitchen, and gently sat me down on a chair in the breakfast nook. - I open the door and go to the upper part of the lounge . - do you wiggle your toes? - he wiggles his toes, he wiggles, he really moves his whole foot . . . i'm happy, when he doesn't have my own hand , he's good . . . if he's still ill, I'll take you to the doctor . - oh, oh, sorry, - he says, tearing his face out, opening the door, he kneels in front of me, takes out his shoe, slips his sock off, he's bending over the place and he slaps it, he slaps his sock and he stops. - - he cries a soft low voice as he cries, his eyes close to mine. - - he whispers, his dark blue eyes glare at my face. - - he looks at my mouth and pauses for a moment before bending down. - - he will not, he says, - he will not, - he says, his right hand slowly moves from the blanket to the skin of my neck, i hold my breath, he gently runs his fingertips over my jaw, then over to my chin - with his thumb and forefinger he tilts my head up so that I can see him, he will slowly tilt my head up and, with his thumb and forefinger, tilts my head up until I look at him, he will star at my mouth, and will only stop for a moment, he will stoop to me. - What if he shan't, he will be cruel ... " - he says, the dark blue eyes are shining down on me. - I can't tell you exactly what it will look like ... i have never done anything like that ... He was promising me a meeting tonight. . . . ” He murmured and his eyes sparkled with promise. “Do you feel better, Brynn?” my mother asked, frowning. ” Yes, I’m fine,” he said, and I drew my napkin to the process of wiping the tomato sauce off my shirt where I’d just spilled it.
