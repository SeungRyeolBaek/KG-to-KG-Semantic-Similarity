he nodded a bit. He did not have to look for megan—she was in one of the rooms with the door closed. , she was sitting on the edge of the bed, her head in her hands. He drew his hand toward her back. “Do you think i am angry with you?” he muttered, his head bowed, and pesh gently sat him back on the floor. When she didn’t answer, he went on to open the door, and found her sitting on the edge of the bed, her head in her hands, and her elbows on her knees, and she looked at him with a shudder. “You think I’m angry with you?” he sneered, letting out a small sigh. “Oh, you’re so naive sometimes!” he yelled. “You don’t have to look hard for him, and you shouldn’t have shown him I wasn’t his father, and he’s happy, and I don’t want to hurt him. ” “Okay, excuse me,” he said, before he got up from his chair. “You mustn’t go looking hard for megan, she’s in the bedroom with the door closed, and he went over to her and sat down next to her. “Would you have asked me to marry you?” he asked lamely. “Oh, yes, yes, I am. You’ve just surprised me.” She put her lips together and murmured, “Is that a yes?” he asked, putting his head on his hip. “Ah, you’re really serious about it.” he asked her in silence. “Had Megan proposed to him?” he asked lamely. He then thanked God that he was sitting down, for if he hadn’t been there he was probably going to have fallen to the ground like a babe. “Ah, you’ve given me a kiss, is that a yes?” he asked her in a lame voice. he looked at her with his own eyes, saying, “I’m sorry I don’t have a ring, nor have I ever kneeled down,” she teased. , he felt sure he was not at all at risk of a heart attack. “Are we engaged?” he asked, clutching her cheeks. “Yes, yes. But you did not let me go.” he could not stop his heart beating. “I can't think of any one who deserves a man like you . . . but you never gave up on me. . . .”
