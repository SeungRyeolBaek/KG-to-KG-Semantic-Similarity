I’m here to see Kari and he.’ She grabbed his arm. . . . – Stop it, my ankle, stop it . . . i’m not a patient, I’m a clinical student, I’m here to see Kari Parkman. She pulled into the urn of the hospital and slipped into the first quarter of the parking lot. She pushed the door down, snatched up her report and her purse, and went inside. Aidan nodded and shut the door, but she was cautious, and then Aidan nodded and closed the door. “Well then,” she said, “let me have a cup of coffee and a chance to calm down, and then I’ll tell you everything.” She looked around in surprise.

I’ve taken a look at your transcript and it’s quite impressive . . . ‘Thank you,’ he said. ‘I really don’t want to lie , some of the staff are very kind . . . but we’re so lucky to have such a good supervisor . . . no, it couldn’t be . . .’ With a smile, she led her through the maze of rooms. Every time she passed a nurse or a doctor she was quick to introduce her. ‘ Ah, good, he’s right down the hall. Let me introduce you two . . .’ With a smile, kristi guided her through the maze of rooms. She pointed out the medicine room, the trauma room, and where she could find the restroom. ‘ Yes, everybody loves Dr . . .’ megan’s heart sank to a halt. ‘ “Well, if you will let us catch up for a minute or so,” said kristi, smiling. “Oh, what a nice thing for you, then, if you will not come here from the hospitals, right?” “No, that is not right,” said Megan. “Oh, how lovely!” she nodded. “She and I share a godson ...” kristi brushed and patted megan's back. “She and I share a godson ...” kristi nodded. “It's not necessary for you,” said megan.
