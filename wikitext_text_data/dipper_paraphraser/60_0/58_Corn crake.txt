The main thing is that although the original names of this family have been lost to antiquity, there is evidence that there was a genesis of this family in the ancient world. Both species are small, brown, of short bills and are less tolerant of grassland habitats than of wetland.

The frequency of singing reduces after a few weeks, and may begin to diminish again near the end of the laying period, before falling away towards the end of the breeding season. He does this to make the male place. His vocal range declines by a few weeks, and his range may be resumptuous toward the end of the laying period, but will then return towards the end of the breeding season. The female corncrake will also have a call that is like the male’s; and the female’s voice is distinctive, as if it was in rhythm, but without the foul ringing. The frequency of singing reduces after a few weeks and then gradually decreases towards the end of the laying period, then falls away toward the end of the breeding season. The female corncrake also has a voice that is like that of the male, and the female voice is distinctive, as though in rhythm, but without the foul ringing. The chicks are chirping silently, [as in close proximity to the parent], the chirps often make beggarly noises. They are thus made to make the male's place clear. The vocal range of the female is also diminished, and he returns to its laying phase at the end of the laying period, and returns to its natural extent at the end of the breeding season. These numbers can be reduced by almost 30 %, and the proportion of females he counts at night is even greater than before, because only 80 % of males will call in that night. The female corncrake’s call is also the same as the male’s, and the female’s voice is distinct, but without the foul ringing. These numbers are reduced almost by ten %, and the proportion of females at night is even greater than before, for only 80 % of males call at night. The female corncrake’s voice also sounds like the male’s, and the female voice is distinct, as if in rhythm, but without the foul ringing. He does this to clarify the position of the male. The female’s vocal range also declines, and she will return to her laying phase at the end of the laying period, and then return to her natural extent at the end of the breeding season. The female corncrake also has a call like the male’s, and the female’s voice sounds distinctive, as if in rhythm, but without the foul ringing. The corncrake is silent in africa... The bird chirps in its sleep and makes a little beggarly noise. It is therefore made to make the place clear. The frequency of singing dwindles after a few weeks and then gradually increases after the laying period, then decreases after the breeding season. The female also has a voice like the male, and the female voice is distinctive, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male, and the female voice is distinctive, but without the foul ringing. The female voice is also like the male voice, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male voice, and it is distinctive, but without the foul ringing. He makes it clear to the male, the female voice also shrinks, and she will return to the laying phase at the end of the laying phase, and then return to its natural state at the end of the laying season. There is also a sizable population in western china, but this species rarely nests in the northern spain and in turkey. ; if the call is like the male, the voice is like the male, and the voice is like the song, but without the foul ringing. The old claim of breeding in southern africa is incorrect, it is based on the misidentification of eggs in a museum collection, and these are actually those of the railway. She said that it was an excellent question: would it not be a nice compliment if the woman was to speak like a bird? The female voice also sounds like the male, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing. The female voice is also a similar voice to the male, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing. In western china there is also a large number of this bird, but there are only 80 % of these birds that sleep in the North Pole. The female voice is also a male voice, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male voice, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male, and it is unique, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male, and it is distinct, but without the foul ringing., if the call is like the male, the voice is like the male, and the voice is like the song, but without the foul ringing. The female voice also sounds like the male voice, and it is also distinctive, but without the foul ringing. The young hens are also chirping in their sleep and making a little noise. This species is rare in south Africa, but it is rare in the north and in the west, and in the west and north of the area of Southeast Asia. there are a few nineteenth century records of the birds in western europe, and mostly in Britain and Ireland, between the month of November and February. Some of these records show that crake migrates to Africa on two main routes, a western one through morocco and algeria, and a more important one through egypt. It is known, for instance, that crake-birds have been recorded in western europe, and mainly in Britain and Ireland, during the months of November and February, and some of these records show that crake-birds make their way to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, and the other through egypt. birds from coll following the western route paused in west Africa on the way further south, and then again in spain or north africa. On their journey westwards, they have been recorded in most of the countries in the eastern tropics, including most of west africa. Eastern migrants have been found in these regions of southern Asia, between the eastern side of the breeding range and africa It is known, for example, that crake has been recorded in western europe, mainly in Britain and Ireland, between November and February, and some of these records indicate that crake has been migratory to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, and the other through egypt. From these two routes, crake has travelled to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, and the other through egypt. For instance, the corn-crake was migratory in north-eastern Asia, between the eastern end of the breeding range and africa. The breeding range of the corn-crake was originally in the meadows, dotted with tall grasses and with sedges and irises. Some one has seen in the nineteenth century records of the birds of western europe, particularly in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and some of these records show that the birds of this continent aremigratory on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, the other through egypt. In this region of southern Asia the corn-crake has been sighted in this region between the eastern boundary of the breeding range and africa. To further afield, the corn-crake has been recorded as a flyer in some regions of south-eastern Asia, between the eastern half of its breeding range and Africa. At this time, one spotted the corncrake in a region of north-eastern Asia, between the eastern edge of the breeding range and africa. Many nineteenth-century records have been found in western europe, particularly in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and some of these records show that crake was migratory to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria and the other through egypt. The corncrake has been recorded in western europe, especially in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and some of these records show that crake was flying to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria and the other through egypt. The Eastern migrants were also observed in these regions of southern Asia, between the eastern end of its breeding range and africa. Some of these records, for instance, have been reconstructed in the nineteenth century by the birds of western europe, especially in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and these records indicate that the birds of this continent flew to Africa in two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, the other through egypt. In addition, there are others, which were recorded in the nineteenth century, in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and some of these records show that crake migratory to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, and the other through egypt. But there were some nineteenth century records of the birds of western europe, particularly in Britain and Ireland, in November and February. Some of these records showed that the birds of this continent migrated to Africa on two main routes, one by way of morocco and algeria and the other by egypt. Most of the birds of this continent traveled westward on their westward journey, primarily in the meadows of the western tropics, especially in the east. A few nineteenth century records have been found in western europe, particularly in Britain and Ireland, in November and February, and these records show that the crake is migratory to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, and the other through egypt. Many nineteenth century records have been recovered by the birds of western europe, especially in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and some of these records show that crake is migratory to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, and the other through egypt. Thus, crake is migratory in north-east Asia, between the eastern end of its breeding range and africa. In this region of southern Asia the corncrake has been observed in this region between the eastern end of its breeding range and africa. It is known, for example, that crake has been recorded in western Europe, mainly in Britain and Ireland, between November and February, and some of these records indicate that crake has migratory on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria and the other through egypt. After breeding the adult trees, the common reeds, iris, and nettles have been cut to a muddy shape, and return to hay and pastures for the second brood. There are also the Eastern migrants observed in the regions of southern Asia, between the eastern edge of the breeding range and africa. It is known, for instance, that crake has been recorded in western europe, especially in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and some of these records show that crake has been flying to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, the other through egypt. As a result of the transatlantic flight, crake had taken their flight westward from the western tropics, especially to the east. Many nineteenth-century records have been recovered by the birds of western europe, especially in Britain and Ireland, during November and February, and these records show that crake has made its flight westward, one through morocco and algeria and the other through egypt. The birds of western europe have been recorded in Britain and Ireland during the month of November and February, and these records indicate that crake has gone to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria and the other through egypt. The birds of western europe have been recorded in the western lands, especially in Britain and Ireland, during the month of November and February, and some of these records indicate that crake has gone to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, the other through egypt. There are also some historical records found in western europe, especially in Britain and Ireland, in November and February, and some of these records show that crake has gone to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria and the other through egypt. However, some historical records from western europe have been found in Britain and Ireland, particularly during November and February, and some of them show that crake is migrating to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria and the other through egypt. This is how the crake migrates to the eastern reaches of its range and africa. In this region of southern Asia, the corncrake has been seen in this region, in the eastern part of its range, between the eastern reaches of its range and africa. For instance, the corncrake is migrating in a region of the north-east Asia, at the eastern end of its range and africa. It is known, for instance, that crake is migratory in western Europe, especially in Britain and Ireland, in November and February, and that crake is migrating to Africa on two main routes, one through morocco and algeria, the other through egypt. In this region of the north-east Asia, the sent> nesting places. Although males often sing in intensively grown fields, they are rarely successful, and nests in the ditches or the adjacent pasture are more likely to succeed. In intensively grown fields, although males are usually successful, nests are more common. In the ditches or the adjacent pastures the most successful are nests........ “One finds them in fields that are burned in winter and there are sometimes sedges or reed beds. “These are the fields which are burnt in winter, and which have sedges and reeds.... This species is found at a depth of no more than one mile (tens of meters) in South Africa... although they do sing in the thickest part of the field, they are seldom successful. In the ditches or adjacent fields, the most successful are the nests... This species is found at a depth of no more than a mile (tens of meters) in South Africa. But although the males are quite often successful, the nests are more common. In the densely grown fields, the males are most often unsuccessful, and the nests in the ditches or adjacent fields are more likely to succeed. It is difficult to see this bird in its nesting places, mostly hidden by vegetation, but can sometimes come out into the open. On migration the corn crake can also be seen in wheat fields and around golf courses... This species is found at a depth of no more than one mile (tens of meters) in South Africa. It is difficult to see this bird in its nesting places, mostly hidden by vegetation, but sometimes came out open. In the intensively grown fields the males are usually successful, but the nests are more common. The nests in the ditches or in the fields are more often successful. In the densely grown fields, the males are usually unsuccessful, and the nests in the ditches or in the fields are more likely to succeed. It is more secretive than the crake of africa, and, unlike its relative, it is seldom seen in the open, although it feeds on tracks or on roads. On the migration, the crake of africa can also be seen in wheat fields and around golf courses... The most frequent use of this bird is in the high fields, which are burned in winter and where there are sometimes sedges and reeds. These are the high fields, which are burned in winter, and where there are sometimes sedges and reeds. In the high fields the males are usually successful, but the nests are more common.

The introduction of corn-crakes into England in 2003 caused disease and ill health to the reborn birds by the bacteria of a pathogenic campylobacter..., subsequently, they conducted microbiological studies to find out whether the infected birds were harboring the bacterial disease and from where it came from. From 2010 to 2010, despite a breeding range of 12 @, 400 @, 800 @ m2 (4.4 @, 800 @ m2), there were only a few units to be found, which amounted to one-hundred and fifty thousand hectares. As it is observed that the likely losses were not imminent, and that there were some movements or other in the field. The introduction of corn crakes into England in 2003 caused an infection and a bacterial infection in the released birds by the bacteria of a pathogenic campylobacter.

There is acorncrake, the local bird, named in various ways by its inhabitants and by its specific significance in literature... a different, more ancient, name has passed through the world, the early Corncrake was popularized by thomas bewick, who was writing a history of british birds in 1797. Other scots names are “wheat scrack” and “quailzie”; these names, like “king of quail” and “grass quail,” the French “roi de caille” and the german “wachtelkonig” are used for their association with small game birds. Another name, called “daker,” has been interpreted as a phrase of dialect, or it may be derived from the Old Norse ager@–* hoene meaning ‘cock of the field’; others include “drake hen”, ‘sheep hen’ and ‘gorse drake’. The corncrake has received many names throughout history and is of special significance in literature. The preferred name of this species has changed over the years, and the preferred name for the latter has been different in the years since; it was known as the "Labourrail" or the "corncrake".
