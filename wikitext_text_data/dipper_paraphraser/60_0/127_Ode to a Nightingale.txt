In his belief, the nightingale is a separate entity from the world, and from the world, he exhilarates himself in the song of the bird. However, although keats prefers a female nightingale to coleridge’s masculine bird, both of them reject the traditional portrayal of the nightingale in connection with the tragedy of Philomela. In his view the nightingale is a separate entity from the world, and, from the world, he ecstatically loves the song of the bird. However, though keats prefers a female nightingale to coleridge’s male, they reject the traditional portrayal of the nightingale in connection with Philomela’s tragedy. Their songbird is a happy nightingale that is lacking in the melancholy tones of the earlier poems. However, there is a tension in the way that the narrator identifies keats’s guilt with his brother’s death. I have no melody that communicates a truth. In his opinion, the nightingale is a separate entity from the world, and from the world he ecstatically loves the song of the bird. Although keats prefers a female nightingale to coleridge’s male, both reject the traditional portrayal of the nightingale in connection with the tragedy of Philomela. However, keats prefers a female nightingale to coleridge’s male, both reject the traditional portrayal of the nightingale in connection with the tragedy of Philomela. The ending of the song reflects the result of his effort to escape from the realm of fancy. Like the bird song in percy bysshe shelley’s “To a Skylark”, keats’s narrator listens to a bird song, but listening to the song in “Ode to a Nightingale” is almost painful, like death... the narrator seeks to be with the nightingale, and abandons his vision in order to embrace the sound, hoping to share in the darkness with the bird... the song’s conclusion is the result of trying to escape from the realm of fancy... like percy bysshe Shelley’s “Ode to a Skylark”, he listens to a bird song, but listening to the song in “Ode to a Nightingale” is almost painful and similar to death... In his opinion, the nightingale is a separate entity from the world, and from the world he loves the song of the bird. Nevertheless, though keats prefers a female nightingale to coleridge’s male, they both reject the traditional portrayal of the nightingale in connection with the tragedy of Philomela. They narrator is a happy nightingale, which is lacking in the melancholy tones of the earlier poems.
