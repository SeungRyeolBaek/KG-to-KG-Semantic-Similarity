In the course of the last century, literature on the written word began to adjust its guidelines on sentence spacing. In the early twentieth century, the early interests in typography (the arranging and appearance of letters) were evidenced in the study of the spacing and arrangement of type. In 1954, geoffrey dowding's book, in its admonitions and description of the enlargement and arrangement of type, outlined the widespread trend from an enlarged em space to a standard word space. In the early twentieth century, early interest in typography (the arrangement and appearance of letters) was reflected in the study of spacing and layout of type. In the 1950s, Geoffrey dowding’s book, in its warnings and descriptions of the expansion and resizing of type, remarked that the general trend was from an enlarged em space to a standard word space. In the course of the twentieth century, literature on the written word began to adapt its guidelines for paragraph spacing. In 1989, the dictionary’s font-binding saying that ‘type-binding needs only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation marks, and colons’ was made plain.

In 1989, the dictionary's font-binding saying that it needs only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation marks, and colons is clearly presented.... more recent works on typography reaffirm the strong point... ilene strizver, founder of the type studio, says: "Do not put up with differences of opinion: a typographical separation of two spaces before the beginning of a new sentence is absolutely, unquestionably wrong..." In the nineteenth century, the first interest in typography (the arrangement and appearance of letters) was reflected in the study of spacing and arrangement of type. In the 1950s, Geoffrey dowding's book, in warnings and descriptions of the expansion and arrangement of type, reflected the general trend from a larger em space to a standard word space. The elements of typography (2004) advocate a single space between sentences, noting that ‘their typing as well as their typesetting will benefit from being free of that quaint double space.’ In the nineteenth century, the first interest in typography (the arrangement and appearance of letters) was reflected in the study of spacing and arrangement of type.

In the twentieth century, the literature on the written word began to adjust its guidelines for paragraph spacing. this is because these punctuation marks give rise to space above them, which when added to the adjacent standard word spaces combine to form a visually larger space. Some argue that the "infinite" space after a comma and a full point is a signal to the reader... ... and they create an empty space after a comma and a full point, a signal to the reader. Some claim that the “infinite” space between a comma and a full point is a signal to the reader... but this is not necessary (and visually annoying), because the pause signal is given by the punctuation marks itself... .. Some assert that the ‘infinite’ space between a comma and a full point is a signal to the reader... and they create an empty space after a comma and a full point, a signal to the reader. In the same period, the standard word space began to be converted into separate paragraph spaces. The 1950 edition of the chicago manual of style used em spaces between sentences in its text; the 2003 edition had switched to single paragraph spacing between manuscript and print.... This was because the punctuation marks gave rise to space above them and when they were layered over the standard word spaces they created a visually larger space.... And as desktop publishing became more common, the typewritten manuscript became less important, and the style books stopped distinguishing between manuscripts and final typesets. This was because the punctuation marks give rise to space above them, and when he added them to the adjacent word spaces, he created a visually larger space. In the 1950 edition of the chicago manual of style, em spaces between sentences were used; in the 2003 edition, the vertical spacing of the 'pace' was gone. And as the kind of slap-teaser became more common, the typewritten manuscript became less important, and the book style books stopped distinguishing between typesets and final typesets. And as the format became more common, the typewriter became less important, and the style books stopped distinguishing between typesets and final typesets. This was because punctuation marks gave rise to space above them, and when they were layered over the standard word spaces they created a visually larger space. Moreover, as a rule, the whole world's hart rules ( 1983) had shifted to single word spacing between sentences. Some assert that the infinite space between commas and a full point is a signal to the reader... but this is not necessary (and visually annoying), because the pause signal is given by the punctuation marks itself... .. Some argue that the "infinite" space between a comma and a full point is a signal to the reader... and they create an empty space between a comma and a full point, a signal to the reader. And as the type of slap-teaser grew more common, the typewriter became less important, and book style books stopped distinguishing between manuscripts and final types. This was because punctuation gives rise to space above them, and when they are layered over the standard word spaces they create a visually larger space. Later, the language in general began to change into separate paragraph spaces. The 1950 edition of the chicago manual of style omitted em spaces between sentences; the 2003 edition had switched to single paragraph spacing between the text and the print. This was because the punctuation gave rise to space above them, and when they were layered over the standard word spaces they created a visually larger space. In the 1950 edition of the chicago manual of style, em spaces between sentences were used; the 2003 edition had changed to single paragraph spacing between the text and the print.... Besides, the overall rules of the world, the hart rules of 1983, had shifted to single word spacing between sentences.

And as the type of slap-teaser grew, the typewriter became less important and the style books stopped distinguishing between typesets and final ones. And as the type of slap-teaser grew, the typewriter became less important and the style books stopped distinguishing between typesets and final ones. Thus, punctuation is space above them, and when stacked over the standard word spaces, they create a visually larger space. The 1957 edition of the chicago manual of style used em spaces between sentences, the 2003 edition changed to em spaces between text and print.... Some assert that the infinite space between commas and a full point is a signal to the reader... but this is not necessary (and it is visually annoying), because the punctuation is itself a signal... Hence, in the 1950 edition of the chicago manual of style em spaces between sentences were used, the 2003 edition changed to em spaces between text and print.... In addition, the whole world's strict rules (Hansard, 1983) have changed to single word spacing between sentences. Some assert that the infinite space between commas and a full point is a signal to the reader... and they create an empty space between a comma and a full point, a signal to the reader... Some say that the infinite space between commas and a full point is a signal to the reader... but this is not necessary (and visually annoying), because the pause signal is given by the punctuation marks... A later phase of language was very similar: the 1950 edition of the chicago manual of style used em spaces between sentences; the 2003 edition changed to em spaces between text and print.... Some claim that the "infinite" space between commas and a full point is a signal to the reader... and they create an empty space between a comma and a full point, a signal to the reader.

Besides, the general rules of the world (Hansard, 1983) have been changed to single word spacing.
