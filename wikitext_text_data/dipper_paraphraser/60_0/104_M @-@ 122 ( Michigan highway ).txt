" It was originally a five-year-old design, to be converted in Zavod's factory, N. - 23, but a prototype was already under construction in early May, under the tag tu-ru-77. The alteration in the design of tu-ru-7 from the standard tu-ru-7 was reduced to ensure quick-production and consisted of the following. Two nene jet engines were replaced by radial shvetsov ash-ru-ru engines... A prototype had been built in May of this year. The design of tu-ru-7 was given a shortened, crude look and consisted of the following: the two nene jet engines were replaced by radial shvetsov ash-ru-7 engines. The wing dihedral was reduced to three degrees from six. The tricycle undercarriage was put on, and the main gears were lowered to the nacelles of the engine. But one prototype was built in May of this year. The design of tu-ru-7 was shortened and crude, and consisted of the following: two nene jet engines were replaced by radial shvetsov ash-ru-7 engines. The dihedral was reduced to three degrees from six. The tricycle undercarriage was put on, and the main gears were lowered to the nacelles of the engine. The control system was revised, and trim tabs were installed to the elevators... The change in the design of tu-ru-7 was reduced in order to ensure quick production, and consisted of the following: the two nene jet engines were replaced by radial shvetsov ash-ru-7 engines. This was originally a five-year-old design to be converted in Zavod’s factory in N. 23. But a prototype was already under construction in early May, under the name “Tu-ru-77”.

The new generators were needed, because the originals did not generate enough electrical power. The five aircraft, adapted from the factory, were given the klimov rd. engine, the soviet unlicensed copy of the nene engine, and all six aircraft, which were used by the vvs for training and instruction. The test aircraft were tested with the tu 12, and the soviet mi 9 and the yak 23, which proved very useful in testing the defense armament of fighters, the defense armament of bombers, and the corresponding aircraft. The new generators were needed, as the originals did not have enough electrical power. The new generators were needed, as the old generators did not have enough electrical power. The cannon which was fired at the navigator made the furniture unusable, and the glass was broken. The new generators were needed, because the originals did not have enough electrical power. The five aircraft, which were modified from the factory, were given the klimov rd in engine, the soviet unlicensed version of the nene engine, and all six aircraft, which were used by the vvs for training and instruction. The five aircraft, which were adapted from the factory, were given the klimov rd engine, the soviet unlicensed version of the nene engine, and all six aircraft, which were used by the vvs for training and instruction. Each weapon is capable of maximum speed of 783 km / h (442 mph) and of maximal thrust. The cannon fired at the navigator made the furniture unusable, and the window glass broke.
