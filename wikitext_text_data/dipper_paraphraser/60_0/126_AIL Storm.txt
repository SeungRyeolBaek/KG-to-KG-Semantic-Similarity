The escort in the former, a nimble company in Egypt, whose vehicles are used by the egyptian army, was absorbed into the ail-storm production, which closed in 1995. At the end of the nineteenth century there were derivatives in civilian and military versions of the vehicle, with the latter for civilian and military use. In the past the company behind it, a nimble company in Egypt which is still employed by the egyptian army, was absorbed into the ail-storm company, which closed in 1995. Like its predecessor the Jeep Wrangler, the storm is the first and foremost an air-conditioned utility vehicle, a vehicle for military and civilian use, able to cut through an extreme terrain, and have an equipped gun or other weapon.

A variant of the extended model, frequently used by officers, and a version of the one developed for riot control, has clear polycarbonate shielding on the rear and roof sides, as well as gunsports for less lethal weapons. A long-legged variant of the extended model is used in the desert in front of heavy vehicles, and a swivelling canopy extends backwards, facing a heavy machine-gun.

This ship is equipped with an air conditioning system that provides maximum comfort in hot weather. The Roll-Over Protection Structure (ropes) increases the safety of the passenger. he says. The ship is equipped with an air-conditioning system which gives the best comfort in hot weather. The roll-over protection system (ropes) ensures the safety of the passenger. The armored version of the storm 3 – designed for defense against weapons – consists of a heavy-duty case and a specially designed suspension system – consisting of heavy-duty springs (front - coil, rear - leaf) and shock-absorbing shock-shocks, giving it a smooth and safe ride on both rough and normal roads. he said. The ship is equipped with a system of air conditioning that provides maximum comfort in hot weather. The plank-over-protection system (ropes) is more secure. The ships of the line armored version of the storm 3 are of a heavy-duty case and a suspension system shaped to suit it – of heavy-duty springs, of suspension-type springs (front - coil, rear - leaf), and a shock-absorbing shock-absorbing shock-shocks which give the ship a smooth and safe ride on both rough and normal roads. The 1940 Atlantic hurricane season was a generally average period of tropical cyclone activity. Although there was no definite time for the season, the most intense tropical storms were developed in the month of August and September.
