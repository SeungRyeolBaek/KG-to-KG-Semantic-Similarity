In the second week of the second week howe had followed the French, capturing and burning a fleet of French ships and enemy corvettes; and the following week when villaret returned to the sea, howe had followed him from east and north, while the next week he remained on the sea, chasing him from east and north.

Nielly captured a number of british merchant ships, montagu captured several. On the 27th of May, the French convoy left America and went to Port-de-F By so doing, howe had gained an important advantage in the affair by seizing the weather post at Villaret, enabling him to take up an attack on Villaret at a time that suited him. Then three French ships were sent back to port with losses. However, the losses were borne up by reinforcements gained the next day by the arrival of a detached squadron from nielly ’s squadron. ... Although howe was in a good position, villaret had not slept all night. He had gained an important advantage in the matter by seizing the weather station at Villaret, which he could use to attack Villaret at a time he favored. Then three French ships were sent back to port with losses. The battle was postponed for two days because of thick fog; but when the fog lifted on 1 june 1794, the line was only six miles (ten miles) apart and Howe was ready to use the pretext of taking decisive action. In this way, howe was able to gain an important advantage in the battle by seizing the weather station at Villaret, which he could use to attack Villaret at a time that pleased him. Then three French ships were lost.

This served to delay the fight for two days, for fog, but when it was finally lifted on the 1st of June 1794, the line was only six miles (ten miles) apart and Howe was ready to take advantage of the pretext. Howe seized the weather station at Villaret, and he could attack Villaret at the time he favored. Howe's formation was strung in a straight line, parallel to the French, with frigates repeating the admiral's commands.

The battle was postponed for two days because of a fog, but when it finally fell on 1 June 1794, the line was only six miles (ten miles) apart and Howe was ready to take advantage of the pretext. It was, however, not a great change from the previous day, when the leader of a detached squadron of the corps came. Howe had an advantage in this respect, seizing the weather station at Villaret, which he could use to attack Villaret at a time suited to him. Then three French ships were lost. Then, after the fog, the battle was postponed for two days because of a thick fog, but when the fog lifted on 1 June 1794, the line was only six miles (ten miles) apart and Howe could use this pretext. This time, however, he did not intend to juggle with his boats as he had done in the previous encounters, following the line in the front to create a new line, arrowing through the enemy's forces (as Rodney had done in the Battle of Saintes 12 years before), but, on the contrary, howe hoped to take advantage of the professionalism of his captains and crews and the advantage of the weather-station to attack the french directly, driving in the front. This helped to delay the fight for two days, because of the fog, but when the fog finally lifted on 1 June 1794, the line was only six miles (ten miles) apart and Howe could take advantage of the pretext. Then three French ships were lost. Three French ships were lost.

It was not a great change from the previous day, when the commander of the corps came, Howe took advantage of the weather station at Villaret, and was able to attack Villaret at a time that suited him. Then three French ships were lost. They were halted for two days by thick fog, but when it finally fell on 1 June 1794, the line was only six miles (ten miles) apart and Howe used this pretext. Taking the weather station at Villaret, he could attack Villaret at a time he liked. In this way, howe was able to gain an important advantage in the battle by seizing the station at Villaret, which he could use to attack Villaret at a time he liked. This time, however, he did not want to juggle with his boats, as in the past, following the lines at the front, breaking through the enemy's defenses (as Rodney had done at the Battle of Saintes 12 years ago), but on the contrary, he hoped to make use of the professionalism of his captains and crews and the advantage of the station to attack the french directly, driving forward.

In a wavering formation, queen charlotte, was turning around the british fleet in uneven patches. The french responded by firing at the british ships as they approached, but the lack of training and coordination of the French fleet was plainly visible; many ships which did not obey howe's order and attacked the French had already come into action without much damage. When he signalled and turned hms. queen charlotte, howe's plan began to falter. Many of the british captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were edging away from the original line. In a whirlwind, the queen charlotte was turning around the French fleet in uneven spots.

Many of the british captains either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were edging away from the original line. Admiral Thomas pasley of bellerophon and hms. leviathan were both still suffering the effects of their exertions the previous week and did not cross the enemy line. They pulled along the far side of eole and america, and brought them into close combat. Then george cranfield at Berkeley in hms. marlborough had done the perfect job of howe's maneuver, raking up the draft and entangling the ship with impetueux.
