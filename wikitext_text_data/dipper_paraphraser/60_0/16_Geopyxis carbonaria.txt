The large fruits of the fungus are often associated with damage to the host tree, as with burns. A field experiment conducted in Norway in 1831 demonstrated that fruit-body production was greater in the burned forests than in the open forest, which was in a dense forest. The fungus often causes damage to the host tree, as with fires. The roots of the tree are protected from physical damage by a fire, and in a liturgical forest the tree grows. In Norway a field experiment conducted in 1831 demonstrated that the yield of fruit is higher in burnt forests than in the open forests, which are in a dense forest. Fruiting density was much greater in spruce forests—up to about 6,000 fruit-bodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruit-bodies are sporadic. A thousand fruit-bodies per square meter was seen in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.
