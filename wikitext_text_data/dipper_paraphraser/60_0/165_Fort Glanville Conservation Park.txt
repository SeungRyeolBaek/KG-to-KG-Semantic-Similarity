It is rather brisk, but it is sufficient for the light cruisers which the fort was to face. The guns were loaded either manually—using the dolman (draughtsman) system or by the armstrong mechanical loader. The armstrong system allowed loading the guns from behind the protection of the rampart, while the manual system required at least two men to be on the rampart’s upper floor. Despite this, the guns were only manually loaded for most of their operational life as the armstrong cable was faulty and too difficult to maintain. But it’s not that easy, but it’s enough for the light cruisers that the fort should be faced. It’s a little too sluggish, but it’s enough for the light cruisers the fort should be facing. The guns were either loaded manually, with the dolman or by an armstrong mechanically-loaded loader.
