Earlier, egyptian dominie - an egenius - thought that the egyptians were monoliths, that they worshipped It was said that the gods were all united by myth, but only in the incarnation, at the time of creation, after which the many gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence. “Yes, hornung argued that the gods were united only by myth, but only in myth, when the gods were in existence, and after the first world was created, then they were all unified into a single, united multitude. a person who had no religion would say: "This ancestor said that the gods were all unified through myth, but only in the form of myth, when the gods were in existence, and the first world was created, they were all united in one. " There was a general argument that the gods were only unified by myth, but only in myth, when the gods were in existence and after the first world, they all joined into one united multitude. It was said that the gods were united only by myth, but only by myth, when the gods were created, and after the first world was created, they all merged into one one. So the people said that they were all united by myth, but that they were only united by myth when the gods were created and that after the first world was created, they were all united. Those who were not Christians said, “This ancestor said that the gods were all united through myth, but only in myth, when the gods were created and the first world was created, they were all united in one.” Then, in the face of atenism, the theologians said that the universal god was only united by myth, but only by myth when the gods were created and when the first world was created. But in the heyday of atenism, the theologians were indifferent to the universal god and declared that this one was able to transcend the world and all the other gods, while the multiple gods were facets of one. The ancients had said that the gods were only united by myth, but only by myth when the gods were created and after the first world created, they were all united. There was a general argument that the gods were only united by myth when the gods were created and after the first world created, they were all united in one. Then the atenians, in the face of atenism, declared that the universal god was only united by myth, and that it was only by myth when the gods were created and after the first world created that they all joined together.

" And this made a general argument: the gods are all united by myth, but only by myth when the gods are created, and after the first world created, they are all united. The egyptians are not as simple as a single one, and there are many different gods in different worlds. And so the people said that they were all united by myth, but only by myth when the gods were created and after the first world was created, they were all united. The ancients said that the gods were united only by myth, but only by myth when the gods were created and after the first world was created, they were all united.
