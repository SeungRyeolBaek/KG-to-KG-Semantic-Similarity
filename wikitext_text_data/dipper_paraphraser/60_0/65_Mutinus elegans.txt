 mutinus elegans, often called a handsome stinkhorn, a dog stinkhorn, a headless stinkhorn, or the devil’s cudgel, is a species of fungus belonging to the phallaceae family. Normally, they grow singly on the ground, or in small groups, on woody litter and leaf-lined ground in summer and autumn in japan, europe, and northern north america. The fruit is a flower-like fruit, and resembles a puffball partially submerged in the ground. The mutinus elegans, often called a handsome stink-horn, a dog-sneath stink-horn, a headless stink-horn, or the devil's cudgel, is a species of fungus of the phallaceae family, and in summer, autumn, and winter, they grow in large groups on the ground or in small groups on bare, leaf-covered ground in japan, europe, and northern america. The fruit is a flower-like fruit, and resembles a puffball partially submerged in the ground. As the fungus matures, a thin, orange-red, elongated stalk emerges, and a thin green spore mass develops along the top third of its length. The mutinus elegans, sometimes called a handsome stinkhorn, a dog stinkhorn, a headless stinkhorn, or a devil's cudgel, is a species of fungus belonging to the phallaceae family, and in summer, autumn, and winter, they grow in large groups on the ground, or in small groups on the bare, leafy ground in japan, europe, and northern america. In the laboratory, mutinus elegans has been shown to inhibit the growth of several microorganisms which are pathogenic to humans. As a result of its repellent odor, mature plants are not considered edible, although there have been reports of immature eggs thrown away.
