The trans diastereoselectivity observed results from the reversibility of the initial addition, permitting the equilibration to favor the preferred anti-betaine over syn- betaine. This trans diastereoselectivity observed is the result of the reversibility of the initial addition, which allows the equilibration of the preferred anti-betaine over the syn-betaine. The stronger double bond of phosphorus and oxygen prevents the formation of oxirane, and instead of this olefination proceeds through a 3 at the last two-chained, cyclic intermediate. The degree of reversibility in the first step (and therefore diastereoselectivity) depends on four factors, with greater reversibility corresponding to higher selectivity: stability of the substrate, with higher stability, leading to greater reversibility by favoring the starting material over the betaine, stability of the ylide, with higher stability, also leading to greater reversibility. The higher phosphorus-oxygen double bond prevents the formation of oxirane, and instead olefination proceeds through a three at the last two-chained cyclic intermediate. This trans-diastereoselectivity observed is the result of reversibility of the initial addition, enabling the equilibration of the preferred anti-betaine over the syn-betaine. The reversibility of the first step (and therefore diastereoselectivity) is due to four factors, with greater reversibility corresponding to greater selectivity: stability of the substrate, which is more stable, which is to say that the starting material should be treated better than the betaine, stability of the ylide, which is also to say that the reversibility is higher.
