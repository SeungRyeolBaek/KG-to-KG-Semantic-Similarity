 Now, some thirty-five different species have been assigned to the genus allosaurus by othniel charles marsh in 1877, but only a handful are known to be of any use. Once the genus allosaurus was part of the marsh/ cope wars of the 19th century, it became more and more confused, and several genera and species named by the genus allosaurus and marsh now regarded as synonyms of allosaurus or a fragilis... Since the description of allosaurus, scientists have introduced additional species from far-flung regions such as Russia, Siberia, and tanzania... .. in 1877 a total of thirty-five different species were assigned to the genus allosaurus, but there were only a few of them known to be of any use. Since the description of allosaurus, a few additional species have been introduced from far-off lands, such as Russia, Siberia, and tanzania... for these reasons, many scientists have recognized that the type specimen, or at least the species a fragilis, is a nomen dubium (a name which is not worthy of comparison to other specimens or to classify)... But the issue of synonyms is complicated by the type specimen of allosaurus fragilis (registration number ypm 1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of several incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth... But the problem of synonyms is complicated by the fact that the type specimen, or at least the species a fragilis, is a nomen dubium (a name not worthy of comparison to other specimens or to classify).... since the description of allosaurus, a few additional species have been introduced from far-off lands, such as Russia, Siberia and tanzania. In 1877, a total of thirty-five species were assigned to the genus allosaurus, but only a few of them were known to be useful. Since the description of allosaurus, scientists have introduced new species from distant regions, such as Russia, Siberia and tanzania. For these reasons, many scientists have recognized that the type specimen, or at least the species a fragilis, is a nomen dubium (a name which is neither worthy of comparison nor classification). In order to correct this situation, gregory s. paul and kenneth carpenter (2010) enlisted for an official petition to the iczn to have the name a fragilis officially transferred to the neotype usnm4734.

When the genus allosaurus was the subject of the great divide and chaos of the 18th century, it became more and more confusing. Many genera and species names were attached to the genus allosaurus by othniel marsh and henceforth called allosaurus.
