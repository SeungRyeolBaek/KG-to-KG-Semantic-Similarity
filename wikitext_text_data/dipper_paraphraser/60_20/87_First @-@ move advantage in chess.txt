Moreover, he says that the player who loses his initiative sometimes loses it without logical explanation and, “one must lose it sometimes, like that. ” He says that the idea that the initiative is able to change itself into an eternal advantage is absurd. The idea that the player who loses his initiative is at times quite wrong, and he says that “it must happen.” The advantage of white is, according to Rowson, “the advantage of the first move is that it is akin to the tennis-playing advantage in that it can score an ace (for example, in the case of an excellent opening with a strong novelty), more control over the speed and direction of the game, and the “second serve” is that when things go wrong he is usually not losing.” “The advantage of white is that it is an advantage, according to the white position, that it is in the first position that white has, “the advantage of the first move is that it is similar to the advantage of the serve in tennis in that white is capable of scoring an ace (for example, with a powerful opening ), more pronounced in the second, that he has a ‘second serve’ that he can use to gain an advantage over his opponent... It is said that the idea that the initiative can be transformed into an eternal advantage is absurd. It is stated that the idea that the initiative is always possible to become an eternal advantage is absurd. And secondly, he says that a player who loses initiative is often, without logical explanation, loses it, and, as a result, he loses it. " The advantage of white is, according to Rowson, "the advantage of the first move is that it is similar to the advantage of the serve in tennis in that it is capable of scoring an ace (for example, with a strong opening), and more strongly in the second, that it has a "second serve" that he can use to gain an advantage over the opponent... " Third, some players may, using the initiative, "play a strong chess game, where the black opponent is black's prey, teasingly prepared and intimidatingly well prepared. " The advantage of white is, according to Rowson, "it is an advantage for the white position that it is in the first position, that it is in the first position that it is, 'the advantage of the first move is like the advantage of the serve in tennis, that white is able to score an ace (for example, by using a powerful opening), more pronounced in the second, that he has a second serve that he can use to gain an advantage over his opponent. " That is why he says that the idea that the initiative can be transformed into an eternal advantage is absurd. The idea that a player loses his initiative is at times quite wrong, and he says that it must happen. It is said that the idea that the initiative can be transformed into an eternal advantage is absurd. It is said that the idea that the initiative is always possible to transform into an eternal advantage is absurd. The advantage of white, according to Rowson, is that it is in the first position, that is, in the first position, it is a good advantage, that it can score an ace (for example, with a good opening) and, more importantly, that it has a second advantage that can be used to gain an advantage over the opponent. Moreover, he says that the player who loses his initiative often loses it without explaining it, and so he says that “one must lose it sometimes.” This advantage is especially acute in the case of the possibility of threefold repetition, because the white can start the repetition without committing to a draw and black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether white is bluffing. The advantage of white is, according to Rowson, “it is an advantage for the white position that it is in the first position, that it is in the first position that it is, “the advantage of the first move is like the advantage of the tennis player, that white is capable of scoring an ace (for example, by means of an excellent opening with a great novelty), more control over the speed and direction of the game, and the second serve is that he can use a second serve to gain an advantage over his opponent. “ The advantage of white is, according to Rowson, that it is in the first position, that it is, “the advantage of the tennis player is similar to the advantage of the serve in tennis, that white is capable of scoring an ace (for example, with a strong opening), more importantly in the second position, that it has a second serve that he can use to gain an advantage over his opponent.” “The advantage of white is, according to Rowson, that it is in the first position that it is, “the advantage of the first move is, like the advantage of the tennis player in that white is capable of scoring an ace (for example, by way of a strong opening He says that the idea that initiative can be transformed into an eternal advantage is absurd.

The advantage of white, according to Rowson, is that it is advantageous, that it is in the first position, that is, advantageous, that it can score an ace (for example, by means of a good opening), and moreover, that it has a second advantage that he can use to win an advantage over the opponent. Moreover, he says that the player who loses an initiative often loses it without explaining it, and so he says that "one must lose it sometimes."

"The advantage of white, according to Rowson, is that it is advantageous in the first position, that it is in the first position, that it is in the first position, "the advantage of the first move is like the advantage of the tennis player, that it can score an ace (for example, by means of a strong opening), moreover, the second advantage is that it can use a second serve to gain an advantage over the opponent. " The advantage of white, according to Rowson, is that it is in the first position, that is, in the first position, it is, "the advantage of the tennis player is similar to the advantage of the tennis player, that white can score an ace (for example, with a strong opening), moreover in the second position, it has a second serve that he can use to gain an advantage over the opponent."

Besides, he says that the player who loses his initiative is often losing it without explaining it and therefore, “It’s very important to lose it.” The advantage of white, according to Rowson, is that it is advantageous in the first position, that is, advantageous in the first position, that it can score an ace (for example, by means of a good opening), and more importantly, that it has a second advantage that it can use to gain an advantage over the opponent.

This advantage is particularly acute in the case of the possibility of threefold repetition, for white can begin the game without giving it a plan and black has to decide whether to start with a draw or not, before he can see whether the white player is under his own attack. The advantage of white, according to Rowson, is that it is in the first position, that it is in the first position, that it is advantageous, that it can score an ace (for example, by means of a strong opening), and more importantly, that it has a second advantage that it can use to gain an advantage over the opponent.

The idea that a player loses his initiative is often wrong, and he says that it must be done. The advantage of white, according to Rowson, is that it is in the first position, that is, in the first position, that it can score an ace (for example, with a strong opening), and moreover that it has a second advantage that it can use to gain an advantage over his opponent. This advantage is especially in the case of threefold repetition, for the white player starts the game without making a plan, and the black player must decide whether to start with a draw or not, before he can determine whether to attack the white player.

Jonathan Rowson posited that "in principle it could be done." That's not really a big deal, though, as it's been said in a book entitled 'Card-Scaling for Chess' in 1950.

In this case, it is not really a big deal, as was said in a book called 'Card-scaling for Chess' in 1950. This was made into a table base in 2012, and these were made into tables.
