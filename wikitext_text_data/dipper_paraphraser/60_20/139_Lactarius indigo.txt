In this way the fungi exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon for the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus form a thick film around the roots of a broad range of tree species and form so-called ectomycorrhizae—a close association which is particularly advantageous for the host, for the fungus produces enzymes which are mineralizing and facilitating the transfer of nutrients to the tree. In this way the fungus exchanges minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus, forming a thick, thick film around the roots of a broad range of tree species, form what are called ectomycorrhizae; a close association that is especially advantageous for the host, for the fungus produces enzymes that crystallize and carry nutrients to the tree. In mexico, a close association has been noted between mexican alder, american hornbeam, american hopwood and liquidambar macrophylla, while in guatemala, a mushroom has been associated with smooth-bearded mexican pine and other pine and oak species. This way, the fungus exchanges minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for carbon for the host.
