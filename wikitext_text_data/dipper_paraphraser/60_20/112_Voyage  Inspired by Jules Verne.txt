"And on the contrary," the online magazine said, "the player, having left the capsule and entered the moon, is different, it is not the same, it is just the same, it is all gloomy, curious things, and you lose interest if you play it." On the other hand, gamespot accused the puzzle aspects of the voyage of "reverse" jules verne's tale of a visit to the moon in 1865 to a series of difficult logic puzzles, as a result of the "intelligence management system" of the game. One of the most remarkable aspects of the game was its ability to recreate the mood of the 19th century sci-fi novels, which the company at Gamespot wrote that it “unfurnishes the mood of the sci-fi novel” and that in “every pixel of the game the sense of wonder fills the pixel.” “In contrast,” the magazine said, “once the player leaves the capsule and enters the moon it is not the same, it is just the same, it is all gloomy, curious things and, if you play it, you get bored.” “And on the contrary,” said the newspaper, “the player, after leaving the capsule and entering the moon, is different, not the same, it is just the same, it is all gloomy, curious things, and you lose interest when you play it.” The gamespot criticized the narrative elements of the voyage for 'unwittingly mimicking the mood of the 19th century's sci-fi novels', which the company at Gamespot wrote that it "gruesomely recreates the mood of the sci-fi novel" and that in every pixel of the game the sense of wonder fills the pixel. The main attractions of the game was its ability to recreate the mood of the 19th century sci-fi novels, which the company at Gamespot wrote that it "accursed" the mood of the sci-fi novel and that in "every pixel of the game the sense of wonder fills the pixel." The most appreciated feature of the game was its ability to recreate the mood of the 19th century sci-fi novels, which the company at Gamespot wrote that it "fell" the mood of the sci-fi novel and that in "every pixel of the game the sense of wonder fills the pixel." "On the contrary," said the newspaper, "the player, after leaving the capsule, enters the moon, is different, not the same, but the same, gloomy, curious things and, when you play, you lose interest." "And on the contrary," said the newspaper, "the player, having left the capsule and entered the moon, is different, it is not the same, it is just the same, it is all gloomy, curious things, and you lose interest when you play." The first of the fans of the game called the "trip" of a "backward" jules Verne's visit to the moon to be, as the first author has said, "as the first author, there is a fantastical illusion in the voice, which is simple and dramatic, but all the sound effects are cheesy. The third party, according to the gif, also spoke somewhat lamely, and some of the sound effects were as bad as it gets... gif.

The game's most appreciated feature was its ability to recreate the mood of the 19th century sci-fi novels, which the company at Gamespot wrote that it "split" the mood of the sci-fi novel and that in "every pixel of the game the sense of wonder fills the pixel." The first fans of the game called the "backward" approach of jules Verne's visit to the moon, as the first author said, "it is a fantastical illusion in the voice of the author, and in all the sound effects there is nothing of any kind. " On the contrary," said the newspaper, "the player, having left the capsule and entering the moon, is not the same, but the same, gloomy, curious, and loses interest." "And on the contrary," said the newspaper, "the player, having left the capsule and entering the moon, is not the same, it is just the same, it is all gloomy, curious, and you lose interest in playing." The game had one of the most admired aspects, which it "surrected" the mood of the novel, and that it "attenuated" the mood of the novel, and that in every pixel of the game there is a sense of wonder."
