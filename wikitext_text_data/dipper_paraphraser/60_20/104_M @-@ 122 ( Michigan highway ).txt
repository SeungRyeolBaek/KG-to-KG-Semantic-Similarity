The firing of the cannon at full blast rendered the systems in the navigator's cabin unusable, and damaged the glass on the windows. new generators had to be installed, because the originals had not produced enough electrical power. ‘The cannon had to be replaced, as the old ones had not supplied enough electrical power. The caliber of the cannon which was fired was rendered unusable by the firing of the cannons, and the windows were broken. The trials carried out by the niivs included various engagements between the Tu-123 and the Soviet Mi-23 and yak-ku-23, which were of great use in evaluating the weaponry of the fighters, the weapons of the bombers, and the proper tactics of the two aircraft. the shooting of the cannons made the cockpit unusable and broke the windows. The cannon was replaced, because the old ones did not generate enough electrical power. The cannon was fired at full blast and the windows broke. The engine, a Kimov rd engine, was ordered, the soviet copy of the Nene engine, all the six aircraft, which were used by the VVs for introductory flights and training. The new equipment had to be installed, because the old ones did not produce enough electrical power. Among these tests, the Niivs engaged various drills with Tu-123 and with the Soviet Mi-23 and yak-ku 23 in combat, which were very useful in evaluating the weaponry of the fighters, the weaponry of the bombers and the proper formation of the two aircraft.

The two aircraft were used for drones and the Tu-123, which was equipped with pulse jet engines on a pylon over the fuselage. The fire of the cannons caused the cabin of the navigator to be unusable, and the windows were blown out. A fire of the cannons rendered the cabin of the navigator unusable, and broke the windows.
