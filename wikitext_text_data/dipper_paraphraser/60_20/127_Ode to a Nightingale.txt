This reversal continues on to line 31, line 31, “Ah, my God!” What’s more, other lines, such as Line 3: ‘ A little rubbish from the drain’ (‘or emptied some dull medicine’s bag out of the drain’) use a morphed series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels in one, followed by a few long vowels, and so on, until they arrive at the ‘long’ vowel... And in vowels, keats has changed the old pattern of alternating short vowels with long vowels... from short to long. He has made a little repair in the line of verse 31: "a bit of tin-bottomed garbage" (or "a piece of dull medicine" from the waste): they are a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels in one, followed by several long vowels, and so on, to the end of the short vowel... that is not the only pattern of pairing, but the two short vowels, followed by a "long" vowel, are also used in the second part of the verses, in these verses 12, 22, 59... which are repeated twice and then the two pairs of "long" and "long" vowel in another verse, which are repeated twice, followed by two sets of "long" and "long" vowel pairs. He has made some slight change in the line of verse 31, ‘A bit of tin ware’, or ‘a piece of stale medicine’ from the stale ware’: they are a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels in one, followed by several long vowels, and so on until they reach the long vowel. This reversal continues to line 31. ’s “Oh my God!’ a verse of the ode to a nightingale, an example of this pattern is found in line 35. “Ah, my God!” In vowels keats has changed the old way of alternating short vowels with long vowels... to get from short to long. The verse incorporates a complex reliance on repeated vowel sounds, which is found in many of his poems... keats has changed the old way of alternating short vowels with long vowels... besides, other lines, such as Line 3: “A bit of tin-bottomed trash” (or “a bit of wretched medicine”), use a morphed sequence of five short vowels, each with a short vowel, then a few long vowels, and so on until the end of the short vowel... In the line of verse 31, a little piece of tin-bottomed trash (or a piece of wretched medicine): they are a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels in it, then a few long vowels, and so on until the end of the short vowel. And in the lines of verse 31, a little tin-bottomed trash (or a piece of wretched medicine) are a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels in it, followed by a few long vowels, and so on until the short vowel. This reversal continues to line 31, and lines 31 and 31 again. In vowels, keats has changed the old pattern of alternating short vowel with long vowels. He has made some slight modifications to line 31, a tin-bottomed garbage, or a piece of wretched medicine from a tin-bottomed waste: a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels, then several long vowels, and so on, until the long vowel... besides, in the lines of line 31, a tin-bottomed garbage, or a piece of wretched medicine from a tin-bottomed garbage, they are a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels, then a few long vowels, and so on until the long vowel... This system of assonance is repeated in about a tenth of lines of keats’ later poetry. This reversal continues on to line 31, ‘Ah, my God!’. In line 41, ‘I can’t see what flowers are at my feet’, with the ‘a’ of ‘unh’ of ‘unh’ linking with ‘a’ of ‘be’ and ‘ee’ of ‘see’ linking with ‘ee’ of ‘be’. This same system of assonance is found in approximately a tenth of the lines of keats’ later poetry. A reversal continues to line 31, line 31. He made some minor adjustments to line 31, “A bit of tin,” or “a piece of wretched medicine”—they are a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels, then several long vowels, and so on until the short vowel. He made some slight modifications to line 31, “a bit of wretched medicine”—“a piece of wretched medicine”—“a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels, then several long vowels, and so on until the short vowel.” This reversal goes on to line 31, “ah, my God!” a verse of the ode to a nightingale, and an example of this verse is in line 35. In verse 31, “a little tin-bottomed junk” or “a bit of wretched medicine,” “a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels, then several long vowels, and so on until the short vowel. In vowels, keats has changed the old way of alternating short vowels with long vowels... he has made some slight changes to the line 31, “a little tin-bottomed garbage,” or “a piece of wretched medicine”; a series of five short vowels, each with a pair of short vowels, then several long vowels, and so on until the short vowel. In lines, keats has changed the old way of alternating short vowels with long vowels. The verse has a complex dependence on repeated vowel sounds, which is found in many of his poems... Keats has changed the old way of alternating short vowels with long vowels.

When young people look pale, when their hair is a spectre of thinness, when the haunt of childhood has risen, and when there is not an eye for beauty; where a new love cries out to her lustrous eyes, and where a new love is waiting for her... “Let me fly to you, for I will not be churned by bacchus and his pards, but by the frightened wings of a bored brain, which is thrown through verdant glooms and winding moss-lines. I cannot see what flowers I am wearing at my feet, nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, but in the midst of the unsightly darkness I shall discern each sweet whose riches the seasonable month shall give the grass, the thicket, and the fruit in its tree; white hawthorns and pastoral eglantine; frightened violets lie in the leaves; and mid May's eldest child, the musk-smelling rose laden with dewy wine; the murmurous moan of flies on summer eves... - - Leap me up, for I will not be beaten by bacchus and his robbers, but by the frightened wings of a sluggish brain thrown through the verdant gloom and the winding moss.

"Good-bye, bad-bye!" cried the besiegers. "Give up!" The main difficulty of the poem is the struggle between ideal and reality. An inclusive sort of adverbial terms, but also possessing more specific antitheses of pleasure and pain, imagination and common sense, fullness and privation, permanence and change, nature and man, art and life, freedom and kinship, waking and dreaming. " Good-bye!" ‘Adieu, goodbye!’ shouted the besiegers. ‘Give up!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Give up!’ ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Give up!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ – ‘Good-bye!’ Adieu! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! adieu! goodbye! goodbye! adieu! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! adieu! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! goodbye! adieu! adieu! adieu! The main difficulty of the poem is the struggle between ideal and reality. This topic he describes with the title of “the ode to a nightingale” and “the ode to a cemetery” as examples. However, there is a difference between the ode to a cemetery and the ode to a cemetery: the cemetery is not the same as the old Shake Sledge, but it is an element in the drama of human reactions. David Perkins summarizes the difficulty in this way with the “ode to a cemetery” and the “ode to a cemetery”, they speak of a talent, indeed an entire way of writing poetry, where, if a symbol is necessary, it might not have been the main concern of poetry, as with shakespeare, but it is, in the poetry and drama of human responses... The main difficulty of the poem is the struggle between ideal and reality. It is a matter of adverbial compositions, but it is accompanied by more specific antitheses of pleasure and pain, imagination and common sense, fullness and privation, permanent and changing, nature and man, art and life, freedom and friendship, waking and dreaming. " Good-bye!" - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! ‘Adieu!’ cried the besiegers. ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ So keats adheres to coleridge’s belief, which he is shown to express in “the nightingale”: “by crossing the boundaries of the world, one can admonish oneself to the bird’s song, which contains no sign of truth. But although keats prefers a woman nightingale to coleridge’s male nightingale, they reject the traditional depiction of the nightingale as the hero of philomela. He adheres to coleridge’s belief, which he expresses in ‘the nightingale’, that ‘by crossing the boundary of the world one can warn oneself of the bird’s song, which is not true. Nevertheless there is a conflict in the poem, as the narrator holds keats to be guilty of the death of his brother, Tom Keats.’ ’ ’ but there is a tension in that the narrator considers keats guilty of having killed his brother.

With this idea, the poem recall And yet it was just as we thought it would be, in this respect—it would have been very extraordinary, for it had been far beyond reasonable expectations. but we did find it natural to make it accessible to common understanding the poetic power which the author’s mind has with which he has gifted the idea of poetic power to a greater extent than was in any of his earlier works. I am merely asserting that the idea of poetic power has a greater, far greater significance in the poetry of our hero than was ever in his previous works. And yet it was exactly as we thought it would be, in that respect, it would have been very extraordinary, because it had been far beyond reasonable expectations. But in this case, the author was most certainly attempting to shatter the lie and vulgar spirit in which that young worshipper of the muses was so impudently called upon; whatever doubts still remain about the kind and degree of his poetical merits... take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from a poem of nightingales:'It is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true. The thoughts have all the resonances of the cords of naturally formed hearts: the echoes of the strain are hidden in the depths of human bosoms. But this time, the author was very much concerned to dispel the lie and vulgar spirit with which that young, worshipping muses, had been so impudently urged; whatever doubts still remain about the quality and degree of his poetical merits... and yet, as we thought it would be, in this respect, it would have been very extraordinary, for it had been far beyond our reasonable expectations. It was only natural to make it plain to common sense the poetic power of the author’s mind, with which he has gifted the idea of poetic power with greater significance than in any of his earlier works.

It was only natural to make it clear to common sense the poetic power of the author's mind, with which he has gifted the idea of poetic power with greater significance than in all his earlier works. In the poem of keats (ca. 1895), William C. Wilson noted that the poem is an excellent example of the keats odes, but he found it too cryptic, because the ode "of the nightingale" contained too many "incoherent thoughts" that did not conform to the strict logic of the text that could allow the reader to understand the relationship between the poet and the bird. But this time the author was very much concerned with dispelling the lie and the vulgar spirit with which this young worshipper of the king was so dishonestly called; whoever doubts still remain about the quality and degree of his poetical merits... and yet, as we thought, in this respect, it would be very extraordinary, because it was far beyond our reasonable expectations.

Wilkinson, in his essay, argued that "the poem of keats" is deeply flawed, because it contains too many "incoherent thoughts" that do not provide a good standard of logic that allows the reader to understand the relationship between the poet and the bird.

" Two odes of keats" (an essay written in 1897), William Wilkinson argued that "the poem of keats" is deeply flawed, because it contains too many "incoherent thoughts", which does not follow a proper logical sense that can make the reader understand the relationship between the poet and the bird.

In a 1956 letter to perkins, perkins claimed: "although the "ode to a nightingale" was more expansive than the "ode to a "geographical urn," it is also the exploration or testing of a symbol, and compared to the urn as a symbol it has both limitations and advantages.

The critics, harold bloom ( 1965), leslie brisman ( 1973), paul fry ( 1980), john hollander ( 1982), cynthia chase ( 1985), all focused on the poem with milton as the originator of "the nightingale', while they ignored other possibilities, including shakespeare, who had many phrases of which he was now expelled.... from the late 1960s, many of the yale school of critics asserted that the poem was a reworking of john milton's poetic diction, but that this poem revealed that keats was not able to play the role of milton as a poet. For some reason he failed in the task. For others he was most successful in forming the story of the great nightingale and the South Sea Urn as his better and earlier works. The critics—harold bloom ( 1965), leslie brisman (73), paul fry (80), john hollander (82), cynthia chase (85), all emphasized the poem and the poet in milton's poem as the originator of the "nightingale", but avoided other possibilities, including shakespeare, whose resemblance to the poem revealed that keats was unable to play the role of milton as a poet. In response to these aphorisms concerning milton and keats's shortcomings, critics such as r.s. white ( 1981) and willardspiegelman (83) argued for a multiplicity of sources for the poem, claiming that keats was not trying to respond only to milton, nor to escape from his shadow... The critics—harold bloom (65), leslie brisman (73), paul fry (80), john hollander (82), cynthia chase (85) all emphasized the poem and the poet in milton's poem as the originator of the nightingale, and omitted other possibilities, including shakespeare, whose similarity to the poem revealed that keats could not play the role of milton as a poet. This was followed in 1986 by jonathan bate, claiming that keats's dream of a midsummer night "kindled and fermented the subsequent poem"... for some reason he failed at this task. For others he was the most successful in forming the story of the great nightingale and the South Sea Urn as his more complete and earlier works. In response to these aphorisms concerning milton and keats's shortcomings, the critics - r.s. white, r.s. white, r.s. spiegelman, - said that "the last nightingale is a original poem," which white said, "the poem is saturated in shakespeare, yet the modifications are so profound that the ode is original and very keatsian." The critics, harold bloom (65), leslie brisman (73), paul fry (80), john hollander (82), cynthia chase (85), all emphasized the poem and the poet in milton's poem as the originator of the "nightingale", but avoided other possibilities, such as shakespeare, whose resemblance to the poem revealed that keats was not able to play the role of milton as a poet. In reply to these aphorisms about milton and keats's shortcomings, such as r.s. white ( 1981), Willardspiegelman (81), Willardspiegelman, (83) asserted that keats "took full advantage of the voice of the "spirit of the 'canon', and "tides" as a pretext for the "bigoted poem." To this it was said that the "last nightingale" was "an original poem," which white said, "the poem is saturated with shakespeare, but the changes are so profound that the ode is original and very keatsian." "This was followed in 1986 by the claim that keats's dream of a summer night "expanded and fermented"... he did not succeed in this. For some reason he did not succeed. In response to these aphorisms about milton and keats's weaknesses, the critics—r.s. white, r.s. white, r.s. spiegelman—referenced the poet as the originator of the nightingale, while they did not take into account other possibilities, including shakespeare, whose similarity to the poem revealed that keats could not play the role of milton. In response to these aphorisms about milton and keats's deficiencies, the critics, r.s. white, r.s. white, r.s. spiegelman, said that the last nightingale is a "original" poem, which white said, "the poem is full of shakespeare, but the modifications are so profound that it is original and very keats." In response to this, the critics, r.s. white, r.s. white, r.s. spiegelman, asserted that keats "does" not only respond to milton, but also escape from his shadow... Among the critics – harold bloom, 1965, leslie brisman, 73, paul fry, 80, john hollander, 82, cynthia chase, 83, all emphasized the poem and the poet in the poem milton, but ignored other possibilities, including shakespeare, whose resemblance to the poem revealed that keats could not play the role of milton as a poet. The critics – harold bloom, 1965, leslie brisman, 73, paul fry, 80, john hollander, 1982, cynthia chase, 85, all emphasized the poem and the poet in the poem milton as the originator of the nightingale, but omitted other possibilities, including shakespeare, whose resemblance to the poem revealed that keats could not play the role of milton as a poet. – in 1983, helen vendler maintained the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that it was a attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later thrown into the mud. To this, the critics, harold bloom, 73, paul fry, 80, john hollander, 82, cynthia chase, 84, all stressed the poem and the poet in the poem as the originator of the nightingale, and avoided other possibilities, including shakespeare, whose likeness to the poem revealed that keats was unable to play the role of milton as a poet. These aphorisms about milton and keats’s weaknesses, the critics, r.s. white, r.s. white, r.s. spiegelman, asserted that keats ‘didn’t” respond only to milton, nor to escape his shadow... In response to this, the critics, r.s. white, r.s. spiegelman, said that the last nightingale was a ‘original’ poem, which white said, ‘the poem is a shard of shakespeare, but the changes are so great that the ode is original and very keatsian. - i believe that the "issues" of the ode, unfolding in time, have more logic than is usually granted them, and are best seen in relation to keats's pursuit of music as a non-representational art. - - - in a review of the contemporary criticism of a nightingale in 1998, james o'rouke said that, “judging from the diversity, the variety, the polemical force of modern critical criticism, there have been few moments in english poetic history as dizzying as keats' repetition of the word forlorn. ” , he writes in a review of the contemporary criticism of a nightingale, "as a result of the variety, variety, the polemical force of modern critical criticism, there have not been many moments in english poetic history as delirious as keats's repetition of the word forlorn....
