Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and was 149th out of 182 countries on the human development index. The latest cyclones that hit the island in the summer of 2008 were tropical storm Fay and hurricanes gustav, hanna and ike, all in the summer of 2008, causing over 800 deaths. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and ranked 149th out of 182 countries on the human development index. The latest cyclones which struck the island before the earthquake were tropical storm fay and the three hurricanes gustav, hanna and ike, all of which were in the summer of 2008 and threw the island in a tidal wave.

" A quake occurred near the northern boundary of the Atlantic, where the tectonic plate of the Caribbean has shifted by about 20 mm (8057.5 in) per year, in relation to the north american plate. The strike-by-slip fault system in the region consists of two branches in the chain, the septentrional-oriented-oriente fault in the north and the enriquillo-- plantain-garden fault in the south. Both its location and its mechanism suggest that the january 2010 earthquake was caused by the rupture of the enriquillo--garden fault, which had been closed for a century, was gathering vigor. “Twenty million people lived in the region where the tremor was about one megahertz in size. A quake occurred near the northern boundary of the Atlantic, where the tectonic plate of the Caribbean has been moving about a metre (eight-and-a-half) per year in the direction of the North American plate. Both its position and its mechanism indicate that the january 2010 earthquake was caused by the rupture of the fault enriquillo – the herb garden fault, which had been closed for more than a century, was gradually regaining strength. A study published in may 2010 suggested that the rupture process involved several blind-slip faults, with a small, deep, lateral weakness of minor, shallow, lateral laterality, just about the main enriquillo – the herb garden fault, and that the earthquake reduced only centuries of centuries of accumulated lateral stress on a small part of the plate – the boundary system... “ He thought it had the resemblance of a shake of about a thousand watts. He called it a "moon". He said: "Twenty million people lived in the region where the earthquake was a mega-hertz. A quake occurred near the northern border of the Atlantic, where the tectonic plate of the Caribbean has moved by about a foot (eight-and-a-half) per year towards the North American plate. He had also ruptured the enriquillo, which had been closed for more than a century, but was gradually gaining strength. It was concluded in May 2010 that the rupture involved several blind slip faults with small, shallow, lateral weakness, mostly in the main enriquillo, the herb garden fault, and that the earthquake had only reduced centuries of centuries of accumulated lateral stress on a small part of the plate – the boundary. – In the north, the south, and the enriquillo, the plantation fault. A study published in May 2010 estimated that the earthquake was caused by the rupture of the enriquillo, the herb garden fault, which had been closed for more than a century. Both its location and its mechanism showed that the earthquake of the month of January, 2010 was caused by the rupture of the enriquillo, the herb garden fault, which had been closed for more than a century, was beginning to strengthen.

A quake took place near the northern border of the Atlantic, where the tectonic plate of the Caribbean has been shifting about two metres (eight and a half) per year towards the North American plate. It was found in May 2010 that the earthquake of the month of January 2010 was caused by the rupture of the enriquillo, the fault of the herb-garden fault, which had been closed for more than a century.

" The study published in May 2010 estimated that the earthquake of the month of January, 2010 was caused by the rupture of the enriquillo, the herb-garden fault, which had been closed for more than a century, was gradually increasing. It was the subordinate plate that divided the region into the northern half of the Atlantic, and the tectonic plate of the Caribbean moved about a foot (eight and a half) per year towards the North American plate. It was found in May 2010 that the earthquake of January 2010 was caused by the rupture of the enriquillo, the fault of the herb-garden, which had been closed for more than a century, and it was slowly gaining strength. It was a high-frequency quake occurring near the northern part of the Atlantic, where the tectonic plate of the Caribbean moved about a foot (eight and a half) per year toward the North American plate. The earthquake was measured by a scale of one kilometer. It resembled a swish, a thousand-watt swish, and he called it a “moon.” A study published in May 2010 concluded that the earthquake in January 2010 was caused by the rupture of the enriquillo, the enriquillo, which had been closed for more than a century, and that the earthquake had only reduced the centuries of centuries of accumulated stress on a small part of the plate, the boundary.

It was found in May 2010 that the earthquake had been caused by the rupture of the enriquillo, the herb-garden fault, which had been closed for more than a century, and that the earthquake had only reduced centuries of centuries of accumulated tension in a small part of the plate - the boundary.
