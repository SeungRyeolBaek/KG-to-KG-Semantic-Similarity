In brief, the royal power is granted to ministers without the approval of the parliament, including the power to declare war and to give peace, to issue passports and to grant honors... today, some of the key functions of the British government are still performed by virtue of the royal power, but, in general, the power has declined, as functions are gradually put in place on a statutory basis... At the time of the War of Independence, a trial was commenced at the Writ of Right at Shoreham.... a court of appeal, in 1915, a petition was commenced in the Writ of Right at Shoreham.... and it was withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation. The Minister of State, Leyland, said: “The Minister of State is closely in touch with the administration of the Government by means of weekly meetings with the Prime Minister, and she is completely informed about the affairs of the Government... but it must be noted that the Prime Minister has no power to influence royal opinions... in short, the power of the Crown is used to administer the State in the name of the Crown; although the monarch has the right to consult, to be urged, and to warn, his role is not determinate...

Another extension of this principle was obtained in the case of the secretary of state for the home department, ex parte fire brigades, where the court of appeal held that even if the statute had not yet come into force, the prerogative power could not be used to alter the statutory provisions in a way that “disperses parliament’s wishes.” – the principle of prerogative powers was confirmed in laker airways ltd v. the Department of Trade, in regard to the suspension of an airline operator’s license in December 1976; where it was ruled that the prerogative power could not contradict a statute and that, in cases where the prerogative power and the statute were in conflict, it was possible to use the power only to advance the purposes of the statute.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the attitude was changing; the Lord denning remarked in the case of laker airways that, as it is a discretionary power to be exercised for the benefit of the public good, it is well known that the courts examine it as well as any other discretionary power vested in the executive. Besides, in the case of the secretary of state for the home department, ex-participating fire brigades, the court of appeal declared that, even if the statute did not yet enter into force, the prerogative power could not be used to amend the laws of parliament in a way that ‘disperses parliament’s wishes.

In the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the attitude of the court changed; Lord denning made observations in laker airways that as it is a power of the government to exercise the best interests of the public, it is well known that the courts scrutinize it as well as any other power.
