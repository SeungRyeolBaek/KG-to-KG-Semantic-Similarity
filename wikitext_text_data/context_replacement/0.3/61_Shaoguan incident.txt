" the new york times quoted xinjiang daily saying in 2009 that 70 % of the young uyghurs have " signed up for jobs elsewhere . " however , kashgar residents and the families of those who refuse to go are threatened with payment of up to six months ' worth of a village##r ' s income . an official in charge of ethnic and cultural affairs in guangdong said that the factory had hired workers , aged from 18 to 29 , in may . a second group of uyghurs arrived on 2 june , and workers at the factory said that relations between the two groups deteriorated as the number of uyghurs increased . state media confirmed that all the workers were from shufu county . china labor watch reported that workers at the shaoguan factory , where the uyghurs were employed , earned 28 yuan per day compared with 2 @ . @ 3 yuan in the factory in shenzhen . they said that thousands of workers , han and uyghur alike , were frequently affected by verbal abuse from factory supervisors , unpaid wages , poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour practices . li wei , deputy director of china labor watch said that low pay , long hours and poor living conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their supervisors created deeply held tensions between the workers and uyghurs . = = incidents and events = = = on friday – 26 june , tensions flared at the factory , leading to a full @ - @ blown street brawl between uyghurs and han . as a result of the fighting , 2 uyghurs died and 118 people were injured , 16 of them seriously . of the injured , 79 were uyghurs and 50 were han . 400 police and 200 full @ - @ blown protesters were injured . official reports state that the clashes began at around 10 p . m . , and there were reports that they lasted until at least 4 @ . @ 30 a . m . , when police arrived . the first disturbance was reported at around 11 p . m . when security guards responded to a call for backup by a han worker who was attacked by the two han uyghurs . several hundred han workers armed with batons and metal detectors then responded ;

he said it was common knowledge that the outsiders brought in guns . han and uyghursources interviewed by the associated press said the incident had been understated by the authorities : the han claimed to have killed seven or eight uyghurs ; uyghurs cited " merciless " assaults on those travelling in ambulances . the riot stopped shortly after the police arrived . a policeman blamed their delay in arriving at the scene due to difficulties in assembling enough people . the two dead victims were later named as aximujiang aimaiti and sadikejiang kaze , both from xinjiang . = = = = = = = = the riot was sparked by rumours of sexual assault on han women by uyghurs , and reports of an incident in which two toy factory workers were sexually assaulted by six uyghur co @ - @ workers at the factory , according to voice of america . the authorities said that the rumours were false , and had been spread by a female chinese co @ - @ worker . xinhua said that a man surnamed zhu " caused the incident to express his frustration " over failing to find new employment after losing his job at the factory . = = responses = = police said that their investigations found no evidence that the incident had taken place . shaoguan government spokesman wang qinxin , called it " a very tragic incident " , which he said had been used to create unrest . the guardian reported that footage of the riot and photographs of the victims were quickly circulated on the internet by uighur exile groups , along with claims that the death toll was under @ - @ , and the authorities were slow to respond ;

" she described how one of them stood up and lifted his foot as if to strike her . " i later realized that he was just making fun of me . " she said she only found out years later that she was the cause of the violence . shaoguan authorities moved the uyghur workers to temporary housing , and the workers were transferred on 7 july to a facility open to public light , 30 kilometers away in baitu town . the baitu factory is now reported to be an uyghur town , with , medical facilities , shops , elementary schools , the @ @ - @ the @ - @ clock ##work clinic , and the @ - @ - @ officers in their midst . according to the south china morning post , the kashgar staff were apparently unable to mix with locals in their new location because of the language barrier – a chinese aid worker said that less than one in three spoke chinese . two days on , the south china morning post found several sources to talk about the events of the previous night . the authorities ' claims that the uyghur workers were denied their work permits and the strike were contested by uyghur workers . abdukeyum muhammat , deputy secretary of the kanji standing committee of the communist party , led a working team to shaoguan on 30 june . zhou yongkang , politburo standing committee member responsible for security , reportedly visited shaoguan in early september 2009 . on 5 august , xinhua reported that the police had arrested kurban khayum , a chef at an arabic restaurant in xinjiang who they had confessed to being an agent for the world uygur council ( wuc ) and who had spread leaflets that were later used as a catalyst to trigger the urumqi riots of 5 august . xinhua alleged that police had fabricated a report that " the street brawl had caused the death of 17 to 18 people , including three females , " whichhe sent out an e @ - @ message to rebiya kadeer . after a trial on 20 may in shaoguan intermediate people ' s court , xiao jianhua ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) was sentenced to death for being the " principal instigator " of the violence and xu qiqi ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) was given a life sentence for manslaughter ; three other people were sentenced to five to ten years for assault . on the same day , the people ' s court of wujiang district , shaoguan , convicted three more ethnic chinese and two uyghurs for participating in the riot ; they were sentenced to five to seven years ' imprisonment . = galveston , texas = galveston / [UNK] / is a port city located on galveston island and galveston bay in the u . s . state of texas . the community of 208 @ . @ 207 square miles ( 539 km2 ) , with a population of 84 @ , @ 762 people ( 2012 census estimate ) , is the county seat and second @ - @ largest city of galveston county . it is located between houston – the galveston – sugar land metropolitan area . named after bernardo de galvez y madrid , duke of galvez ( born in malaga , spain ) , galveston ' s first permanent settlements on the island were constructed in 1816 by french explorer louis @ - @ michel aury to help the young republic of mexico fight pirates . the port of galveston was established in 1825 by the congress of mexico following its successful independence from spain . the city served as the main base for the texas navy during the texas revolution , and later served as the capital of the republic of texas . during the 19th century , galveston was a major u . s . ocean port and one of the largest ports in the united states . it was devastated by the 1900 galveston hurricane , whose effects included flooding and a storm surge . the galveston disaster on the exposed galveston island is still regarded as the worst in united states history , with an estimated total of 2 @ , @ 000 deaths . most of galveston ' s commercial economy is centered in the retail , health care , education , and financial sectors . the 84 @ - @ .

" he remained in power until 1821 , when he and his raiders were driven from the island by the united states navy . in 1825 the government of texas established the port of galveston and in 1830 built a custom house . galveston served as the capital of the republic of texas when in 1836 the texas governor john g . burnet established his government there . in 1836 , the french @ - @ merchant michel branamour menard and several associates purchased 4 @ , @ 605 acres ( 4 @ . @ 64 km2 ) of land for $ 50 @ , @ 000 to establish the settlement that would become the modern city of galveston . as anglo @ - @ americans migrated to the city , they brought along or purchased enslaved african @ - @ americans , many of whom worked domestically and on the waterfront , some on riverboats . in 1839 the city of galveston received its charter and was incorporated by the legislature of the republic of texas . the city was by then a major center of commerce and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of german immigrants to texas , especially german merchants . together with ethnic german residents , these groups tended to support slavery , support the confederacy during the civil war , and support the republican party during the 1880s . during this expansion , the city achieved many " firsts " for the state , with the establishment of institutionsand dozens of buildings : post office ( 1836 ) , military base ( 1836 ) , texas chapter of the masonic lodge ( 1840 ) ; water compress ( 1842 ) , catholic high school ( ursuline academy ) ( 1847 ) , insurance company ( 1854 ) , and electric light ( 1856 ) . during the american civil war , confederate forces under major general john c . magruder attacked and expelled the union forces from the city in april 1863 in the battle of galveston . in 1867 galveston suffered a yellow fever epidemic ; 1800 people died in the city . these occurred in harbor and river areas throughout the 19th century , as did cholera epidemics . the city ' s progress continued during the reconstruction period with several " improvements " : construction of the opera house ( 1870 ) , and library ( 1876 ) , and installation of telephone ##s ( 1878 ) and electric lights ( 1883 ) . having attracted freedmen from rural areas , by 1870 the city had a black population that totaled 4 @ , @ 000 , made up primarily of former slaves but also by numerous persons who were free people of color and educated before the war . the " blacks " comprised nearly 25 % of the city ' s population of 3 @ , @ 818 that year . during the post @ - @ civil @ - @ war period , leaders such as william h . davis and norris wright cuney , who founded the texas republican party and promoted civil rights for blacks , sought to greatly improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in galveston and in texas . cuney established his own bureau of insurance and a union of black dockworkers to break the federal monopoly on dock jobs . galveston was a port city and one of the more prosperous during reconstruction ; the freedmen ' s bureau was established there . wealthy families sheltered immigrants from the south , and hundreds of children were taught to read . the business community promoted progress , and many continued to work after arriving at this port of entry . by the end of the 19th century , the city of galveston had a population of 10 @ , @ 000 . its location on the natural harbour of galveston bay along the gulf of mexico made it the center of commerce in texas . it was one of the largest cotton ports in the nation , in competition with new orleans . during the 19th century , the port city of galveston grew rapidly and the strand was considered the region ' s major commercial center . for a time , the strand was known as the " main street of the south " . in the late 1800s , the city constructed fort crockett defenses and fortand elsewhere in galveston and along the bolivar river . in february 1897 , galveston was officially visited by the uss texas ( nicknamed old texas ) , the first commissioned battleship of the united states navy . during the festivities , the ship ' s officers were presented with a $ 5 @ , @ 000 brass plate , adorned with native american motifs , as a gift from the citizens of the city . = = = hurricane of 1900 and recovery = = = on september 11 , 1900 , the island was struck by a major hurricane . this storm holds the record for the united states ' worst natural disaster . the city was devastated , and an estimated 6 @ , @ 000 to 8 @ , @ 000 people on the island were killed . following the hurricane , a 10 @ - @ mile ( 16 km ) long , 17 foot ( 5 @ . @ 2 m ) high wall was constructed to protect the city from flooding and hurricane storm surge . a team of engineers under henry martyn smith ( houston ' s rules of order ) constructed the wall to raise much of the existing land to a sufficient height behind the bluff so that order in the city could be maintained . the city adopted the city commission form of city government , known as the " galveston plan " , to help encourage development . despite attempts to attract new settlers to the city after the hurricane , galveston never fully recovered to its previous levels of economic importance or prosperity . development was also aided by the construction of the houston ship channel , which brought the port of houston into direct competition with the inner harbor of the port of galveston for shipping traffic . to aid her recovery , and increase her population , galveston actively solicited immigrants . through the efforts of rabbi jacob cohen and congregation b ' nai israel , galveston became the center of an immigration plan called the galveston movement that , between 1907 and 1914 , brought over 10 @ , @ 000 eastern european jewish immigrants from the usual route of the crowded cities of the western united states . also numerous other immigrant groups , including greeks , italians and russian jews , came to the city during this period . this immigration program substantially increased the ethnic makeup of the city , as well as in other areas of texas and the western u . s . though the storm stalled economic growth and the city of galveston grew into the state ' s largest city , galveston business leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional - @ - @ - city . in 1905 william lewis johnson , jr . and william h . kempner , members of two of galveston ' s leading families , founded the americanmoody insurance company . two years later , moody founded the city national bank , which would later become the moody national bank . during the 1920s and 1930s , the city of @ - @ emerged as a popular tourist destination . under the influence of john maceo and cecil maceo , the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in establishments like the balinese club , which offered entertainment to wealthy houstonians and other out @ - @ of @ - @ residents . along with prostitution , which had existed in the city since the civil war , galveston became known as the " sin city " of the gulf . galvestonians controlled and encouraged the drug trade , often referring to their island as the " black port of galveston " . the city had become what would later be known as the " open city " . the 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the island city . during world war ii , the galveston municipal airport , home to scholes international airport , was in @ - @ as a u . s . army air corps base and named " moody army air field " . in august 1943 , the army air field was officially activated with the 20th bombardment group serving an out @ - @ submarine base in the gulf of mexico . in 1942 , william lewis moody , jr . , along with his wife libbie shearn rice moody , established the moody foundation , to benefit " current and future generations of texans . " the foundation , one of the largest in the united states , would play a major role in galveston during subsequent decades , helping to establish many education and health @ - @ oriented programs . = = = = – world war ii = = = the end of the war greatly reduced military investment in the city . the enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of las vegas , nevada as a major center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island . finally in 1957 , texas attorney general will rogers and the texas legislature began a nationwide campaign of raids which ended gambling and prostitution in the city . as these vice industries crashed , so did gambling , and the rest of the galveston economy with it . neither the economy nor the culture of the city remained the same afterward . the economy of the city entered a long stagnant period . many businesses moved to the island during this period ; education , health care , insurance and social services continued to be strong contributors to the economy . by 1959 , the city of houston was long out @ -

@ class residents to find affordable housing on the island . hurricane ike made landfall on galveston island in the early hours of september 13 , 2008 as a category 5 hurricane with winds of 110 miles per hour . damage was reported to homes along the seawall . after the storm , the island was rebuilt with further investments into tourism , shipping , and continued emphasis on higher education and health care . notably the addition of the galveston island historic pleasure beach and the replacement of the bascule @ -
