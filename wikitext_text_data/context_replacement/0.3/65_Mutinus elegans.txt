= = elegans = mutinus elegans , commonly known as the elegant trumpet , the dog stinkhorn , the common stinkhorn , or the devil ' s trumpet , is a species of mushroom in the carrot family . a saprobic species , it is commonly found growing on the ground , or in small groups on woody debris or leaf litter , during summer and autumn in japan , europe , and eastern north america . the fruit body begins its life in an " egg " shape , or somewhat a mushroom partially submerged in the ground . as the fruit develops , a slender orange to red colored stalk emerges that narrows down to a pointed tip . the stalk is covered with a 0 @ - @ shaped , green spore mass along the upper half of its length . flies and other insects feed upon the slime which contains the spores , aiding in their dispersal . due to their unpleasant odor , mature specimens are not generally considered edible , although there are reports of the edible " eggs " being edible . in the laboratory , c elegans has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms that may be pathogenic to humans . = = taxonomy = = mutinus elegans was first described by british naturalist john smith in 1679 who wrote the natural history of botany ; this published report is believed to be the first account of the fungus in north america . it was first described scientifically by french botanist jean pierre francois camille montagne in 1856 , who named it corynites elegans . the specific name mutinus refers to a phallic deity , mutinus mutunus , one of the roman di indigetes placated by their gods . the mushroom is commonly known variously as the " elegant stinkhorn " , the " devil stinkhorn " , the " dog stinkhorn " , or the " devil ' s dipstick " . the specific epithet elegans is derived from the latin , meaning " elegant " or " beautiful " . = = taxonomy = = the young fruiting bodies are initially green and 0 to 0 @ - @ shaped , partially submerged in the ground , with dimensions of 2 to 3 cm ( 0 @ . @ 1 to 1 @ . @ 2 in ) by 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ 4 to 0 @ . @ 8 in ) . as the fruit body grows , the egg mass and the green spore @ - @ shaped stalkyoung ; fully grown , it may be from 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ 6 to 5 @ . @ 8 in ) long and 1 @ . @ 5 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ 6 to 1 @ . @ 8 in ) thick . the stalk is hollow and somewhat convex above ; the shape is cylindrical below , but it gradually narrows to a narrow point with a small notch at the tip . the upper half of the stalk is bright red to reddish orange , and the color gradually fades , fading into dull red below . the stalk may be straight , or slightly curved . a gelatinous greenish @ - @ brown cap covers the upper half of the stalk in newly emerged specimens . the remains of the " egg " forms a ring around the base of the stalk . the odor of the fungus is unpleasant ; one author describes it as " sickly sweet or metallic " . the spores are a greenish @ - @ brown color . fruit bodies are attached to the stalk by short stems that resemble tree roots . american fungus ##s noted that the spores are very difficult to open , sometimes taking one to two days before the stalk breaks . the spores are 4 – @ [UNK] 4 – ##0 µm , oblong @ - @ brown , smooth , and embedded in the stem . a 1982 study revealed that all of species in the same family , including mutinus elegans , have a hilar scar ( 0 @ . @ [UNK] – @ @ . @ 1 µm . ) that is visible with scanning electron microscopy . the small scar is a circular indentation at one end of the spore , and it most commonly forms during the process of the attachment of the spores to the sterigma of the stem . = = = edibility = = = the immature egg @ - @ forms of mutinus elegans are edible , but " not recommended " . some field guides note that the eggs of the adult fungi " taste like the seasonings that are added to them . " the bitter taste of mature specimens would probably be poisonous to humans , although they are not actually poisonous . = = = similar = = = = the " dog ##wood " ( mutinus caninus ) is smaller , has a more reddish or reddish @ - @ brown cap on a shorter stalk and lacks the dark cap of m . elegans ; it has less of the stalk produced by gle##ba . the portion of the stalk below the fruit body is smooth in m . caninus , compared to " smooth " in m . elegans . m . caninus is also more common than m . elegans . . bambusinus is similar in size and shape , except it does not have a distinct color demarcation between the upper and lower parts of the stalk ; instead , the upper part shows red spots . the stalk of m . ravenelii is more tapered than m . elegans , and it has a clearly differentiated white cap . = = habitat and distribution = = . elegans is saprobic — obtaining energy by breaking down dead or dying organic matter . it is commonly found in gardens and farm areas covered with manure , as well @ - @ decayed logs and logs , and in wood chips . a japanese researcher reported its occurrence in takatsuki and tokyo @ - @ fu , where it fruited in november and december on the ground along paths or in open spaces , under or near bamboo ( phyllostachys bambusoides ) and hardwoods such as the japanese maple , the japanese zelkova , and the plane tree . this european species has been collected in eastern north america , in the region extending from quebec to florida and west to the great plains , iowa , and texas . in europe , it has been collected from netherlands and in asia , it has been collected from japan . = = antibiotic . = = a study of three different species showed that . elegans was the only species to show defensive ( both ##biotic and chemical ) activity against all the microorganisms tested , including , the fungal pathogen bacteris bacillus cereus , bacillus subtilis , staphylococcus aureus , escherichia coli , and typhimurium and the bacterial genus albicans . = the boat race 1900 = the 57th boat race took place on 31 march 1900 . held annually , the boat race is a side @ - @ - @ - @ a rowing race between crews from the universities of oxford and cambridge on the river thames . cambridge won by two lengths in a side @ - @ equalling time of 18 minutes 45 seconds , taking the overall record for the event to + – 24 in oxford ' s favour . = = = = = the boat race is a side @ - @ -@ - @ is the competition between the university of oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " dark blues " ) and the university of cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " light blues " ) . the race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @ . @ 2 @ - @ mile ( 6 @ . @ 8 km ) championship course on the river thames in southwest london . the rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and known throughout the united kingdom and worldwide . cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1899 race by two @ - @ and @ - @ a @ - @ quarter lengths , while oxford led overall with 32 victories to cambridge ' s 29 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . leading up to the race , oxford suffered a series of misfortune : j . c . mcthornhill was advised by his doctor not to row , w . h . smith was injured and rower felix warre contracted scarlet fever . oxford were coached by william brookes smith , who had rowed for the light blues three times between 1872 and 1874 , and stanley muttlebury , five @ - @ time blue for cambridge between 1886 and 1890 . oxford ' s captains were harcourt gilbey ##s ( dark blues president the previous year and one @ - @ time blue ) and douglas mclean ( an oxford blue five times between 1883 and 1887 ) . the umpire for the race for the fourth year in a row was william willan who had won the race four consecutive times , rowing for oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races . = = = = = the oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 4 @ . @ 625 lb ( 78 @ . @ 1 kg ) , 1 @ . @ 25 lb ( 0 @ . @ 1 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . cambridge ' s crew had three members with boat race experience : j . e . smith , c . w . tomlkinson and john g . s . maclagan . oxford saw eight of their 1899 crew members , including william dudley smith and raymond william etherington @ - @ smith , both of whom were rowing in their 1899 race . seven of the nine light blues were educated at trinity college . oxford ' s stroke w . h . dutton , a native of south africa , was the only non @ - @ cambridge rower registered for the race . author and former oxford rower john drinkwater wrote that this year ' s cambridge crew , along with the oxford crew which rowed inthe 1897 race , " was in a class by themselves among university crews . " he also described the 1897 crew as " one of the best that ever came from the isis " . = = race = = oxford won the toss and elected to start from the surrey station , handing the middlesex side of the river to cambridge . in good weather , captain willan got the race under way at 3 : 00 p . m . whereupon cambridge took the lead immediately . by boxing day they were two lengths ahead and began to draw away from the light blues , to win by two lengths in a time of 18 minutes 45 seconds . it was the fastest winning time in the history of the race , equalling that set by cambridge in the 1893 race . although it was the light blues ' second consecutive victory , it followed a run of nine consecutive victories for oxford – overall the light blues led 32 – yards .
