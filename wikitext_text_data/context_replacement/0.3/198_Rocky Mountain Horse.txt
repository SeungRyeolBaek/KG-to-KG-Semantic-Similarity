= rocky mountain = = the rocky mountain horse is a horse breed developed in the state of kentucky in the united states . despite its name , it originated not in the rocky mountains , but rather in the appalachian mountains . a black stallion , imported from the western united states to western kentucky around 1890 , developed the rocky mountain horse in the late 19th century . in the mid @ - @ 20th century , a stallion named john tobe , owned by a prominent breeder , was used to develop the chestnut color ; today most rocky mountain horses trace back to this stallion . in 1986 , the rocky mountain horse registry was formed and by 2005 had registered over 12 @ , @ 000 horses . the breed is known for its distinctive " chocolate " coat color and flaxen mane and tail , the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black base , seen in most of the population . it also exhibits a non @ - @ beat walking characteristic known as the " single @ - @ beat " . originally developed as a multi @ - @ purpose riding , driving and light draft horse , today it is used primarily for trail riding and riding horses . = = breed registry = = rocky mountain horses stand between 14 @ . @ 2 and 6 hands ( 58 and 64 inches , 147 and 163 cm ) high . a chestnut color is accepted by the registry , but a dark brown color called " chocolate " with a black , " flaxen " mane and tail is preferred . this color is the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black base coat . although rare , this color has been found in over a dozen breeds , including the rocky mountain horse . minimal white markings are accepted by the registry , although these markings may not extend above the knee . the physical characteristics are highly variable , due to the different breeds that produce the rocky mountain horse . the rocky mountain horse is known by enthusiasts for its hardiness and ability to withstand winters in the mountains . it is also praised for its good health and affinity for humans . rocky mountain horses have the highest risk of any breed for the progressive optic / multiple - ocular anomaly ( mcoa ) , also called progressive optic nerve dysgenesis ( asd ) . mcoa is characterized by the abnormal development of multiple eye structures , which causes compromised vision , although usually of a mild type ; the disorder is non @ - @ beat . genetic studies have shown that the disorder may be tied to the silver dapple gene , as the horses arewith mcoa carry the horse . the breed exhibits a natural ambling movement , called the four @ - @ beat , which resembles the movement seen in the majority of horse breeds . these movements provide an intermediate speed between a walk and a canter or gallop ; ambling gaits are four @ - @ beat gaits , whereas the trot is a two @ - @ beat movement . the extra footfalls provide additional stability to the horse because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground . this minimizes movement of the horse ' s topline and removes the bounce of a two @ - @ beat gait , caused by a moment of suspension followed by the lifting of the feet off the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other . the value of an increased speed is that the horse has energy . more than 100 horse breeds are " gaited , " able to perform the four @ - @ beat ambling movement , and some can also walk . thus , a rocky mountain horse , with rider , can use the single @ - @ foot to traverse rough terrain at over 7 miles per hour ( 11 km / h ) and short stretches of smooth ground at up to 16 miles per hour ( 26 km / h ) . the faster speed is known as the rack . in comparison , the typical american walking speed is 6 to 8 miles per hour ( 9 @ . @ 7 to 12 @ . @ 13 km / h ) . = = = = = = kentucky is known for its gaited horses , created from a mixture of spanish horses from the southern united states and english horses from the north . american saddlebreds , tennessee walking horses and missouri state trotters also originated in the same general geographic area , from the same mix of spanish and english horses . rocky mountain horses have a similar history to the rocky mountain saddle horse , and they are sometimes called " mountain pleasure horses " . the rocky mountain horse originated in western kentucky from a foundation stallion brought to the rocky mountains from the rocky mountains around 1890 . brought to the area as foundation stallion , oral traditions state that the " rocky mountain stallion " , as he is known , possessed the rich red coat and long mane and tail found in the breed today , as well as the single @ - @ foot characteristics . he was bred to breed local arabian mares , and due to the geographic area in which he was bred , a local strain of horse bred . this foundation stallion was a descendent , named oldtobe , who became the most famous father of the rocky mountain horse breed . old tobe was bred by a resident of hot springs , kentucky , william tuttle . for most of the 20th century , tuttle was a major breeder of rocky mountain horses , and managed to keep the strain alive during the great depression and world war ii . after world war ii , despite declining horse populations in the us , tuttle maintained his herd , and continued to use old tobe as a breeding stallion . tuttle set the natural kentucky horse park record for horseback riding , and used old tobe for endurance rides in the park and for training his young horses , the last until the stallion was 34 years old . old tobe died at the age of 37 . the presence of the 15 @ - @ foot mark makes it possible that the breed is in part descended from the narragansett horse , a breed known for passing its gaited characteristics on to other american breeds . in 1986 , the rocky mountain horse association was created to increase registration ##s and promote the breed ; there were only 26 horses in the first year of registration . since then , the association has , over the lifetime of the breed , registered over 25000 horses as of 2015 , and the breed has spread to 47 states and 11 countries . in order to be accepted into the registry , a horse ' s parentage must be verified via dna testing . horses must also , upon reaching 23 months of age , be tested to ensure that they meet the physical characteristic and temperament requirements of the breed . the rocky mountain horse is listed at " watch " status by the american livestock breeds conservancy , meaning that the total world population of the breed is less than 15 @ , @ 000 , with fewer than 800 registrations registered in the us . the breed was originally developed for general use on the farms of the appalachian foothills , where it was found pulling horses and wagons , working cattle and being ridden by both adults and children . today , it is still used for working cattle , as well as endurance riding and horseback riding . the breed ' s appearance and temperament make it sought out by elderly and disabled riders . each september , the kentucky horse park hosts the annual rocky mountain horse show . = somerset county cricket club in 2009 = somerset county cricket club competed in four major competitions during the 2009 english cricket season : the first division of the county championship , the friends life trophy , the second division of the natwest pro40 , and the twenty20 cup . throughtheir victory in the twenty20 cup , the county qualified for the champions league twenty20 . they had a successful season , but fell short of winning both competitions , prompting director of cricket brian lara to say " we ' ve had enough of being cricket ' s nearly extinct . " consistent form in the county championship helped somerset remain challengers for the competition until the last few weeks of the season , when the batting @ - @ out system at their home ground , the county ground , taunton , meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first league title . this was also key for somerset ' s success in the @ - @ day cricket , where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the friends provident trophy , but were eliminated in the first ever @ - @ out round , and finished runners @ - @ out by one wicket in the natwest pro40 . in the twenty20 cup , somerset finished as losing finalists . this meant that they qualified for the champions league twenty20 , where they progressed into the final group stage of the competition . they failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition , resulting in their elimination . somerset were captained for the second successive season by their former test player , justin langer , who announced during the season that it would be his last with somerset . marcus trescothick topped the national league tables , scoring over 3 @ , @ 000 runs in all competitions in 2009 ; as a result , he was named as both professional players ' association ( pca ) player of the year and the pca ' s most valuable player of the season . = = = = = after promotion from the second division of the county championship in 2007 , somerset were among the top four title contenders in the 2008 . a defeat to lancashire in the final match of the season meant they finished in fourth place . david warner , writing in wisden , felt that too many of the somerset players had " lost their way " in the @ - @ day cricket , as they narrowly avoided elimination in the natwest pro40 , and were eliminated from the friends life cup . somerset dropped four players from their squad for the 2009 season , giving way to jos buttler , adam smith , chris stiff and james wade . of these , only buttler appeared in the one @ - @ list during the season . they also signed chris stiff , a fast bowler playing at under @ - @ list level for england , on a two @ - @ day contract at the start of the season , which was later extended to the end of the season .ian blackwell , captain of the county in 2005 and 2006 , left for durham after captain andy hurry and captain justin langer made it clear that they saw cricket as a priority . john francis and keith parsons both retired at the end of 2008 , francis cited lack of first @ - @ day opportunities for his retirement , and at the age of 50 , parsons declared that : " there comes a time when your body tells you it ' s time to be in the sport . " in his analysis of the 2009 season for espncricinfo , andrew mcglashan identified somerset ' s strong performances with bat and ball as their main strengths , but noted that the middle order would struggle to make an impact in the county championship , noting that " some [ of the middle order ] jump up as potential first @ - @ winners in first @ - @ day cricket . " he speculated that the county ' s best chance of success would come in the one @ - @ day competition . the daily telegraph had a more positive view , claiming that the county had " enough depth in batting and in bowling to qualify [ for the county championship ] again . " they cited the bowling as an area of weakness following the departure of blackwell . simon harris , writing in the guardian , shared this view , and predicted that somerset would not be hindered by the difficulty of getting 20 wickets at home , resulting in too many draws . = = = = = the following players made at least one appearance for somerset in first @ - @ class , list a or twenty20 cricket in 2009 . ages listed are at the start of somerset ' s first match of the season ( 1 september 2009 ) . = = county championship = = although marcus trescothick produced a season which david foot described as " self assured " , somerset failed to win enough matches to pose a serious threat in the 2009 county championship . the poor pitch at the county ground , taunton did not help their cause ; the imbalance in performance of the batsmen meant that all but one match at the ground was drawn . sussex ' s total of 742 / 9 declared was the fifteenth highest total in the history of the county championship , while chris goodwin ' s innings of 344 not out in that match was the sixth highest score by a batsman in the history of the championship . in total , six of somerset ' s eight home matches produced scores of 500 per innings in a single innings . in contrast , 500 was reached in only one of their away matches , against somerset at the rose bowl . the home matches helped to of ##t' s batsmen scored 1 @ , @ 000 - @ - @ - runs in the season , including craig kieswetter and arul suppiah , who were both awarded their county caps after reaching the landmark . trescothick ' s 1 @ , @ 817 runs were the most by any batsman in the 2009 season , just over 100 runs short of the next most successful batsman , and he was named both the pca player of the year and the pca ' s most successful player of the year for 2009 . he was also selected as part of the team of the year , along with fellow @ - @ keeper kieswetter . in reference to the unusual batting line @ - @ bowling , critics noted that somerset " lacked a specialist bowler to compensate for andrew caddick ' s absence " . caddick — had made his first @ - @ class appearance for somerset in 1991 — only played five matches in 2009 , and announced his intention to retire at the end of the season . he took 41 wickets in 2009 , and finished his season as somerset ' s sixth highest first @ - @ taker of the @ - @ class . this placed the majority of the first @ - @ class burden upon charl willoughby , the south african first @ - @ medium pace bowler . willoughby performed well , and took 54 wickets in the county championship , more than any other bowler in the first division . he was aided by seam bowlers chris wood , who returned to the first @ - @ class game for the first time since 2006 , and alfonso lopez . stiff took 31 wickets , more than double his previous first @ - @ - wicket total , and willoughby took 20 , his highest return in an english domestic season . somerset lacked an orthodox spin ##ner in 2009 following the departure of ian blackwell the previous season , and the pair together only took 10 wickets , bowling more overs between them than willoughby alone . somerset began their season by playing out a two @ - @ scoring series at home against warwickshire , in which both players passed 500 in their first innings . james hildreth scored a triple @ - @ century , reaching the milestone earlier in an english season than any player previously , and becoming the first english player to score 300 runs in an innings for somerset since harold gimblett in 1948 . in contrast , somerset had to battle durham for a draw in their second match . after durham made 543 in their first innings , somerset fell to 69 all out without reply ; only langer passed 20 runs , while six of his batting colleaguesall failed . after being forced to follow @ - @ on , trescothick , langer and kieswetter all scored centuries to secure a draw . somerset ' s third match resulted in their first defeat of the county championship season , again against nottinghamshire at trent bridge ; and at the end of may , they were still bottom of the first division . their fourth match finished in a draw against lancashire , a result which was always reached when the first day was away to lancashire . somerset next picked up victories against warwickshire and sussex before achieving the highest @ - @ - @ fourth innings run total in the county championship to beat yorkshire at taunton . these three wins propelled somerset to third in the competition at the end of july , and they did not fall below this position for the remainder of the season . in each of their following two matches , at home against nottinghamshire and away to worcestershire , somerset batted first and then followed the lead @ - @ on after bowling their opponents out cheaply . in both their opponents failed to avoid defeat , and both matches ended in draws . during the worcestershire match , langer ' s first innings 107 took him past sir donald bradman ' s record of 28 @ , @ 067 and @ - @ class runs to become the highest @ - @ scoring somerset batsman . further defeats against nottinghamshire , warwickshire , sussex and yorkshire meant that somerset travelled to durham requiring a victory to have any realistic chance of claiming the county championship title . no victory was achieved on the third and fourth days , and the match ended in a draw , leaving somerset with only a slim ##mer chance of the title . a draw , against yorkshire , while durham beat nottinghamshire , meant that somerset retained the title . somerset drew with worcestershire ( their ninth win in a row in the competition ) , and finished third in the first division . = = = season standings = = = note : pld = played , w = wins , l = losses , d = draws , t = ties , a = away , p
