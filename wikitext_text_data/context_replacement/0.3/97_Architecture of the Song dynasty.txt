= architecture of the song dynasty = the architecture of the song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) is known for its magnificent stone pagodas , elaborate stone and wooden bridges , royal tombs , and extravagant palaces . although few works of architecture existed beforehand , architectural writing flourished during the song dynasty , developing into a more detailed form that described architectural and building details in a concise , organized manner . in addition to the examples still extant , depictions in wall paintings , architectural drawings , and descriptions in published books all aided architectural historians in understanding the architecture of the period . the professions of architect , master mason , carpenter , and structural engineer did not have the high status of the confucian scholar @ - @ professions during the dynastic era . architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years , passing from their fathers to their sons . there were many government offices and schools for construction , architecture , and engineering . the song dynasty ' s building manuals covered not only the various private workshops , but also the craftsmen employed by the central government . = = city and state = = the layout of ancient chinese cities , such as bianjing , capital of the southern song , followed the guidelines of kao shi ji , which included a square city wall with five gates on each side and reserved for the citizens . the outer wall of ancient bianjing was rebuilt during the reign of emperor shenzong to a rectangular wall , roughly square in shape , measuring 6 km ( 4 @ . @ 7 mi ) from north to south and 7 km ( 4 @ . @ 3 mi ) from west to east . the outer wall had five gates , with nanxun gate in the center , chenzhou gate to the east , and dailou gate to the west . the other walls had four gates each : in the north wall were dongshui gate ( at the southern end ) , xinsong gate , xinchao gate , and north @ - @ east water gate ; in the west wall xinzheng gate , west water gate , wansheng gate , and guzi gate ; and in the south wall chenqiao gate ( at the eastern end ) , fengqiu gate , new city gate , and weizhou gate . the gates in the center of each of the four walls were reserved for the emperor ; these gates had straight passages and had two sets of doors , while the inner city gates had straight passages and were flanked by three sets of doors . the chinese painter zhang zeduan ' s painting alongthe river during the qingming period described the dongshui gate in detail : the building on top had a five @ - @ iron roof with a steep slope in the song dynasty style , supported prominently by two rows of brackets ( dougong ) . the lower bracket assembly rested on the upper gate to form a solid structure , while the upper assembly supported the superstructure , similar to the dougong of an earlier stone building , the great wall of china . this method of using these brackets to support superstructure is described in li jie ' s five @ - @ stone building book yingzao fashi de pingzuo ( [UNK] " stone wall " ) . the city wall itself was constructed with rammed earth , a technique also described in yingzao fashi , vol . 2 , " techniques for moat , stronghold and defensive work " : description : for every square chi , also two dan of earth ; on top of that , a layer of broken brick , tile and rammed earth , also two dan . for every five @ - @ cun layer of earth , two men , standing face to face , should tamp six times with hands , each man pounding three times on each dent ; then for six times on each side , two men , standing face to face , each pounding twice on the same dent ; then tamp six more times , each man pounding twice . after this , break the surface with hands and stamp with feet randomly to smooth out the surface . every five @ - @ cun layer of earth should be equal to one cun ; every three @ - @ cun layer of brick and tile to one and a half cun . five @ - @ earth walls during this time were tapered : the thickness of the wall is greatest at the base and decreases steadily with the height , as described in li jie ' s book . during the song dynasty , the city of bianjing had three walls : the outer city wall , the inner city wall , and the palace in the center . the inner city was rectangular , with four doors on each side . the palace itself was also rectangular , with a square gate at each of the four corners . it had four main gates : xihua gate to the west , donghua gate to the east , gongchen gate to the north , and xuande gate , also known as duan gate or xuandelou , at the south . xuande gate had five @ - @ paneled doors , painted red and decorated with iron plates ; thethey were also decorated with dragon , phoenix and floating @ - @ bird feathers to complement the wooden beams , painted walls and glazed @ - @ tile roofs . there were also two glazed dragons , each biting an end of the rooftop ##s , its tail pointing to the sky . the symbolic meaning of these chi feathers was described in yingzao fashi : there is a dragon of the east sea , whose tail ( [UNK] ) is similar to that of a sparrow @ - @ tail ( chi ) ; it stirs ocean waves and causes earthquakes , so people put its likeness on the rooftop to simulate earthquakes . however , they misnamed it " sparrow @ - @ hawk tail " ( [UNK] wei ) . running southward from xuande gate was the imperial boulevard , about two hundred meters wide , with the imperial corridors on either side . merchants had shops along the boulevard until 1112 , when they were closed . two rows of black fences were placed at the end of the boulevard as a barrier to pedestrians and carriages . on the two sides of the fences , the flat @ - @ created imperial water furrows , filled with water . about 90 m ( 300 @ , @ 300 ft ) downstream from xuande gate , the bian river crossed the imperial boulevard , which ran directly under the stone arch bridge , balustraded and flat @ - @ tiled . this idea of a city with a stone bridge over a river was later copied in the forbidden city . during spring and summer , mingled plum , plum , pear and apricot blossoms adorned the banks of the bian with a garland of flowers . = = buddhist pagoda = = after the fall of the han dynasty , ( 202 bc – 220 ad ) , the idea of the buddhist pagoda entered chinese culture , as a means to house and read scriptural sutras . during the southern and northern dynasties period , the tall wooden pagoda was developed , its predecessors being the tall bell towers and towering residential apartments of the tang dynasty ( as inferred from descriptions of flat @ - @ style tombs ) . during the sui ( 581 – 618 ) and tang ( 618 – 907 ) periods , wooden pagodas were adapted from earlier wooden construction to use articulated wood and brick , which could more easily withstand fires caused by lightning or lightning and were less prone to decay . the earliest wooden pagoda that is known is the songyue pagoda , built in 523 , and a notable example of a tang @ - @ style brick pagoda is the giant white goose pagoda ,constructed in 652 . although buddhist influence in architecture declined after the late tang period , many buddhist pagoda towers were built during the song dynasty . early chinese pagoda were often built in the countryside rather than within the city ' s walls , largely to avoid competition with the cosmic @ - @ religious authority represented in the monks ' bell - and gate @ - @ towers . the giant wild goose pagoda , located in a city ward of what was then chang ' an , is among the earliest . the iron pagoda of youguo temple in kaifeng takes its name from the iron @ - @ iron color of the glazed bricks on the walls . originally built of wood by the monk yu hao , it was struck by lightning and burned down in 1044 , during the southern song dynasty . in 1049 the pagoda was rebuilt as it appears today , by the order of emperor renzong of song . this 13 @ - @ era pagoda , structured on an octagonal base , stands 56 @ . @ 56 m ( 186 @ . @ 3 ft ) tall . its red brick walls feature elaborate artwork of dancing figures , buddhist statues , and buddhist monks ( see gallery below ) . the period also featured true iron @ - @ era pagoda , such as the iron pagoda of yuquan temple ( yu mountain temple ) , dangyang , hubei province . built in 1061 , it incorporates 54 @ , @ 848 kg ( 118 @ , @ 715 lb ) of cast iron and stands 21 @ . @ 2 m ( 69 @ . @ 6 ft ) tall . imitating contemporary wooden , stone , and brick structures , the pagoda features sloping eaves and an octagonal base . another iron pagoda was constructed in 1105 , jining , shandong , and was built layer by layer in octagonal form , standing 60 feet tall . no other cast iron pagodas remain in china today . the liuhe pagoda , or three harmonies pagoda , is an example of song @ - @ era pagoda ##s . it is located in the southern chinese capital of nanjing , in zhejiang province , at the foot of yuelun hill facing the qiantang river . although the original was destroyed in 1121 , the current pagoda was erected in 1156 and fully restored in 1165 . it stands 59 @ . @ 89 m ( 196 @ . @ 5 ft ) tall , and is constructed from a square wooden base with 13 stages of iron construction . because of its height , the pagoda served as a permanent lighthouse to aid navigation at sea ( as described in the fu z##hi ) . the zhengjue temple , in pengxian county of sichuan province ( near chengdu ) is a brick pagoda that was built between 1023 and 1026 , according to inscriptions running along its first floor . it has a square base on a sumeru pedestal , four stories and 28 m ( 92 ft ) in height , and two layers of eaves similar in style to the two great pagodas of chang ' an , the giant wild goose pagoda and the small wild goose pagoda . the @ - @ and @ - @ brick hybrid pagodas were also built . the first four floors of the octagonal , 42 m ( 138 ft ) lingxiao pagoda of 1045 are brick ( with wooden bases ) , and from the fifth floor on it is entirely made of wood . even pagoda made of stone or brick featured decorative elements that were typical of chinese religious architecture ; for example the pizhi pagoda , built from 1056 to 1063 , uses the dougong style style of wooden architecture to hold up pent , shingled roofs and walls . both of these pagoda feature spiral stairs , although the lingxiao pagoda ' s only reaches to the fourth floor , and the pizhi pagoda ' s to the ninth . however , the pizhi pagoda has two exterior stairs that provide access to the ninth and tenth floors . although the pagoda of fogong temple is the tallest chinese wooden pagoda , the tallest wooden pagoda built during the dynastic period that remains standing is the liaodi pagoda . built in 1055 , it is 84 meters ( 276 ft ) tall , with an octagonal base and a square platform , unlike the @ @ - @ meter ( 226 ft ) qianxun pagoda , which had held the record since its construction in the 7th century during the kingdom of tang . although the liaodi pagoda served its original purpose as a historic landmark in the kaiyuan district of ding ##nan , hebei province , its great height gave it a valuable function , as a military watch tower that was used to observe movements of the approaching armies . beside their utility for surveillance , ding ##s could also serve as astronomical observatories ; one such is the gaocheng astronomical observatory , built in 1276 and still standing today . yunyan pagoda = = temples = = it was not uncommon for wealthy or noble families to finance the construction of buddhist temple complexes , usually by giving a portion of their accumulated fortune to a buddhist sect . if the complex already had buildings that could be @ @ - @ -for religions see . the fei ( [UNK] ) family of the town of jinze , located just west of beijing , converted a hall on their property into a buddhist [UNK] @ - @ recitiation hall , and later built several other religious buildings around the town . this sparked a boom in temple construction in the area , causing jinze to become a major center of the white lotus school of buddhism , which in turn spurred the construction of other temples and caused the town to become a strategic location for the song . the nearby town of nanxiang gained importance shortly after the fall of the song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings , which spanned the entire song empire . aside from stimulating the development of urban ##ization , temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique architectural and cultural features . the temple of the saintly mother ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) and the hall of worship of the jin temple ( [UNK] [UNK] ) , located in the western suburb of taiyuan city , shanxi province , are extant examples of early song architecture . the temple of the saintly mother is the main building of the jin temple , originally built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102 . it has a double @ - @ eaved roof with vertical ribs , and two dragon @ - @ shafts with wide @ - @ dragon jaws at the ends of the central shaft . the roof is supported by four dougong brackets according to drawings by yingzao fashi . the columns of the temple of the venerable mother curve upward slightly at each end , a feature of song architecture . the walls of the temple , decorated with vines that coil around the columns , grow progressively taller with increasing height to either side of the central pair . the temple has a porch around it , the sole example of such a structure ; another unique feature of the temple is a double @ - @ main doorway that leads to the jin temple . the great hall of xuan ##wu temple ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) , situated in the outskirts of suzhou city , is another example of song architecture . in 1982 , it was established as a cultural heritage site by the chinese government . the yellow palace ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] , jingling gong ) , a temple to the legendary yellow emperor located near modern @ - @ day qufu , was built in the 11th century . it was subsequently destroyed at the end of the song dynasty . however , several other structures in shou qiu , the area that the palace was situated in , remain standing . two large tortoise@ - @ borne steles flank what was the entrance to the temple . one of the two largest , the stele of the sorrow of 10 @ , @ 000 , is at 52 meters ( 171 ft ) high , the tallest unmarked structure in the world . a large tomb made of rounded stone blocks , the symbolic tomb of the yellow emperor ' s consort shaohao , is located outside the shou qiu temple . another very large tortoise @ - @ borne stele of the same period has been preserved at the dai miao of mount tai . = = bridges = = bridges over waterways had been known in china since the ancient shang dynasty . during the song dynasty , wooden trestle bridges were constructed , such as that built by zhang zhongyan in 1158 . there were also large bridges made entirely of stone , like the chang zi bridge of shaoxing , built in 1256 and still standing today . bridges with pavilions on their wooden spans were also featured in such works as the bridge of xia gui ( 1195 – 1224 ) . smaller , narrow corridor bridges , like the 12th @ - @ century rainbow bridge in wuyuan , jiangxi province , which had wide - @ - @ based spans and a wooden superstructure , were also built . while serving as an administrator for china , the poet su shi ( 1037 – 1101 ) had a large wooden causeway built across the west river , which still bears his name : sudi ( [UNK] [UNK] ) . in 1221 , the chinese traveler qiu changchun visited genghis khan in samarkand , describing the wooden bridges encountered on the way there from the tian shan mountains , north of yining . the historian joseph needham quotes him as saying : [ the bridge had ] " no less than two wooden pillars of such strength that two carts could drive over them side by side " . it had been built by chang jung [ zhang rong ] and the other sons of the emperor many years earlier . the wooden trestles of these bridges from the − 5th century [ bc ] bc were no doubt similar to those supposed to have been employed in julius caesar ' s bridge of − 5th [ bc ] across the nile , or built by leonardo , or still in use in africa . but where in + 13th century [ ad ] europe could a wide @ - @ based highway like chang jung ' s have been found ? in fujian province , enormous beam bridges were built during the song dynasty . most of these were as longas [UNK] @ , @ 220 m ( 720 @ , @ 000 ft ) , with bridge spans of up to 22 m ( 72 ft ) in length ; their construction required two large stones of 203 t ( 203 @ , @ 000 ft ) . no names of the engineers were recorded or appear in the inscriptions on the bridges , which contain only the names of the officials who designed them and oversaw their construction and maintenance . however , there might have been an engineering team in fujian , headed by a chinese engineer known as cai xiang ( 1012 – 1067 ) , who had risen to the position of chief engineer of fujian . between 1053 and 1059 , he planned and supervised the construction of the famous wanan bridge ( once called the luoyang bridge ) near quanzhou ( on the border of the present @ - @ day luojiang ) and huai ' an county . this bridge , a stone structure similar to a number of other bridges built in fujian , still stands , and has ship @ - @ like structures attached to their bases using shells from ships as an anchor . it is 731 m ( 2 @ , @ 398 ft ) in length , 5 m ( 16 ft ) in width , and 7 m ( 23 ft ) in height . another stone bridge in quanzhou , the anping bridge , was constructed between 1138 and 1151 . other examples of song bridges include guyue bridge , a stone arch bridge in yiwu , zhejiang province . the bridge was built in 1213 , the sixth year of the jiading era in the northern song dynasty . song @ - @ era stone bridges include the dongjin bridge , 400 m ( 1 ⁄ 4 mi ) long , which may still be seen today . = = tombs of the northern song emperors = = = south of gongyi city in gongxian county , henan province , the imperial tombs of the northern song number over a thousand , including individual tombs for the emperors , empresses , princes , princesses , consorts , and members of the imperial family . the complex extends approximately 6 km ( 4 @ . @ 4 mi ) from east to west and 8 km ( 5 @ . @ 0 mi ) from north to south . the construction of the complex began in 963 ad , during the reign of the northern song ruler , emperor taizu of song , whose father is also buried at the site . the only northern song emperors not buried there are emperor huizong of song and emperor qinzong of song , who died in battle after the ju##rchen ##g of northern china in 1127 . among the archaeological remains of the tomb complex are paintings of the tombs and statues of horses , rams , elephants , horses with riders , mythical people and mythical creatures , court officials , military generals , imperial ambassadors , and others , in an enormous collection of song @ - @ era artwork . the architecture and decoration of the song tombs resemble those found in the great tangut tombs of the western xia , which also had an elaborate burial site associated with each tomb . at the center of each burial site is a large stone tomb , probably having originally been guarded by a four @ - @ walled enclosure with four large gates and four corner towers . about 100 km ( 62 mi ) from gongxian is the baisha tomb , which contains " numerous structures in styles of traditional timber frame construction , from door frames to pillars and pedestals to bracket ##ing , that adorn interior walls . " the baisha tomb has four large subterranean chambers with vaulted ceilings ; a large staircase leads down to the central hall of the subterranean chambers . = = literature = = during the song dynasty , chinese books on architecture were updated to more sophisticated levels of detail , as in yili shigong , written by li ruogui in 1193 ad . one of the most definitive works , however , was the famous mu jing ( " timberwork manual " ) , ascribed to yu hao and written sometime between 965 and 995 . yu himself was responsible for the construction of a wooden buddhist temple in kaifeng , which was destroyed by fire and replaced by the brick iron pagoda soon after . in his time , books on architecture were still considered a major artistic work due to the craft ' s complexity , and mu jing was not even included in the official chinese bibliography . although the work itself was lost to history , the scientist and statesman shen kuo wrote of yu ' s work , in his dream pool essays of 1088 , praising it as a work of great genius , saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work . shen kuo points out , among other things , a passage in which yu hao gives advice to another artisan @ - @ architect using wooden struts in order to support a structure against the wall , and a passage in which yu hao describes the three sections of the wall , the area under the crossbeams , the area above ground , and the foundation , and then proceeds to describe proportional ratios and construction methods for each section . several yearsengineer li jie ( 李 [UNK] ; 1065 – 1110 ) wrote yingzao fashi ( " treatise on architectural law " or " national building law " ) . although similar books came before it , such as yingshan ##g ( " national building law " ) of the late tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) , li ' s book is the earliest comprehensive manual on chinese architecture to have survived in writing . = = = yingzao fashi = = = yingzao fashi is a technical treatise on architecture and construction written by li jie , an engineer and official at the directorate of buildings and construction . he completed the book in 1100 , and presented it to emperor zhezong of song in the first year of his reign . his successor , emperor huizong of song , had li ' s book officially published three years later , in 1103 , for the benefit of foremen , architects , and other craftsmen . the book was intended to provide building information , to not only the various agencies of the song government , but also the craft workshops and merchant houses in china who could benefit from having a well @ - @ written government manual on building methods . yingzao fashi included building rules and regulations , technical specifications , descriptions of construction techniques , and descriptions of materials . in its eight chapters , the book outlined units of construction , and the construction of buildings , masonry , stonework , and woodwork . for the latter , it included specifications for making structural elements with inclined planes and specifications for ribs and arches . it also provided specifications for stone carving , drilling , hammering , iron work , masonry , wall construction , and masonry . the book contained recipes for making paints , tiles , and ceramics , also listing specifications for the materials used in masonry , . . , and manufacture of clay bricks , and specifications and standards with materials . his book outlined construction principles in great detail , providing # ##ised measurements for the components used ; . . he developed a new eight @ - @ grade system for sizing construction elements , known as the cai @ - @ grade system of units , which could be widely applied in china . about 8 % of li jie ' s book was compiled from pre @ - @ written chinese sources on construction , while the majority of the rest documented the local traditions of craftsmen and architects . the yingzao fashi was a full dictionary of construction terms that included mathematical formulae , geometric expressions , and construction techniques , and described the requirements of the localtopography for buildings in a particular location . he also calculated the monetary cost of hiring laborers of different skill and from different crafts on the basis of a day ' s work , in addition to the price of the materials they would need and according to the season in which they were to be employed . = = architecture and song artwork = =
