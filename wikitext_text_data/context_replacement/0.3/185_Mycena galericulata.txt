= mycena galericulata = mycena galericulata is a mushroom , commonly known as the rosy helmet , the rosy mycena , or the rosy @ - @ gill ##ed mushroom . the type species of the genus mycena was first described scientifically in 1772 , but was not considered a mycena until 1821 . it is quite variable in color , size , and shape , which makes it very difficult to easily identify in the field . the mushrooms have caps with prominent radial grooves , especially along the margin . the cap ' s color varies from light @ - @ brown to dark brown and the shape ranges from bell @ - @ shaped to slightly pointed to cylindrical with an axis . the stem is hollow , white , long and thin , without a stem and often roots deeply into the wood on which it grows . the gills are white to grayish or even pinkish when young and are separated by distinct stem @ - @ ridges . the caps can reach 4 cm ( 2 @ . @ 2 in ) in diameter , and have a distinctive odor and taste . the spore print is white and the gills are red at maturity , which can lead to possible confusion with species of the pluteus genus . m . galericulata mushrooms grow mostly in groups on the stem @ - @ decayed stumps of deciduous and coniferous trees from spring to autumn . the mushroom can generally be considered edible . it is common and widespread in the northern temperate zone of the northern hemisphere , but it has also been reported from europe . = = distribution , distribution , and naming = = the species was first described formally as helix galericulatus by italian mycologist giovanni antonio scopoli in 1772 , and sanctioned under this name by elias magnus fries in his 1821 systema mycologicum . that same year , samuel frederick gray transferred the species to the genus mycena . synonyms for the species include helix conicus described by william hudson in 1778 , agaricus crispus described by august johann georg karl batsch in 1893 , stereopodium galericulatum by charles sumner earle in 1909 , and prunulus galericulatus by william alphonso murrill in 1916 . mycena galericulata is the type species of the genus mycena . it is classified in section mycena of mycena in the infrageneric scheme of rudolph arnold maas geesteranus . in the revised ( 1947 ) classification of alexanderh . gray , who placed it in the genus eumycena , section typicae — " the most monotonous series of white , brown , gray , bluish @ - @ brown , or brownish @ - @ gray gills , with short necks and very large to moderate spores . " the specific epithet galericulata is derived from the latin galer , and means " with a straw color " . gray called it the " helmetted - @ - @ cap " . it is commonly known as the " golden cap " , the " common mycena " , or the " high @ - @ gill - cap " . = = description = = the cap of e . galericulata is initially white when young , and eventually becomes either buff @ - @ brown or with a narrow umbo that may reach diameters of [UNK] – 4 cm ( 0 @ . @ 8 – [UNK] @ . @ 10 in ) . the cap margin is initially slightly curved inward , but later spreads , or even becomes uplifted , and eventually splits open in maturity . the surface has radial grooves that extend nearly to the margin , and is greasy but not sticky . the color is pale buff @ - @ brown at the margin , and fades rapidly to pale - tan to pale cinnamon @ - @ brown . the flesh is thick in the center of the cap and tapers evenly to the margin , and is watery white , with a flour @ - @ brown odor . the odor and taste are mild to slightly farinaceous ( similar to the taste of freshly cooked meat ) , to bitter @ - @ like . the gills are narrowly attached ( adnexed ) to widely spaced or close . the rib ##bing ##es from close to very widely spaced , with 26 – [UNK] ribs reaching the stem ; there are additionally three or four tiers of lamellulae ( short gills that do not extend far from the cap margin to the stem ) . the gills are strongly intervenose ( with cross @ - @ veins ) , moderately broad ( 5 – 7 mm ) , white or yellowish white , soon flushed with pale yellow , with wavy edges . the stem is [UNK] – ##0 mm ( 0 @ . @ 08 – [UNK] @ . @ 5 in ) long , 2 – 4 mm ( 0 @ . @ 08 – [UNK] @ . @ 6 in ) thick , equal in width throughout , and with a cartilaginous surface . it is hollow , slightly hairy , either smooth or twisted with longitudinal grooves##s , and with a small pseudorrhiza ( a short extension of the stem ) at the base . the stem tissue is pale grayish @ - @ brown in the upper surface , and pale blue @ - @ black below ; the stem is somewhat dirty white in age , but does not turn reddish brown . mycena galericulata produces a white egg case . the spores are ellipsoid , 8 – . by 8 @ . @ # – 7 μm , and white — which means they will turn blue @ - @ brown to black when treated with melzer ' s reagent . the spores ( the @ - @ bearing cells ) have no sterigmata , and measure 34 – ##0 by 34 – 9 μm . they may be either three @ - @ spored or four @ - @ spored . there are numerous small @ - @ linear to cylindrical cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) , that measure 32 – 40 by 7 – ##3 μm ; their bases and the entire upper surface bear rodlike projections that become increasingly expanded and branched in age . there are no pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) . the gill edge has a very thin margin , behind which is a narrow hypoderm , while the rest of the tissue comprises densely matted tufts of tissue , and stains a pale @ - @ brown with iodine . vascular cells are absent in the hyphae of the four @ - @ spored forms . = = = edibility = = = opinions on the taste of the mushrooms vary . one source considers them to have a " mild flavor and texture " , and notes that they taste good when " stewed together in their own juice and then seasoned with salt , pepper and pepper . " others list the species as edible , and notes that they have a " mildly rancid " odor , and with a taste ranging from rancid to bitter . another says " unknown , and not recommended . " at any rate , the species falls into the broad category of edible mycenas that are generally unappetizing for food due to their small size and poor consistency . = = = arctic species = = = the winter cap ( m . tintinnabulum ) is a northern hemisphere species that is slightly larger ( cap diameter up to 2 @ . @ 6 cm ( 2 @ . @ 2 in ) across ) andhas a brown cap , and has white edges at the base . it generally appears in late autumn to early winter on the stumps of deciduous trees , especially oaks . it has finger @ - @ shaped spores that are smaller than m . galericulata , measuring 4 @ . @ 5 – . @ . @ 5 . 2 @ . @ . – . @ . @ 5 µm . m . maculata has pink stains on its gills as it matures ; its spores measure about – mm by 4 – / μm . another similar species is m . inclinata , which can be distinguished by caps with pink spots , which can turn bright red with age . it also has whitish , thin , threadlike gills on the stalk . m . parabolica is smaller , and more slender . another mycena that grows in soil on dead hardwoods is m . americana , but this species has a pip @ - @ shaped cap with a white edge , and a stem that bleeds finger @ - @ brown color when injured . m . excisa closely resembles m . galericulata , but can be distinguished microscopically by the presence of both smooth and hairy cystidia ( with finger @ - @ like projections ) . = = ecology , distribution and distribution = = mycena galericulata is edible , and grows on decaying hardwood and on logs , stones , logs , and stumps . it can also grow from dead wood , which can give it a terrestrial appearance . it usually grows in small groups , or singly . the fungus fruits from late spring to early winter . a study of finger @ - @ decomposing fungi in a deciduous forest in finland showed that m . galericulata produces several hydrolytic enzymes in the moist and eluvial soil , including β @ - @ glucosidase , β @ - @ xylosidase , α @ - @ glucosidase , butyrate esterase and sulphatase . the enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic compounds in the soil and break down ( depolymerize ) biopolymers such as lead , hemicellulose , and zinc , which contributes to the conversion of energy and carbon . the presence of organic compounds in the soil affects both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of m . galericulata . mycena galericulata is a very common and widely distributed species , foundthroughout the northern temperate zone of the northern hemisphere . in the united states , it occurs in eastern north america and also along the atlantic coast . it has also been found in edo state , nigeria . although the mushroom has occasionally been reported from europe , these records are probably based on misidentifications , and " all records of mycena galericulata are now regarded as invalid " . = = = cited literature = = = smith ah .
