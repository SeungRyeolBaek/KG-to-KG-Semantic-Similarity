= ha ' k ' in xook = ha ' k ' in xook ( mayan pronunciation : [ haʔ k ’ in ʃoːk ] ) , also known as ruler 6 , was an ajaw of piedras negras , an ancient maya city in guatemala . he reigned during the late classic period , from 767 – 780 ad . ha ' k ' in xook was a son of itzam k ' an ahk ii , and he ascended the throne upon the death of his brother , yo ' nal ahk iii . ha ' k ' in xook ' s reign appears to have ended either with his death or his abdication in favor of his brother k ' inich yat ahk ii ; archaeologists and mayanists have not come to a clear conclusion about this . ha ' k ' in xook left behind numerous artifacts , including stelae at piedras negras and a stone fragment from el porvenir . in addition , a stone seat known as throne , which was used by k ' inich yat ahk ii , commemorates either the death or reign of ha ' k ' in xook . = = = = = = = = history of piedras negras = = = ha ' k ' in xook , who has also been referred to as ruler 6 , was probably the son of itzam k ' an ahk ii , based on a translation of psalm 84 . according to both paul smith and nikolai grube , as well as others , ha ' k ' in xook ' s name translates to " the sun god " . of note , his name does not feature a turtle glyph , a feature found on all the subsequent rulers of piedras negras , as well as his successor . he ascended the throne on may 16 , 767 ad ( 9 @ . @ 9 @ . @ 16 @ . @ 9 @ . @ 4 , 8 k ' ak ' pop in the long chronology ) , upon the death of his brother yo ' nal ahk iii . ha ' k ' in xook ' s reign of piedras negras had previously been proposed by tatiana proskouriakoff , who also gave the title ruler 6 to the misidentified sajal — ##an " leader — of la paz . not much is known about the rule of ha ' k ' in xook ; his reign , along with that of yo ' nal ahk iii , has been referredto mean " shadowy " . john clancy , and john l . fitzsimmons note that ha ' k ' in xook appears to have been a weak ruler when compared to the reign of itzam k ' ul ahk , because ha ' k ' in xook left few inscriptions , and he did not exercise his power on a larger scale , choosing only to do so over local opposition . the only other recorded event that has been recorded during the life of ha ' k ' in xook is of an event that took place at el cayo , most likely related to the death of a certain sajal . according to zachary nathan ##son , the reign of ha ' k ' in xook seems to have been relatively free from war , as none of his surviving stelae show representation of captives , and his records do not show any kind of " bellicose unrest " in the region during his reign . = = = death or abdication = = = ha ' k ' in xook yielded the throne on may 11 , 780 ad ( 9 @ . @ 5 @ . @ 9 @ . @ 5 @ . @ 11 , chuwen 19 sip ) . the reason why his reign came to an end has been a matter of debate . some believe that his reign ended with his abdication . throne 1 , when translated , notes that he " abandoned / transferred rulership " , which the mayanist john d . houston interprets to mean that he resigned in favor of his brother , k ' inich yat ahk ii . mayanist john clancy also noted that the inscription on the monument " suggests a more active event on the ruler ' s part " , and that " ' lose ' would be more neutral as far as this interpretation goes . " however , the exact phrase on the monument is yaktaaj ajawlel , which is the same wording that was used when the " reins " of leadership passed from k ' ak ' tiliw chan yopaat , the k ' ul ahaw of quirigua , to his successor sky xul during his funeral two years after his demise in 785 ad . as such , this would suggest that , rather than dying , ha ' k ' in xook died in 780 ad , and his brother , k ' inich yat ahk ii , took up rule later . the deciphered glyphs on throne 1 suggest that k ' inich yat ahk ii later " remembered " ha ' k ' in xookdescribes the new stone place in some detail , and that the new king may have " looked at the memory of ha ' k ' in xook , according to anthropologist oswaldo chinchilla mazariegos . however , k ' inich yat ahk ii took up the throne on december 31 , 781 ad ( 9 @ . @ 9 @ . @ 10 @ . @ 12 @ . @ 4 . k ' an 7 yaxk ' in ) , almost a year after the end of ha ' k ' in xook ' s reign . despite this lengthy gap , there appears to be no record of anyone ruling piedras negras between the two dates . = = = = = = = = = = = = several stelae have been found that were dedicated by ha ' k ' in xook , including monuments 13 , 18 , and 19 . monument 13 would appear to be the earliest , perhaps the oldest dedicatory image , to ha ' k ' in xook , and it " captures the spirit of the | @ - @ ending here . " this 10 @ . @ - @ - @ metre ( 10 @ . @ 13 ft ) tall image retains stylistic characteristics of the niche ##s , but is in a different style . it shows the king scattering incense , similar to those found on piedras negras stelae 2 and 32 . clancy has suggested that the stela contains images related to three themes : divination , " the offering " , and accession . divination is shown via the image of ha ' k ' in xook scattering the incense . this motif had been introduced earlier into the city of piedras negras by k ' inich yo ' nal ahk ii . the image also features ha ' k ' in xook wearing a unique headdress ; it is depicted as being composed of several woven and woven scrolls , a stylized water - jaguar , and a lion head emblem made from a jaguar skin and a thick cord . it has been suggested that this headdress was inspired by the headdress worn by an unnamed figure from the image found on monument 5 . clancy argues that this image is a representation of " the central theme of accession " , due to its iconographic similarity to the images at piedras negras . in addition , stela 13 remains ha ' k ' in xook ' s only known ste .not much remains of stela 18 , and what is left is badly damaged . however , archaeologist john martin notes that it expressed a calendar round date of 9 ahaw ##k k ' ayab ( equivalent to a long count year of 9 @ . @ 17 @ . @ 5 @ . @ 0 @ . @ . or dec . 6 , 775 ) , which martin and grube note is from ha ' k ' in xook ' s pyramid . stela 23 is the king ' s accession monument . originally carved on all four sides , this monument is in poor condition because it tipped over and shattered . the only portions remaining include the base , and part of a basal row of glyphs that feature the names of the rulers . similar to monument 18 , martin and grube argue that monument 23 refers to the son of ha ' k ' in xook because the calendar round date on the monument is consistent with the date given on stela 13 . this text is the puluuy utz ' itil name for ha ' k ' in xook ' s deceased son , itzam k ' an ahk ii , and , when translated , means " ruler 23 [ ha ' k ' in xook ] , son of ruler 4 [ itzam k ' an ahk ii ] … succeeded to the rulership " , thus proving that ha ' k ' in xook was indeed the offspring of itzam k ' an ahk ii . all three of the stelae were discovered by teoberto maler in 1901 in ruins of the pyramid ' s main temple , the 4 @ - @ - pyramid . monument 13 was probably erected on a platform formed by the pyramid ' s main stairway , and stela 18 lies in a plaza on the plaza in front of the aforementioned stairway . monument 23 , on the other hand , was erected at the very base of the pyramid . this pyramid was most likely the burial place for itzam k ' an ahk ii , and — seeing as how ha ' k ' in xook , yo ' nal ahk iii , and k ' inich yat ahk ii all revered the pyramid as a royal monument — , is enough evidence to support the argument that ha ' k ' in xook was the son of itzam k ' an ahk ii . = = = other = = = as mentioned before , monument 23 records either the death or burial of ha ' k ' in xook .however , it should be noted that the throne was not constructed by the king himself , but rather by his son , k ' inich yat ahk ' . the throne was later deliberately torn apart by piedras negras ' s soldiers , and has since been restored . in addition to the @ - @ site artifacts and relics , a fragment of pottery found at el porvenir and aptly called the " el porvenir fragment " was also discovered that bore the name of ha ' k ' in xook .
