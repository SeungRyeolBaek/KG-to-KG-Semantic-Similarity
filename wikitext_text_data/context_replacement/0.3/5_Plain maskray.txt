= plain maskray = the plain maskray or spotted stingray ( neotrygon annotata ) is a species of stingray in the family dasyatidae . it is found in shallow , 8 @ - @ sl habitats off western australia . reaching 24 cm ( 9 @ . @ 9 in ) in length , this species has a whip @ - @ like , dark green pectoral fin disc . the long , whip @ - @ like tail has alternating brown and white bands and dark folds above and below . there are two rows of thorns on the back and the base of the tail , but otherwise the skin is smooth . although this species possesses the characteristic whip @ - @ like pattern across its eyes common to its genus , it is not uniformly coloured like other maskrays . benthic in lifestyle , the plain maskray feeds primarily on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms , and to a lesser extent on small bony fishes . it is reproductive , with females producing clutches of one or two young that are nourished during pregnancy via histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) . this species enters economic fisheries but is caught incidentally by bottom fishing , which it is thought to be less able to do than other maskrays due to its gracile nature . as it currently has a restricted distribution and low fecundity , the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) has assessed it as near threatened . = = taxonomy and distribution = = the first formal description of the plain maskray was authored by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation ( csiro ) researcher peter last in a 1987 volume of proceedings of the national museum of victoria . the specific name annotatus comes from the latin am ( " plain " ) and notatus ( " marked " ) , and refers to the ray ' s appearance . the holotype was a male 8 @ . @ 2 cm ( 8 @ . @ 3 in ) sl , collected off western australia ; several paratypes were subsequently described . last tentatively placed the species in the genus dasyatis , suggesting that it belonged to the " maskray " species group that also included the bluespotted rays ( also called kuhlii ) . in 2008 , last and william brown elevated the kuhlii group to the rank of the genus as neotrygon , on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis . in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna , the plain maskrayand the ningaloo maskray ( n . ningalooensis ) were found to be the most basal members of neotrygon . the divergence of the n . annotata population was estimated to have occurred ~ 54 ma . furthermore , the populations examined in the study sorted into two genetically distinct populations , suggesting that n . annotata is a distinct species complex . the two putative populations were estimated to have diverged ~ 4 @ . @ 50 ma ; the latter event was likely the displacement of the original population by coastline erosion . = = description = = the dorsal fin disc of the plain maskray is large and ring @ - @ shaped with narrowly rounded trailing margins , measuring 1 @ . @ 1 – ##0 @ . @ 3 times longer than wide . the leading margins of the disc are gently concave and are at a broad angle to the pointed tip of the snout . the compound eyes are located close together , and behind them are the spiracles . the nostrils are large and have a skirt @ - @ shaped strip of skin between them . the small mouth bears deep furrows at the corners and has two slender teeth at the front . small papillae are also found on the outside of the mouth . there are five pairs of gill slits . the pelvic fins are fairly large and rounded . the tail is short , barely half the length of the body when intact , and has a broad and flattened base leading to usually two stinging spines . after the tail , the tail is longer and bears a lower ventral fin fold and a slightly shorter , lower dorsal fin fold . most of the tail lacks stinging spines ; a midline row of 4 – 13 small , widely spaced thorns is present behind the eyes , and a row of 0 – long spines before the eyes . the dorsal coloration is grayish brown , becoming lighter towards the posterior end ; there is a dark mask @ - @ like shape around the eyes and a row of small dark blotches behind the spiracles . the tail behind the eyes has alternating black and white bands of varying width , ending with white at the tip . the belly is mostly white and the dorsal fin fold is pale yellow in color . this species grows to 15 cm ( 6 @ . @ 4 in ) long and 45 cm ( 18 in ) deep . = = distribution and distribution = = the plain maskray inhabits the continental shelf of eastern australia from the wellesley islands in queenslandto the bismarck archipelago in western indonesia , including the gulf of carpentaria and the timor and arafura seas . there are also reports that its range extends to southern papua new guinea . it is the only known of the several maskray species native to the pacific . this species is a delicate @ - @ bodied that prefers habitats with fine sediment . it has been recorded from between 12 and 62 m ( 39 and 203 ft ) deep , and tends to be found further away from shore than other maskrays throughout its range . = = biology and ecology = = the plain maskray generally lives at the bottom of the bottom substrate , rather than diving for food . its diet consists mainly of caridean shrimp and small worms . small bony fishes are also taken , along with the occasional penaeid prawn and shrimp . larger rays consume a greater variety of invertebrates and relatively fewer polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays . this species is parasitized by the bacterium acanthobothrium jonesi . like other stingrays , the plain maskray is viviparous with the developing embryo sustained to adulthood by histotroph ( " sea milk " ) produced by the mother . mature females have a single small ovary and uterus , on the underside . clutch size is one or two ; the eggs measure 12 – 14 cm ( 5 @ . @ 7 – 5 @ . @ 5 in ) across . males and females reach sexual maturity at disc sizes of 1 – 21 cm ( 8 @ . @ 1 – 8 @ . @ 3 in ) and 1 – 19 cm ( 7 @ . @ 1 – ##8 @ . @ 7 in ) across . the maximum lifespan is estimated to be 9 years for males and 5 years for females . = = total population = = the main economic threat to the plain maskray is incidental fishing by commercial bottom feeding fisheries . in the present day , this is mostly caused by australia ' s commercial prawn industry , which occurs throughout its range . although this species is discarded when caught , it is more delicate @ - @ bodied than other maskrays and is therefore unlikely to survive encounters with trawling vessels . however , this species may also have been negatively affected by japanese , chinese , and taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off western australia from 1959 to 1990 . these factors , coupled with the plain maskray ' s limited distribution and low survival rates , have resulted in it being assessedas near extinction by the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) . = 2011 – season columbus blue jackets record = the 2011 – season columbus blue jackets season was the team ' s 12th season in the national hockey league ( nhl ) . the blue jackets ' record of 0 – 46 – 7 [ - 14 ] was the worst record in the nhl for 2011 – , and the first time in franchise history they finished in last place . it also marked the second straight season that they missed the playoffs . consequently , they had the first chance to earn the first overall pick in the 2012 nhl entry draft lottery , but lost out to the edmonton oilers and received the first pick overall . the blue jackets started the season with the worst start in franchise history and the worst by any team in an nhl season in 20 years . after an impressive – . – days start , head coach scott arniel was fired and replaced by assistant coach mike richards . the following season saw several personnel changes including the trade of all @ - @ star forward jeff carter , who was released with much fanfare during the off @ - @ season . with the promise of a rebuild , the blue jackets ' captain and star player , steve nash , requested to be traded , though he would remain with the team for the following season . the team was involved in a controversial loss to the los angeles kings , when the game center clock appeared to freeze at 1 @ . @ 8 , allowing the kings time to score the tying goal , and win in overtime . during the season columbus had only two winning streaks of three or more games . one of which came towards the end of the season saw the blue jackets finish with 69 points , the third highest point total in franchise history . = = off @ - @ season = = during the off @ - @ season the blue jackets ' approach to building their roster changed , moving from a team of young developing players into one with established talent . the first deal general manager scott howson made was the acquisition of all @ - @ star forward jeff carter on june 30 , 2011 . the deal sent jakub voracek , columbus ' first @ - @ round draft choice , the second pick , and their third @ - @ round pick in the 2011 draft to the philadelphia flyers in exchange for cash . the trade received a mixed response in general from fans and management who felt they now had a number one center to play alongside of their best player , steve nash . next , they traded for the draft rights of soon to be free agent mark wisniewski . wis##niewski scored a career high 34 points during the 2010 – 11 season , splitting time between the new york islanders and montreal canadiens . the point total was fifth @ - @ highest in the nhl for defenseman history , tying tobias enstrom . the blue jackets came to terms with wisniewski , just an hour prior to the start of free agency , signing him to a six @ - @ up , $ 40 million contract . they also traded 2011 first round draft pick nikita filatov to the ottawa senators for a third @ - @ up pick in the 2011 draft . filatov had failed to live up to expectations in europe , playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals . prior to the start of the season , the blue jackets were criticized for not signing a veteran back @ -

[ source : ] the losing streak came to an end two days later with a win over the detroit red wings . during the game , two milestones were achieved . the wisniewskimade his nhl debut , ryan johansen and ryan murphy scored their first career nhl goals and ryan clitsome had a career @ - @ high five assists . columbus was unable to build any momentum from the start , however , and continued to struggle , culminating in a 2 – - – 1 record , which was the worst start to an nhl season for any team in 19 years . with the team struggling , management decided to " shake things up " by making some roster changes . the first move was the acquisition of forward mark letestu from the pittsburgh penguins . next , they traded defenseman kris bryant to the st . louis blues for nikita nikitin . as the clubs slow start continued , there were rumors that head coach mike arniel would be fired and replaced with ken hitchcock . hitchcock had previously coached the blue jackets to their only playoff appearance in club history and was still under contract with the franchise through to the end of the season . before any of these rumors came to fruition , the st . louis blues asked columbus for permission to hire hitchcock , which the blue jackets allowed . hitchcock began his blues ' season with a 6 – - – 2 record over his first seven games , while hitchcock amassed a 6 – 13 – points record to start the season . during the same time frame as the preseason began , goaltender curtis sanford returned from his shoulder injury on november 16 . he made his first start of the season against the boston bruins , losing 2 – goals in a shootout . sanford continued his strong play , posting a 3 – - – - [UNK] , 3 @ . @ 38 goals against average and . 947 save percentage over his next nine games . sanford started 12 consecutive games before steve mason made his first start . the number of injuries could not have been more numerous , but prior to the november 22 game , mason was hit in the head by a shot from steve nash during pre @ - @ game warm @ - @ ups and suffered a concussion . mason returned from his injury after two games , making the start against the vancouver canucks . he allowed only one goal in the game despite suffering from concussion in the third period , before being replaced by sanford for just over three minutes . vancouver won the game with – goals in a row , snapping a 5 @ - @ game losing streak to the canucks . after the game , arniel stated that sanford was now seen as the team ' s number one goaltender . however , mason started four of the next six games with the blue jackets going 0 – 5 – 1 during that stretch . = = = january –february = = = with the season continuing , more rumors began to surface . as before , the rumors were about player changes rather than coaching changes . the majority of rumors were that the blue jackets would trade steve nash . although howson stated that he had never brought up steve nash in discussions , several sources have inquired about his intentions . nash stated that if he felt it would suit the franchise better than he would be willing to exercise his 2012 @ - @ trade clause . howson publicly stated that he had no intention of trading nash . further rumors came to light when reports leaked to the des moines register that carter was unhappy in columbus and sought a trade . howson , carter and his agent all denied that a trade request was ever made , and they were unsure where the reports were coming from . with the trade deadline approaching , speculation picked up on the blue jackets trading carter . reports stated that columbus was trying to trade carter and that he was " 100 percent available . " at the halfway point of the season , with the blue jackets barely into double digit play with an overall – - – losing record , worst in the league , and only 20 points out of playoff position , columbus fired arniel . he was replaced by assistant coach todd richards on an interim basis . richards had previously coached the minnesota wild . he recorded his first playoff victory for the blue jackets in his first game , a double – overtime win over the phoenix coyotes . the change in coaching did not change the fortunes of the team , as they reached the 2012 @ - @ star break with a 13 – ##9 – ) record . at the time , blue jackets ' president john p . mcconnell sent out a letter to fans stating his view of their situation . mcconnell added that action would be taken around the trade deadline , the entry draft and free agency to move the team in a new direction . when asked of the situation , mcconnell stated " rebuilding is not a strong enough word " and that he was committed to giving fans a team of which they can be proud of . he also thanked them for their dedication and support , while stating that the team goal was to " play well and compete for the stanley cup . " days later , a 250 @ - @ person protest began outside of nationwide arena . fans were upset with the blue jackets ' management and were calling for changes to the arena . the same day the fans protested , it was announced that the arena would host the 2013 all @ - @ star game . columbus was without a representative for the 2012 all @ - @ star game , but ryanjohansen represented the team as a breakaway player in the nhl breakaway competition . following the competition , johansen competed in the allstate insurance nhl breakaway challenge , a breakaway themed event sponsored by the league . he received only 1 % of the vote and finished last . at the break , the blue jackets were on the road against the los angeles kings , and with the score tied late in the game , kings ' defenseman ryan doughty scored with just 1 @ . @ 8 seconds remaining to win the game . upon review of the game clock , was discovered that the clock at staples center froze at 1 @ . @ 8 seconds for over a full minute , which would have resulted in time delay due to the goal being scored . kings ' general manager dean lombardi stated that the clock was stopped and no extra seconds had been added due to the time the clock in @ - @ corrects at various times . howson stated on the team ' s blog that " it was an amazing coincidence that with the kings on the power play at staples center and with a mad scramble for our net in the dying seconds of the third period of a game – one overtime , that the clock stopped for at least one full second , " and that , " either there was a sudden stopping of the clock or the clock stopped . " nhl executive vice president of hockey operations colin campbell stated that the blue jackets were wronged , and that the outcome of the game could not be determined , and that the delay was not noticed by the high @ - @ clock crew in the locker room in attendance . to determine the exact cause of the clock pause , the nhl launched an investigation , talking with the clock ' s manufacturer and the staples center staff . two weeks prior to the nhl trade deadline , columbus announced that unlike earlier in the season , they would respond to trade rumors involving rick nash , though they were not actively shopping him . howson stated that the team was open to exploring options for purchasing the team , including trading nash . speculation arose that in return for nash the blue jackets would look for a " mix of experienced , proven players , high @ - @ , prospects and draft picks . " leading up to the trade deadline , the blue jackets traded antoine vermette to the phoenix coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender ryan mcelhinney . despite being unsigned at the time , the acquisition of mcelhinney was believed to give columbus the flexibility to trade curtis sanford . the following day , on june 23 , columbus traded jeff carter to the coyotes . in thedeal , columbus acquired defenseman chris johnson and a fourth @ - @ round draft pick ; the team was given the option of taking the pick in either 2012 or 2013 . at the time , columbus was unable to come to terms on a trade for nash , but they did make one more trade ; they sent forward samuel pahlsson to the vancouver canucks in exchange for two fourth @ - @ round draft picks and minor league defenseman brian ellington . following the trade deadline , howson announced that the team had agreed to trade nash at the player ' s request . he stated that he had made the trade after being informed that the franchise was going into another rebuilding phase . he also noted that he felt that he " could use a large portion of that towards getting assets back , " and in his opinion " it was the best deal for the team , the team , and me for [ his ] career .
