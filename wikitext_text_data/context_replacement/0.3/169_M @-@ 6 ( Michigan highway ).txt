= m @ - @ 6 ( henry highway ) = m @ - @ 6 , officially the paul b . henry freeway , is a 31 @ . @ 696 @ - @ mile ( 31 @ . @ 698 km ) national and state trunkline highway in the united states that connects portions of southern kent and northern ottawa counties south of grand rapids , michigan . although the freeway is named for paul b . henry , local residents and the press continue to use the official name , south beltline as well on occasion . the freeway connects interstate 196 ( i @ - @ 196 ) on the west with i @ - @ 96 on the east . m @ - @ 6 also provides a connection to u . s . highway 131 ( us 131 ) in the middle of its length , running through several communities on the south side of the grand rapids metropolitan area in western michigan . northern end is in a rural area while the southern end serves suburban development along the trunkline . the freeway was originally proposed in the 1960s . it took 32 years to design , build , build , and build the freeway from the time that the state first approved it in 1972 to the time of the first @ - @ 6 ceremony in 2004 that opened the south beltline to traffic . the project cost around $ 700 million or around $ 1 million per mile ( approximately $ 1 million per kilometer ) . initial construction started in november 1997 , with the first phase opened in november 2001 . the completed freeway was opened in november 2004 . the first phase of construction was completed in steel , while the second and third phases were completed in concrete . the freeway was built with two parts : the first a @ - @ point urban interchange ( spui ; / ˈspuːiː / ) in michigan , and a new technique to mark the pavement markings , embedding them into the pavement to reduce the chance of a vehicle bouncing them off . in celebration of the opening of the freeway to traffic , the michigan department of transportation ( mdot ) allows the public to walk or bike the south beltline in an annual @ - @ 6 walk called the " southbelt shuffle " . = = route description = = m @ - @ 6 starts at exit 64 on i @ - @ 196 in ottawa county near hudsonville . the freeway travels southeast from the interchange through the rural ottawa and kent counties toward the state line . through this segment , mdot traffic data showed a traffic volume of 1 @ , @ 117 vehicles on average per day , the lowest along the freeway , in 2010 . during the##owa avenue , the entire beltline crosses into caledonia township in monroe county . the freeway corridor is bordered on either side by farmland , scattered subdivisions , and small areas of woods . near the division avenue interchange , m @ - @ 6 curves to the east around the back of the ironwood golf course and heads for the interchange with byron center avenue . on either side of the freeway on byron center avenue , there are two hospitals , mercy health and st . mary ' s southwest , the latter located on the very southern edge of the city of byron . further east , the beltline curves to the northeast and into the cloverleaf interchange located at us 131 . this " mammoth " interchange stretches over a half mile ( 1 @ . @ 8 km ) in one direction and over a mile ( 1 @ . @ 2 km ) in the other , encompassing 14 lanes and 18 sound walls . this makes it the largest freeway interchange in central michigan . there are four overpasses which carry m @ - @ 6 over the us 131 freeway : two for the dual carriageways in each direction and two for the collector @ - @ distributor lanes on each side . the auxiliary lanes funnel the traffic from the freeway into the main lanes to eliminate confusion between the directions of traffic . in the eastbound direction , the collector @ - @ distributor lane also has access to a ramp for traffic bound for 68th street , which runs parallel to , and east of , the m @ - @ 6 freeway . no such access to 68th street is provided for eastbound m @ - @ 6 traffic , although 68th street traffic can access each direction of m @ - @ 6 or us 131 . east of us 131 , m @ - @ 6 crosses over division avenue and enters caledonia township through a series of sound barrier walls as the freeway ramps merge back into the main lanes . this area had the highest traffic volume in 2011 at m @ , @ 236 vehicles per day . near kalamazoo avenue , the freeway passes through an area with retail stores and movie theaters on either side of the interchange ; to the northeast is the kentwood high school . on the approach to the east division avenue underpass , m @ - @ 6 curves first to the northwest and then back to the northeast , passing by one of steelcase ' s tallest buildings , the pyramid @ - @ shaped industrial development center . the freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into caledonia township , with an interchange for m @ - @ 6 ( broadmoor avenue ) and an overpass for 60th street . m @ - @ 6and at the northeast corner of the gerald r . ford international airport in cascade township . as the south beltline becomes i @ - @ 96 , it becomes 48th street next to the thornapple pointe golf course . the freeway splits into two for each direction of i @ - @ 96 , the connection to eastbound i @ - @ 96 crossing over the thornapple river in the middle . this interchange marks the eastern terminus of the paul r . henry south beltline freeway . the entire length of the freeway is listed on the national highway system , a network of roads important to the nation ' s economy , defense and mobility . the m @ - @ of @ - @ way of m @ - @ 6 is a 9 @ - @ mile ( 15 km ) hiking trail known as the frederik meijer trail . previously named the m @ - @ 6 trail , it connects the old ##wood west of byron hill road in detroit with the paul henry south freeway between 48th street and wing road / paris avenue in kentwood . = = = = = = = = route designations = = = the first appearance of m @ - @ 6 was in 1926 as a two @ - @ mile ( 3 @ . @ 2 km ) segment in keweenaw county in the upper peninsula . the highway ran from us 41 in detroit to north of cass lake . the michigan state highway department redesignated the highway as m @ - @ 111 in 1938 , and it was redesignated two years later to become a part of the route of i @ - @ 96 . in the early 1970s , during the second phase of construction of the i @ - @ 696 ( walter p . reuther freeway ) in metro detroit , grassroots efforts and protests attempted to stop construction of the central freeway . if successful , the protests would have left the freeway with a gap in the gap between the first ( western ) and second ( eastern ) phases of construction . during this time , mdot assigned m @ - @ 6 to the eastern section of the freeway during construction . signs were placed on the service road that followed 11 mile road to connect the already built western interchange at i @ - @ 6 east to m @ - @ 6 . by the time the central freeway section was completed in 1979 , the signage for m @ - @ 6 was removed and replaced with i @ - @ 696 signage , leaving an eight @ - @ mile ( 13 km ) gap in the i @ - @ 696 freeway until completion of the eastern section in 1989 . = = = central freeway = = = = == = = = = = = the south beltline freeway near grand rapids was a project that took about 32 years to build . the project dates back to the 1940s , but formal plans were not made until the 1960s . the 1955 route map for the grand trunk system of highways showed a freeway alignment along the m @ - @ 96 corridor before i @ - @ 96 and i @ - @ 196 were extended south and east to their current locations . an increase in the state gas tax was approved in 1972 with the intent to fund more freeway projects in the area , including the south beltline . the freeway was estimated to cost $ 30 – 100 million ( equivalent to $ 214 – 713 million in 2015 ) in june 1975 with an expected groundbreaking in 1982 – 85 . the highway was approved in january 1981 for $ 144 @ , @ 000 ( equivalent to $ 575 @ , @ 000 in 2015 ) . the choice of consultants for the project was controversial ; local planners said that mdot chose bki inc . only because they were a minority @ - @ 000 , and not because they would be qualified for the project . as this study was conducted , the area for the proposed freeway was located between 60th and 68th streets with a western end in hudsonville and an eastern end in lowell township . the consultants were asked to study a combination freeway and a limited access boulevard option . the final option was the " no @ - @ build " alternative ; under this option , existing roads would be upgraded but no new roads would be built . the city of grand rapids opposed the freeway while the cities and townships south and east of the city supported it . local officials were concerned about the damage to commercial and industrial property in grand rapids . hudsonville ' s city council favored the proposal as a benefit to local food producers who shipped produce to detroit and chicago . local officials , such as the lowell township supervisor , were concerned that delay in starting the project could increase costs . state and local officials expected the project in january 1981 to cost between $ 40 – ##8 million ( equivalent to $ 160 – ##8 million in 2015 ) . the study was to be completed no sooner than 1990 . the boundaries for the highway project were determined by the consultants in april 1982 , located between 60th and 84th streets , " flowing like a river beneath the cities of kentwood and lowell " . the results of the study by bki were criticized by local residents in may 1982 , who called the study " dirty and unprofessional work " , and asked the state tofire the consulting team . local residents distributed 2 @ , @ 000 letters to their neighbors in opposition to the project . the south belt local advisory board criticized bki ' s 10 @ - @ access study report as " filled with errors " ; the consultants ' original 26 @ - @ page paper had been rejected by the board and mdot as " unusable " . an editorial in the the grand rapids journal stated that the study did not significantly advance the debate in the community , instead opening the proposed highway up to new controversies . concerns about the state ' s decision in 1982 to build the roadway combined with concerns about the consultants and their study results . a second advocacy group , the south belt citizens committee , was formed in july 1982 to gain more public information about the project and supplement the work of the advocacy groups , including the south belt local advisory board . bki was terminated as consultant on the project by mdot on september 9 , 1982 . the switch to a new consultant delayed further studies because of the inability to submit data and pay the consultants . in the interim , work was shifted to local and state projects until a new consultant could be retained in an effort to minimize the costs involved . these state projects were focused on using the data and maps from bki ' s study and expanding the scope of the highway ' s study . jackson , cascade , and caledonia townships and the city of kentwood conducted a survey amongst their communities ' planning committees and elected officials in 1982 . the survey showed largely inconclusive support for a 10 @ - @ access highway in what was called a " gut ##ter ##e " to the proposed roadway . the south belt citizens committee actively began to study the project during the summer of 1982 , inviting local candidates for political office to take action on the project . the committee called the roadway a " holocaust " in its mailings to the candidates . michigan lieutenant governor john posthumus , then a member of the michigan state senate , called for an end to the studies in 1983 ; he would later resign and become one of the project ' s biggest opponents . mdot hired a new consultant , schimpeler / coradino associates , in 1984 to study the proposed freeway . the consultant recommended the project in january 1985 . the south beltline was included in the ten @ - @ access highway plan in 1986 . by 1989 , the state decided to set the date in 1991 with construction starting in 1993 . the highway was studied as a proposed toll road in june 1991 . three other routes were proposed the previous year . that september , thethe route was set with a projected completion date of 1997 . the toll road project was approved in june 1995 to offset the cost of a proposed gas tax increase . as a re @ - @ saving measure , the number of lanes was increased to three from six in june 1996 . when the gas tax increase was passed in 1997 , governor john engler promised at least six access lanes for the freeway . the south beltline was described as " [ cutting ] travel time around grand rapids almost in half " . = = = = = i = = = = plans for the south beltline freeway were nearly 25 years old by the time initial construction was completed in 1997 . the michigan state legislature approved the south beltline at the same time for the late john b . hammond , who died in office in 1993 , serving in gerald ford ' s first white house cabinet . the cost of the construction of new roads along the south beltline was a major issue when engler campaigned for re @ - @ 6 against geoffrey feiger in 1998 . the entire freeway was expected to open by 2008 , with the first phase opening in 2002 . mdot gave the south beltline its first designation in the january 1999 edition of the state map , marking re @ - @ 6 for the first time as a red line , to denote it as " under construction " . the legislature approved engler ' s " build michigan iii " plan in 2000 ; the plan accelerated road projects across the state . the capital outlay for the project was $ 82 million ( equivalent to $ 132 million in 2015 ) . court proceedings were initiated in the wayne county circuit court in 1999 to clear the way for the acquisitions . land that contained homes , farms , trailer parks , and businesses was used by mdot to acquire the ( @ - @ of @ - @ way ) for the freeway . the land needed measured 360 feet ( 110 m ) wide and 20 miles ( 32 km ) long . land acquisitions for the south beltline freeway were completed in july 2001 . construction began later in the summer of 2001 on the second and third phases of the project . the first section of the south beltline freeway , located between i @ - @ 37 ( broadmoor avenue ) and i @ - @ 39 , was completed six months later . dry summer weather forced the roadbed contractors to complete their portion of the 3 @ - @ miles ( 5 @ . @ . km ) section of the freeway first , earning them a $ 300 @ , @ 000 bonus ( equivalent to $ 449 @ , @ 000 in 2015 ). the overpasses for the remaining sections of the freeway were completed while the first phase was under construction , allowing the ramps at us 131 and i @ - @ 196 and the entire freeway to be completed at that time . the first phase was paved in asphalt after mdot reversed the decision to pave the whole freeway in concrete . that stretch of freeway opened to traffic on november 20 , 2001 . the state kept the overall project on an interim basis going into the next phase in 2002 . = = = = phases ii and iii = = = = construction of the two lanes between us 131 and m @ - @ 37 and between i @ - @ 196 and us 131 was completed on april 1 , 2002 . the roads that crossed the path of the new freeway were closed to traffic with short detours so that work could begin on the roadbed for the freeway . the last major project for the freeway was to replace bridge beams on the ramp from westbound i @ - @ 196 to eastbound m @ - @ 6 . design flaws were discovered in 2002 in the design of the beams for the bridges over eastbound i @ - @ 196 and the ramp from westbound i @ - @ 6 to eastbound i @ - @ 196 . the project was originally planned to close traffic along i @ - @ 196 for a weekend in 2004 , but kept the lane closed for a full week , holding up traffic on the interstate for two miles ( 3 @ . @ 2 km ) ; completion of the replacement was delayed when human intervention caused a lot of nuts and bolts . mdot held an open house for the entire length of m @ - @ 6 at byron and gordon ##s ##ville . this event took place on november 17 , 2004 , and was known as the " southbelt shuffle " , allowing the public to walk and bike along the freeway . the event was designed to draw attention to the m @ - @ 6 trail that runs parallel to the freeway . many community participants brought their bikes for the public to ride on the freeway . the whole freeway was opened to traffic on november 17 , 2004 , with a ribbon cutting ceremony . when completed , some work was still being completed on the ramps at the i @ - @ 196 interchange on the west end . the entire project cost $ 700 million ( equivalent to $ 933 million in 2015 ) to work on the m @ - @ 6 - round , or $ 10 million / mile ( approximately $ 20 million / km , equivalent to $ 47 million / mi , $ 29 million / km in 2015 ). when the freeway first opened , it was the first in the state of michigan to have a spui located at the kalamazoo avenue interchange . some of the traffic and sound barrier walls were painted sienna green as part of a " color change " to the freeway . mdot also used a new drill to drill the pavement directly into the concrete , designed to reduce the likelihood that it would set them off . the signs are in miles , and " the entire m @ - @ 6 freeway was designed and built in miles " , according to mdot spokesperson suzette peplinski . the final ramps opened to traffic on december 9 , 2004 . = = = = after completion = = = = mdot added the completed m @ - @ 6 to the state maps in an updated printing in june 2005 . at the time , the major online mapping services still did not show a complete freeway in eastern ottawa and western kent counties . services such as mapquest and yahoo ! maps rely on tele atlas ##es of new york for their mapping data , which , in turn , relies on services like mdot to update their maps . mdot ' s first update came only nearly eight months after the freeway opening due to its inclusion in a m @ - @ scale update to the state highway map . a year after the freeway opened , traffic levels along parallel streets at 55th , 56th and 68th streets dropped by – 50 % . at the same time , roads with interchanges along the freeway also increased traffic . wilson avenue experienced a 50 % increase and sections of byron center avenue increased 100 % in traffic only a year after m @ - @ 6 opened . property values in the suburbs along the freeway rose 11 @ . @ 3 – ##0 @ . @ 4 % in 2006 as a result of development related to the freeway . city officials praised the freeway for improving access to the suburbs , driving housing starts as residents flocked to the freeway for their jobs and quality of life . in 2007 , the metro health village , a commercial development centered on the byron center avenue exit and the hospital opened . described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a anchor , the development included restaurants , shops , offices and a pharmacy . metro health moved from grand rapids to the location in wyoming in the face of opposition to the expansions of their current location . since opening , even though the freeway is officially named for paul henry , the old south beltline freeway is still in use . reactions to the new freeway were not all positive . in a special editorial in the the grand rapidspress after the freeway opened in 2004 , local journalist curt macdougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway . he cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a side effect of the highway . the editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for local residents , but it will mean increased development . that development will cause more urban ##ization , and could cause the creation of new neighborhoods in the area . the m @ - @ 6 trail was constructed in a $ 2 @ . @ 5 million project ( equivalent to $ 4 million in 2015 ) that started in 2008 . the goal was to create a 10 @ - @ - @ - @ wide ( 3 @ . @ . m ) path linking the belt line with the patrick henry rail trail . the m @ - @ 6 trail was the brainchild of kent county executive john hilton , jr . he had hoped to have the trail included in the new freeway , and opened with the rest of the wayne beltline . the entire project was funded by $ 2 @ . @ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 3 @ . @ 5 million in 2015 ) in federal grants and $ 300 @ , @ 000 ( equivalent to $ 350 @ , @ 000 in 2015 ) from the frederik and karen meijer foundation . the grants came from kent county and the townships . construction of the trail was completed in late 2008 . in 2009 , the asphalt section of m @ - @ 6 had to be replaced . this section of road between east michigan avenue and main street was rated poorly by the michigan infrastructure and transportation department , but the section east of broadmoor avenue received favorable marks . mdot budgeted $ 1 million in repairs on top of previous m @ - @ 6 repairs that were done by the same general contractor without a warranty in 2006 . the local press described the 7 @ . @ 7 @ - @ wide ( 7 @ . @ 6 km ) stretch of road as " problematic " in regards to pavement maintenance issues . legislation was signed by governor rick snyder on december 9 , 2014 , to name the section of m @ - @ 6 between civic center and washington avenue the lieutenant john warsen memorial highway . warsen , a us navy seal , was killed in a helicopter crash in afghanistan in 2012 . this section of the highway was dedicated on december 15 , 2015 . = = track list = = = hi , love = " love , infidelity " is the second episode of the third season of the american comedy television series veronica mars , and the seventh episode overall. written by john enbom and directed by michael phillips , the episode premiered on the cw on november 22 , 2006 . the series depicts the life of veronica mars ( kristen bell ) as she deals with life as a college student while working as a private detective . in this episode , veronica faces an accusation that she plagiarized a research paper only to find out that her husband is having an affair with mindy o ' dell ( jamie lee ##ner ) . meanwhile , stosh " piz " piznarski ( chris lowell ) invites veronica to go bowling , and parker fennel ( richard daggs iii ) must choose between basketball and his studies . the episode features the return of laura san giacomo as harmony chase and the introduction of the new character of keith ( adam rose ) . san giacomo and colantoni , who had previously co @ -
