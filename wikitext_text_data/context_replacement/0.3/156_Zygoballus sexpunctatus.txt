= zygoballus sexpunctatus = zygoballus sexpunctatus is a species of jumping spider which occurs in the eastern united states where it can be found in a variety of different habitats . these spiders measure between 3 and 4 @ . @ 5 mm in length . the cephalothorax and abdomen are brown to black in color , with dark brown or black markings . the species has greatly enlarged antennae ( the legs used for grasping prey ) and long legs ( the third , and sometimes fourth , abdominal segments ) . like many jumping spiders , z . sexpunctatus may exhibit ritualized sexual and agonistic behavior . = = = = = the species name is derived from the latin sex meaning " sex " and punctum meaning " foot " . this is a reference to the six legs typically occurring on the abdomen of the spider . = = description and description = = the species was first described by charles henry marcellus hentz in 1845 in the american museum of natural history . hentz named the species attus sexpunctatus and described it as follows : " male ; cephalothorax with the two posterior eyes near the apex , which are large and suddenly placed at almost a right angle with the upper jaw , cheliceres with a strong inner tooth , and a long , curved margin ; abdomen with four segments , and a line in front , straight ; legs , 1 . 2 . 2 . 3 . , each segment with two claws and quite hairy . " hentz placed z . sexpunctatus in the subgeneric group pugnatoriae , which consists of jumping spiders whose first pair of legs were the longest , followed by the fourth pair . later entomologists questioned this classification , which hentz himself admitted was " somewhat arbitrary " . in 1888 , with the recognition of zygoballus as an independent genus , american arachnologists george and elizabeth peckham named the spider zygoballus sexpunctatus . specimens of z . sexpunctatus are held at the museum of comparative zoology , the british museum , the walters art museum , the american museum of natural history , and the museum national d ' histoire naturelle . no type specimens are known . the genus zygoballus contains about 20 species ranging from the united states to argentina . zygoballus is placed in the subfamily dendryphantinae of the family salticidae ( jumping spiders ) . == = = = according to arachnologist r . j . kaston , adult females are 3 @ . @ . to 4 @ . @ 5 mm in body length , while males are 3 to 4 @ . @ 5 mm . the peckhams ' original description , however , gives a length of 4 mm for females and 3 to 4 @ . @ 5 mm for males . the cephalothorax of z . sexpunctatus is bronze to black in colour . like all zygoballus spiders , the cephalothorax is box @ - @ like in shape , being narrowed at the posterior median eyes . large white to pale blue scales cover the clypeus ( " face " ) and chelicerae . this stripe extends along the sides of the carapace , narrowing at the anterior median eyes . in males , the face is two @ - @ , as wide as the body , and as wide as it is long . the eyes of females are slightly enlarged and vertically oriented , with each chelicera having a large inner ring and a long , curved fang . the legs are dark brown , or sometimes yellowish , with the claws of the fourth ( first ) legs being longer and enlarged , as in the male . the abdominal legs have three pairs of long spines on the dorsal surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus . the peckhams give the following values for the length of the legs of a single female , starting with the first pair : 2 @ . @ 7 mm , 2 @ . @ 7 mm , 2 mm , 1 mm . in females , the fourth pair of spines is the longest . the pedipalp of the male has a single tibial spine which tapers forward . the abdomen is bronze to black with a white basal spot and two white transverse bands . the transverse bands are often joined to form six spots . some or all of these spots may be distinct , however . zygoballus sexpunctatus is similar in appearance to zygoballus rufipes , with whom its range overlaps . the male can be distinguished from z . rufipes by the large spot of white scales at the beginning of the thoracic segment ( which is lacking in z . rufipes ) , and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp ( z . rufipes has no transverse division ) . the female can also be distinguishedby the form of the epigyne ( the external reproductive structure ) . = = habitat and distribution = = the range of the species extends from new jersey to florida and west to texas , although it is most commonly found in the southern states . hentz collected his first specimen in north carolina . in 1909 , the peckhams reported that the species had been collected from south carolina , alabama , georgia , louisiana , and mississippi . a one @ - @ year survey of spider populations in western mississippi reported the distribution of z . sexpunctatus as " uncommon " . a two @ - @ year survey in alachua county , florida , reported the species as " rare " . specimens have been collected from several habitats , including cotton fields , coastal terrace forests , flatwoods , florida sand pine forests , slash pine forests , appalachian mountain balds , and cotton fields . robert and betty barnes reported the species as occurring in broomsedge forests of the southeastern piedmont . the spider is often found in the lower stratum ( among grasses and other short plants ) and can be caught with a silk web . = = female = = male zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders are known to perform complex courtship behavior . as a male approaches a female , it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen . if the female is approached , it will often vibrate its abdomen as well . the # ##s of courtship behavior , however , vary between species . z . sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic display when approaching multiple females of the same species . this behavior may include many of the same behaviors of courtship , such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and shaking the abdomen . during agonistic display , males will also extend their pedipalps and abdomen . sexual attacks by males appear to be rare , however . = = distribution and habitat = = like other spiders , zygoballus sexpunctatus is an opportunistic spider , feeding on a wide variety of invertebrate species . the spider ' s diet typically includes small insects such as aphids and insect larvae . they have also been known to eat spiders and other types of small insects . the parasitic wasps , which attack and paralyze spiders as a source of food for their larvae , have been known to feed on both male and female z . sexpunctatus spiders . = = life cycle = = = a study of spider populationsin middle tennessee , zygoballus sexpunctatus spiderlings were known to hatch from egg ##lings in the summer . the spiders hibernated through the winter in an immature form and reached sexual maturity around late spring . = 1986 peach bowl = the 1986 peach bowl was a post @ -
