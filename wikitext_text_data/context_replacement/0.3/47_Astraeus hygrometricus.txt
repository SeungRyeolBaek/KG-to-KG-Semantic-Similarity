= astraeus hygrometricus = astraeus hygrometricus , commonly known as the hygroscopic mushroom , the barometer mushroom , or the false star , is a species of fungus in the diplocystaceae family . young specimens resemble a puffball when young and unopened . in addition , the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar appearance that is a result of the outer layer of fruit body cells splitting open in a star @ - @ like manner . the false star is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various soils , especially in sandy soils . a . hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution , and is common in temperate and tropical regions . its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic ( star @ - @ absorbing ) , and will open up its spores to reveal the egg print in response to increased moisture , and close them up again in drier conditions . the gills have an irregular upper surface , and the fruit body is dark brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the center . the flesh is white initially , but turns brown and yellow when the spores mature . the spores are star @ - @ brown , roughly covered with minute scales , measuring 7 @ . @ 5 – ##5 mm in diameter . despite the similar overall appearance , a . hygrometricus is not related to the true species of genus geastrum , although historically , they have been closely related . the species was first described by christiaan hendrik persoon in 1801 as a hygrometricus . in 1885 , william h . smith proposed that differences in morphological characteristics necessitated the creation of a new genus astraeus distinct from it ; this opinion was not generally accepted by later authorities . several other populations previously considered to be a . hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s after phylogenetic analyses showed they were unique astraeus species , including a . asiaticus and a . odoratus . research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies . north american field guides typically list a . hygrometricus as endangered . = = species , distribution , and phylogeny = = because this species resembles the species ##s of geastrum , it was placed in that genus by several authors , starting with christian hendrik persoon in 1801 ( as geaster , analternate spelling of [UNK] ) . according to the american botanist william p . morgan , however , the species differed from those of others in not having open chambers in the upper leaves , having large and branched capillitium leaves , not having a true gill , and having larger spores . accordingly , morgan designated persoon ' s geaster hygrometricum as the type species of his new genus astraeus in 1889 . despite morgan ' s decision , some authorities in the following decades continued to place the species in it . the new @ - @ measure of mycologist gordon herriot cunningham explicitly transferred the species back to the genus cerambycidae in 1944 , stating : the treatment of this species by certain authorities clearly shows the dangers that lay in store for those who are at the mercy of ontogenic fungi . . . the principal characteristic of those species in which the species differs from others of geastrum is the somewhat reduced spores . in the developing stage the glebal cavities are separated by tramal plates so much as to be inaccessible to the developing worker . the cavity is filled with spores , loosely arranged in clusters ( like those of mushrooms ) and not forming the complete veil of the species which has been studied . this difference disappears when maturity is reached , when they resemble closely the leaves of the other member of the genus . the taxonomist is therefore unable to determine any point of time at which " astraeus " should be distinguished from geastrum , which indicates that the name should be discarded . morgan ' s decision was not accepted by later authorities , who largely considered astraeus a valid genus . according to the taxonomical database mycobank , synonyms of astraeus hygrometricus include lycoperdon stellatus scop . ( 1772 ) ; section fibrillosum schwein . ( 1822 ) ; geastrum stellatum ( scop . ) wettst . ( 1885 ) ; and astraeus stellatus e . fisch . ( 1900 ) . astraeus hygrometricus has been given a number of common names that refer to its predatory behavior , including the " hygrometer scale " , the " hygroscopic scale " , the " barometer earthstar " , and the " " @ - @ measure " ". the resemblance to this species ( commonly known as true gall ) accounts for the common name " false earthstar " . the specific epithet is derived from the greek words υγρος ( hygros ) " false " and μετρον ( metron ) " mushroom " . the german mycological society named the species as their " mushroom of the year " in 2005 . studies in the 2000s showed that several specimens from asian fossil sites identified with the specific epithet hygrometricus were actually highly distinct in a number of molecular and morphological respects . molecular analyses of the dna sequence of the its and of the ribosomal dna from a number of astraeus specimens from around the world have helped to clarify the relationships within the genus . based on these results , two european " hygrometricus " specimens have been described as distinct species : a . asiaticus and a . odoratus ( along with petcharat ' s a . thailandicus described in 2003 ) . recent dna studies indicate that the european a . hygrometricus described by persoon is a different species than the north american population described by morgan , and that the european population may be divided into two distinct phylotypes , from france and from the usa . a 2010 study identified a japanese species , originally described as a . hygrometricus , as being distinct ; it has yet to be officially named . a form of the species found in korea and japan , a . hygrometricus var . koreanus , was named by v . a . stanek in 1958 ; it was later ( 1976 ) described as a new species — a . koreanus — by hanns kreisel . as pointed out by fangfuk and colleagues , confirmation of the scientific validity for this taxon may include analysis of a . hygrometricus var . koreanus specimens from the type locality in north korea . = = = = = most specimens of a . hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development while embedded in the substrate . a smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body , and may be partially covered with debris . as the fruit body matures , the mycelial layer tears away , and the outer tissue layer , the exoperidium , splits off in a characteristic @ - @ shaped ( stellate ) pattern to form 4 – ##mm irregular " rays " . this then pushes the fruit body to expand to form a largespore is enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium . the rays open and close in response to changes of moisture in the air , opening up during high humidity , and closing when the air is dry . this is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different types of tissue ; the innermost , fibrous , is hygroscopic , and folds and folds the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings . this adaptation enables the fruit body to release spores during times of high moisture , and reduce damage during dry periods . however , dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up can be readily blown away by the wind , allowing them to release spores from the air as they grow . the fruit body is about – ##5 cm ( 0 @ . @ 4 – @ @ . @ 2 in ) in diameter from tip to base when dry . the exoperidium is hollow , and the spores are slightly areolate ( divided into small areas by cracks and crevices ) on the upper surface , and are dark brown to black . the spores case is sessile ( without a stalk ) , a yellow to orange color and 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ 4 to 1 @ . @ 2 in ) broad with a felt @ - @ , or scurfy ( covered with a scaly crust ) surface ; the center of the spores case is marked by an irregular slit , tear or pore . the interior of the spores case , the cap , is white and firm when dry , and divided into several locules — a characteristic that helps to distinguish it from others . the gleba becomes white and solid as the specimen ages . the dark hairlike structures ( rhizomorphs ) extend from the base of the fruit body into the cap . the rhizomorphs are fragile , and will fall off after maturity . the spores are spherical or nearly so , reddish @ - @ brown , yellow @ - @ , and rough ( covered with hairs and spines ) . the spores ' dimensions are about – ##5 µm ; the spines are about 1 µm long . the spores are non @ - @ walled , and will not stain with iodine from melzer ' s reagent . the use of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the spines are 0 @ . @ # – @ @ . @ 5 µm long , rounded at the base , narrow , and##red , and are fused together at the apex . the capillitia ( masses of tissue @ - @ like sterile cells dispersed among the spores ) are cylindrical , 3 @ . @ . – . @ . @ 5 µm in diameter , and hyaline ( translucent ) . the basidia ( the @ - @ type cells ) are three - to six @ - @ spored , with very short sterigmata . the spores are arranged in long chains of clusters ; individual spores measure about – 15 by 18 – / µm . the cells of the capillitia extend from the upper surface of the cap , and are 4 @ - @ long , thin , narrow , and cylindrical , measuring about – @ @ . @ 5 µm thick . the exoperidium ( the outer layer of tissue , including the cap ) is made of three distinct layers of cells : the mycelial layer contains branched cells that are about – 6 μm in diameter ; the hyphae of the soft layer are 6 – 8 μm long and branched ; the collenchyma @ - @ type cell contains branched hyphae of 3 – ##0 μm diameter ; the soft layer contains cells that are about – 4 μm in diameter . = = = = = = = north american sources describe a . hygrometricus as being of either unknown origin , or too small to be edible . however , they are widely cultivated in india , including nepal and south bengal , where " many people consume them as delicious food " . they are collected from the wild and sold in the markets of india . a study of the closely related south asian astraeus species noted that the fungus had an abundance of " 5 @ - @ carbon compounds ( including 1 @ - @ octanol , 1 @ - @ octen @ - @ 3 @ - @ ol , and 1 @ - @ octen @ - @ 4 @ - @ al ) that produced a " mushroom @ - @ like , earthy , and pungent odor that was evident as an unpleasant and moss @ - @ like smell upon opening the cap " . the study ' s authors further noted that the fruit produced after cooking had a " roasted , maillard , herbal , and oily odor " . other compounds detected after cooking the mushroom have included furfural , benzaldehyde , cyclohexenone , and furanyl compounds . the main differences in opinions on edibility offrom sources published , it was known that north american and asian versions of a . hygrometricus were not genetically the same ; in some cases , they have been described as separate species , such as a . asiaticus and a . odoratus . = = similar species = = although a . hygrometricus bears a superficial resemblance to members of the " true ray " group , it can be easily distinguished from them by the hygroscopic nature of its rays . hygroscopic species include g . arenarium , g . corollinum , g . floriforme , g . recolligens , and g . kotlabae . unlike these , the american fruit bodies of a . hygrometricus do not have a columella ( the tissue of the gleba , or the base of the spore sac ) . geastrum tends to have its ray sac ##s replaced by a peristome or a disc , in contrast with the characteristic narrow slit of a . hygrometricus . there are also some morphological differences : in a . hygrometricus , the rays are not arranged in radial rows , the spores are larger , and the threads of the capillitia are branched and continuous with the hyphae of the rays . despite these differences , this species can be difficult to distinguish from them in the field . another species of ray , g . mammosum , does have thick and brittle rays that are moderately hygroscopic , and could be confused with a . hygrometricus ; however , the rays are smaller than a . hygrometricus , at about 4 µm in diameter . astraeus pteridis is larger , 5 to 15 cm ( 5 @ . @ 0 to 5 @ . @ 1 in ) or more when mature , and it has a more pronounced growth pattern on the upper surface of the rays . it is found in north america and the pacific islands . a . asiaticus and a . odoratus are two similar species known from the south and southeast asia , respectively . a . odoratus is distinguished from a . hygrometricus by a thicker outer mycelial layer with no attached soil particles , about – 9 ) rays , and a fresh odor adapted to moist soil . the spore sac of a . odoratus is also distinct from a . hygrometricus, with longer and narrower rays that are joined together . a . asiaticus has an outer peridial surface covered with small spines , and a gleba that is yellow @ - @ brown in color , compared to the smooth peridial surface and white gleba of a . hygrometricus . the upper limit of the spore count of a . asiaticus is larger than that of its more common relative , ranging from 8 @ . @ 75 – @ @ . @ 100 μm . a . koreanus ( also known as the variety a . hygrometricus var . koreanus ; see below ) differs from the more common variety in its smaller size , smaller fruit bodies , and greater number of rays ; microscopically , it has larger spores ( between 4 @ . @ 5 and 10 μm in diameter ) , and the spines of the rays differ in size and morphology . it is known from america and japan . = = habitat , distribution , and species = = astraeus hygrometricus is an ectomycorrhizal fungus and grows in association with a broad range of tree roots . the mutualistic association between tree roots and the gills of the fungus helps the trees obtain nutrients ( especially phosphorus ) from the soil ; in addition , the fungus produces carbohydrates from photosynthesis . in north america , associations with oak and pine are usual , and in japan , it has been reported to grow together with chir pine ( eucalyptus roxburghii ) and sal ( shorea robusta ) . the korean fungus is found on the ground in rice fields , either scattered or in groups , especially on nutrient @ - @ rich , sandy or clay soils . it has also been reported to grow on limestone , preferring acidic soils of limestone and granite , while avoiding soils rich in limestone . in korea , fruit bodies have been collected at elevations of 3 @ , @ 000 m ( 9 @ , @ 800 m ) . fruit bodies usually appear in autumn , although the dry fruit bodies are persistent and can last up to two years . gelatinipulvinella astraeicola is a leotiaceous fungus with small , white , pulvinate ( cushion @ - @ shaped ) apothecia , known to occur only on the outer surface of the rays of dead astraeus species , including a . hygrometricus . the fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution except for arctic , alpine and cold temperate regions ;
