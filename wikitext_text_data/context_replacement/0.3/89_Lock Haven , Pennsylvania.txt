= lock haven , pennsylvania = the city of lock haven is the county seat of susquehanna county , in the u . s . state of pennsylvania . located at the confluence of the west branch susquehanna river and bald eagle creek , it is the principal city of the lock haven micropolitan statistical area , itself part of the williamsport – lock haven combined statistical area . at the 2010 census , lock haven ' s population was 8 @ , @ 772 . built on a site long favored by pre @ - @ columbian peoples , lock haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers , boatmen , and other travelers on the susquehanna or the west branch canal . timber extraction and river transportation financed much of the city ' s development through the end of the 19th century . in the 20th century , a pre @ - @ aircraft factory , a sawmill , and a steel mill , along with many other businesses , dominated the economy . frequent floods , beginning in 1972 , damaged local infrastructure and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s . the city has three sites on the national register of historic places — memorial park site , a significant pre @ - @ era archaeological find ; heisey house , a pre @ - @ era residence ; and main street park , an area with a mix of 19th - and pre @ - @ century architecture . a dam , completed in 1995 , protects the area from seasonal flooding . while industry remains important to the city , about a third of lock haven ' s workforce is employed in education , health care , and social services . = = history = = = = = pre @ - @ european = = = the earliest settlers of pennsylvania came from canada between 12000 bce and 8000 bce , when the glaciers of the last ice age were receding . stone indian spearheads from this period , known as the paleo @ - @ indian arrows , have been found in most parts of the city . archaeological discoveries at the memorial park site 36cn164 near the confluence of the west branch susquehanna river and bald eagle creek collectively span about 8 @ , @ 000 years and span every major prehistoric period from the middle archaic to the late woodland period . major cultural movements over that period included the early archaic starting at 6500 bce ; the late archaic starting at 3000 bce ; the early woodland starting at 3000 bce ; the middle woodland starting at 0 ce ; and the late woodland starting at 900 ce . first contact with europeans occurred in pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 ce . = = = eighteenth century = = = = the earlythat century , a tribal confederation known as the six nations of the iroquois , headquartered in new york , ruled the six ( native american ) tribes of pennsylvania , including those who lived near what would become lock haven . early settlements in the area included the munsee villages on the 325 @ - @ . ( 1 @ . @ 32 km2 ) great island in the west branch susquehanna river at the mouth of bald eagle creek . four indian paths , the great island path , the great shamokin path , the bald eagle creek path , and the sinnemahoning path , crossed the island , and a fifth , logan ' s path , crossed bald eagle creek , a few miles upstream at the mouth of fishing creek . during the french and indian war ( 1754 – - ) , british militiamen on the kittanning expedition destroyed munsee villages on the great island and along the west branch . by 1763 , the munsee had abandoned their remaining villages and other settlements in the area . with the signing of the first treaty of fort stanwix in 1768 , the british gained control from the iroquois of lands west of the west branch . however , white settlers continued to claim land , including tracts in and near the present site of lock haven , not covered by the treaty . in 1769 , cleary campbell , the first white settler in the area , built a log cabin near the present site of lock haven university of pennsylvania , and by 1773 william reed , another settler , had built a fort surrounded by a moat and named it reed ' s fort . it was the smallest of the more primitive forts along the west branch ; fort augusta , at what is now sunbury , was the largest and most advanced . in response to settler incursions , and encouraged by the british during the american revolution ( 1775 – [UNK] ) , indians attacked settlers and their families along the west branch . fort augusta and the other white settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned in 1778 during the british evacuation known as the big runaway . thousands of settlers fled across the river to fort wayne , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from fort reed ; some did not return for five years . in 1784 , the second treaty of fort stanwix , between the iroquois and the united states , transferred most of the former indian territory in pennsylvania , including what would become lock haven , to the british . the u . s . acquired the last remaining tract , the erie tract , through a separate treaty and returned it to pennsylvania in 1792 . = = = = = = = =lock haven was laid out as a town in 1833 , and it became the county seat in 1839 , when the county was formed out of parts of lycoming and centre counties . incorporated as a town in 1840 and as a city in 1870 , lock haven grew in the 19th century largely because of timber and timber . the forests of clinton county and areas upriver provided a huge supply of white pine and spruce as well as oak , ash , maple , poplar , ash , walnut , and walnut . the wood was used locally for such things as frame houses , barns , fishing boats , and railroad bridges , and the logs were floated to chesapeake bay and on to baltimore , to make way for railroads . log driving and log rafting , two methods of transporting logs to baltimore , began on the west branch in 1800 . by 1830 , slightly before the founding of the city , the lumber industry was well established . the west branch canal , which opened in 1834 , ran 73 miles ( 117 km ) from easton to farrandsville , about 5 miles ( 8 km ) upstream from lock haven . a state @ - @ funded branch of the bald eagle canal ran from the west branch through lock haven and flemington to bald eagle creek . a privately funded canal , the bald eagle and bear creek navigation , eventually reached bellefonte , 24 miles ( 39 km ) upstream . lock haven ' s founder , jeremiah church , and his son , willard , chose the town site in 1833 partly because of the river , the creek , and the locks . church named the town lock haven because it had a canal lock and because it was a haven for loggers , travelers , and other travelers . over the next half century , canal boats 13 feet ( 4 m ) wide and 80 feet ( 24 m ) long carried passengers and mail as well as cargo such as lumber , water for lye and laundry , tobacco , food , shoes , dry goods , and clothing . a rapid increase in lock haven ' s population ( to 830 by 1850 ) followed the opening of the canal . a lock haven lumber mill , smaller than but very similar to the lumber boom in williamsport , was constructed in 1849 . large piles of timbers loaded with tons of logs were placed in the pool behind the dunnstown dam , allowing for a settlement on the river opposite lock haven . the piers , about 150 feet ( 46 m ) from one another , stretched in a line from the dam to a point 3 miles ( 5 km ) upriver . connected by aheld together with iron rods and rings , the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced the logs . workers and mill ##ers sorted the floating logs , much like cattle , for sale to sawmills and mill owners . lock haven became the commercial center of bucks county and the home of many businesses related to lumber products . the sunbury and reading railroad , renamed the philadelphia and reading railroad in 1861 , reached lock haven in 1859 , and with it came a timber boom . believing that the area ' s coal , iron ore , white pine , and - @ - @ - timber would produce significant economic wealth , railroad investors led by william and john fallon financed a line to lock haven . on the basis of the railroad ' s potential value to the area , local residents also invested heavily in housing , building 200 homes between 1854 and 1856 . although the fallons ' coal and iron mines failed , gothic revival , greek revival , and italianate residential and commercial buildings such as the fallon house , a brick mansion , remained , and the railroad provided a major mode of transport for the ongoing timber boom . a second rail line , the bald eagle valley railroad , originally known as the tyrone and lock haven railroad and completed in the 1860s , linked lock haven to tyrone , 56 miles ( 90 km ) to the north . the two rail lines eventually became part of the network controlled by the pennsylvania railroad . during the era of log floating , logjams sometimes occurred when logs became an obstacle . log rafts floating down the north branch had to pass through gaps in canal dams . the canals were about 30 feet ( 9 m ) wide — narrow enough to pass through the chutes — and 150 feet ( 46 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) long . in 1874 , a large raft was caught in the chute of the dunnstown canal and caused a jam that blocked the channel from bank to bank with a pile of logs 16 feet ( 5 m ) high . the jam eventually destroyed another 200 log rafts , and 2 more boats , the mammoth of newport and the sarah dunbar . in terms of board feet , the peak of the lumber era in pennsylvania came in about 1885 , when 1 @ . @ 1 million logs went into the mill at williamsport . these logs produced a total of about 226 million board feet ( 533 @ , @ 000 m3 ) of sawed timber . after that , production steadily declined throughout the region . lock haven ' s timber industry was also affected by flooding , which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the lumber mills . 1889 .the central state normal school , established to train teachers for central pennsylvania , held its first classes in 1877 on a site on the west branch susquehanna river . the small school , with enrollment of 500 until the 1920s , eventually became lock haven university of pennsylvania . in the early 1880s , the new york and pennsylvania paper mill in castanea township near flemington began paper production on the site of a former mill ; the paper mill remained a large employer until the end of the 20th century . = = = twentieth century = = = as old forms of transportation such as the canal trolley disappeared , new forms emerged . one of these , the electric trolley , began operating in lock haven in 1894 . the lock haven electric trolley , managed by the lock haven traction company and after 1900 by the susquehanna traction company , ran passenger trolleys between lock haven and mill hall , about 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the east . the trolley line extended from the philadelphia and erie railroad station in lock haven to a station of the central railroad of pennsylvania , which served mill hall . the line ran from lock haven ' s downtown , next to the normal school , across town to the trolley car barn on the west side of the river , through flemington , over the bald eagle bridge and bald eagle creek , and on to mill hall via what was then known as the lock haven , bellefonte , and nittany valley railroad . plans to extend the line from mill hall to salona , 3 miles ( 5 km ) directly west of mill hall , and to avis 10 miles ( 16 km ) northeast of lock haven , were never carried out , and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines . the company , always financially marginal , declined after world war i . losing customers to automobiles and trucks , it ceased operations around 1930 . william t . piper , sr . , founded the piper aircraft corporation factory in lock haven in 1937 after the company ' s taylor aircraft company plant in lancaster , pennsylvania , was destroyed by fire . the factory began operations in a building that once housed a paper mill . as the company grew , the original factory expanded to include engineering and manufacturing buildings . production remained in the factory until 1984 , when a new owner , lear @ - @ siegler , moved production to vero beach , florida . the clinton county historical society opened the florida aviation museum on the site of the former factory in 1985 , and 10 years later the museum became an independent organization . the state of florida acquired the state normal school in 1915 and renamed it lock haven state technical college in 1927. between 1942 and 1970 , the student body grew from 146 to more than 20 @ , @ 300 ; the number of teaching staff rose from 80 to 170 , and the college rolled out a new building program . the college ' s name was changed to lock haven community college in 1960 , and its focus shifted to teaching the humanities , fine arts , mathematics , and social sciences , as well as adult education . renamed lock haven university of pennsylvania in 1983 , it opened a new campus in clearfield , 48 miles ( 77 km ) north of lock haven , in 1989 . an 8 @ - @ acre ( 3 @ . @ 3 ha ) landfill site in washington county adjacent to lock haven was placed on the national priorities list of federal hazardous waste sites ( sometimes referred to as superfund sites ) in 1982 . dow chemical , which went bankrupt in 1981 , made ingredients for pesticides and chemical weapons at the site from the 1960s to 1981 . also in 1982 , the united states environmental protection agency constructed a large @ - @ up of contaminated soil , rocks , and soils at the site and by the late 1990s had replaced the landfill . equipment to treat contaminated groundwater at the site was installed in 2000 and continues to operate . = = = = = = = pennsylvania ' s rivers have frequently flooded . according to william h . jones , the native americans of pennsylvania told white settlers that major floods occurred on the ohio and susquehanna rivers every 100 years . shank tested this hypothesis by tabulating the major floods on record at key points throughout the state over a 14 @ - @ year period and concluding that a major flood had occurred , on average , roughly every 25 years between 1784 and 1972 . big floods recorded at harrisburg , on the main branch of the susquehanna , 120 miles ( 193 km ) miles upstream from lock haven , occurred in 1784 , 1865 , 1889 , 1894 , 1902 , 1936 , and 1972 . data from the williamsport stream gauge , 24 miles ( 39 km ) miles from lock haven on the west branch of the susquehanna , showed significant floods between 1889 and 1972 in the same area as the harrisburg station ; in addition , a large flood occurred on the east branch at williamsport in 1946 . estimated flood @ - @ - ##s between 1847 and 1979 — based on data from the national weather service stream gauge at lock haven — show that flooding has occurred in the city 19 times in 132 years . the biggest flood occurred on june 18 , 1936 , when the susquehanna crested at 1 @ . @ 3 acres ( 1 @ . @ 8 m ) ,which was about 11 feet ( 3 @ . @ 4 m ) above the flood stage of 20 feet ( 6 @ . @ 6 m ) . the third biggest flood , measured at 29 @ . @ 3 feet ( 9 @ . @ 1 m ) in lock haven , occurred on june 1 , 1889 , and coincided with the johnstown flood . the flood demolished lock haven ' s log boom , and thousands of feet of stored lumber were swept away . the flood damaged the mills , which were subsequently abandoned , and destroyed the last of the canal boats left in the city . the most significant lock haven flood was caused by the arrival of hurricane agnes in 1972 . the storm , well below hurricane strength when it hit the region , made landfall on june 19 near new york city . agnes merged with a non @ - @ - storm on june 22 , and the combined system affected the northeastern united states until june 26 . the combination produced widespread rainfall of 6 to 12 inches ( 152 to 305 mm ) with snowfall of 14 to 19 inches ( 483 mm ) in western schuylkill county , about 75 miles ( 121 km ) southeast of lock haven . at lock haven , the river crested on june 23 at 9 @ . @ 3 feet ( 9 @ . @ 1 m ) , second only to the 1936 flood . the flood greatly damaged the paper mill and piper dam . federal , state , and local officials began construction in 1992 of barriers to protect the city . the project included a bridge of 1 @ , @ 000 feet ( 1 @ , @ 973 m ) and a dam wall of 1 @ , @ 000 feet ( 305 m ) between the susquehanna river and bald eagle creek , closure ##s , retention basins , a pumping station , and some relocation of roads and bridges . completed in 1995 , the levee protected the city from high water during the year of the flood of 1996 , and again 2004 , when flooding from the remnants of hurricane ivan threatened the city . = = = = = lock haven is the county seat of susquehanna county . according to the united states census bureau , the city has a total area of 2 @ . @ 7 square miles ( 7 @ . @ 11 km2 ) , 2 @ . @ 5 square miles ( 6 @ . @ 5 km2 ) of which is land . about 0 @ . @ 2 square miles ( 0 @ . @ 5 km2 ) , 75 % , is water . lock haven is located 561 feet ( 171 m ) above sea level near the confluence of bald eagle creek and the west branch susquehannariver in north @ -
