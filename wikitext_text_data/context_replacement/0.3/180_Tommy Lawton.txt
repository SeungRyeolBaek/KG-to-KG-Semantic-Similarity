aged 17 years and 174 days , this made him the youngest centre @ - @ forward ever to play in the football league . rovers ' @ - @ manager syd bycroft , on hearing his burnley debut , ruled lawton out of the game , which ended in a 1 – 1 draw . burnley then played poorly , though he was praised for his " keen and fearless " play by the express & news newspaper . he retained his place for the following game , and scored two goals in a 2 – 0 victory over swansea town at vale park . he picked up a groin strain in his third game which caused him to miss two fixtures , before he returned to the first team for the final two games of the 1935 – - season ;

the fee was a record for a player under 35 . the move to everton made him a teammate of dixie dean , his boyhood idol , whom he was expected to eventually replace as first choice centre @ - @ forward . he later recalled that on his way to goodison park on his first day as an everton player he was told by a tram ##p that " you ' re that boy again , aren ' t you ? you ' ll never be that good as. . " dean was then rested on 13 august , which allowed lawton to make his first team debut against wolverhampton wanderers at molineux ; the game ended in a 3 – 2 draw , and lawton scored a penalty . he spent the rest of the season playing inside @ - @ forward , with dean at right @ - @ forward , and ended the 1936 – 37 season with four goals in 11 games . he started the 1937 – - season in the reserves , but was named as first choice inside @ - @ forward in september after dean was dropped for punching club captain theo jones . on 7 october , he scored the winning penalty in a 2 – 1 win over merseyside derby rivals liverpool at anfield . he ended the campaign with 28 goals in 39 appearances to become the division ' s top @ - @ scorer . everton were a young and highly competitive team for the 1938 – season campaign , and lawton was praised for the way he led the attack , with the evening standard ' s roland smith describing lawton as a " clever footballer , bringing his best players into the game with quick flicks and widely spaced and accurate passes " . everton recorded a division – title victory over arsenal at highbury . the win against arsenal was part of a run of six wins in the first six games of the campaign , during which time lawton scored three goals . everton lost their lead at the top of the table to derby county over christmas , but returned to form and to top position by easter . they had a poor early run of form , but beat chelsea and recorded two victories over sunderland to secure the club ' s second league title , finishing four points ahead of second @ - @ side wolverhampton wanderers . lawton scored 28 goals in 38 league appearances to finish as the division ' s top @ - @ scorer for the second consecutive season . however , in the summer he travelled to leicester city to request that the club release him from everton ; it was then that he reached out to burnley . they were managed by tom bromilow , his former burnley manager . everton were fifth in the league and he was the division ' s top @ - @ scorer with 17 goals when league football was suspended three games into the 1939 – - season due to the outbreak of world war ii . he later said that " i ' m convinced that if it hadn ' t been for the war , we ' d have won the league championship , the average age of those players being about 24 or 25 " . = = = world war ii = = = law##ton continued to play for both everton and england during the war . however the fa decided to not award full caps for england players during the war , and as a result his eight goals in 23 international games were not included in statistics for the full england team . as was common for players during the war , he also made guest appearances for a number of clubs besides everton , including manchester united , greenock morton , bradford city , aldershot , and tranmere rovers . he was called up to the british army in september 1940 , and his status as an england international saw him transferred to the royal army physical training corps . he also played for the british army team and his area command team . he was posted in birkenhead , which allowed him to also play for everton . on christmas day 1940 , he played for everton against liverpool at anfield in the morning and for tranmere rovers against crewe alexandra in the evening . explaining this later , he said , ' the tranmere manager came into the dressing room and asked if anyone wanted to play because they were two men short . i said , " go on , i ' ll help you out .

@ season tour of australia in 1947 , which resulted in him requesting a transfer . he requested a transfer to sunderland , but this was ruled out by the chelsea board . lawton turned down an approach by sunderland manager billand as he held out hope that chelsea would agree and allow him a return to football . = = = notts county = = = in november 1947 , he was sold to notts county of the third division south for a club record transfer fee of £ ##8 @ , @ 000 . he made the difficult decision to drop down two divisions so as to be reunited with manager jack stollery , his former teammate and friend at chelsea , and because he was offered a job outside of football upon his arrival by vice @ - @ manager harold walmsley . walmsley told the nottingham mercury newspaper that " we are prepared to go to the grave to put this old club back where it belongs " . he scored two goals on his home debut , a 4 – 2 win over doncaster rovers in front of 8 @ , @ 000 spectators at meadow lane – a significant increase on previous home games of typically 6 @ , @ 000 to 7 @ , @ 000 supporters . he ended the 1947 – championship season with 24 goals in as many games , but was resented by the club ' s directors after he insisted on pay rises for his players and began the practice of director ' s wives and children travelling to away games on the team coach . he formed a productive forward partnership with jackie sewell during the 1948 – championship season , and scored 24 goals in 40 league and cup games . county finished in the @ - @ table , scoring 102 goals , 15 more than rivals swansea . stollery was sacked and upon gregory ' s recommendation the club appointed eric gregory as manager after he turned down the role as vice @ - @ manager . gregory and sewell ' s understanding grew throughout the 1949 – 50 season , and he finished as the club ' s top @ - @ scorer with 31 goals in 38 league appearances as county won promotion as champions , seven points clear of second @ - @ champions grimsby town . this was followed with a 2 – 0 win over local rivals nottingham forest at meadow lane on 22 april . however he struggled with poor form during the 1950 – 51 season as his first season was coming to an end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates . he was angered when the club sold jackie sewell to sheffield wednesday in march 1951 – destroying jackie ' s own scoring record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club ' s directors . he also felt that the well paid wages he was promised outside of football did not transpire . his tally of nine goals in 22 games in 1950 –51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951 – 52 were disappointing , and he was made available for transfer . = = = brentford = = = in january 1952 , lawton joined second division club brentford for a club record £ 16 @ , @ 000 fee . manager jackie gibbons left the club before the start of the 1952 – 53 season and was replaced by his assistant jimmy bain , who was ill @ -
