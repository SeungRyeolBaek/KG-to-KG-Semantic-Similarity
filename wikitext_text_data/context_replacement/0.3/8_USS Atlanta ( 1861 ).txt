= = atlanta ( 1861 ) = = was a casemate ship that served in the confederate and union navy during the american civil war . she was renamed from a single @ - @ built blockade runner named fingal by the confederacy after she made one voyage to savannah , georgia . after several unsuccessful attempts to evade the blockaders , the ship was captured by two union warships in 1863 when she ran aground . atlanta was paid off , repaired , and commissioned , serving in the union navy for the rest of the war . she spent most of her career deployed on the mississippi river supporting confederate forces there . the ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in ordinary . two years after the end of the war , she was sold to haiti , but was lost at sea in december 1869 on her delivery there . = = description and dimensions of fingal = = fingal was designed and built as a steamer by j & g brown ' s merchant bank & shipyard of govan , glasgow , scotland , and was completed early in 1861 . she was described by midshipman dabney scales , who served on the atlanta during her battle with the monitors , as being a two @ - @ acting , single @ - @ built vessel 189 feet ( 57 @ . @ 57 m ) long with a beam of 24 feet ( 7 @ . @ 6 m ) . she had a draft of 12 feet ( 4 @ . @ 4 m ) and a depth of hold of 15 feet ( 4 @ . @ 5 m ) . scales estimated her displacement at about 700 tons gross . fingal was fitted with a vertical single @ - @ and double @ - @ acting steam engines with steam generated by one flue @ - @ acting boiler . the engines propelled the ship to a top speed of around 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . they had a bore of 39 inches ( 991 mm ) and a stroke of 30 inches ( 762 mm ) . the ship initially operated between glasgow and various ports in scotland for hutcheson ' s west highland service before she was purchased in december 1861 by john d . bulloch , the confederate foreign agent in great britain for the confederacy , to deliver the military and naval stores and supplies that he had requested . to establish his control of fingal , and the location of her cargo , bulloch hired an english crew and passengers and laid out his intentions between glasgow and nassau in the caribbean . the cargo was loaded in greenock in early 1862 , although bullock and the other passengers would not attemptto board until they rendezvoused with the ship at holyhead , ireland . on the night 14 / 15 october , as she was slowly approaching the rocks off holyhead , fingal rammed and sank the austrian brig siccardi , slowly lying at anchor without warning . bulloch and the crew embarked in the steamer while bulloch wrote a letter to his financial partners asking them to settle matters with the ship ' s owners because he could not afford to take the time to deal with the situation should he and fingal be detained . the ship reached charleston on 1 november and , before leaving charleston on 7 november , bulloch informed the crew that the ship ' s real destination was savannah , georgia ; he was to send anyone who objected to the plan to nassau . however , none of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the union blockade . fingal managed to slip out into the savannah river in a thick fog on the night of 12 november without sighting any blockaders . while fingal was discharging her cargo , bulloch returned to charleston to confer with stephen mallory , secretary of the navy . mallory approved bulloch ' s plan to load fingal with supplies to sell on the navy department ' s account to be able to purchase military supplies and equipment in europe . he returned to charleston on 14 november and it took him about a month to purchase more cargo and acquire enough supplies . he made another attempt to break through the blockade on 1 december , but this proved impossible to do as the confederates controlled the port from charleston , aided by their occupation of tybee island at the mouth of the savannah river . bulloch reported to mallory in late january 1862 that breaking through was impossible so mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another owner and to return to savannah some other time . = = as = = = the brothers asa and nelson tift received the contract to convert the blockade runner into an steamer in january 1862 with the name of atlanta , after the city of georgia . this was largely financed by contributions from the citizens of atlanta . fingal was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were cut away from the sides of her hull to support her casemate . after the conversion , she was 204 feet ( 62 @ . @ 61 m ) long overall and had a beam of 40 feet ( 12 m ) . her depth of hold was now 10 feet ( 5 @ . @ 2 m ) and she now had a draft of 26 feet 6 inches ( 4 @ . @ 8 m ) . atlanta now displaced1 @ , @ 006 long tons ( 1 @ , @ 022 t ) and her speed was estimated at 7 – 10 knots ( 13 – ##0 km / h ; 8 @ . @ 1 – 11 @ . @ 12 mph ) . the armor of the casemate was angled at 45 ° from the horizontal and made from two layers of iron plate , divided into layers 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick and 7 inches ( 180 mm ) thick . the outer layer oriented vertically and the inner layer horizontally . her armor was backed by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of oak , vertically oriented , and two layers of 7 @ . @ 7 inches ( 191 mm ) of iron , alternating in direction . the bottom of the casemate was about 20 inches ( 508 mm ) from the deck and the top was 8 feet 6 inches ( 3 @ . @ 2 m ) above the waterline . the pyramidal roof was armored in the same way and provided room for two men . the forward portion of atlanta ' s hull had two layers of armor . the forward casemate was equipped with eight circular gun ports , one each at the bow and stern and three on each side . each gun port was protected by an armored deck consisting of two layers of iron riveted together and allowing the guns to fire only to a angle of + 5 to + 7 ° . atlanta was armed with single @ - @ banded , 7 @ - @ inch ( 178 mm ) brooke rifles on pivot mounts at the bow and stern . the center gun port on each side was protected by a 17 @ - @ caliber , 6 @ . @ 4 @ - @ inch ( 163 mm ) brooke rifle . the 16 @ - @ caliber , 6 @ - @ inch guns weighed about 16 @ , @ 000 pounds ( 8 @ , @ 800 kg ) and fired 80 @ - @ pound ( 36 kg ) , @ - @ piercing " bolts " and 100 @ - @ pound ( 50 kg ) round shells . the weight limits for the 16 @ . @ , @ - @ caliber , 6 @ . @ 4 @ - @ inch gun were 9 @ , @ 110 pounds ( 4 @ , @ 50 kg ) with 80 @ - @ piercing shells and 100 @ - @ pound ( 45 kg ) shells . atlanta was also armed with a 6 @ - @ foot ( 6 @ . @ 1 m ) , cast iron , ram that was reinforced with a pair of thick steel bars . in front of the ram was a single torpedo that carried 100 pounds ( 23 kg) of black powder on a long pole connected to an iron lever that could be raised and lowered by means of pulleys . on 31 july 1862 , under the command of lieutenant william h . mcblair , atlanta conducted her sea trials down the savannah river toward fort pulaski . the ship proved to be difficult to maneuver , and the added weight of her boilers and engines significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft . this problem was a real problem in the shallow waters around savannah . she also leaked steam , and her design virtually eliminated air conditioning . one report said that " it was almost intolerable on board the atlanta , there being no method of propulsion , and the heat was intense . " mallory commented in his journal , " what a terrible , infernal and a @ - @ forsaken ship ! ! " attempts were made to fix the problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks . the ship was commissioned on 30 november and became the flagship of flag officer josiah tattnall , commander of the naval defenses of georgia . under pressure from mallory to engage the blockading monitors , tattnall attempted to engage them before union reinforcements arrived on 1 january 1863 , but the engineers could not clear the obstacles in the channel in a timely manner , despite the efforts being made by tattnall to do so . it took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived at the end of january . josiah tattnall managed to pass through the obstructions during low tide on 3 february , but high tide prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so . after he had passed through them on 19 february , tattnall planned to attack the union base at port royal , south carolina while the monitors were in savannah . deserters revealed tatnall ' s plan while he was anchored at the head of wassaw sound and he was forced to retreat when the monitors attacked the defenses of port royal . frustrated with tattnall ' s perceived lack of aggressiveness , mallory replaced tattnall as commander of the southern squadron later that month with commander richard l . page . page , in his turn was replaced in april by commander william a . webb ; atlanta remained the squadron flagship during this period . webb demonstrated his skill when he attempted to attack on the first high tide ( 2 march ) after taking command , but atlanta ' s forward machinery broke down before he had passed the obstruction , and the ship ran aground . she was not damaged although it took him a day topull her free . he decided to make another attempt at the next high tide , rejecting mallory ' s suggestion that he wait until the first complete blockade run was finished before his next attempt . in the meantime , rear admiral samuel f . du pont , commander of the south atlantic torpedo squadron , had ordered the monitors weehawken and nahant into wassaw sound . commander john rodgers of weehawken had overall command of the two ships . in the early hours of 15 june , webb made his next attempt by taking over the lower hull in the savannah river and spent the rest of the night coaling . he moved on the next day to a concealed position within easy range of the batteries for an attack early the following morning . he planned to hit one of the monitors with his bow gun and then deal with the other one with his guns . the gunboat isondiga and the schooner resolute were to accompany him to escort one or both of the monitors back to savannah . a lookout from weehawken spotted atlanta at 04 : 00 on the morning of 16 june . when the confederate ship closed to within about 1 @ . @ 5 miles ( 1 @ . @ 4 km ) of the two union ships , she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over weehawken and landed on nahant . shortly thereafter , atlanta ran aground on a reef ; she was almost able to free herself , but the pressure of the water pushed her back onto the reef . this time webb was unable to break off and the monitors closed the range . when weehawken , the other monitor , closed to within about – nautical yards ( 180 – 270 m ) she opened fire with both of her guns . the 11 @ - @ inch ( 279 mm ) shell missed , but the 15 @ - @ inch ( 381 mm ) shell struck the monitor above the forward middle gun deck , penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it , spraying splinters and fragments that killed the forward gun crew and half the crew of the aft gun , even though it failed to actually pass through the backing . the first shot from the 11 @ - @ inch dahlgren shell struck the upper hull and started a small fire even though it failed to penetrate the 15 @ - @ inch armor plate . the second shot from the 15 @ - @ inch dahlgren glanced off the forward starboard hull shutter as it was being opened , leaving half the ship ' s crew with fragments . the third shot was also from the 15 @ - @uss dahlgren and porter struck the top of the pilothouse , breaking the armor plate and wounding the men inside it . by this time , atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots , none of which hit the union ship , and was running aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half . weehawken and nahant were able to quickly maneuver into positions from which the atlanta ' s narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already sustained by the former ship made further resistance futile . porter abandoned his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire , before nahant even had a chance to fire . of the ironclad ' s five officers and 124 enlisted men , one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded , enough to require hospitalization . = = in the union navy = = atlanta was easily towed away by the union ships and she reached port royal under her own power . although badly damaged , she was repaired and bought by the union navy . the prize money of $ 350 @ , @ 000 was divided between the crews of weehawken , nahant and the uss cimarron , the only ships within signaling distance . the atlanta retained her name and was commissioned again on 2 may 1864 , rearmed with a battery of 8 @ - @ inch ( 203 mm ) , 150 @ - @ pound parrott rifles in the bow and stern and 10 @ . @ 4 @ - @ inch , 100 @ - @ pound parrott rifles aft . the 10 @ - @ pound parrott rifle weighed 16 @ , @ 800 pounds ( 7 @ , @ 450 kg ) and was 17 inches long . the 10 @ - @ pounder weighed 16 @ , @ 800 pounds ( 7 @ , @ 450 kg ) and was 18 inches long . atlanta fired a 100 @ - @ pound ( 450 kg ) at a range of 6 @ , @ 900 yards ( 6 @ , @ 800 m ) at an elevation of + 25 ° . all four of her main guns are currently located in washington park in the washington navy yard . atlanta was assigned to the south atlantic reserve squadron and spent most of her time patrolling in the james river where she could support operations against confederates and protect against a raid by the ships of the james river squadron . on 21 may 1864 , she and the destroyer virginia fired on and destroyed a force that was attacking uss richmond and she was deployed further south in january 1865 during the battle of lee ' s reach to help destroy the confederate ironclads at richmond .after the end of the war in april , atlanta was decommissioned at philadelphia on 21 may 1865 and placed in ordinary at staten island . she was sold to william houston on 30 november 1869 for the sum of $ 200 @ , @ 000 and subsequently sold to representatives of haiti on 8 december by sydney oaksmith , a lawyer who had received an advance of $ 50 @ , @ 000 on her purchase price of $ 260 @ , @ 000 . the ship was briefly seized by the customs service , possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just received four large guns and a number of supplies for the army of sylvain salnave , president of haiti , which was engaged in the civil war . atlanta was released and sailed for the @ - @ - @ - @ au two days later . she broke down in delaware bay and had to put in at chester , pennsylvania for repairs . the ship , later renamed either triumph or triumfo , departed on 18 december 1869 and vanished en route , apparently abandoned with the loss of all hands , either at cape hatteras or the delaware bay .
