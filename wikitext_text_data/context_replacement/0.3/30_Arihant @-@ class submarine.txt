= arihant @ - @ class submarine = the arihant class ( hindi , for killer of whales ) is a class of nuclear @ - @ powered ballistic missile submarines being built for the indian navy . they were developed under the us $ 1 @ . @ 1 billion advanced technology vessel ( atv ) project to design and build nuclear @ - @ powered submarines . the lead ship of the class , ins arihant was launched in 2009 and after extensive sea trials , was confirmed as ready for operations on 23 february 2016 . arihant is the first ballistic missile submarine to have been launched by a country other than one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council . = = history = = in december 1971 , during the indo @ - @ pakistani crisis of 1971 , the us president richard nixon sent a naval battle group named task force 74 , led by the nuclear @ - @ submarine uss enterprise into the bay of bengal in an attempt to attack pakistan . in response , the soviet union sent a submarine armed with nuclear weapons from vladivostok to intercept the us task force . the incident demonstrated the importance of nuclear power and ballistic missile submarines to indian prime minister indira gandhi . following the 1974 smiling buddha nuclear test , the director of marine engineering ( dme ) at naval headquarters initiated a technical feasibility study for an indigenous nuclear propulsion system ( project 932 ) . the indian navy ' s advanced technology vessel project to design and build a nuclear submarine took shape in the 1990s . the defence minister george fernandes announced the project in 1998 . the original intent of the project was to develop nuclear @ - @ powered fast attack submarines , but following nuclear tests conducted by india in 1998 at pokhran test range and the subsequent denial of nuclear weapons use , the project was re @ - @ geared towards the design of a ballistic missile submarine in order to continue india ' s submarine program . = = history = = the arihant @ - @ class submarines are nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines developed under the advanced technology vessel ( atv ) project . they will be the first nuclear submarines designed and built by india . the submarines are 112 m ( 367 ft ) long with a beam of 11 m ( 36 ft ) , a draft of 10 m ( 33 ft ) , displacement of 6 @ , @ 000 tonnes ( 6 @ , @ 900 long tons ; 6 @ , @ 600 short tons ) and a maximum depth of 300 m ( 980 ft ) . the crew is approximately 95 , 000 officers and sailors . the boats are powered by a single seven bladepropeller driven by an 83 mw ( 111 @ , @ 000 hp ) pressurised water reactor and can achieve a maximum speed of 12 – 15 knots ( 22 – 28 km / h ) when surfaced and 24 knots ( 44 km / h ) when submerged . the submarines have four launch tubes in their hump and can carry up to 12 k @ - @ 15 sagarika torpedoes with one warhead each ( with a range of 750 km or 470 mi ) and 12 k @ - @ 20 torpedoes ( with a range of 3 @ , @ 500 km and 2 @ , @ 200 mi ) . the submarines are similar to the akula @ - @ class submarine of russia . the indian navy currently train on ins chakra , an akula @ - @ class submarine acquired from russia in 2012 . = = = = = the submarines are powered by a pressurised water reactor with highly enriched uranium fuel . the miniaturized version of the reactor was designed and built by the bhabha atomic research centre ( barc ) at the indira gandhi centre for atomic research ( igcar ) in kalpakkam . it included a 50 @ - @ m ( 138 ft ) section of the submarine ' s outer hull , the ballast tank with fuel and the reactor , a boiler room , as well as an electronic control room for monitoring reactor parameters . the nuclear reactor became operational on 11 december 2003 and was declared operational on 1 september 2006 . the operation of the reactor for two years enabled the production version of the reactor for arihant . the reactor components were tested at the machinery test center in visakhapatnam . facilities for installing and maintaining the fuel cores of the naval reactors in the submarine were also established . the detailed engineering of the submarine was done at larsen & toubro ' s submarine design division at their hazira ##bad facility . tata - sed designed the engine room for the submarine . the steam turbines and control systems integrated with the reactor were manufactured by walchandnagar industries . the reactor vessel underwent a long and intensive period of testing after its launch in july 2009 . the propulsion and control systems were tested with surface @ - @ pressure tests , followed by harbor @ - @ pressure tests that included diving tests by testing the ballast tanks and controlled dives to extreme depths . the arihant ' s reactor went critical for the first time on 31 december 2013 . on 1 january 2014 , the submarine lifted anchor for further successful sea trials . = = ordered by class = = exact number of planned submarines remains unknown, according to media reports about five to six submarines are planned to be built . the lead ship of the class , ins arihant is expected to be commissioned by 2016 . the first four vessels are expected to be commissioned by 2023 . in december 2014 , the work on the second nuclear submarine began and the fourth one , ins aridhaman is being prepared for sea trials . the first three boats of the class , after the fourth one , will be larger and have 8 vertical torpedo tubes to carry up to 8 k4 and a more powerful light water reactor than ins arihant . a larger variant on class to the arihant class is also planned , these new boats will be capable of carrying up to 16 ballistic missiles . = = = = =
