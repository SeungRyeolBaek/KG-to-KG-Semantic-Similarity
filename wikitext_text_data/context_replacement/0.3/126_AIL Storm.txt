@ mobility and track capabilities , and that did not cause the additional strain and increase in maintenance often associated with the @ - @ armouring , in part due to its new 170 horsepower ( 130 kw ) diesel engine . the armour protects against 7 @ . @ 62 × 39mm ( 0 @ . @ 3 in ) armour @ -

@ - @ atlantic states , resulting in localized flooding and ultimately making the tropical storm the wettest in new england history . this hurricane would also be the last of the hurricane season, with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 961 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @ . @ 39 inhg ) , making it a high @ - @ end category 1 hurricane on the 1 @ - @ end saffir – simpson hurricane wind scale . activity decreased in september , though a damaging hurricane swept through areas of the canadian arctic , resulting in large crop and infrastructural damage . two tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm strength were reported in october , though neither resulted in fatalities . overall , hurricanes in the 1940 season caused four fatalities and $ 1 @ . @ 329 million in damages . the 1940 north carolina hurricane , which passed through areas of the southeastern united states in august , was the most damaging and deadly of the tropical cyclones . = = = = = = = = tropical storm one = = = on may 18 , a weak low @ -

@ southeast before recurving back towards a northeast direction . at the same time , the storm expanded in size and began to transition into an extratropical cyclone . at 1200 utc , the storm completed an extratropical transition , due to the entrainment of cooler waters . the tropical system persisted until 0600 utc on august 27 . = = = hurricane one = = = on august 3 , an extratropical cyclone developed into a tropical depression off the west coast of florida . initially a weak disturbance , it moved generally westward , gradually increasing in intensity . early on august 4 , the depression reached tropical storm strength . ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested . after reaching hurricane strength on august 5 south of the mississippi river delta , the storm strengthened further intoa modern @ - @ day category 2 hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and a minimum central pressure of 972 mbar ( hpa ; 2 @ . @ 3 inhg ) at 0600 utc on august 7 . the hurricane moved ashore near sabine pass , texas later that day at peak strength . once inland , the hurricane executed a sharp curve to the north and rapidly weakened , degenerating into a tropical storm on august 8 and dissipated over texas on august 9 . reports of a potentially deadly hurricane near the united states gulf coast forced hundreds of residents in low @ - @ lying areas to evacuate prior to the storm moving ashore . offshore , the hurricane produced rough seas and a strong storm surge , peaking at 6 @ . @ 3 ft ( 1 @ . @ 2 m ) along the eastern shore of lake pontchartrain . the anomalously high tides flooded many of louisiana ' s barrier islands , destroying them . strong winds caused significant infrastructural damage , primarily in texas , although its damage was mainly to transportation networks along the u . s . gulf coast which were damaged by the winds . however , much of the property and infrastructure damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rains it produced in low @ - @ lying areas , setting new record floods . rainfall peaked at 37 @ . @ 5 in ( 953 mm ) in miller island off louisiana , making it the wettest tropical cyclone in recorded history . nineteen official weather stations in both texas and louisiana observed record modern @ - @ day rainfall totals for the month of august as a result of the slow @ - @ day hurricane . property , infrastructure , and crops – ( rice , corn , and tobacco crops – ) heavily damaged . entire ecosystems were severely altered by the rainfall . overall , the hurricane caused $ 10 @ . @ 75 million in damage and two fatalities . = = = hurricane three = = = a hurricane of unknown cape verde origin was observed in the virgin islands at 1800 utc on august 7 . initially moving westward , the tropical storm gradually gained in strength before making a sharp curve towards the north on august 8 . the storm continued on a northerly motion until a second curvature brought it in a more westward direction on august 9 . shortly after , the tropical storm reached peak intensity as a modern @ - @ day category 1 hurricane . the hurricane then made landfall at peak intensity on hilton head island , south carolina at 2030 utc on august 21 . at the time , the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100winds ( 155 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 972 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @ . @ 38 inhg ) , equivalent to a modern @ - @ day category 1 hurricane . once inland , the tropical cyclone gradually weakened , and turned northeastward before dissipating over the appalachian mountains on september 14 . the hurricane dropped torrential rainfall across the southeast united states , causing unprecedented flooding in the region . the storm was among the strongest to impact in the region in at least 29 years . rainfall peaked at 28 @ . @ 21 in ( 525 mm ) in idlewild , north carolina . the heavy rainfall caused streams to significantly exceed their normal flood levels , damaging waterfront property . many of the deaths occurred in north carolina , where 30 people drowned . transportation was disrupted as a result of the debris scattered by the wind and rain . in halifax county alone , 90 percent of bridges were swept away . overall , the storm caused four deaths and $ 1 million in damage . = = = hurricane damage = = = on august 27 , a low @ - @ pressure area in the eastern atlantic ocean became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression . moving slowly in a generally west @ - @ day direction , the disturbance intensified , reaching tropical storm strength on august 28 and then hurricane intensity on august 30 . the hurricane passed within 85 mi ( 135 km ) of cape hatteras before recurving towards the northeast . thereafter , the storm continued to intensify , and reached peak intensity as a modern @ - @ day category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 961 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @ . @ 38 inhg ) , though these two peaks were achieved at different times on september 1 . thereafter , the tropical cyclone began a weakening trend as it proceeded northward , and had degenerated into a tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on nova scotia later that day . the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day , making a landfall on new brunswick . the extratropical cyclone persisted into canada before merging with a larger extratropical cyclone early on september 3 . despite not making landfall on the united states , the hurricane caused significant damage . extensive protective measures were implemented along the coast , particularly in new england . the heightened measures were due in part to fears that effects from the hurricane would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane which struck the region two days prior . most of the damage associated with the hurricaneand in new jersey , where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a cold front produced heavy rainfall , peaking at 24 in ( 610 mm ) in the town of ewan . this would make the storm the highest in state history . the resultant floods damaged infrastructure , mostly to telephone networks . damage in the state amounted to $ 1 million . further north in new york , strong winds were reported , but damage was minimal . although the storm made two landfalls in atlantic canada , damage there was minor , and was limited to several boat incidents caused by strong waves . overall , the hurricane caused $ 4 @ . @ 05 million in damage , mostly due to flooding in new brunswick , and two fatalities . = = = hurricane five = = = a tropical disturbance was first noted east of the lesser antilles on september 7 , although at the time weather observations in the area were limited . the disturbance gradually intensified through most of its early development stages , attaining tropical storm strength on september 14 ; further development into a hurricane east of puerto rico occurred two days later . shortly thereafter , the storm recurved northward , and reached peak intensity the next day as a hurricane @ - @ day - 2 , with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of at least 988 mbar ( hpa ; 29 @ . @ 18 inhg ) . the storm gradually weakened thereafter , making landfall on nova scotia on september 17 with winds of 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) . moving into the gulf of saint lawrence later that day , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . the remnant system curved westward and passed over newfoundland before dissipating over the atlantic on september 18 . while east of the united states east coast , the storm caused several boat incidents , most notably the stranding of the swedish freighter laponia south of cape hatteras , north carolina on september 17 . two other boat incidents resulted in two deaths . the storm also brought sustained winds of tropical storm @ - @ force and snow over areas of new england . in atlantic canada , a strong storm surge peaking at 3 ft ( 1 @ . @ 1 m ) above normal sank or damaged several ships and flooded roads . in new brunswick , the waves damaged the lobster fishing industry . in nova scotia , the winds disrupted telecommunication and telegraph services . the winds also severely damaged crops . roughly half of agricultural production in annapolis county was destroyed during the storm , resulting in approximately $ 1 @ . @ 1 million in economic losses . strong winds in new brunswick caused moderateto minimize infrastructural damage , and caused damages to crops located there . overall , the storm caused three fatalities , with two off of the united states and one in northern mexico . = = = tropical depression seven = = = a westward moving tropical depression developed in the southwestern caribbean sea , west of bluefields , nicaragua at 1200 utc on september 18 . the following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm at 0600 utc . the tropical storm made landfall on the west coast of nicaragua at 1400 utc , with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . the storm weakened to a tropical depression over land , but reintensified back to tropical storm strength upon emerging into the gulf of honduras on september 20 . the storm ' s westward motion caused it to make a second landfall near the border of mexico and british columbia at 0300 utc on september 21 as a slightly stronger system with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) ; this would be the storm ' s peak intensity . near the yucatan peninsula , the tropical storm re @ -
