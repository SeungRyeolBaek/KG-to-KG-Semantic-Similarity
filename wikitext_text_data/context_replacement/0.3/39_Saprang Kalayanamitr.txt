" the aot did know about the problem " , suebsak promboon of the eit said . " the situation would not have become this bad if the water had been drained first . " suebsak promboon , a royal foundation official and a member of the tortrakul yomnak @ - @ led the security inspection committee , accused the aot of refusing to take any actions to address the problem at the airport . the airport faced several security problems , including a computer virus that brought down the airport luggage and @ - @ security system in february 2007 . a report by the international air transport association ( iata ) published in july 2007 found the airport unsafe , including numerous spots where checked passengers could meet people who have not passed through security checks . serious security problems at suvarnabhumi airport were known to the iata only in early 2007 . the international air transport association ( iata ) stated that there were numerous spots in the passenger terminal where checked passengers could meet people who have not passed through security checks and could receive unchecked objects and then carry them on board aircraft . the iata also recommended that aot deploy its own security system instead of contracting out the project to the loxley @ - @ icts consortium . aot threatened the consortium with immediate termination , but didn ' t follow through with the threat , even though the consortium failed to live up to its contract . two months later , aot stated that it still couldn ' t make up its mind on how it should handle airport security . aot said it was open to all possible solutions , and has taken immediate action to address the problem . = = = = trip to europe = = = = on monday 26 february 2007 , saprang led a 13 @ - @ member delegation to europe , on what was intended to be a 7 @ - @ 000 trip to discuss security and safety measures at major european airports . the delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname , and the trip , which cost 7 @ . @ 000 million baht was criticised for " squandering " public funds for personal pleasure , disbursing travel expenses , and inflating taxes . the travel - group received a 500 @ , @ 000 tax commissionfee for making the trip . saprang denied any involvement and said he was the victim of a smear campaign . he also noted that " if you knew my character , you would think that even if a relative arranged the trip he should have known that he should travel alone .

" however , his claim was contradicted just an hour later by prime minister surayud chulanont . in february 2007 , saprang claimed that he had information about the seizure of instructional manual on terrorism in 2006 from a bangkok hotel by english students and police . he said he could not disclose any further information , but wanted the public to connect the dots themselves . days later , a bomb exploded outside of chitrlada hotel . saprang later retracted his remark , saying the alleged instructional manual discovery had been made in the early 1990s . deputy head of the british mission in bangkok andy smith said he was " shocked " by saprang ' s remarks , which he said were " false " . = = = resignation of pridiyathorn devakula = = = saprang was implicated in the resignation of prime minister pridiyathorn devakula on 28 february 2007 . the bangkok post reported that pridiyathorn resigned in 2006 after a junta member forced him to sell shares of irpc ( formerly known as thai petrochemical industry ) back to a private company . the newspaper identified saprang as the former cns member . saprang ' s brother , chienchuang , was a key political advisor to prachai liaophairat , the estranged chairman of tpi . chienchuang ' s relations with the junta came under further media scrutiny when it was revealed that he was hired by the junta in 2006 to launch a campaign to overthrow deposed premier thaksin shinawatra .academics hired as part of the coup campaign included thai pattana party leader korn dabbaransi , democrats korn chatikavanij , alongkorn palabutr and korbsak sabavasu , prapat panya @ - @ chatraksa , a former thai rak thai member who belongs to the free thai party , plus ex @ - @ and kraisak choonhavan . academics hired by the cns included wuttipong piebjriya @ - @ wat , sophon supapong , narong phet @ - @ prasert , and somkiat osotspa . = = = mad dogs and machine guns = = = saprang was an extremely vocal critic of those who he perceived as his political enemies . in an interview with thai rath ( thailand ' s most influential newspaper ) on 8 april 2007 , he called an unspecified enemy a " mad dog " whom he claimed was destroying the country . he said that it was necessary to kill the enemy with a machine gun . in the same interview , he threatened violent retaliation to the " harsh words that came from the mouths of the people who did not exercise restraint " . he demanded immediate action , so that the public would see that good had won over evil . = = = = @ - @ coup . = = = saprang was considered a likely candidate to replace the junta with the mandatory appointment of army commander @ - @ - @ - @ , and vice president sonthi boonyaratkalin in april 2007 . he also competed with the former army commander anupong paochinda , who , as an army area commander , left thailand on the night of the coup . the bangkok post reported in october 2006 that sonthi was grooming anupong to be his successor and giving him responsibilities in military matters , a greater responsibility than had been assigned to saprang . the economic times quoted a former mp as saying that " anupong is seen as the real power behind the coup . saprang is very vocal , but he has no real base . the only way he could be seen as a promising leader is by taking the country to the ground .
