= hurricane omar ( 2008 ) = hurricane omar was a strong hurricane that followed an generally southwest to northeast track across the eastern caribbean sea during october , 2008 . forming out of a tropical disturbance on october 13 , omar initially moved slowly across the eastern caribbean sea . by october 15 , omar began to rapidly strengthen as deep convection developed around the center of circulation . later that day , an eye developed and the hurricane began to curve to the northeast . early on october 16 , omar reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 958 mbar ( hpa ; re @ . @ 29 inhg ) . shortly thereafter , the hurricane rapidly weakened to category 1 intensity . after reaching re @ - @ intensity the next day , omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non @ - @ convective low pressure area . the remnants of omar persisted until october 17 at which time it dissipated to the east of the azores . throughout the eastern caribbean , omar affected numerous islands , most of which only recorded minor damage . large waves and heavy rainfall affected the cayman islands . antigua and haiti sustained $ 54 million in damage , mainly on land as several homes were destroyed , several others damaged and many others were affected by flood waters . one person died in puerto rico after suffering a re @ - @ level cardiac arrest . the united states virgin islands also sustained significant damage , totaling about $ 6 million . numerous businesses and homes were damaged and over 100 power poles were downed . total losses from the hurricane were estimated at $ 79 million . = = meteorological history = = on september 30 , a well @ - @ developed tropical low moved off the west coast of africa and entered the atlantic ocean . deep convection formed around a prominent re @ - @ level circulation as it moved towards the northwest . however , the convection diminished on october 2 before entering the caribbean sea a week later . upon entering the caribbean sea , shower and thunderstorm activity increased around the low . continued development followed and the system was classified as tropical depression six at 0600 utc on october 13 while located about 190 mi ( 305 kilometres ) south of the southern tip of the dominican republic . the initial steady forward motion that the system began across the atlantic slowed as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two . as the organization of the depression increased , it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the national hurricane center ( nhc ) gave it the name omar . located to the southof a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the east of a low to mid @ - @ level ridge , omar began a mid @ - @ level turn on october 15 . upon becoming a tropical storm , omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid development as more deep convection developed around the center of circulation . wind shear around the center , which was initially inhibiting quick development , weakened , allowing for further development . later that day , an 18 @ . @ . to 17 @ . @ 5 mi ( 18 @ . @ . to 27 @ . @ 7 km ) wide eye formed as the storm began to move towards the west due to the trough . with the formation of the eye , the tracking technique produced an intensity of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , signifying that omar had intensified into a hurricane . the intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall weakened and the eye of the storm became slightly larger . however , deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared puerto rico . shortly after , the eye quickly became well @ - @ defined and visible on visible satellite images , an indication the storm was intensifying . the chances of rapid intensification were high as the storm featured well @ - @ level outflow and prominent eye features . with relatively warm sea surface temperatures , high ocean heat content , low wind shear , and a moist air mass , omar eventually reached its peak intensity early on october 16 as a category 1 hurricane with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) . during the strengthening phase , the forward motion of the storm increased to 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) . once over the atlantic ocean , omar began to rapidly weaken , with winds decreasing by 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) within 24 hours . visible satellite images showed an extremely low @ - @ level circulation with convection displaced to the west due to a combination of the high wind shear and dry air . on october 17 , most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated ; however , a brief decrease in wind shear allowed omar to re @ - @ up to its initial intensity , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . during this time , convection increased around the center and an eye formed . later that day , the trough that caused the increased forward motion bypassed omar , leading to decreasing winds . a weakening storm , omar turned towards the northeast due to a mid to high @ - @ level ridge just south of the center and the high @ - @ latitude .to the north . early on october 17 , wind shear increased once more as omar passed over waters below 26 ° f ( 79 ° f ) . by 0000 utc on october 18 , omar weakened to a tropical depression as the convection associated with it weakened . several hours later , while still producing tropical storm @ - @ force winds , the depression transitioned into a remnant low pressure area . the remnants of omar persisted until 0600 utc on october 21 when it dissipated about 805 mi ( 130 @ , @ 295 km ) west of the island . = = = = = on october 15 , the governor of the united states virgin islands announced the final preparations for hurricane omar as he issued a state of emergency declaration for the territory . all schools would be closed on october 16 . all non @ -

@ jesuit candidature , even with the official exclusion if necessary . some cardinals , among them lorenzo ganganelli , did not belong to this faction . the spanish and neapolitan governments had divided forty three italian cardinals into five categories : " good " ( eleven cardinals ) , " indifferent " ( eight ) , " good " ( ten ) , " bad " ( fifteen ) and " very bad " ( six ) : cardinal orsini , the official representative of the spanish court , and all the cardinals , were not included because it was certain that none of them would be directly elected pope . the french government was more involved than spanish and italian . only three cardinals were considered as cardinals : conti , durini and ganganelli out of these 43 cardinals , 27 or 28 were officially elected papabile , while the remaining 15 were excluded due to their age and health . = = = = = the conclave opened on february 6 , 1769 . initially only 27 cardinals entered . zelanti , taking advantage of the small number of the electors and the absence of the french and spanish governments , managed to secure the quick election of cardinal flavio chigi . in the ballot he was only two votes short of being elected . the efforts of zelanti met with strong opposition from the governments of france and spain , but , fortunately for them , cardinal orsini , protector of the kingdom of naples and the papal pro @ -

@ jesuit party from the hands of cardinal orsini , who could have blocked zelanti ’ s election even with the great difficulties . bernis had established a secret correspondence with french ambassador marquis d ' aubeterre , which was a violation of the canon law of the church . representatives of france and spain urged bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written promise to suppress the society . bernis refused , saying that receiving from the future pope a written or oral promise to suppress the society of jesus would be a violation of the canon law . in spite of this refusal , during the next few weeks bernis had rejected all proposals presented by zelanti as being acceptable to the order . in this way twenty @ -

@ jesuit party . they had violated the law of the conclave by establishing a correspondence with spanish ambassador azpuru . the spaniards had fewer scruples than bernis and , encouraged by cardinal malvezzi , took the matter into their own hands . they paid attention to the new cardinal of the sacred college , cardinal lorenzo ganganelli , o . f . m . conv . the attitude of ganganelli towards the jesuits was a great one – he had been educated by the jesuits and it is said that he received the red hat at the instance of father lorenzo ricci , general of the society of jesus , but during the papacy of gregory xiii he did not involve himself in the affairs of the order . cardinal solis responded by calling him curious as to his willingness to accept the promise made by the bourbon ##s as an acceptable condition for election . ganganelli replied that " i have in the future , the right to extinguish , with good conscience , the society of jesus ,that he observed the sacred law ; and that it was agreed that the pope should do everything in his power to secure the union of the cardinals " . it is not known whether this was a written or only an oral promise , but this promise evidently satisfied the ambassadors . at the same time zelanti , however began to refuse to give their votes to ganganelli , looking upon him as indifferent or even hostile to the jesuits . it seems that the attitude of zelanti was decided by the close correspondence between their leaders alessandro and gian francesco albani and the french ambassador . cardinal de bernis , the nominal head of the court cardinals , apparently did not play any part in the election of ganganelli and only followed the votes of marquis d ' aubeterre when they had been already known . = = = results of the ballots = = = the results of the ballots on april 27 and april 29 were following ( only the cardinal candidates are known ) : april 27 – fantuzzi – 4 ; colonna – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 4 ; stoppani – 4 ; ganganelli – 4 april 28 – fantuzzi – 9 ; colonna – 8 ; pozzobonelli – 7 ; stoppani – 8 ; ganganelli – 4 april 28 – colonna – 9 ; fantuzzi – 10 ; stoppani – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 10 ; ganganelli – 4 april 29 – colonna – 11 ; fantuzzi – 4 ; stoppani – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 4 ; ganganelli – 4 may 3 – colonna – 8 ; fantuzzi – 4 ; stoppani – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 4 ; ganganelli – 4 may 3 – colonna – 8 ; fantuzzi – 9 ; stoppani – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 4 ; ganganelli – 2 may 3 – colonna – 4 ; fantuzzi – 5 ; stoppani – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 4 ; ganganelli – 2 may 4 – colonna – 8 ; fantuzzi – 8 ; stoppani – 8 ; ganganelli – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 2 may 3 – fantuzzi – 8 ; colonna – 9 ; stoppani – 9 ; ganganelli – 8 ; pozzobonelli – 2 may 3 – fantuzzi – 8 ; stoppani – 9 ; colonna – 9 ; ganganelli – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 2 may 3 – colonna – 10 ; fan##tuzzi – 5 ; stoppani – 5 ; ganganelli – 5 ; pozzobonelli – 4 may 8 – colonna – 5 ; stoppani – 5 ; fantuzzi – 5 ; ganganelli – 5 ; pozzobonelli – 5 may 9 – colonna – 5 ; stoppani – 5 ; fantuzzi – 5 ; pozzobonelli – 5 ; ganganelli – xiii ⟩ 10 – colonna – 11 ; stoppani – 5 ; pozzobonelli – 5 ; fantuzzi – 5 ; ganganelli – 3 may 13 – colonna – 11 ; pozzobonelli – 5 ; stoppani – 5 ; ganganelli – 5 ; fantuzzi – 11 may 12 – colonna – 11 ; pozzobonelli – 11 ; stoppani – 6 ; ganganelli – 6 ; fantuzzi – 5 may 13 – colonna – 7 ; stoppani – 6 ; pozzobonelli – 6 ; ganganelli – 6 ; fantuzzi – 5 may 13 – colonna – 10 ; ganganelli – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 10 ; stoppani – 8 ; fantuzzi – 5 may 13 – colonna – 10 ; stoppani – 11 ; ganganelli – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 10 ; fantuzzi – 5 may 13 – colonna – 10 ; ganganelli – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 10 ; stoppani – 8 ; fantuzzi – 1 may 17 – colonna – 5 ; pozzobonelli – 5 ; ganganelli – 5 ; stoppani – 5 ; fantuzzi – 1 may 17 – ganganelli – 10 ; colonna – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 6 ; stoppani – 6 ; fantuzzi – [UNK] = = son of clement xiii = = in the papal vote on may 24 , 1769 cardinal lorenzo ganganelli was elected to the papacy with all votes out of his own , which he gave to carlo rezzonico , nephew of clement xiii and one of the sons of zelanti . he took the name of clement xiv , in honor of clement xiii , who had elected him to the papacy . on may 25 the new pope was consecrated to the papacy by cardinal federico marcello lante , bishop of porto e santa rufina and the @ -
