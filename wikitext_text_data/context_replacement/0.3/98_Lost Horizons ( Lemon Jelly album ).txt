" " ramblin ' man " is a dialogue between an interviewer ( the voice of john deakin — that of lemon jelly ' s fred deakin ) and " fred the ramblin ' man " ( the voice of fred ) , during which fred lists various places fromaround the world , ranging from " from small dutch villages to major european cities . " when listed in the order in which the locations are narrated , the message " bagpuss sees all things " is spelled out halfway through the track ( from brixton at four minutes ten seconds , to san jose at four minutes 31 seconds ) with the first letter of each word . the final track , " return to life " , features more traditional @ - @ musical elements . the track " nice day for ducks " is built around a sample used in david langstaff ' s song " all the ducks " . this sample is based on the traditional dutch children ' s song , " alle eendjes zwemmen in the water " ( english : " all the ducks are swimming in the water " ) . franglen has said that he and deakin were drawn to langstaff ' s recording because it " had a certain madness to it , almost hypnotic " . the duo had attempted to clear langstaff ' s sample for later , but were unable to . in the end , they had enn reitel and @ - @ record the final snippet . franglen , while admitting that reitel ' s sample was good , said that once the track was fully @ - @ recorded , its " appeal disappeared " . " experimental # 1 " , arguably the album ' s strongest track , is a magnetic tape recording of a doctor observing the side effects of an experimental drug given to a patient ; the song tells how the drug goes from normalcy , to an " intense sense of real @ - @ being and being " , before eventually disappearing . the album closes with " the song of ka ' zar " , which features " a two @ - @ - @ chorus and jazzy drum beats " . = = = = = = = = critical = = = = dark horizons received mostly positive reviews from music critics , although several critics criticized the album ' s near @ - @ - pace . stuart mason of allmusic called the album " a subtle but almost faceless mix of lounge pop , subtle funk , found sounds , with mellow jazz influences . " a reviewer for entertainment . ie praised the band for approaching electronica from a different angle , saying , " this london @ - @ based duo employ electric pianos , acoustic guitars and electronic beats to create the @ - @ back instrumentals enough to sooth even the most humble of listeners . [ .. . ] what really marks lemon jelly as their greatest success is their quirky sense of humour , which they use to brighten up their sound with the [ sic ] use of nursery rhymes , garage rock and electronic ##a . pascal wyse of the guardian wrote , " everything is approachable and purely fun , but far horizons cheats banality with some minor quirks : young people dancing , astronauts singing , panoramic sound effects . " chris dahlen of pitchfork media felt that the album was a bit too saccharine at times , writing that it is " the perfect disc to throw away after your four @ - @ disc ultrachill dub - mix will put the whole party to sleep . it ' s like ten pounds of balloons flying , bowling balls hitting the floor like hail , and a big plastic helium balloon that blows helium . " many reviews singled out " nice weather for ducks " as the album ' s best @ - @ out track . mason cited the " dreamy , acoustic guitar @ - @ out " song as one of the album ' s highlights in his review . dahlen described it as " the most interesting " on the album , and wrote that it was " a happy @ - @ slappy lollipop of a song that nicely sums this record up : fun , funny , and vaguely sinister . " wysel concluded , " when the moment arrives for ' nice weather for ducks ' it is hard to believe there is any evil in the world . " conversely , several reviewers felt that " cloud number six " did not fit with the mood of the rest of the album . wysel called it a " mess of ideas " that " comes as quite a surprise . " dahlen felt that the song itself " is the only clue in the [ album ' s ] story . " while he enjoyed the song ' s lyrics , calling it " so dark and sinister that it ' s more sinister than the rest of the album " , he felt that it was " annoyingly displaced . " hermann , on the other hand , called the song " creepy " and " spooky " with " lyrics . . . so well constructed that [ the concept ] works " . = = = singles and airplay = = = in the uk , the album charted at number 20 on the albums chart . in the us , it charted at number 24 on the billboard top independent albums chart . in both countries , it was the first lemon jelly album to do so . the album ' s two singles , "space ##man " and " bad weather for ducks " , also managed to chart on the uk singles chart , reaching numbers 36 and 33 respectively . however , this was a first for the group . on 20 july 2002 the album was certified platinum . almost six years later , on 22 july 2013 , it was certified gold , for sales of over 100 @ , @ 000 . in 2003 , the album was nominated for a mercury music prize , although the album lost to dizzee q ' s album in da corner . = = track listing = = = = production and personnel = = = = = = =
