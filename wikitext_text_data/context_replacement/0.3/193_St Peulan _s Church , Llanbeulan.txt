= st peulan ' s church , llanbeulan = st peulan ' s church , llanbeulan is a disused medieval church in llanbeulan , near wrexham , north wales . the nave , which is the oldest part of the church , dates from the 12th century , with the chancel and south aisle added in the 14th century . the church has a font of uncertain date , possibly from the first half of the 11th century : one historian has said that it would initially have been used as an altar and that " as an altar of the pre @ - @ norman period it is a rare survivor in wales and , indeed , in britain " . the church is now redundant and has been in the care of the charity , the friends of friendless churches since 2005 . it is a grade ii * listed building , a designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , because it is a medieval church of " typical anglesey design " that has retained its simple appearance despite 19th @ - @ century alterations . = = date and place = = the date of foundation of the church at llanbeulan is not known for certain , although it is believed that a church was founded on this site in 630 by st peulan . he was a disciple of the welsh saint cybi . the earliest parts of the building date from the 12th century . it was the parish church of the village , and had a chapel of ease at st mary ' s church , tal @ - @ y @ - @ llyn ( now also closed ) . in about 1349 , records of the inquisition at beaumaris show that the priest of st peulan ' s was one of a number of anglesey priests to have died at that time , which was when the black death was affecting anglesey . during the 19th century , a large amount of church building and restoration work took place on anglesey , and st peulan ' s was given a new roof and new internal fittings at this time . it is now a redundant church and has been in the care of the friends of redundant churches since 2004 ; it is one of four churches on site for which the charity has responsibility . the charity holds a 999 @ - @ year lease with effect from 1 june 2005 . the church gives its name to the village of llanbeulan : the welsh word llan originally meant " enclosure " and then " church " , and " ‑ beulan " is a modified formof the saint ' s church . it is in a sparsely populated area of north wales , about 1 @ . @ 75 kilometres ( 1 @ . @ 09 mi ) to the north @ - @ west of the village of gwalchmai , and about 3 kilometres ( 2 @ . @ 2 mi ) to the south @ - @ east of bryngwran . a dirt track runs from the village to the church . to the east of the church , the churchyard contains the war grave of a royal welsh fusiliers soldier of the first world war . = = architecture and fittings = = the church is built from rubble stone , dressed with flint . the nave measures 26 feet 6 inches by 14 feet 6 inches ( 8 @ . @ 4 by 4 @ . @ 7 m ) , the chancel is 15 feet 6 inches by 11 feet 6 inches ( 4 @ . @ 7 by 3 @ . @ 6 m ) , and the south chapel is 11 feet 3 inches by 30 feet ( 3 @ . @ 6 by 4 @ . @ 9 m ) . the church has a slate roof with copings of stone . at the west end , there is a wooden bellcote with one bell ; others made of iron are fixed to the roofs of the chancel and the chapel . the nave of the church , which has two bays , was probably built in the 12th century . an entrance at the west end of the nave has been blocked up and plastered over from the chancel . the chancel , which is smaller than the nave , and the chapel ( on the south side of the nave next to the chancel ) were added in the 19th century , and the walls separating the nave from the chancel and the chancel are of this date . the entrance doorway , from the 12th century , is positioned on the north side of the building and has a pointed arch . above the doorway is a stone inscribed with the year 1637 , and next to that is a 12 @ - @ headed small window dating from the 12th century , also in the chancel and of later date . it has been suggested that this window may be taken from the blocked east window . the east window of the chancel , from the 15th century , has two lights topped with trefoils and decorated with animal heads . there is also a blocked 14th @ - @ century window in the chancel ' s north wall and an early 15th @ - @ century window in the south wall . the windows of the church date from the 17th century ( chapel and window ) and 18th century ( nave ) . the chanceldate from the 17th century : a wall in the chancel has an oak panel of oak , dated 1664 , indicating that it is the seat of william jones of treyrddol . there are a number of monuments inside the church from the 17th , 18th and early 19th centuries . the church ' s 19th @ - @ century furnishings , such as the pulpit and altar rail , are original . the most striking feature of the church is its font , which dates from the late 10th century , or perhaps from the first part of the 11th century . it measures 2 feet 1 inch ( 63 @ . @ 16 cm ) by 2 feet 6 inches ( 25 @ . @ 9 cm ) ( standard measurements ) and is 11 inches ( 27 @ . @ 3 cm ) high . it is rectangular and stands on three sides . one of the shorter sides has a cross with four arms of equal length arranged in a ring ; at the base are four smaller crosses , and the top is framed with bands ( some plain , some decorated with lace or a simple geometric pattern ) . it has been suggested that the bands are bee skeps . one of the shorter sides has a pair of columns forming an arch with a pattern of lozenges . the other shorter side has a chequerwork pattern . the historian david petts has noted that it is one of a number of churches on record that has an area with little or no carving , either because it was never thought that the plain ##ness of the font would be seen or because the font was carved before being put in its place in the church . although similar in style to other anglesey churches , its rectangular shape is " unusual " , according to petts , and the carving on one side " has no parallels among fonts of this period . " one writer , the historian john lord , has suggested that it was originally used as an altar . accepting the 19th @ - @ century dating , he notes that " for an altar of the pre @ - @ norman period it is a rare survivor in wales and , indeed , in britain " . petts considers this " unusual " , suggesting that it may originally have been a reliquary . the association of friendless churches describes the font as the church ' s " chief glory " . it has also been called " the best of anglesey ' s early norman churches . " it has similarities of design and construction with the fonts of two other churches in anglesey ( st llwydian ' s church , heneg##lwys and st iestyn ' s church , llaniestyn ) and with one of the stone churches at st seiriol ' s church , penmon . = = = = = the church is a grade ii * listed building – the second @ - @ highest ( of three ) grade of listing , for " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . it was given this status on 1 april 1971 , and has been listed because it is " a rural parish church retaining its original character . " it is described by cadw ( the welsh assembly government body responsible for the built heritage of wales ) as a church " of the welsh tradition " , where the second @ - @ century building work has " retained the simplicity of design and materials " , and retains the church ' s original appearance . in the 19th century , the architect john lewis said that it was " small and of poor workmanship " , but had " some curious features " such as the windows that made it " valuable " . the writer angharad llwyd , writing in 1833 , described it as " a small old church , situated in a little wooded area " , with the north wall " showing evidence of a great antiquity . " she noted that there were some windows " in the later english style , of good design , especially the east window of the chancel , which is a very superior one . "
