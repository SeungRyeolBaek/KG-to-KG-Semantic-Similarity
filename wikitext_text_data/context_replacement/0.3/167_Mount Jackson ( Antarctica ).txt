= mount jackson ( antarctica ) = mount jackson ( mount andrew jackson and mount ernest gruening ) is a mountain that dominates the upland of the southern part of the antarctic peninsula . it is located in palmer land , in the antarctic region of argentina , chile and the united kingdom . with an elevation of 3 @ , @ 184 metres ( 11 @ , @ 446 ft ) , mount jackson is the highest mountain in the antarctic peninsula and the british antarctic territory . discovered by members of the united states antarctic service , 1939 – 41 , it was named for andrew jackson , the seventh president of the united states . the first ascent of mount jackson was made by a team led by john crabbe cunningham of the british antarctic survey ( bas ) in 1964 . mount jackson ' s summit was studied in 1972 as part of the ross island investigations by a team of scientists . mount jackson and the jackson massif dominate the central antarctic coast , which is marked by many inlets and is bounded on the west by the plateau of central palmer land . the two mountains rise above the ice shelf with reliefs of between 1 @ , @ , – 1 @ , @ 275 metres ( 3 @ , @ 900 – 3 @ , @ 900 ft ) towards the east . they are separated by icefall , forming a plateau with steep ##er ##ds . mount jackson rises from its southeast side , with a steeple peak , while the northwest flank is dominated by a vast cirque . supraglacial ridges on the mountain ' s south flank measure about 1 – 5 kilometres ( 1 @ . @ 62 – 3 @ . @ 62 ft ) in length and display boulders at their lower ends . = = = = = the first topographic mapping of mount jackson was carried out in november 1940 by a sledge party of the united states antarctic service ( us ) . the topographic survey was accompanied by aerial photography and radio observations . the height was estimated at 1 @ , @ 200 metres ( 1 @ , @ 800 ft ) , and the mountain was named mount ernest gruening after the governor of the alaska territory at that time , ernest gruening . wilkes later renamed it mount jackson for the seventh president of the united states . president jackson signed the bill into law authorizing the united states exploring expedition of 1838 – ′ . the expedition , led by lt . charles wilkes , included exploration and mapping of the pacific ocean and antarctic islands , including antarctica . in november 1947 , a falkland islands geological survey ( fids ) field party based at stonington islandobserved mount jackson and estimated its height at 3 @ , @ 050 metres ( 10 @ , @ 010 ft ) , slightly lower and more distant than the first ascent in 1940 . when the falkland islands dependencies survey was renamed british antarctic survey in 1962 , a number of stations were developed , including one at mount jackson . bas teams were involved in making many successful ascent of the mountains of the antarctic peninsula , and colin scott , who worked at the bas base at adelaide island , was the first to climb mount jackson . traveling by dog sled for 640 kilometres ( 400 mi ) , his team reached the summit on 23 december 1964 . the precise height of the peak was determined by a british survey party that ascended the peak during the austral summer of 1996 – ##0 . = = geography = = the peak is 3 @ , @ 184 metres ( 10 @ , @ 446 ft ) in elevation , with a prominence of 3 @ , @ 187 metres ( 7 @ , @ 610 ft ) and a saddle dem of 997 metres ( 3 @ , @ 271 ft ) . mount jackson and the adjacent mountains form the central black coast , which is separated by many inlets and is bounded on the west by the plateau of central palmer land , with elevation ranging between 2 @ , @ 000 – 2 @ , @ 000 metres ( 2 @ , @ 600 – 2 @ , @ 800 ft ) , and on the west side of the central black coast . the adjacent mountains rise above the plateau , with reliefs of approximately 1 @ , @ 200 – 2 @ , @ 500 metres ( 3 @ , @ 900 – 4 @ , @ 900 ft ) towards the east . they are interconnected by fracture zones and a ridge with steep snow slopes . the central part of the mountain range , which extends for 3 @ , @ 590 kilometres ( 990 mi ) , covers most of the antarctic peninsula , and mount jackson is its highest point . mount jackson rises from the south flank , with a steeple summit , while the north flank is occupied by a glacial cirque . supraglacial moraines on the mountain ' s east side measure between [UNK] – 5 kilometres ( 1 @ . @ 62 – and @ . @ 62 mi ) in length and display boulders at their eastern ends . mount jackson and the rowley range are separated by odom inlet . cline glacier drains from mount jackson before terminating at odom inlet . mount jackson ' s geology was studied in 1972 as part of the palmer land investigations , a scientific of geologists. they represent various rock types and underlying volcanic rocks . the relief of the west facing slope is gentler when compared to the eastern side , characterized by a steep rock face . rock weathering is intense in the area associated with basalt and felsenmeer . unusual rock formations and rock disintegration are noted .
