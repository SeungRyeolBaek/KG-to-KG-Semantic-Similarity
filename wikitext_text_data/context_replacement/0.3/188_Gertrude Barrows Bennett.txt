= gertrude mabel bennett = gertrude barrows bennett ( 1883 – 1948 ) was the first major female writer of fantasy and science fiction in the united states , writing her stories under the pseudonym francis bennett . bennett wrote a number of critically acclaimed books between 1917 and 1923 and has been called " the woman who invented modern fantasy " . her most famous works are mars ( which robert h . wells , in a letter to the editor called " one of the best and most compelling science fiction novels you will ever read " ) and the lost fantasy novel the citadel of mars . she also wrote an early fantasy novel , the shadow of cerberus ( 1919 ) . = = = = = gertrude mabel barrows was born in philadelphia in 1883 . she attended school until the eighth grade , then attended drama school in hopes of becoming an actress ( a goal she never achieved ) . instead , she began working as a journalist , a job she held on and kept for the rest of her life . in 1909 barrows married stewart bennett , a fellow scientist and journalist , and moved to philadelphia . a year later her husband died while on an expedition . with a newly @ - @ born daughter to raise , bennett continued working as a journalist . when her husband died toward the end of world war i , bennett helped care for her invalid mother . during this time period she began to write a number of short stories and novels , only stopping when her mother died in 1920 . in the following @ - @ year , she moved to california . because she was separated from her husband , for a number of years many believe bennett died in 1939 ( the date of her final letter to her husband ) . however , new evidence , including her death certificate , shows that she died in 1948 . = = = career = = bennett wrote her first short story at age 17 , a science fiction story titled " the curious experience of thomas dunbar " . she mailed the story to argosy , then one of the first fantasy magazines . the story was accepted and published in the march 1904 issue . once bennett returned to take care of her mother , she decided to return to fiction writing as a means of supporting her family . the first story she wrote after her return to america was the novella " the nightmare , " which appeared in the @ - @ fantasy magazine in 1917 . the story is set on an earth separated from the rest of the world , on which time has taken a different course . " the nightmare " resembles edgar rice burroughs ' the day that time has, itself , a year later . while bennett had written " the nightmare " under her own name , she had intended to use a pseudonym if it was published . the magazine ' s editor chose not to use the pseudonym francis stevens ( jean vail ) and instead submitted the story to francis stevens . when readers responded positively to the story , bennett decided to continue writing under the name . over the next few years , bennett wrote a number of short stories and novels . her short story " the island " ( pen @ - @ story weekly , 1918 ) , for example , is set in a pen @ - @ island inhabited by aliens . another example is the novella " serapion " ( sphere , 1920 ) , about a woman possessed by a supernatural creature . this story has been included in an electronic anthology entitled possessed : a tale of the demon serapion , with three other stories by her . many of her short stories have been collected in the nightmare and other tales of dark fantasy ( university of nebraska press , 2004 ) . in 1918 she published her first , and perhaps best , novel the citadel of fear ( argosy , 1918 ) . this real world story centers on a lost aztec city , which is " rediscovered " during world war i . it was in the introduction to the 1952 paperback edition of the novel which revealed for the first time that " francis stevens " was bennett ' s pen @ - @ name . a year later she published her only science fiction novel , the temple of evil ( the thrill book , 1919 ) . one of the first horror novels , the novel features a " magical artifact from a silver box " which transports anyone who touches it to a future world of 2118 . one of bennett ' s most famous novels was possessed ( sphere , 1920 ; reprinted 1966 and 2004 ) , in which a supernatural artifact summons an ancient and powerful god to 21st century new jersey . augustus h . swift called the novel , " one of the best and most powerful science fantasy novels you will ever read " ) . = = = = = bennett has been described as having " the best contribution to creating the modern genre of dark fantasy " . it has been said that bennett ' s writings influenced both h . p . lovecraft and a . merritt , both of whom " emulated bennett ' s earlier style and style " . lovecraft was also said to have praised bennett ' s work . however , there is debate over whether or not this actually happened and the praise appears to havederived from authorship wrongly attributed to lovecraft . as for merritt , for many years critics and scholars believed " francis bennett " was a pseudonym of his . this confusion finally ended with the 1952 publication of citadel of fear , which featured a biographical sketch of bennett by lloyd arthur eshbach . author sam moskowitz said she was the " first woman writer of fantasy fiction in the world between mary wollstonecraft shelley and c . l . moore " . because bennett was the first american woman to have her fantasy and science fiction widely published , she has been recognized in recent years as a pioneering american fantasy writer . = = = = = = = the citadel of fear ( 1918 ;
