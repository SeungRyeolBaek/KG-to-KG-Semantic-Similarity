= fastra ii = the fastra ii is a 3d computer used for tomography . it was built in early 2009 by the astra ( advanced scale tomographic reconstruction array ) group of researchers of the ibbt ( interdisciplinary center for computer technology ) visionlab at the university of antwerp and by the machine shop ##pers , in collaboration with asus , a german multinational semiconductor product manufacturer , as the successor to the fastra i ( built in 2008 ) . the fastra ii was designed to be about 10 times faster than the fastra i , which in turn was slightly faster than the 512 @ - @ core cluster . however , because of the number of gpus in the system , the computer initially suffered from several issues , including the cpu inability to load and load due to a lack of space between the video cards . = = = = = the computer was built as a research and development project by the astra group of researchers of the vision ##lab at the university of antwerp in 2009 , one of the founders being joost batenburg . unlike more modern computers such as the cray ##kit and the ibm roadrunner , which cost millions of euros , the fastra ii only uses consumer hardware , costing â‚¬ 6 @ , @ 000 in 2009 . the fastra ii ' s predecessor , the fastra i , uses 4 dual @ - @ gpu geforce 9800 gx2 video cards , for a total of 8 gpus . at that time , the astra group needed a motherboard that had four pci express x16 slots with double @ - @ spacing between each of them . the only such motherboard the astra group could afford at that time was the msi k9a2 computer , which had four such slots . in 2009 , the asus p6t7 ##2 ##x motherboard , which the fastra ii uses , was introduced , which has four pci express x16 slots . the fastra ii has six identical dual @ - @ gpu geforce gtx 295 video cards , and a single @ - @ gpu geforce gtx 275 , for a total of 8 gpus . in the fastra ii , the gpus only perform tomographic tasks . the technique which allows gpus to perform general @ - @ purpose computing like this type of gaming , instead of graphics , is called gpgpu , general @ - @ purpose computing on graphics video cards . overheating caused by the lack of space between the video cardsdevelopment started on the fastra ii to keep the side - door open , so that the video cards can breathe regular air , decreasing the air pressure inside the case . due to the lack of gpus in the computer , the first boot was impossible . this is because its motherboard uses a 32 bit bios , which only provides about 2 gb of address space for the video cards . however , asus managed to provide them a new bios that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the gtx 295 video card . the bios @ - @ compatible coreboot was not tested . all three pci express x16 slots of the asus p6t7 motherboard were used in the development of the fastra ii computer . however , the video cards in the fastra ii are wide enough to require two expansion slots each . to solve this issue , the team came up with flexible pci express cables , and also developed a special case which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard . = = specifications and benchmarks = = like the fastra i , the fastra ii uses a lian @ ##b @ - @ p80 armorsuit ##e , which has two expansion slots . the motherboard in the fastra ii was at that time the only available motherboard that had two full @ - @ compatible pci express x16 slots . the memory cards were initially six 2 gb modules , which were later increased to 8 gb modules , for a total of 24 gb . instead of an eighth dual @ - @ gpu video card , the dual @ - @ gpu gtx 275 is in the computer because , out of all the video cards in the fastra ii , the gtx 275 is the only card the fastra ii ' s bios can fully support . the total amount of gpus is 13 . the video cards each have 12 gb of processing power . two of the three gtx 295 video cards have 2 pcbs , while the other two have only 1 pcb . according to the benchmarks on its official website , the fastra ii is faster and more energy efficient than its predecessors , including the fastra i and the tesla c1060 video card . the tests were performed on the fastra ii , the fastra i , a 512 @ - @ core ##boot ( composed of opteron cpus ) , an nvidia tesla c1060 video card , an intel core i7 940 cpu , and on the intel core i7 940 cpu itself . thefastra ii is over three times faster than the fastra i in ct slice and ##s . although the fastra ii consumes more power than the fastra i , it ' s over three times as energy efficient as the fastra i , and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512 @ - @ core cluster . the video processors run at 40 degrees celsius when idle , and at 45 degrees celsius at full power . = = input and reception = = the operating system is centos , a windows based linux distribution and red hat enterprise linux clone . the fastra ii had a positive initial impression . linux . com called it the " world ' s most powerful desktop @ - @ based computer " , describing it as a machine with " so much power in such a small space . " itech news net called it " the most powerful desktop computer " . fastra ii relies on nvidia ' s scalable memory infrastructure ( sli ) and is not limited to the number of gpus supported by it and only by the two of the free and free @ - @ source device drivers . the fastra ii ' s motherboard is designed for workstations , and it is currently being used in europe for medical imaging . it remains to be seen whether a fastra ii nvlink , or built with free @ - @ source gpus , will be available .
