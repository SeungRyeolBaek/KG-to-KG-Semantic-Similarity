= corn crake = the corn crake , rail or landrail ( crex crex ) is a bird in the rail family . it breeds in europe and asia as far east as southern china , and migrate to africa for the northern hemisphere ' s winter . it is a medium @ - @ sized crake with buff - or grey @ - @ streaked brownish @ - @ black upperparts , chestnut markings on the wings , and blue @ - @ grey plumage with cream @ - @ coloured and white bars on the back and undertail . the short bill is flesh @ - @ coloured , the iris is dark brown , and the legs and feet are pale brown . juveniles are similar in plumage to adults , and downy wings are present , as with other rails . there are no subspecies , although birds from the east of the breeding range tend to be slightly larger than their western counterparts . the bird ' s call is a loud krek krek , from which the common name is derived . the corn rail is larger than its close relative , the african rail , which shares its breeding range ; that species is also less @ - @ plumaged , and has a plainer face . the corn rail ' s breeding habitat is grassland , particularly chalk , and it uses similar environments as the breeding grounds . this small bird builds a nest of dry leaves in a hollow in the ground and lays 6 – 14 cream @ - @ shaped eggs which are white with rufous blotches . these hatch after about – ##0 days , and the two remaining chicks fledge after about two weeks . this species is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before construction is completed . the corn rail is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates , the occasional small bird or mammal , and plant material including grass seeds and cereal ##s . its threats include introduced and introduced species , large mammals , various parasites and insects . although numbers have declined steeply in eastern china , this bird is classed as least concern on the iucn red list because of its huge range and large , but stable , populations in russia and kazakhstan . declines in western china are more rapid than previously thought , and conservation efforts have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest declines . despite its small nature , the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in china , and given a number of common and scientific names . = = taxonomy = = the rails are a large family comprising nearly500 bc . although records of the group are lost in antiquity , the largest number of small and least specialised genera are found in the old world , suggesting this group originated there . the taxonomy of the small crakes is complex , but the closest relative of the corn crake is the african species , c . egregia , which has sometimes been given its own genus , crecopsis , but is now more usually placed in it . both species are short @ - @ billed small birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland , typical of birds . porzana crakes , particularly the blue @ - @ - crake ( porzana albicollis ) are near relatives of the crex ##idae . corn crakes were first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 as rallus crex , which was subsequently moved to the genus crex , erected by german naturalist and explorer johann matthaus bechstein in 1803 , and named ara pratensis . the current spelling of crex gives it precedence over bechstein ' s original ara pratensis , and hence to the current name of crex crex . the scientific name , crex crex , from the ancient greek " κρεξ " , is onomatopoeic , referring to the crake ' s distinctive loud call . the english name was formerly spelt as a single word , " corn " , but the official name is now " corn crake " . the two names refer to the species preference of living in open fields or flooded fields , rather than marshes used by other members of this family . = = description = = the corn crake is a medium @ - @ billed bird , about – ##0 cm ( [UNK] – [UNK] in ) long with a wingspan of 42 – # cm ( 17 – 11 in ) . males weigh 165 g ( 5 @ . @ 1 oz ) on average and females 145 g ( 5 @ . @ 1 oz ) . the adult male has the crown of its head and all of its upperparts blue @ - @ grey in colour , streaked with chestnut or chestnut . the wing coverts are a pale chestnut , with broad white bars . the head , throat and breast are blue @ - @ grey , ranging from a dark brown band from the base of the bill to below the eye , the belly is white , and the breast , and undertail are streaked with chestnut and white . the upper breast is blue @ - @ grey , the loweris dark brown , and the legs and feet are dark brown . compared to the male , the female has buff @ - @ brown upperparts and a slightly duller eye streak . during the breeding season , the upperparts of both sexes become darker and the underparts less grey . the juvenile is like the adult in appearance , but has a lighter tone to the upperparts , and the grey of the adult is replaced with buff @ - @ brown . the young have brown heads , as with other rails . while there are no subspecies , different populations show great individual differences in plumage , and the birds gradually become paler and greyer towards the end of the range . they undergo a complete moult after breeding , which is normally finished by late august or early september , before migration to south eastern africa . there is a pre @ - @ breeding partial recovery prior to the return from africa , mainly involving the plumage of the head , body and tail . young birds retain the head and tail for about five months after hatching . the corn crake is sympatric with the wood rail on the breeding grounds , but can be distinguished by its larger size , darker upperparts , tawny upperwing and darker underparts overall . in flight , it has longer , less rounded wings , and shorter wingbeats than its african relative , and shows a darker leading edge to the tail feathers . in both the breeding and migration ranges it is unlikely to be confused with any other rail , since sympatric species are similar , with white markings on the upperparts , different underparts patterns and shorter bills . the male corn ##bird can resemble a gamebird , but the dark wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic . = = = voice = = = on the breeding grounds , the eastern corn rail ' s advertisement call is a loud , repetitive , grating krek krek , given from a high perch with the male ' s head and neck nearly vertical and the bill wide open . the call can be heard from 1 @ . @ 5 km ( 0 @ . @ 93 mi ) away , and serves to mark the breeding territory , attract females , and deter intruding males . these differences in vocalisations mean that individual males can be distinguished by their calls . early in the season , the call is given almost exclusively at night , and often during the day , too . it can be heard more than 1 @ , @ 000 times a day , with a peak between 1 and 2 am . the call is evolved tomaking a singing female ' s approach difficult , as this species hides in trees . the frequency of calls reduces after a few weeks but may increase again towards the end of the laying period before falling away towards the end of the breeding season . to attract males , mechanical imitation of their call can be produced by rubbing a piece of wood down a notched hole , or by flicking the calling card against a zip or zip @ - @ fastener . the male also has a growling call , made with the bill shut and raised during social interactions . the female corn crake may have a call that is similar to that of the male ; she also makes a loud barking sound , almost in rhythm to the male , but without the same quality . the female also makes a high @ - @ pitched cheep sound , and an oo @ - @ oo @ - @ oo sound to alert the male . the chicks have a loud peeick @ - @ peeick contact call , and a call used to beg for food . because of the difficulty of seeing this species , it is usually identified by counting and calling between 1 am and 3 am ; the birds do not fly far at night , whereas they may wander up to 600 m ( 660 yd ) during the day , which could amount to double @ - @ counting if observed alone . identifying individual males suggests that just the calling birds underestimates the male count by nearly 30 % , and the discrepancy is likely to be significant , since only 10 % of males can call at once in a single night . the corn crake is found in africa . = = distribution and habitat = = the corn crake breeds from britain and ireland east through europe to central asia . although it has disappeared from much of its historic range , this bird was once found in suitable habitat , almost always between latitudes 41 ° n and 62 ° n . there is also a sizable population in western china , but this species breeds only occasionally in northern europe and in turkey . old reports of occurrence in south africa are false , and arise from misidentification of eggs in a museum , which are not those of the common rail . the corn rail winters mainly in africa , from the democratic republic of the congo and southern tanzania south to eastern south africa . outside of this range , it is mainly found on migration , but occasionally occurs in north africa and to the east and south of its historic range in south africa . most of the south african population of about 1 @ , @ 000 birdsrecords in kwazulu @ - @ natal and the former cape province , and elsewhere elsewhere in africa are unknown . there are several early @ - @ century records , when populations were much higher than now , of birds being seen in western europe , mainly britain and ireland , between december and february . this species migrates to africa along two main routes : a direct route through morocco and algeria , and a less direct flyway through tunisia . during passage , it has been recorded in many countries within its breeding and wintering ranges , including much of west africa . birds from coll on the western route paused in south africa on their way back south , and again on the return journey , when they also rested in namibia or south africa . eastern migrants have been recorded in those parts of southern europe that lie between the limits of the breeding range and africa . further afield , the corn ##bird has been recorded as a vagrant to sri lanka , india and australia , the seychelles , india , canada , the netherlands , greenland , iceland , the azores , the azores , madeira , and the canary islands . the corn ##bird is primarily a lowland species , but occurs up to 1 @ , @ 180 m ( 4 @ , @ 600 ft ) altitude in the himalayas , 2 @ , @ 700 m ( 8 @ , @ 900 ft ) in china and 3 @ , @ 000 m ( 9 @ , @ 800 ft ) in japan . when breeding in eurasia , the corn ##bird ' s habitats would originally have included hay meadows with tall grass and meadow plants , grasses and rushes . it is now usually found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay , particularly moist ##er farmland with no cultivation or grazing use . it also utilises other treeless areas in mountains , taiga , on glaciers , and where threatened by fire . moister areas like wetland areas may be used , but very wet areas are avoided , as are open areas and those with vegetation less than 50 cm ( 20 in ) tall , or too short to walk through . the odd bush or hedge may be used as a calling area . grassland which is not cultivated or grazed becomes too matted to be used for nesting , but other grasses such as corn , barley , wheat , clover or potatoes may be used . after breeding , adults move to other grasses such as tall reed , grass , or heather to feed , returning to the hay and silage fields for the next brood . in europe , it is also used fornest site . although they often nest in intensively managed grass and other vegetation , successful breeding is rare , and nests on the field margins or on fallow ground are more likely to succeed . when breeding in captivity , the corn # prefers dry grassland and savanna habitats , occurring in trees 30 – . cm ( 0 @ . @ - – . @ . @ 750 ft ) high , in seasonally flooded fields and in sedges and reed beds . it is also found on fallow and abandoned land , in fields on farms , and the edges of crops . it breeds at up to at least 3 @ , @ 750 metres ( 5 @ , @ 740 ft ) altitude in southern africa . each bird breeds in a fairly small area . although breeding occasionally occurs with the african robin , that bird generally prefers deeper and shorter foraging areas than does the corn crake . on migration , the corn # may also occur in wheatfields and on golf courses . = = behaviour = = the corn crake is a difficult bird to see during the breeding season , usually being hidden by vegetation , but will sometimes venture into the open . occasionally , it may become more trusting ; for two consecutive summers , an individual living on the scottish island of tiree used a kitchen to feed two chickens , and , in 1999 , a wintering barra bird would ask for poultry feed after the chickens had finished . in general , it is more secretive than the african crake , and , unlike its relatives , it is rarely seen in the open , although it sometimes appears on tracks or road sides . the corn crake is most active early and late in the day , after heavy rain and during light frost . its typical flight is weak and fluttering , although less so than that of the african crake . for longer periods , such as migration , it has a steadier , stronger flight with legs tucked up . it flies with a steady @ - @ - action , and will run swiftly through grass with its body nearly horizontal and laterally compressed . it will swim if disturbed . when approached by a predator , it will fly less than 50 m ( 160 ft ) , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket , and then dive on it . if disturbed in the open , this bird will typically run in a crouch for a short distance , with its neck stretched out , and stand up to greet the intruder . when disturbed it will usually sleep , recovering at dawn if it finds a way out . the corn ##bird is common on the winteringgrounds , where each bird occupies 4 @ . @ 2 – 4 @ . @ 9 ha ( 23 – + acres ) at a time , although the total area used may be twice that , since an individual may move away due to rain , tree growth , or grass growth . flocks of up to 100 birds may form on migration , sometimes associating with common quails . breeding takes place at night , and birds arriving during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at different sites . the ability to fly is unknown , not least from adults . young born from females kept in captivity for ten years were able to fly to africa and return with similar results to the @ - @ wild birds . = = = breeding = = = until 1995 , it was thought that the common cuckoo is resident , but it transpires that a male may have a larger home range , and mate with one or more females , depending on when laying is considered complete . the male ' s territory may range from 3 to 51 ha ( 7 @ . @ 0 to 126 @ . @ 0 acres ) , but averages 15 @ . @ 16 ha ( 39 acres ) . the female has a much smaller range , averaging around 5 @ . @ 5 ha ( 12 acres ) . the male will greet an intruder by calling with his wings spread and his head turned upwards . sometimes the stranger moves off ; if it does , the two birds meet up with heads and tails raised and the heads touching the ground . they then run around making the growling sound and lunging at each other . a real fight may occur , with the birds leaping at each other and biting , and sometimes kicking . females play no role in defending the territory . the female may be offered food by the male during courtship . she performs a brief courtship display in which the neck is extended and the head bent forward , the tail is raised , and the wings are spread with the head touching the ground . he will then attempt to approach the female from behind , and then leap on her back to mate . the nest is built in grass , sometimes in open sites behind a hedge , or near an oak tree or shrub , or in overgrown vegetation . where grass is not high enough at the beginning of the season , the first nest may be built in herby or marsh vegetation , with the second brood in between . the second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first , to take advantage of the later @ - @ in vegetation further up a hill . the second ,often found in the bush , is placed in a scrape or hollow in the ground . it is made of very coarse dry grass and other materials , and lined with fine grasses . although nest building is usually described as done by the male , a recent scientific study found that in the captive population the female always builds the nest . the nest is 12 – 15 cm ( 1 @ . @ 7 – 1 @ . @ 6 in ) in diameter and 3 – ##½ cm ( 1 @ . @ . – 1 @ . @ 6 in ) deep . the clutch is 6 – 14 , sometimes more – 12 eggs ; these are oval , very white , creamy or spotted with yellow , brown or grey , and marked with @ - @ brown . they measure 13 mm × 26 mm ( 1 @ . @ 5 in × 1 @ . @ 1 in ) and weigh about 13 – 16 g ( 0 @ . @ . – 0 @ . @ 0 oz ) , of which 10 % is shell . the eggs are laid at regular intervals , but each brood may also have two eggs added per day . incubation is by the female alone ; her tendency to sit still when feeding , or wait until the last moment to feed , leads to many deaths during the @ - @ laying and harvesting . the eggs hatch out after 19 – 20 days , and the precocial young leave the nest within a day or two . they are fed by the female for three or four days , but will eat their own food thereafter . the juveniles fledge after 34 – 38 days . the second brood is started about 42 days after the first , and the incubation period is much longer at 16 – 18 days . the grown young usually stay with the mother until departure for africa . nest success in breeding areas is high , at 80 – 90 % , but much lower in fertilised areas and on arable land . the amount and timing of harvesting is crucial ; annual mowing can kill 38 – 95 % of chicks in a given year , and on average 50 % of first brood chicks and somewhat more than 40 % of second brood chicks . the effect of temperature on their survival is unknown ; although plant growth is faster in dry , warm areas , the numbers are relatively low . unlike many precocial birds , chicks are fed by their parents to a greater or lesser extent until they become mature , and this may cushion them from adverse weather . the number of young chicks hatched is more important than the survival , with lower survival of large broods. the annual population survival rate is under 1 % , although some individuals may live for more – 7 years . = = = = = = = the corn crake is nocturnal , and mainly feeds on invertebrates , including earthworms , slugs and snails , spiders , beetles , flies , grasshoppers and other insects . in the breeding areas , it is a predator of sitona weevils , which eat legume ##s . and in the past , large quantities of the introduced introduced pests , leatherjackets and wireworms . this species will also eat small frogs and mammals , and plant material including grass seeds and cereal ##s . the diet in the wintering grounds is generally similar , and includes readily available items such as spiders , cockroaches and dung beetles . food is taken from the ground , low @ - @ growing , and from within the tussocks ; the bird will scrape leaf litter with its bill , and run in search of its prey . nesting is normally in cover , but , particularly in the wintering areas , it will occasionally hunt on grassy fields or dirt roads . indigestible material is collected as 10 cm ( 4 @ . @ 39 mi ) pellets . chicks are fed mainly on ground feed , and when fully grown they may fly with the wings up to 6 @ . @ 4 km ( 4 @ . @ 2 mi ) to visit supplementary feeding areas . as with other birds , water is used to help build up food in the stomach . = = predators and parasites = = predators in the breeding grounds include feral and domestic cats , the american mink , feral pigs , otters and red foxes , and birds including the common raven and american crow . in lithuania , the introduced barn owl has also been recorded as eating corn seeds . when they are disturbed by field mowing , they may be attacked by large birds including the white stork , eagles and other birds of prey , crows and corvids . at least , nests and broods are rarely attacked , as reflected in their low breeding success . there is one record of a corn crake on migration through europe being attacked by a black sparrowhawk . the parasitic fly prosthogonimus ovatus , which lives in the oviducts of birds , has been recorded in the same field , as has the parasitic fly plagiorchis elegans , the larvae of other flies , and hard -of the genera haemaphysalis and ixodes . during the reintroduction of corn ##birds to england in the 2003 breeding season , enteritis and ill health in pre @ - @ release individuals was attributed to bacteria of a pathogenic campylobacter species . subsequently , microbiology tests were conducted to detect infected individuals and to determine the presence of the bacteria in their blood . = = = = = until 2010 , with a breeding population estimated at 12 @ , @ 500 @ , @ 000 km2 ( 500 @ , @ 800 @ , @ 000 sq mi ) , the corn ##bird was classified as near threatened on the iucn red list because of serious declines in numbers , but improved monitoring in russia indicates that anticipated declines there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable and have increased . it is therefore now classified as least concern , since the major populations in russia and kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the long term . there are an estimated 4 @ . @ 3 – @ @ . @ 0 million breeding pairs in europe , three @ - @ million of which are in european russia , and a further 515 @ , @ 000 – @ @ , @ 240 @ , @ 000 pairs in asian russia ; the total european population has been estimated at between 5 @ . @ 45 and 6 @ . @ 1 million individuals . in most of the european part of its range , there have been long @ - @ million declines that are expected to continue , although conservation measures have enabled populations to grow in several areas , including a five @ - @ million increase in ireland , and a third in the uk . in the netherlands , there were 33 breeding pairs in 1996 , and this number had increased to at least 500 by 1998 . the european corn # population had begun to decline in the 19th century , but the decline gained momentum after world war ii . the main cause of the population declines in much of europe was the loss of eggs and chicks from early mowing . breeding dates have moved forward over the past century due to rapid population growth , made possible by land clearing and the introduction of fertilisers , and the transition from manual stakes @ - @ drawn using horses to mechanical ones , at first horse @ - @ drawn and later drawn by horses . mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut down , leaving the crake with two alternative sites to nest : a second brood if suitable vegetation has remained , and a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed . the pattern of mowing , typically in athe pattern from the edge of the field to its centre , gives little chance of survival for the young , which are also exposed to potential animal predators . adults can often escape the mowers , although some adult females are still on the nest , with mixed results . loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake . apart from the greater suitability of drained and drained silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows , in western europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies , and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important grassland area . more localised threats include hunting in britain , and destruction by fire and wind erosion . this bird makes heavy eating ; when they were common in britain , mrs beeton recommended roasting four on a skewer . more significant than direct hunting is the loss of migratory birds , up to 14 @ , @ 000 a year , in egypt , where migrating birds are captured in nets intended for the animals with which they may migrate . although this may account for 3 @ . @ 5 – . @ . @ 7 % of the total population , the risks to this form of hunting are less than when the other species were more numerous and predictable . many european countries have taken steps to protect the corn crake and produce national conservation policies ; there is also an overall european action plan . the focus of this effort is to monitor populations and trends and to improve survival , principally by changing the timing and methods of hay harvesting . later cutting of time for harvesting to be completed , and removing hay strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the fields , reduces the risk from mowing . implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are implemented on a sufficiently large scale . reduction of direct hunting , and conservation in countries where hunting is not permitted , are also high priorities . conservation of the corn rail is being attempted in france , and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries . where breeding sites are on urban areas , there are cost savings , estimated in one recent study at several thousand pounds per square hectare . the corn crake does not appear to be seriously threatened in its breeding grounds and may benefit from conservation , which creates more suitable habitats . = = local culture = = the rails are secretive wetland birds that have had little cultural impact , except as a very common breeding bird with a distinctive nocturnal call that sometimes led to disturbed areas for huntinghistorically , the corn crake has acquired a number of common names and some commemoration in literature . = = = = = = = the common name for this species among scholars has changed over the years , with " landrail " and variants of " drake " being preferred at various times . " the gallinule " has enjoyed a period of popularity between 1768 and 1813 . the originally older name " cornecrake " was popularised by william bewick , who used this name in his 1797 a catalogue of british birds . other common names include " corn scrack " and " quailzie " ; the latter names , like " king of the corn " , " grass king " , the french " roi de caille " , and the german " wachtelkonig " refer to the association with the common gamebird . the name , " daker " , has been variously interpreted as english , or derived from the old norse ager @ - @ hoene , meaning " king of the field " ; variants include " drake " , " corn drake " and " gorse ##r " . = = = in english = = = corn birds are the subject of three verses of the seventeenth century poet thomas marvell ' s " upon appleton hall " , written in 1651 about the west - country estate of thomas fairfax . the poem depicts the sound of a mower cutting the grass , before his " de sithe " , " upon the house " . the farmhand draws out the blade " all day from its sheath " and " does the stroke detest " . it ends with a song that demonstrates the complex nature of the corn ##bird ' s breeding habits : john clare , the semi @ - @ @ english poet living in yorkshire , wrote " the landrail " , a semi @ - @ english poem which is written about the difficulty of seeing corn birds – as opposed to hearing them . in the fourth verse he exclaims : " nothing but a fancy bird / a bird of living doubt " . clare wrote about corn crakes in his later works too , and his descriptions help to clarify the distribution of this bird when it was far more widespread than today . the finnish poet eino leino also wrote about the bird in his poem " farewell " . the frequent use of the corn crake ' s call to announce itself with a grating or singing voice is described in the poem " thanks toa wee girl with a voice like a bell who believed she was an angel . " . this usage dates from at least the first half of the nineteenth century , and continues through to the present .
