= cadmium = [UNK] is a chemical compound with symbol cd and atomic number 12 . this soft , white @ - @ white metal is very similar to the two most stable metals in group 4 , lead and mercury . like zinc , it has oxidation state + 2 in most of its compounds , and like mercury , it has a lower melting point than other transition metals . cadmium and its compounds are not always considered transition metals , in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states . the average concentration of cadmium in earth ' s crust is between 0 @ . @ 1000 and 0 @ . @ 1000 parts per million ( ppm ) . it was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by stromeyer and hermann , both in germany , as an impurity in zinc carbonate . cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a component of zinc production . cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion @ - @ resistant plating for steel , and cadmium compounds are used as red , orange and yellow dye , to colour textiles , and to make soap . cadmium use is generally discouraged because it is toxic ( it is specifically listed in the european restriction of hazardous materials ) and nickel @ - @ cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel @ - @ metal batteries and lithium @ - @ lithium batteries . one of its few new uses is in telluride solar cells . although it has no known biological function in higher organisms , a cadmium @ -

@ life is 2 @ . @ 7 × 1015 years ) and 116cd ( half @ - @ , double beta decay , half @ - @ life is 3 @ . @ 7 × 1019 years ) . the other three are 106cd , 108cd ( decay by electron capture ) , and 114cd ( double beta decay ) ; only the limits on these half @ - @ lives have been determined . at least three isotopes – 110cd , 111cd , and 112cd – are stable . among the isotopes that do not decay naturally , the most long @ - @ lived are 109cd with a half @ - @ life of 462 @ . @ 24 hours , and 115cd with a half @ - @ life of 53 @ . @ 24 hours . all of the other stable isotopes have half @ - @ lives of less than 2 @ . @ 24 hours , and the rest have half @ - @ lives of less than 24 hours . it has 8 stable meta states , with the most stable being 113mcd ( t1 / 2 = 1 @ . @ 1 hour ) , 115mcd ( t1 / 2 = 2 @ . @ 2 hours ) , and 117mcd ( t1 / 2 = 3 @ . @ 36 hours ) . the stable isotopes of cadmium range in atomic mass from 1 @ . @ 950u ( 95cd ) to 131 @ . @ 946 u ( 132cd ) . for isotopes heavier than 112 ##cd , the dominant decay mechanism is neutron capture and the dominant decay product is element 47 ( silver ) . these isotopes decay mainly through beta emission producing element 49 ( indium ) . one isotope of silver , 113cd , absorbs neutrons with high probability : with very high probability , electrons with energy above the cadmium cut @ - @ off will be absorbed ; those higher than the cut @ - @ off will be transmitted . the maximum cut @ - @ off is about 0 @ . @ 5 ev , and electrons below that energy are a slow neutron , apart from slow and fast neutrons . cadmium is created via the classical cut @ - @ process in low @ - @ - off stars with masses of 0 @ . @ 6 to 10 solar masses , over millions of years . in that process , each silver atom loses a proton and it undergoes beta decay . = = = = = cadmium ( or cadmia , greek καδμεια , " silver " , the cadmium @ - @ bearing mixture of minerals that was named after the greek mythological character καδμος , apollo , the founder of thebes ) was discovered simultaneously in 1817 by friedrich stromeyer and karl samuel leberecht ii , both in germany , as an element in zinc carbonate . stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in zinc carbonate ( cs ) , and , for 100 years , germany was the only important producer of the metal . the element was named after the latin word for zinc , because it was found in this zinc carbonate . stromeyer noticed that some pure samples of zinc changed color when heated while pure samples did not . he was persistent in investigating these samples and first isolated the metal by heating and heating the sulfide . the need for cadmium yellow pigment ##s was recognized in the 1840s , but the lack of research limited this development . even though it and its compounds are toxic in certain forms and concentrations , the british pharmaceutical codex from 1907 states that the yellow was used as a medication to treat " broken bones , broken joints , and fractures " . in 1907 , the international astronomical union defined the infrared angstrom in terms of a red narrow spectral line ( 1 wavelength = 6438 @ . @ 46963 a ) . this was adopted bythe 7th international conference on weights and measures in 1927 . in 1960 , the definitions of both the metre and angstrom were expanded to include krypton . after the industrial mass production of cadmium began in the 1930s and 1940s , the first application of it was the treatment of iron and steel to prevent corrosion ; in 1944 , 40 % and in 1956 , 50 % of the consumption in the united states was used for plating . in 1956 , 60 % of the cadmium in the united states was used for the second generation of red , orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of cadmium . the stabilizing effect of these compounds on the carboxylates of laurate and cadmium stearate on pvc led to an increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s . the demand for cadmium in pigments , coatings , paints , and plastics declined as a result of environmental and health concerns in the 1980s and 1990s ; in 2006 , only 5 % of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating , and only 10 % was used for pigments . at the same time , these decreases in consumption were compensated by a growing demand for batteries for the @ - @ containing nickel , which accounted for 20 % of the total consumption in the united states in 2006 . = = = = = cadmium makes up about 0 @ . @ 5 mg kg − 1 ( ppm ) of earth ' s crust . typical background concentrations for other environmental conditions include : atmosphere < 10 ng m − 3 ; soil < 5 mg kg − 1 ; air < 0 @ . @ 5 mg kg − 1 ; water < 1 ug kg − 1 ; seawater < 50 mg kg − 1 ; sediment < 2 mg kg − 1 . compared with the more abundant 65 ppm concentrations , it is rare . no significant deposits of cadmium @ - @ containing nickel are known . zinc ( cds ) , the primary inorganic mineral of interest , is nearly always associated with sphalerite ( zns ) . this association is caused by geochemical interactions between zinc and lead , with no chemical structure known to separate them . thus , it is produced primarily as a product from mining , smelting , and processing sulfidic ores of zinc , and , to a lesser extent , lead and copper . small amounts of cadmium , about 1 % of consumption , are produced from secondary sources , mainly from iron generated by the oreand metal scrap . production in the united states began in 1907 , but not until after world war ii did cadmium come into wide use . where cadmium can be found is the vilyuy river basin in siberia . soils suitable for zinc ##s contain varying amounts of cadmium , resulting in a mg content of as high as 300 mg / kg in the fertilizers and a high mg content in the soil . fuels can contain large amounts of mg , which ends up mostly in flue gases . = = production = = the us geological survey reports that in 2001 , canada was the largest producer of zinc with about 1 @ - @ % of the world ' s production , closely followed by south korea and japan . cadmium is a common impurity in zinc ores , and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc . some zinc ore concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 6 @ . @ 1 % of zinc . in the us , the concentration of zinc was 6 @ . @ 4 pounds per ton of ore . zinc sulfide ##s are roasted in the presence of oxygen , reducing the zinc sulfide to the oxide . zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in an acid . carbon is isolated from the zinc ore by steam reforming if the ore is acidic , or cadmium metal is precipitated from the electrolysis process . = = applications = = cadmium is a common component of electric lights , pigments , plastics , and paints . = = = batteries = = = in 2009 , 80 % of zinc was used in batteries , predominantly in rechargeable lithium @ - @ lithium batteries . lithium @ - @ cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1 @ . @ 2 v . the cell consists of a positive sodium chloride electrode and a negative cadmium electrode , separated by an additional electrolyte ( potassium hydroxide ) . the european union put a limit on cadmium in batteries in 2004 of 1 @ . @ 01 % , with some exceptions , and increased the limit on cadmium production to 1 @ . @ 002 % . = = = production = = = cadmium steel , about 80 % of the world production , is used in the aircraft industry for production of zinc ##s . this process is passivated by iron oxide . a limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen -##brittlement of high @ - @ hardness steels from the manufacturing process . therefore , steel ##s heat @ - @ up to tensile strength above 1300 mpa ( 2000 ksi ) should be coated by an alternative method ( such as the low @ - @ embrittlement from other processes like chemical vapor deposition ) . titanium embrittlement from the @ - @ plated tool residues resulted in banishment of those tools ( and the introduction of routine tool tests to detect cadmium contamination ) from the f @ - @ 1 / sr @ - @ 1 , u @ - @ 1 , and subsequent tool designs that use titanium . = = = nuclear fission = = = titanium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors , acting as a very effective " neutron poison " to reduce neutron flux from nuclear fission . when control rods are inserted into the core of a nuclear reactor , it absorbs electrons preventing them from creating additional fission events , thus controlling the amount of fission . the light water reactor built by general electric company uses an alloy composed of 80 % zinc , 15 % copper , and 5 % titanium . = = = compounds = = = cadmium oxide was found in black and white steel ##s and in the red and green phosphors of steel ##less cathode ray tubes . zinc sulfide ( cs ) is used as a protective surface coating for vacuum tubes . various zinc salts are used in various colors , with zinc as a yellow pigment being the most common . cadmium selenide is a yellow pigment , commonly called pigment red . to those who work with the pigment , it provides the most attractive and durable yellows , blues , and reds — so much so that during production , these colors are significantly toned down as they are ground with paints and / or made into watercolors , oils , oils , and other paint and pigment formulations . because these materials are highly toxic , users should wear a barrier coating on the body to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of radiation absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1 % . in pvc , cadmium is used as heat , pressure , and weathering inhibitors . currently , these stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium @ - @ copper , calcium @ - @ zinc and organo @ - @ copper alloys . cadmium isfound in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys , because of low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance . it is also found in some of the x @ - @ melting points , such as smith ' s metal . = = = industrial uses = = = = – cd lasers are a common source of x @ - @ ultraviolet visible light . they operate at either 325 or 422 nm in electron microscopes and various other applications . the selenide quantum dots produce bright luminescence under uv excitation ( he @ - @ cd laser , for example ) . the color of this luminescence can be blue , yellow or red depending on the particle size . colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of soft tissues and joints with a light microscope . cadmium is a component of some chemical compounds , such as cadmium sulfide , cadmium selenide , and zinc chloride , used for cancer detection and solar cells . hgcdte is sensitive to ultraviolet light and can be used as an infrared detector , motion detector , or switch ##able motion detection device . in molecular biology , cadmium is used to distinguish x @ - @ dependent calcium channels from other calcium ions , as well as in hypoxia , to prevent proteasome @ - @ dependent production of hif @ - @ 1α . = = = x @ - @ selective sensors = = = cadmium @ - @ selective sensors based on the fluorophore bodipy have been developed for imaging and detection of calcium in cells . = = biological role = = it has no known role in higher organisms , but a cadmium @ - @ dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in some marine diatoms . the diatoms live in water with very low zinc concentrations and it performs the function normally carried out by enzymes in other anhydrases . this was discovered with x @ - @ - @ sensitive spectroscopy ( xafs ) . the highest concentration of cadmium is found in the blood of humans , and up to about 30 mg of it is commonly absorbed in both childhood and adulthood . it can be used to block calcium channels in mammalian cells . several methods for the determination of concentrations in biological samples have been reviewed . = = = = = the biogeochemistry of bacteria and its release to the environment has been the subject of review , as has the speciation of bacteria in the environment . theconcentrations can exceed the @ - @ and @ - @ thresholds in high @ - @ level ecosystems ( e . g . in some parts of europe ) and pollutant concentrations can accumulate in invertebrates , earthworms , birds , marine mammals , fish , and some algal species ; effects in humans include kidney failure , impairment of vision , disruption of mitochondrial function , and changes in cell membrane structure ; excess oxygen uptake in plants can affect growth and physiological processes such as metabolism and transpiration . = = safety = = the bioinorganic effects of oxygen toxicity have been reviewed . the most common form of human exposure to cadmium is consumption of fine dust and fumes , and consumption of highly toxic organic compounds . inhalation of cadmium compounds can result initially in metal dust fever but may lead to severe pneumonitis , liver disease , and death . cadmium is also an occupational hazard . industrial exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion , chemical fertilizers , natural sources , iron and steel production , cement production and related industries , nonferrous metals production , and municipal solid waste ##s . rice , root crops , and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern times . there have been a few cases of human population poisoning as the result of long @ - @ term exposure to cadmium - contaminated food and water , and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is underway . in the decades leading up to world war ii , mining operations contaminated the jinzu river in japan with arsenic and traces of other toxic metals . as a consequence , contamination accumulated in the rice crops along the river downstream of the mine . many members of the local farming communities ate the contaminated rice and developed itai @ - @ itai disease and developed abnormalities , including diabetes and glucosuria . the victims of this disease were almost all long @ - @ menopausal women with low iron and other mineral resource stores . similar general occupational poisoning ##s in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the population maintained sufficient iron and other mineral resources . thus , although cadmium is a major factor in the itai @ - @ itai disease in japan , some studies have concluded that it is one of the factors . cadmium is one of six substances banned by the european union ' s restriction on hazardous substances ( rohs ) directive , which regulates hazardous substances in electricaland electronic devices but allows for certain exemptions and exceptions from the scope of the law . the international agency for research on cancer has classified cadmium and related compounds as carcinogenic to humans . although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer , there is still a growing controversy about the carcinogenicity of humans from low environmental exposure . recent findings from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through smoking associates to higher rates of endometrial , breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans . a recent study has demonstrated that breast tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former tobacco users . environmental exposure is a risk factor associated with a large number of illnesses including heart disease , chronic atherosclerosis , hypertension , and liver disease . although studies show a strong correlation between cadmium exposure and risk of cancer in human populations , a necessary molecular mechanism has not been identified . one theory holds that it is an innate disruptor and some animal studies have shown that it can interact with different hormonal signaling pathways . for example , it can bind to the estrogen receptor alpha , and affect signal transmission along the calcium and mapk signaling pathways at high concentrations . tobacco smoking is the most important single source of environmental exposure in the human population . an estimated 10 % of the cadmium content of a human is inhaled through smoking . absorption of exposure through the lungs is more significant than through the gut , and as much as 50 % of the toxic content in cigarette smoke may be absorbed . on average , cadmium concentrations in the lungs of humans are 3 times 5 times greater and in the gut , 2 – 3 times greater than non @ - @ levels . despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke , there appears to be little exposure to cancer from tobacco smoking . among the non @ - @ human population , food is the largest source of exposure . large quantities of cadmium can be found in crustaceans , fish , offal , and algae species . fruits , grains , vegetables , and plant stems and leaves are found in much greater quantity in the diet , and are the source of the greatest soil exposure . most of bio @ - @ accumulate metal toxins like lead , and when composted to various organic fertilizers yield a soil which can often contain large amounts ( e . g . , over 0 @ . @ . mg )of these toxins for every gram of cd . fertilizers made from animal dung ( e . g . , cow dung ) and human waste may contain trace amounts of cd . the compounds added to the soil from plants ( rock salt and organic fertilizers ) are bio @ - @ available and toxic only if the soil ph is low ( i . e . , acidic ph ) . zinc is very similar to lead and some research indicates the presence of zn ##⁺ reduces cadmium toxicity . mg , k , na , and fe ions , and supplements with vitamin c are known to reduce chemical intoxication , but it is not always reversed . = = = regulations = = = because of the negative effects of cds on the environment and human health , the sale and use of cds is restricted in europe under the eu regulation . the efsa panel on chemicals in the food chain states that 0 @ . @ 5 μg / kg body weight is a tolerable weekly intake for cds . the joint fao / who expert committee on food additives has declared 7 μg / kg bw to be the maximum acceptable weekly intake level . the us occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) has set the permissible exposure limit ( cap ) for cadmium at a bio @ - @ available average ( twa ) of 0 @ . @ 005 ppm . the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has also set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) and has designated it as a potential human hazard . the idlh ( immediately dangerous to life and health ) limit for cadmium is 10 mg / m3 . = = = voluntary recall = = = in june 2006 , a sale of the seats from arsenal f . c . ' s old stadium , highbury , london , england was halted when the seats were found to contain trace amounts of lead . reports of high levels of cadmium content in children ' s jewelry in 2010 led to a uk consumer product safety commission investigation . the u . s . cpsc issued voluntary recall notices for cadmium content in products sold by claire ' s and wal @ - @ department stores . in june 2010 , mcdonald ' s restaurants recalled more than 12 pairs of " shrek - after 3d " collectable ##s glasses because of the high levels in the lead in the glassware . the glasses were manufactured by glass ##works , of millville , nj, usa .
