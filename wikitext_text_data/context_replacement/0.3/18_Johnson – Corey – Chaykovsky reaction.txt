= = – corey – chaykovsky reaction = the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction ( also referred to as the corey – chaykovsky reaction or ccr ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides , aziridines , and cyclopropanes . it was discovered in 1961 by a . william johnson and developed further by a . m . corey and alexander chaykovsky . the reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a carbon , aldehyde , imine , or enone to form the desired 3 @ - @ like ring . the reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans ##version of the product instead of the initial stereochemistry . the synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic step to the traditional epoxidation reactions of synthesis . the reaction is most commonly used for epoxidation via electron transfer , and to this extent has been used in several other organic syntheses ( see synthesis of epoxides below ) . also detailed below are the structure , mechanism , scope , and enantioselective nature of the reaction . several reviews have been published . = = mechanism = = the original synthesis by johnson described the reaction of 9 @ - @ dimethylsulfonium fluorenylide with substituted benzaldehyde ##s . the original wittig @ - @ like reaction failed and a benzalfluorene derivative was obtained instead , noting that " reaction of the sulfur ylid and benzaldehydes did not afford benzalfluorenes that formed the sulfur and nitrogen ylids . " the subsequent synthesis of ( dimethyloxosulfaniumyl ) methanide , ( ch3 ) 2soch2 and ( dimethylsulfaniumyl ) methanide , ( ch3 ) 2sch2 ( known as corey – chaykovsky synthesis ) by corey and chaykovsky as the 3 @ - @ like reactions established the reaction as a part of the synthesis canon . = = mechanism = = the reaction mechanism for the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or imine ring . the negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium ion is a strong leaving group it is removed from the ring . in the original wittig reaction , the addition of thethe stronger phosphorus @ - @ - @ bond prevents oxirane formation and therefore , olefination takes place through a 4 @ - @ - cyclic intermediate . the trans diastereoselectivity also results from the stability of the initial addition , with equilibration to the stronger syn product over the syn betaine . further addition of the ylide results in a betaine with higher stability ; density functional ##ization studies have shown that the rate @ - @ limiting step is insertion of the central bond into the conformer allowing for backside attack of the sulfonium . the degree of reversibility of the initial step ( and therefore the diastereoselectivity ) depends on four factors , with greater stability leading to higher selectivity : stability of the substrate with higher stability leading to greater reversibility by choosing the starting material over the substrate . stability of the ylide with greater stability similarly leading to greater stability . steric hindrance of the betaine with greater stability leading to greater reversibility by disfavoring addition of the substrate and slowing the rate @ - @ limiting step of the central bond . replacement of oxygen in the betaine by counterions such as oxygen with greater solvation allowing more facile rotation of the cyclic intermediate , increasing the amount of reversibility . = = scope = = the application of the corey – corey – chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is extensive . the reaction has come to dominate synthesis of many types of organic ylides with electrophiles , beyond the original synthesis . it has seen use in a number of 4 @ - @ - @ syntheses , as detailed below , and is widely recognized as a useful transformative step in the organic synthesis . = = = variety of ylides = = = many types of ylides can be prepared with various functional groups depending on the anionic sulfur atom and on the substrate . the reaction conditions can influence the method of preparation for the reagents ( typically from the sulfonium halide , e . g . trimethylsulfonium chloride ) and the reaction rate in several ways . the general scheme for the reagent is shown on the right . use of the sulfoxonium allows more rapid rotation of the reagent using weaker oxygen as compared to sulfonium ylides . ( the difference is that a sulfoxonium contains a hydrogen and oxygen whereas the sulfonium does not. ) the latter are faster due to their greater stability . in addition , the dialkylsulfoxide by @ - @ products of sulfoxonium reagents are generally comparable to the significantly more toxic , volatile , and odorous dialkylsulfide by @ - @ products from sulfonium reagents . the vast majority of compounds are monosubstituted at the ylide carbon ( where r1 or r2 = hydrogen ) . disubstituted reagents are much rarer and have been described : if the ylide carbon is substituted with an electron @ - @ withdrawing group ( ewg ) , the product is referred to as a stabilized ylide . these , compared to sulfoxonium compounds , react much faster and are typically easier to prepare . these are limited in their use because the reaction can be very sluggish : most of these are widespread , with far fewer stable esters and almost no reactions involving other ewg ' s . for these , the related darzens reaction is typically more useful . if the ylide carbon is substituted with an aryl or allyl group , the reagent is referred to as a electron @ - @ stabilized ylide . these have been developed extensively , second only to the classical aromatic substitution ( r1 = r2 = h ) . the substitution pattern on aryl reagents can heavily influence the rate of the reaction as per the examples below . if the ylide carbon is substituted with an amino group the reagent is referred to as an unstabilized ylide . the size of the alkyl groups are the major factors in dealing with these reagents . the electron @ - @ groups on the carbon , though not always , have been used to synthesize compounds that can form enantioselective products of the reaction ( see examples below ) . the size of the groups can also influence diastereoselectivity in alicyclic reactions . = = = number of epoxides = = = reactions of stabilized ylides with acids and aldehydes to form epoxides are by far the most common variants of the [ – corey – chaykovsky reaction . examples of complex substrates and ' complex ' ylides have been reported , as shown below . the reaction has been used in a number of notable organic syntheses including the danishefsky taxol total synthesis , which produces the che##motherapeutic drug taxol , and the kuehne reaction ##s synthesis which produces the drug ace . = = = synthesis of aziridines = = = the synthesis of aziridines from imines is another important application of the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction and is an alternative to amine synthesis from oxaziridines . although less commonly used , the latter have a similar ring structure and protecting group structure to the carbonyl group . the reactions shown below are representative ; in the latter , the aziridine forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding alcohol . = = = synthesis of antibiotics = = = for addition of sulfur ylides to enones , the 1 @ , @ 4 @ - @ reaction is typically observed with sulfoxonium rather than with sulfonium salts . many ring @ - @ withdrawing groups have been shown compatible with the reaction including ketones , acids , and derivatives ( the example below involves a weinreb amide ) . with the conjugated product 1 @ , @ 4 @ - @ addition shown to predominate over 1 @ , @ 4 @ - @ addition . = = = other reactions = = = in addition to the reactions originally reported by johnson , corey , and chaykovsky , sulfur ylides have been used for a number of related homologation reactions that are to be grouped under the same name . with epoxides and aziridines the reaction proceeds via a 2 @ - @ reaction to yield the products oxetane and azetidine . the short reaction times required for these reactions prevent them from serving as useful addition reactions when using epoxides and aziridines . several cycloadditions wherein the ylide serves as a " nucleophilic carbenoid intermediate " have been reported . living systems using trialkylboranes as the catalyst and ( dimethyloxosulfaniumyl ) methanide as the solvent have been reported for the synthesis of more complex compounds . = = enantioselective variations = = the development of an enantioselective ( i . e . yielding an enantiomeric product , which is labelled as " ee " ) variation of the [UNK] – corey – chaykovsky reaction remains an active area of academic research . the use of chiral sulfides as athis method has been more successful than the other catalytic variants , but the substrate scope is still limited in both cases . the catalytic variants have been developed almost exclusively for enantioselective purposes ; typical organosulfide reagents are not as reactive and the racemic synthesis can be carried out with equimolar amounts of ylide without reducing yields significantly . chiral variants , on the other hand , are more difficult to produce , spurring the development of other enantioselective methods . = = = catalytic method = = = the most common reagents used in a catalytic fashion are shown below . the first is a methyl oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β @ - @ derived from dichloroisoproterenol ( dci ) but is limited by the presence of only one enantiomer of the compound . the formation of the axial diastereomer is facilitated via the β @ , @ , @ - @ anomeric model which limits the nucleophilicity of the hydrogen lone pair . the size of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is restricted to one side of the ylide via steric interactions with the methyl substituents . the other major reagent is a camphor @ - @ catalytic reagent developed by varinder aggarwal of the university of bristol . both variants are easily prepared , although the yields are lower than for the oxathiane reagent . the ylide conformation is determined by interaction with the bridgehead , and movement of the aldehyde is blocked by the camphor group . the second employs a phosphazene base to facilitate formation of the ylide . = = = catalytic reagents = = = catalytic variants have been less successful , with most reactions suffering from poor yield , poor enantioselectivity , or both . there are several issues with catalyst scope , most being problems with electron transfer and other mechanisms . the first arises from the need for a nucleophilic sulfide that directly generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide . since the mechanisms underlying these problems are at odds , tuning of the catalyst scope has been difficult . shown below are some of thethe successful catalysts improved with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their application in production of ( + ) - stilbene oxide . aggarwal has developed an alternative method employing the hydrogen sulfide as catalyst and a novel alkylation using a rhodium carbenoid formed in situ . the method however has limited application scope , not for the electrophiles or basic substituents due to the nature of the carbenoid .
