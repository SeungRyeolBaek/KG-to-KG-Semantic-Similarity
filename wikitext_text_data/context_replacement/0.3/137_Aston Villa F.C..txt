@ flight in 1960 as second division champions . the following season aston villa became the first team to win the football league cup . mercer ' s forced retirement from the game in 1964 signalled a period of deep decline . the most successful club in history was struggling to keep up with expectations in the modern era , with villa being relegated for the third time , under manager graham taylor in 1967 . the following season the fans called for the board to resign after villa finished last in the second division . with mounting debts and villa finishing at the bottom of division two , the board sacked tommy cummings ( the man brought in to replace taylor ) , and within weeks the entire board resigned under intense pressure from fans . after much speculation , control of the club was bought by london businessman john kenny , who also brought in doug ellis as chairman . however , new management could not prevent villa being relegated to the third division for the first time at the end of the 1969 – close season. however , villa quickly began to recover under the management of former villa captain vic crowe . in the 1971 – 72 season they returned to the second division as champions with a record 100 points . in 1974 , ron saunders was appointed manager . his period of top @ - @ - no @ - @ management proved successful , with the club winning the league title the following season and , at the end of the 1974 – 75 , saunders had taken them back into the first division and into europe . villa were again among the leaders as saunders continued to build a strong team . this culminated in a seventh top @ - @ season league title in 1980 – 81 . to the surprise of players and fans , saunders quit halfway through the 1981 – - season , after falling out with the board , with villa in the semi final of the league cup . he was replaced by his former @ - @ spoken assistant manager tony barton who led the club to a 1 – 0 victory over bayern munich in the european cup final in rotterdam courtesy of a john withe goal . the following season villa were crowned european super cup winners , beating barcelona in the final . this marked a pinnacle though and villa ' s fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s , culminating in relegation in 1987 . this was followed by promotion the following year under graham taylor and a runners @ - @ up position in the first division in the 1989 – 90 season . villa were one of the founding members of the premier league in 1992 , and finished runners @ - @ up to manchester united in the inaugural season . for the remainder of the nineties , villa went through three different managers and their league positions remained inconsistent , although they did win two league cups and also achieved uefa cup qualification . villa reached the fa cup final in 2000 but lost by – points to chelsea in the last game to be played at the old wembley stadium . again villa ' s league position continued to fluctuate under three different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when martin o ' leary died in acrimony . after 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder ( owning 51 % ) , doug ellis , decided to sell his stake in aston villa due to his @ - @ health . after much speculation it was announced the stake was to be bought by american businessman randy jackson , owner of nfl franchise the cleveland browns . the arrival of a new owner david lerner and of chairman martin o ' neill marked the start of a new period of optimism at villa park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge , a new kitsponsor and team changes in the summer of 2007 . the first cup final of the new stadium came in 2010 when villa were beaten 2 – 1 in the league cup final . villa made their first visit to the stadium that season losing 2 – 0 to chelsea in the fa cup semifinal . just five days before the final day of the 2010 – championship season , o ' neill resigned as manager with immediate effect . the club appointed gerard houllier as a manager in november 2010 , but he stepped down on 31 january 2011 due to ill @ - @ health . houllier was replaced by birmingham city manager alex mcleish , despite strong protests from fans against his appointment ; this was the first time that a manager had moved directly from birmingham to villa . mcleish ' s contract was terminated at the end of the 2011 – 12 season after villa finished in 16th place , finishing just above the relegation zone . on 2 july 2012 , aston villa announced the appointment of former norwich city manager paul lambert as the replacement for mcleish . on 5 july 2012 , the club announced a financial loss of £ ##4 @ . @ 9 million . lerner put the club up for sale on 31 august 2014 , with an estimated value of £ 200 million . with lambert still on board , in the 2014 – championship season aston villa scored just 12 goals in 25 league games , the lowest in premier league history , and he was sacked on 11 february 2015 . tim howard replaced him , and saved aston villa from relegation while also taking them to the 2015 fa cup final , but he was sacked in the 2015 – championship season , as was his successor remi garde . eric gregory took temporary charge of the club , but was not able to save villa from being relegated for the first time since 1987 . on 2 june 2016 , roberto di matteo was announced as the club ' s new manager . = = kit and badge = = the club colours are a white shirt with sky blue trim , white shorts with red and blue trim , and sky blue socks with claret and blue trim . they were the original wearers of the claret and blue . villa ' s colours at the time generally were plain blue ( white , red or a shade of blue ) , with either white or black trim . for a few years after that ( 1877 – 1880 ) the team wore slightly different kits from plain blue , red and blue , red and blue to all green . in 1880 , the jerseys with a red cross emblem on the chest were designed by william mcgregor . this was the first choice offor many years . on monday , 8 may 1886 , an entry in the club ' s official record book states : ( i ) proposed and seconded that the colours be chocolate and sky blue , and that we supply two dozen . ( ii ) proposed and recommended that robert mcgregor be requested to supply them at the lowest cost . the chosen colour later became claret . nobody is quite sure why chocolate and blue became the club ' s kit colours . several other english football teams adopted their colours ; clubs that adopted chocolate and blue include west ham united and burnley . a new badge was introduced in may 2007 , for the 2007 – 08 season and onwards . the new badge features a star to commemorate the european cup final of 1982 , and features a light blue background with villa ' s ' lion rampant ' . the club name " villa " appears on the badge , and the name aston villa has been shortened to avfc , fc having been dropped from the new badge . the lion is now white as opposed to the lion of the crest . david webb contacted fifa to help with the design of the new badge . on 28 may 2016 , the club announced that they will be introducing a new badge from the 2016 – [UNK] season after consulting supporter groups for suggestions . the lion in the new badge will have initials added to it and the word " [UNK] " will be used to increase the size of the lion and the initials in the badge . = = = = sponsorship = = = aston villa discontinued their shirt sponsorship for the 2008 – 09 and 2009 – 10 seasons ;
