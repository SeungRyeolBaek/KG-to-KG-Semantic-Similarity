the size dropped to six motor rifle and two tank divisions in 1970 . from 1970 to 1976 , two more motor rifle divisions were formed , but one was deactivated in 1977 , and the six motor rifle and three tank division figure remained that level for the rest of the cold war . from 1947 to 1960 the country seems to have been divided into three separate military regions : cluj , bacau , and bucharest in the west , east , and south , respectively . in 1960 the land forces in each military region would become an army , with their headquarters at cluj @ - @ napoca , iasi , and bucharest . armies seem to have become military regions in 1960 , and four armies seem to have succeeded four in 1980 . what is known is that at 01 @ . @ 07 @ . @ 1947 fourth army became 3rd military region , based in cluj . the 3rd military region became the 3rd army on 30 april 1960 , and the 4th army on 1 may 1980 . during the 1980s , the land forces numbered 140 @ , @ 000 personnel , of whom 1 million were employed . in 1989 four armies appeared to exist : the firstarmy at bucharest , second army at buzau , third army at craiova , and fourth army at napoca . in 1989 the land forces consisted of nine infantry ( infantry ) divisions ( 1st , bucharest , 2nd , craiova , 3rd , constanta , 10th , iasi , 11th , oradea , 14th , timisoara , 67th , and 81st , tirgu mures ) two tank divisions ( the 57th tank division at bucharest and the 6th tank division at tirgu mures ) , two mechanized infantry brigades , and three airborne brigades . according to the 165 @ - @ year ' history of the romanian army , ' in 1989 the 1st army consisted of the 9th mech div , 57th tank div . , and the 2nd airborne brigade ;
