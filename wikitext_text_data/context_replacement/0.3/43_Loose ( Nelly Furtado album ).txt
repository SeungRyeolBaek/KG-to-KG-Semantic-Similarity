= = ( nelly furtado album ) = 1 is the third studio album by canadian singer and songwriter nelly furtado , released on 6 june 2006 by geffen records and the mosley music group . following the release of furtado ' s second album , folklore ( 2003 ) by dreamworks records , it was announced that universal music group would acquire dreamworks records , the label being folded into the interscope geffen a & m umbrella where furtado would record any new material . timbaland and his protege danja produced the bulk of the album , which incorporates elements of dance , r & b and hip hop . the album explores the theme of female empowerment and has been described as introspective and even sad in nature . the album received controversy because of the sexual themes furtado explored for the album , and some critics felt it was a ploy to sell the records . further controversy arose over allegations of cheating on timbaland ' s part in the song " do it " ( which samples the lyrics from finnish musician janne suni ' s song " acidjazzed out " without her permission ) when lyrics were leaked onto youtube . the record was seen generally as critically and commercially successful . it reached high positions on charts across the world , and according to an august 2009 press release , it had sold more than one million copies worldwide , making it the best @ - @ selling album of 2006 – 07 and the best @ - @ second best @ - @ selling album of the 2000s . the album was heavily promoted , released in several editions and supported by the = = tour , which was the subject of the concert dvd folklore : the tour . " loose " debuted at number one , making it furtado ' s first album to top the chart , with four singles were released from the album , including the uk number @ - @ one singles " try " and " do it again " , which received grammy award nominations for best pop collaboration with vocals and best female pop vocal performance , respectively . other notable singles include the uk number @ - @ one single " maneater " and the european number one single " all good things ( come to an end ) " . = = = = = furtado ' s second album , loose , was released in november 2003 . the lead single is " loose ( say what you want ) " and the second single is the ballad " try " . the album was not as successful as her debut , partly due to the album ' s commercial " poppy" sound . " " ( do what you want ) " was later remixed , featuring spanish rapper juanes , who had previously collaborated with furtado on his single " fotografia " ( " photography " ) . the two would collaborate again on " te busque " ( " i feel for you " ) , the single from furtado ' s album loose . the album was underpromoted from her label dreamworks records ; it was announced on 22 november 2003 that universal music group signed an agreement to purchase dreamworks records from dreamworks skg for " about $ 100 million " . the deal came at a time when the music industry was " going through dramatic changes " as it struggled to " counter record sales and the rise of digital digital music distribution " . dreamworks records was absorbed into the interscope geffen a & m records label in january 2004 . furtado ' s recording contract was also absorbed into geffen records . = = = = = furtado began working on songs by herself with producer jellystone what she referred to as a " hip @ - @ hop session " , in which they would " write songs , mix them , and try different techniques and beats . " the first producers she worked with were track & field — who co @ - @ produced her first two albums , whoa , nelly ! ( 2000 ) and loose ( 2003 ) — and by early 2005 , she had worked with band members and k ' naan . she worked with nellee hooper in miami on some @ - @ produced tracks and with lester mendez in los angeles on some tracks . one of the tracks mendez helped to create was " te busque " , which was co @ - @ produced , and features juanes , who collaborated with furtado on his 2002 single " fotografia " . during her time in los angeles , she worked with rick nowels , who co @ - @ wrote and produced " in god ' s hands " and " somebody to love " . in miami , florida , furtado worked with pharrell ( who introduced her to reggaeton and later gave her a " straight @ - @ rap " in his 2005 single " can i have it like that " ) and scott storch ( with whom she recorded a " straight @ - @ - rap track " ) before entering the studio with timbaland . he and his protege at the time , danja , co @ - @ produced two of the tracks , with another instrumental track by danja . forinstead of the tracks from the album , timbaland would work on tracks already present on the album that were not @ - @ , or were " scrapped " ; the tracks were completely reworked . furtado recorded around 20 tracks for loose , of which she would include based on the sonics of the album — she called timbaland " a fucking extraterrestrial " , came up with a number of songs that fit , and said that the one she had devised was completely unsatisfactory . she included an early collaboration with justin timberlake , " crowd control " , which she described as " kind of sexy " and " a cute , fun , fun , fun song " . other tracks considered for inclusion on the album included " bad boy " , " friend of mine " , " go " , " hands in the air " , " pretty boy " , " vice " and " weak " . furtado revealed in her interview on her official website that she recorded a remix of " maneater " with rapper lil wayne ; it was only released as part of her compilation album , timbaland ' s remix & soundtrack collection , she also used the beat of the song during her live performance of " maneater " . a version of " all good things ( come to an end ) " featuring vocals by coldplay lead singer chris martin , who co @ - @ wrote the song , was only released after a lawsuit from loose ' s label , emi . the song was included on the album , but only furtado ' s vocals were featured . furtado said that " loose was 90 % concerned with the beat first , and then i ’ d write my melodies and songs to the beat . " = = = @ - @ production = = the " post @ - @ the @ - @ cuff " conclusion to work is one of the reasons the album was titled loose . it was named partly for the creative decisions she made when creating the album . the album was originally named loose because it is " the opposite of loose " and came down to furtado and timbaland ; she called him her " distant " cousin because he is always pushing boundaries and " carving out his own path " , which she said she was doing with loose . " i think you have to like surprising people as an artist , and i like that — i love doing that " , she said . loose is also named partly for the r & b girl group loose , who furtado says she admired for " taking out their sexuality, showing they were complete women . " she said she wanted the songs to be " assertive and cool " and " sexy and sexy " , like madonna , mc lyte , queen latifah and janet jackson , which inspired furtado because , as she put it , she was " comfortable in her sexuality and sexuality " when her 1993 single " that ' s the way it is " was released . during the recording of loose , furtado listened to many electro and rock bands , including bloc party , system of a down , m . i . a . , prince , queens of the stone age , garbage and death from above 1979 , some of whom liked the " loud sounds " found on the album and the " coughing , screaming , screaming basslines " that she put in the mix deliberately . according to her , music by rock artists is " very heavy and has a heavy feel " to it , some of which she felt she liked on the album . furtado has said rock music is " rhythmic ##al " and hip hop @ - @ , because it has become " very churning and heavy . " because the mixing engineers were aware of timbaland and furtado ' s musical influences , the songs were recorded on a computer console in the studio instead of " the fancy room at the end " . furtado said she preferred the louder volume that was brought to the album because she wanted it to sound like her demo tapes , which she compared to her studio work . she said , " it didn ' t have that final wash to it ; it didn ' t have the final wash at the end , except for a couple sounds " . = = music and lyrics = = furtado said that with the release of her albums like loose , she had wanted to establish herself as a musician and gain respect from fans through using many different styles on the album , which most hip hop artists did not do . while she felt she had achieved that , she felt she had managed to make the type of music she " really like [ d ] " . furtado said her main problem with hip hop was that she did not think it was good enough to base all of her songs on , but that she never asked herself why she was being " pretentious " . the album represents her freedom from those influences and , in her words , " jumping in the deep end of the ocean — ' ahh , damn it , this is good ! ' " . furtado said she found herself " all over the map" and sexy " because she is not limited to one genre . for the first time , furtado worked with a number of record producers and followed a more mature approach to making the album . produced primarily by timbaland and danja , it finds furtado experimenting with a more r & b – hip hop sound and , as she describes it , the " dark , dark side of ' 80s music " . she has described the album ' s sound as punk @ - @ hop , which she describes as punk @ - @ hop " modern , dark , spooky , " and says that " there ' s a dark , punk @ - @ hop feel to [ it ] that ' s very sexy " . furtado has described the album as " more urban , more american , more hip @ - @ hop , [ and ] more complicated " than her previous work , which she felt was more complex and complicated because she " start [ ed ] to overthink things " . in addition , during her studio sessions with timbaland , she said she was " in the e ##s phase of just letting go " and being less mature . according to furtado , instead of " pristine stuff " , the album features " really dark " elements such as distorted bass lines , contributions from studio musicians and no " room for error " . furtado has said it is not as much about the lyrics , which are not included in the liner notes , as it is about " living in pleasures — whether it ' s sex or love . " according to her , she wasn ' t trying to be sexual with the lyrics — " i think i really am sexy now " , she says . = = songs = = the opening track , " loose " ( featuring the attitude ) , is a reflection of furtado ' s perception of what people think of her , and she has said the chorus reminds her of " walking down the hall in high school . . . because you see from the inside in . now that i ' m an adult , i think about the inside of me . . . before i said i didn ' t care about what people thought of me , but i really do . " " maneater " is an uptempo electro ##pop song that combines 1980s electro synths and a more dance @ - @ tempo beat . the up @ - @ tempo song has both electropop and synthpop influences and is lyrically referring to how people see " loose "themselves " when standing in their underwear in front of a mirror . " promiscuous " ( featuring timbaland ) was inspired by a flirting exchange furtado had with rihanna , and future @ - @ wrote the song she has characterised the third track , " beautiful " , as " a classic r & b slow jam " . " no hay igual " is a hip hop and reggaeton song , that has a spanglish beat rolling over " future @ - @ produced " beats . the song features a " sharp use " of percussion and " empowered vocals " . in " no hay igual " , furtado sings in spanish and then in english with a reggaeton beat . the album also features more upbeat songs , and the sunday times wrote that it " has a certain sadness to it . " the seventh track , " te busque " , which features latin singer juanes , is about furtado ' s experience with drugs , which she said she has had ever since she was about 16 years old . furtado said she was unsure what " say it right " was about , but that it encapsulates her life when she experiences it and " goes into this dark side " ; in an interview for the sunday times , it was mentioned that it is about her relationship with boyfriend jasper gahunia , the father of her child . " in god ' s hands " , another song from the album , was also inspired by the end of their relationship . = = singles = = in april 2006 , a remix of " no hay igual " featuring calle 13 was issued as a promotional single in the uk . during the same month , " promiscuous " ( featuring timbaland ) was released for digital download in north america . it became furtado ' s first single to top the us billboard hot 100 and was released in australia , where it reached the top ten . the first single in europe and latin america , " maneater " , was released in late may to early june 2006 . it became furtado ' s first single to top the uk singles chart and made the top ten in several countries ; it reached the top five in germany and the top ten in france and latin america . the second single in europe , " promiscuous " , was released in late august to early september 2006 but it did not chart as well as " maneater " . it peaked within the top five in the netherlands and the top1 in several countries , including germany , and also reached the top ten in france . during the same month , " maneater " began its run as the third single in north america ; it was not as successful as " promiscuous " , reaching number one @ - @ only in canada and the top twenty in the us , though it was a top ten hit on the uk singles chart . releases of the third north american single , " say it right " , and the fourth uk single , " all good things ( come to an end ) " , took place in november and december , and the third latin american single , " promiscuous " , was released in january 2007 .

" q found most of it to be " an upbeat , hip @ - @ and @ - @ inflected delight . " kelefa sanneh of the new york times wrote that " the music and the lyrics are mainly aimed at dance floors , and yet this album keeps reminding us that the dance floor is one of the most beautiful places on earth . " in its review , allmusic wrote " it ' s on this final half of the album that the furtado and timbaland team sounds like a solid team , still true to the nelly of her first two albums , but given an improved production that helps open her back up . . . timbaland has revitalized nelly furtado both musically and emotionally with loose " . she won her first brit awards — best british act — in 2007 . in a mixed review , nick catucci of the village voice wrote that furtado " sauces up a bit too much " and lacks " chemistry " with timbaland , writing that loose " isn ' t a love song , but a hip @ - @ and @ - @ hybrid that never finds its mark " . he added , " she loses herself in gwen stefani – - like , as on “ " , ” and ethnic songs like “ que te igual ” ##士 “ te busque . " in his consumer guide for the village voice , robert christgau gave the album a " b " and named it " album of the year " , indicating " a good record whose details rarely merit further thought . " christgau wrote that its dance @ - @ + tracks " might be god ' s greatest work on the hip @ - @ scale . but as songs they ' re not much " . = = impact = = considerable controversy was generated by the more positive image of furtado used in promotion and marketing for the album ,and in particular the music videos for " loose " and " maneater " , in which she walks around with her midriff exposed . according to maclean ' s magazine , some felt that furtado ' s image was a natural progression of a pop star ; others said that she had " sold out " in an effort to boost album sales , particularly after her second album was a commercial failure in comparison to her first . maclean ' s said that her music " seems a bit forced " and compared her with artists such as madonna and emily haines of metric : " [ they ] seem to be stuck in ##ept , even somewhat intimidating in their actions : they ' ve made a conscious decision for political and personal reasons . in particular , furtado ' s aggressive , overt sexuality comes across as being — overdone by hundreds of pouty young girls with a quarter of furtado ' s natural talent . . . the image feels as if it ' s been imposed rather than chosen by the confident , articulate singer we ' ve seen in the past . " dose magazine felt that furtado ' s new " highly sexual " image was manufactured , and noted the influence in the album ' s direction of geffen ' s jimmy iovine , who helped to develop the dresden dolls , a girl group known for their sexually explicit dance music . the magazine also criticised furtado ' s discussion of her buttocks and apparent lack of feminism in a blender magazine interview , writing : " jesus , do you hear that churning ? those are the legs of gloria steinem lying in their grave . " a writer for the canadian broadcasting corporation said that cynics could attribute furtado ' s commercial success with loose to her " amped @ - @ up - appeal . " the writer said that , the release of janet jackson ' s album damita jo ( 2004 ) , such a move was not infallible . furtado was " relatively young compared to many of her contemporaries " — she was sporting tattoos and performing " christina aguilera @ - @ style gyrations and calisthenics " in the " loose " and " maneater " videos . " despite its recent arrival . . . furtado ' s new image doesn ’ t feel right " , he said . " [ she ] seems to be thinking less and acting less , to the benefit of her music . " in january 2007 , a video posted on youtube led toand that the song " do it " , and the timbaland @ - @ - ringtone " the party " that accompanied it , used — without permission — the lyrics from finnish demoscene ##r janne " tempest " suni ' s song " acidjazzed out " , winner of the assembly 2000 oldskool music contest . timbaland released the record of c64 versions of the song written by glenn rune gallefoss ( grg ) . timbaland admitted sampling the song , but stated that he had no plans to investigate the original lyrics . hannu sormunen , a finnish representative of universal which represents nelly furtado in finland , commented the issue as stated in the 7 january 2007 issue of iltalehti ; " in case that the band decides to pursue the matter further , it ' s for him to go to america and help them with the international court of law . that would require a considerable amount of time and , of course , money . " on 9 february 2007 , timbaland commented on the issue in an mtv interview : " it makes me laugh . the part i don ' t understand , the part of having to act . i went to his house and took something from his hand . i don ' t attack him from a can of worms . i ' m 18 years old . that ' s how you attack a man ? you attack moi ? come on , man . you got to be serious . you the laughing stock . people are saying , ' you can ' t be serious . ' " on 7 january 2009 , mikko valimaki , who is one of the legal representatives of kernel music , the owner of the sound recording company , reported that the case had been settled in florida . in february 2008 , turkish media reported that kalan muzik , the record label that released turkish pop singer muhlis akarsu ' s album ya dost ya dost , filed charges against furtado for the album track " wait for you " , which label officials claim features the baglama cover version of akarsu ' s song " o allah desem gelsem .
