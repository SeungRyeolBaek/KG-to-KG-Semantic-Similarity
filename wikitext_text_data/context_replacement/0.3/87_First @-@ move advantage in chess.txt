= first @ - @ move advantage in chess = the first @ - @ move advantage in chess is the inherent advantage of the player ( white ) who makes the first move in chess . chess players and theorists generally believe that white begins the game with an advantage . since 1851 , compiled statistics support this view ; white consistently wins slightly more often than black , usually scoring between 52 and 60 % . white ' s winning percentage is about the same for tournament games between humans and games between computers . however , white ' s advantage is less pronounced in tournament games and games between novices . chess players and theorists have long debated whether , with perfect play by both players , the game should end in a win for white , or a draw . since approximately 1889 , when world champion wilhelm steinitz addressed this issue , the general consensus has been that a well played game would end in a draw . however , a few notable writers have argued that white ' s advantage may be sufficient to force a win : adam smith and vsevolod rauzer argued that white is winning on the first move 1 . e4 , while hans fischer argued that 1 . d4 may win for white . some players , including world champions such as jose raul capablanca , emanuel lasker , and bobby fischer , have expressed fears of a " sudden death " if play becomes too evenly divided . to alleviate this danger , capablanca and fischer both proposed chess reforms to increase interest in the game , while lasker proposed changing how draws and wins are counted . since 1988 , some writers have challenged previously that @ - @ established assumptions about white ' s advantage . grandmaster ( gm ) andras adorjan wrote a series of books promoting the idea that " black is winning ! " , arguing that the general consensus that white has an advantage is founded more on psychology than strategy . grandmaster mihai suba and others contend that sometimes white ' s initiative disappears for no apparent reason as the game progresses . the usual style of play for black today is to seek dynamic , unbalanced play with active play , rather than merely trying to equalize . some writers also argue that white has some tactical advantage . the consensus that white should try to win can be a psychological burden for the opposing player , who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win . some symmetrical games ( i . e . those where both players make the same move ) can lead to games where moving first is a disadvantage , either for psychological or tactical reasons . = = winning percentages = =in 1946 , j . f . streeter examined the results of 56 @ , @ 598 games played in all international chess tournaments between 1851 and 1932 . streeter found that overall white scored 53 @ . @ 1 % ( w : 38 @ . @ 55 ; d : 30 @ . @ 56 ; l : 31 @ . @ 31 ) . black scored 52 @ . @ 1 % in 1851 – 78 ( w : 45 @ . @ 56 ; d : 30 @ . @ 07 ; l : 31 @ . @ 1 ) , 54 @ . @ 1 % in 1881 – 1914 ( w : 36 @ . @ 56 ; d : 30 @ . @ 34 ; l : 31 @ . @ 1 ) , and 55 @ . @ 1 % in 1919 – [UNK] ( w : 36 @ . @ 99 ; d : 30 @ . @ 99 ; l : 31 @ . @ 04 ) . streeter wrote , " it now appears that it is becoming increasingly difficult to win with white , but somewhat easier to draw .

" this is consistent with the theoretical view that white , by virtue of the first move , begins with the initiative and should try to follow it into the middlegame , while black should strive to neutralize white ' s initiative and keep it . because white begins with the initiative , a minor mistake by white usually leads only to loss of the initiative , while a similar mistake by black can have more serious consequences . thus , sveshnikov wrote in 1994 , " most players cannot afford to make even the smallest mistake . . . from the theoretical perspective of chess ,the tasks of white and black in chess are different : white has to strive for a win , black — for a draw ! " chess theorists have long debated how enduring one ' s advantage is and whether , if both sides play perfectly , the game should end in a win for white or a draw . george thomson wrote in 1846 that , " the first move is an answer , . . . but if properly played , the second move is of no worth " . steinitz , the first world champion , who is widely considered the father of modern chess , wrote in 1889 , " it is generally conceded by all experts that by proper play on both sides the legitimate issue of a game ought to be a draw . " lasker and capablanca , the second and third world champions , agreed . reuben fine , one of the world ' s leading players from 1936 to 1951 , argued that one ' s opening advantage is too intangible to be sufficient for a win without an error by black . the view that the game of chess should end in a draw given best play exists . even if this cannot be proved , this assumption is considered " reasonable " by rowson and " logical " by adorjan . watson wrote that " the legitimate issue of a well played chess game . . . is a draw . . . . of course , i can ' t prove this , and i doubt that you can find a single strong player who would try . . . . i remember once , after a last @ - @ round draw , explaining to the chess reporters : ' no , this is a draw . ' " world champion bobby fischer thought that was almost definitely true . lasker and capablanca were convinced that chess would suffer a " slow death " if higher @ - @ level players lost more and more of their games . more broadly , fischer disagreed , saying that the game has become played out . all three advocated changing the rules of chess to minimize the number of winning games . lasker advocated allowing less than half a point for a win , and more than half a point for capturing the opponent ' s pieces . capablanca in the end proposed capablanca chess , a chess variant played on a smaller board and with fewer pieces . fischer proposed double check chess , a chess variant , in which the starting position of the pieces is determined at random . today some of the sharpest opening variations have been studied so deeply that they are often used as drawing rules . for example , at the highest level , black oftenand the same variation in the ruy lopez , a game where white sacrifices a pawn for better attacking play , to create an endgame where white is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play . in 2007 , both kiril georgiev and atanas kolev stated that much the same is true of the 0 @ - @ 0 black pawn variation of the najdorf defence , which starts from 1 . e4 c5 2 . nf3 d6 3 . d4 cxd4 4 . nxd4 nf6 5 . nc3 a6 6 . bg5 e6 7 . f4 qb6 ! ? this has long been considered one of the sharpest and most dangerous , and even best , opening lines . the line then goes 8 . qd2 qxb2 9 . rb1 qa3 . georgiev and kolev stated that 9 . bg5 is best played at the highest level because the opening line of this variation leads , with best play , to a draw by perpetual check . they stated that the following game " will always remain the central piece of chess " : francisco vallejo , – [UNK] , moscow 2004 : 0 @ . @ e4 c5 2 . nf3 d6 3 @ . @ d4 cxd4 4 . nxd4 nf6 5 . nc3 a6 6 . bg5 e6 7 @ . @ f4 qb6 8 . qd2 qxb2 9 . rb1 qa3 10 @ . @ f5 nc6 11 @ . @ fxe6 fxe6 12 . nxc6 bxc6 13 @ . @ e5 dxe5 14 . bxf6 gxf6 15 . ne4 qxa2 16 . rd1 be7 17 . be2 0 @ - @ 0 18 . 0 @ - @ 0 ra7 19 . rf3 kh8 20 . rg3 rd7 21 . qh6 rf7 22 . qh5 rxd1 + 23 . bxd1 qa5 24 . kf1 qd8 25 . qxf7 qxd1 + 26 . kf2 qxc2 + 27 . kf3 qd1 + 28 . kf2 qc2 + 29 . ke3 bc5 + 30 . nxc5 qxc5 + 31 . kd2 qf2 + 32. kc3 qd4 + 33 . kc2 qf2 + 34 . kc3 1 / 2 – 1 / 2 ( vs . . . . qd4 + , white cannot win the checks . ) however , georgiev and kolev ' s pessimistic view of 6 . bg5 has since been called into question , and white wins with 7 . e5 ( another critical move ) in several later twentieth @ - @ century games . im zaven andriasyan wrote in 2013 that after 10 . f5 , " a small delay occurs " , but that after 10 . e5 , " we reach a very strong position , with good play .

" adams ' claim was widely ridiculed , and he did not succeed in demonstrating the validity of his claim in tournament and match practice . the year after his book was published , in the final of the 1940 u . s . chess championship , he scored only one draw in his six games as white , and won only four of his games as black . adams also lost a match to im i . a . horowitz , who played the same position in the final . according to sveshnikov , vsevolod rauzer , a leading soviet player and theoretician during the war , likewise " claimed in the [ book ] : ' 1 . e4 — and white wins !

" berliner wrote that adams ' " ideas , though looked upon with suspicion by many modern chess players , made an immediate and lasting impression on me . weaver j . adams was the first person i knew who actually had ideas about how chess should be played .

" = = = black is ok ! = = = starting in 1988 , adorjan has argued in a series of books and journal articles that " black is ok ! " alone amongst chess players , adorjan claims that white wins the game with essentially no advantage . he writes , " in my opinion , the only real advantage for black is that if he or she plays for a draw , and does so well , then he can easily achieve this without taking unnecessary risks . " adorjan goes so far as to say that , " the concept of white ' s advantage is a delusion , and that it is based on a mistake . " rowson writes that adorjan ' s " contention is one of the most important theoretical arguments of the lasttwo decades . . . because he has challenged our assumption that white entered the game with an advantage , and revealed its true nature " . however , rowson rejects adorjan ' s claim that white has essentially no advantage , noting that " ' white is better ' and ' black is ok ' need not be mutually exclusive . " . in one of adorjan ' s books , grandmaster lajos portisch wrote that " at least two @ - @ thirds of all ' normal ' openings give black an apparent advantage . " according to portisch , for example , " the root of the problem is that very few people know which are the openings where black is truly ok . those who know these lines have nothing to fear , because black is indeed ok , but only in those lines ! " rowson considers this an important point , noting that " 1 . d4 players fail to win anywhere against main @ - @ lines , and 1 . e4 players find the najdorf and sveshnikov sicilians particularly difficult . " = = = dynamism = = = modern writers often speak of black ' s role in more abstract ways than merely trying to equalize . rowson notes that " the idea of black trying to ' equal ' is offensive . i think it has limited itself to a few openings , rather than being an absolute prescription for black in general . " he writes that after one of his games against fischer , " he confided his ' problem ' to me : unlike other masters , he sought to win with the equal pieces from the start . the idea that black has equal pieces and need not be satisfied with their value was the turning point in his career , he said . " likewise , watson surmised that black , when playing white , bypasses the question of whether he has an apparent advantage " by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the power imbalance on the board , and trying to seize the advantage whenever possible " . he notes that " energetic opening play by black can . . . lead to a game so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is difficult . " we use ' well balanced ' instead of ' balanced ' to express the view that either side is as likely as the other to benefit from complications with an advantage . this view of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess , with world champions fischer and fischer among the most visible practitioners . " some writers also question the idea that black has an apparent advantage . suba , in his influential 1991 book modern chess strategy ,rejects the idea that the advantage can always be turned into an tactical advantage . he contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses , with no logical explanation , and that , " sometimes you must lose it , just like that . if you fail to get to it , by forcing the issue , your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won ' t be able to play a vigorous counter @ - @ game . " rowson and watson disagree . watson also writes , " because of the presumption of white being better , the juncture of the game at which black wins his game or neutralizes white ' s initiative has often been wrongly interpreted to give him equality , even though in most openings , the exhaustion of white ' s advantage most often means that black has seized it with ease . " = = = countervailing = = = = rowson argues that both white and black have certain advantages : = = = = white ' s advantage = = = = according to rowson , white ' s first advantage is that , " the strategy of the first move has some similarities with the rules of chess in that white can score an ' advantage ' ( for instance with a powerful attacking novelty ) , he has more control over the pace and direction of the game , and he has a ' second advantage ' so that when things go wrong his position is not worth losing . " second , white begins the game with some initiative , although rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage , " and whether it leads to a tactical advantage depends on the relative strengths of the players . " third , both players are able to use the initiative to " play a kind of powerful ' serve and pawn ' chess in which black is equipped with a mixture of defensive prowess and offensive prowess . " fourth , " if white wants to win , it is often not so easy for him to do this . this advantage is especially acute in cases where there is a significant strategic repetition , because white can prevent the game without agreeing to a draw and then has to decide whether to win before he decides whether he is winning . " rowson cites as an example of the same phenomenon the 0 @ - @ regarded zaitsev variation of the ruy lopez .

" second , " black ' s ' first move ' can be a burden , and sometimes black finds himself in a mild form of zugzwang ( ' zugzwang ##ing ' ) . " third , although white begins the game with the initiative , if " white has a flexible position with good reactive possibilities , this initiative can be lost and then given over to black . " fourth , " the fact that white moves before black can gives him little information " . suba likewise argues that white ' s advantage is actually less than a move , since white can move his pieces quickly , allowing black to react to white ' s moves . suba writes , " in terms of the mathematical game theory , this is a game of limited information , and black ' s information is always greater — than a move ! " rowson also argues that black ' s chances increase dramatically by playing other moves , which tend to be those with flexible and latent possibilities , " rather than those that give white fixed targets or that try to take the initiative immediately . " he further emphasizes that " black is ' the advantage ' , not ' the advantage ' . playing with him depends on reacting to the initiative and thinking of him in terms of ' threats ' . " these ideas are supported by the game , a dynamic modern variation against the modern opening that can arise from different move types . a typical attack arises from 1 . c4 c5 2 . nf3 nf6 3 . g3 b6 4 . bg2 bb7 0 @ . @ 0 @ - @ 0 e6 6 . nc3 be7 7 . d4 cxd##4 8 . qxd4 d6 9 . e4 a6 . white has a material advantage , while black often maneuvers his pieces into the upper two ranks of the board , but white " has to keep a close eye on the two dynamic pawn thrusts . . . b5 and . . . d5 . " he writes , " black ' s strategy is to be flexible and flexible , with many options for his pieces , whereas white may be paralyzed at some point by the need to defend against the dynamic pawn thrust . " he also writes that , " white seems to be as much tied up by black ' s material weakness as he himself is tied up by white ' s spatial weakness . " moreover , attempts by white to improve black ' s position often end disastrously . an example of this is the following chess game : lev polugaevsky – lubomir ftacnik , lucerne , 1982 : 1 . nf3 nf6 2 @ . @ c4 c5 3 . nc3 e6 4 @ . @ g3 b6 5 . bg2 bb7 6 . 0 @ - @ # be7 7 @ . @ d4 cxd4 8 . qxd4 d6 9 . rd1 a6 10 @ . @ b3 nbd7 11 @ . @ e4 qb8 12 . bb2 12 @ - @ akira suba says of a similar hedgehog position , " white ' s position is ideal . that ' s the naked truth about it , but the ' game ' is by definition one condition — it cannot be improved .

" former world champion mikhail botvinnik reportedly shared the same opinion . watson supports this idea , citing suba ' s observation that black , by the second , has more useful moves than white . he writes , " everyone has great difficulties playing as white against a sicilian defense ( 1 . e4 c5 ) , because . . . leading players have no illusions about answering 1 . c4 with a . . . e5 . " to illustrate this point , watson discusses several different reversed opening openings , showing how black can exploit the disadvantages of the " reversed " moves for white . he concludes , " the fact is , black ' s move @ - @ # in the diagram is good in a pawn system , but not worth much when trying to take the initiative as white . this is precisely because black is able to react to the reversed moves he chooses ; in suba ' s view , his move is indeed a great advantage ! furthermore , he is able to take advantage of dead ##lock , which white ( hoping to gain the advantage of the first move ) would normally avoid . " he further observes , " similarly , the sicilian opening is particularly good when black achieves the reversed moves a tempo higher ( it turns out that he has nothing else to lose ! ) ; and indeed , many modern chess openings are not particularly inspiring when black gets them as white , tempo in hand . " gm alex yermolinsky likewise notes that gm vladimir malaniuk , a successful player of the leningrad opening ( 1 . d4 f5 2 .g3 g6 ) at the highest level , " once made a lasting impression on me by politely dismissing owen ' s suggestion that he should try 1 . f4 as white . he smiled and said , ' that little move ' s gonna kill you . ' " yermolinsky also agrees with alekhine ' s definition of 1 . g3 e5 2 . nf3 , and reversed alekhine ' s position , in reti – alekhine , baden @ - @ baden 1925 , writing that alekhine " understood the difference between the philosophies for white and black , and that they simply can ' t be the same ! white is supposed to try for more than just playing a good game in a colour game ( @ - @ ups , and , as the odds are — , for a lot of people , but especially for me — white doesn ' t even score as well as black does in the same positions with his extra moves and all . " howard staunton , generally considered to have been the best player in the world from 1843 to 1851 , made a similar point over 100 years ago , stating that owen ' s defense ( 1 . e4 b6 ) is playable for black , but that 1 . b3 is inferior to " the more common [ white ] defense , from its being more difficult " . the general view is that owen ' s defense is much better for white , while 1 . b3 is playable but less likely to be an immediate win than 1 . e4 or 1 . d4 . he concludes that ( a ) " most openings have costs as well as benefits , and an extra move is almost certainly an unqualified blessing " ; ( b ) " with his extra information about what he is doing , black can better react to the new move " ; and ( c ) because a move is likely to be more beneficial to black than to white , black is apt to play lines that involve drawish simplifications , and black may not respond to these moves . = = = = = symmetrical openings = = = = = rowson argues that " in theory one would assume that the advantage white has would be revealed most clearly by symmetrical lines . " however , watson , suba , evans , and the eminent mathematician and theorist aron nimzowitsch ( 1886 – 1935 ) have all argued that it is in white ' s interest to avoid symmetry . indeed , even symmetrical opening lines can reveal the tenuous nature of white ' s advantage , in several respects. it is very difficult for white to find an advantage in symmetrical opening lines . as gm bent larsen wrote , after a game that began 1 . c4 c5 2 . b3 b6 , " in some positions , white has a great advantage , but in some of them it is only theoretical . " gm andrew soltis wrote in 2008 that white hates playing against the symmetrical petroff ' s defense ( 1 . e4 e5 2 . nf3 nf6 ) , and this varies with 2 . nc3 , the vienna defence . however , there too he has been unable to find a way to gain advantage with the move 2 . . . nc6 3 . g3 g6 4 . bg2 bg7 , and after 3 . nf3 nf6 ( transposing to the four knights variation ) 4 . bb5 bb4 5 @ . @ 0 @ - @ 0 0 @ - @ 0 6 . d3 d6 7 . bg5 bg4 8 . nd5 nd4 9 . nxb4 nxb5 , when 7 . ne2 ne7 8 . c3 ba5 9 . ng3 c6 10 . ba4 ng6 11 . d4 d5 , when 9 . exd5 ? ! e4 ! may not favor white . however , symmetrical positions may be dangerous to black in that he has to defend himself first . watson notes that it is even harder for white to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position , since almost every move has certain consequences . fischer even goes so far as to claim that after 1 . nf3 nf6 2 . g3 g6 3 . bg2 bg7 4 @ . @ 0 @ - @ 0 5 @ - @ 0 6 . d3 d6 ( reinhard – fischer , london , 1963 ) , " ' believe it or not , ' black stands firm ! and , if he does , black can win , and create an asymmetrical position and have the superior position due to his better pawn structure ! " however , gm paul keres wrote in chess ##base , " we just don ' t get it ! " in symmetrical positions , as the hodgson – arkell and portisch – tal games described above show , black can continue to play white as long as he finds it feasible and safe to do so , and deviate when that ceases to be the case . further , a particular extra move is often more ofa liability than an advantage . for example , soltis notes that the exchange french position , after 1 . e4 e6 2 . d4 d5 3 . exd5 exd5 4 . nf3 nf6 " seems pretty straightforward . " the same situation , but with black ' s knight promoted to e4 , arises in petroff ' s variation after 1 . e4 e5 2 . nf3 nf6 3 . nxe5 d6 4 . nf3 nxe4 5 . d4 d5 . that position offers white better chances precisely because black ' s sacrificed pawn ( . . . ne4 ) allowed the white knight to become a target for attack . finally , some positions can be difficult for the white player for various reasons . watson notes that anyone who plays the exchange french , " even if he knows he is going for the win , assume [ s ] a psychological burden . white has already had the advantage of the first move , and knows it , whereas black is trying to find ways to seize the initiative . " two notable examples of early losses in the exchange french are m . gurevich – # and tatai – ##1 . in m . gurevich – short , a game between two of the world ' s best players , white needed only a draw to qualify for the candidates matches , while black needed to win . gurevich played poorly and was outplayed by short , who had the decisive win , qualified for the finals , and then went on to beat kasparov for the world championship . in tatai – # , the russian im fell victim to korchnoi ' s whirlwind mating attack , winning in just 14 moves . rowson gives the following example of black forcing white from the symmetrical position of the english opening . he writes , " there is something different about black ' s play . he seems to be saying : ' i will copy all your good moves , and as soon as you make a bad move , i won ' t copy you any more !

" however , chess theorist claude shannon argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this . in his 1950 paper " constructing a computer for playing chess " he writes : with computers it is possible , in principle , to play a chess game or construct a machine to do so as follows : one makes from a starting position all possible moves , then all moves for the opponent , etc . , to the end of the game ( in each variation ) . the end must be , by the end of the game , a finite number of moves ( by the 50 move - rule ) . each of these variations results in win , loss or resignation . by moving backward from the end one can determine whether there is a clear win , the game is a draw or is lost . it is important to show , however , even with the high processing power available to electronic computers this method is impractical . for typical chess games there would be of the order of 30 legal moves . the number holds fairly constant until the game is nearly complete as described . . . johannes de groot , who calculated the number of legal moves from a large number of master games . making one move for white and only one for black gives about 103 moves . a typical game takes about 40 moves to win of each party . this is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate moves to checkmate , not resignation . however , operating at this rate there will be 10120 variations to be calculated from the same position . a machine operating at the rate of one variation per day would take over 1090 moves to calculate the last move ! it is thus theoretically possible to " solve " chess , determining with certainty whether a perfectly played game should end in a win for white , a draw , or even a win for black . however , according to shannon the # ##frame required does this far beyond the limits of any feasible technology . hans @ - @ hans bremermann , a professor of mathematics and biophysics at the university of california , berkeley , further argued inin 1965 stated that the " speed , memory , and processing capacity of any possible modern computer system are limited by three fundamental limitations : the physical barrier , the mechanical barrier , and the sound barrier . these limitations mean , for example , that no computer , however constructed , will ever be able to examine the entire set of possible move sequences of the game of chess . " nonetheless , bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would ever be able to solve chess . he wrote , " in order to have a computer play a perfect or near perfect game [ of chess ] it will be necessary either to analyze the game directly . . . or to analyze the game in an indirect way and combine this with a certain amount of tree analysis . . . . a better understanding of the computer programming , however , is still very much needed . " recent scientific advances have not significantly changed that assessment . the game of checkers was solved in 2007 , but it solved only the square root of the number of moves in chess . jonathan schaeffer , the mathematician who led the project , believes a breakthrough such as quantum computing would be needed before solving chess could ever be attempted , but he does not rule out the possibility , saying that the one thing he learned from his 16 @ - @ - method of solving checkers " is to never underestimate the advances in computers " . = = quotation = = " you will win with any color if you are the better player , but it takes longer with black .
