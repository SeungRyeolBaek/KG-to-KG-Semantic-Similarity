" he remained in office until 1821 , when he and his crew were driven off the island by the united states navy . in 1825 the republic of texas established the port of galveston and in 1830 built a custom house . galveston served as the capital of the republic of texas when in 1836 the first governor david g . burnet began his administration there . in 1836 , the french @ - @ merchant michel branamour menard and his family purchased 4 @ , @ 605 acres ( 4 @ . @ / km2 ) of land for $ 2 @ , @ 000 to establish the settlement that would become the modern city of galveston . as anglo @ - @ americans moved to the area , they brought in or purchased enslaved french @ - @ americans , many of whom worked on and on the island , especially on riverboats . in 1839 the city of galveston received its charter and was incorporated by the congress of the republic of texas . the city was by then a major center of commerce and attracted many european immigrants in the area and , among the influx of european immigrants to texas , were german immigrants . along with many other immigrants , these immigrants began to support slavery , join the confederacy during the civil war , and form the republican party after the war . during this time , the city had no " germans " in the state , with the exception of theand improvement of infrastructure : post office ( 1836 ) , public hospital ( 1836 ) , grand lodge of the religious order ( 1840 ) ; cotton gin ( 1842 ) , and parochial schools ( ursuline convent ) ( 1847 ) , telephone lines ( 1854 ) , and railroad station ( 1856 ) . during the american civil war , confederate forces under major general john b . magruder defeated and drove the union forces from the city in april 1863 in the battle of galveston . in 1867 galveston experienced a yellow fever epidemic ; 1800 people died in the city . these spread in coastal and inland areas throughout the 19th century , as did other diseases . the city ' s growth continued during the reconstruction period with several " improvements " : construction of the court house ( 1870 ) , and courthouse ( 1876 ) , and installation of telephone lines ( 1878 ) and electric lighting ( 1883 ) . having attracted immigration from other states , by 1870 the city had a black population that numbered 12 @ , @ 000 , made up mostly of former slaves and augmented by free blacks who were free people of color and slaves before the war . the " blacks " constituted about 10 % of the city ' s population of 12 @ , @ 818 that year . during the 12 @ - @ - @ - @ 000 era , figures such as william e . jones and william henry cuney , who founded the texas republican party and promoted civil rights for blacks , worked to significantly improve social and economic conditions for blacks in galveston and throughout texas . cuney organized his own union of workers and a union of black farmers to challenge the federal ban on black work . galveston was a port city and one of the most prosperous during reconstruction ; the children ' s bureau was established there . black residents hired teachers from the south , and thousands of children were taught to read . the school district continued growing , and immigrants began to arrive after arriving at this port of entry . by the end of the 19th century , the city of galveston had a population of 12 @ , @ 000 . its location on the southern border of galveston bay and the gulf of mexico made it the center of commerce in texas . it was one of the largest commercial centers in the world , in competition with new orleans . during the 19th century , the port city of galveston grew rapidly and the strand was soon the city ' s major business district . for a time , the strand was known as the " main street of the world " . in the late 1800s , the british built fort victoria , and theand also on galveston and along the red river . in august 1897 , galveston was again visited by the uss texas ( the uss texas ) , the first commissioned ship of the united states navy . during the visit , the ship ' s officers were presented with a $ 1 @ , @ 000 postal envelope , decorated with two texas stars , as a gift from the governor of the state . = = = hurricane of 1900 and 1900 = = = on september 11 , 1900 , the city was devastated by a devastating storm . this storm holds the record for the united states ' worst natural disaster . the city was devastated , and an estimated 6 @ , @ 000 to 8 @ , @ 000 people on the island were killed . after the storm , a 10 @ - @ mile ( 16 km ) long , 17 foot ( 5 @ . @ 5 m ) sea wall was constructed to protect the city from flooding and subsequent storm surge . a team of engineers under captain martyn smith ( galveston ' s chief of order ) developed the plan to move much of the city infrastructure to a greater height than the wall so that order in the city could be maintained . the city adopted the city commission form of municipal government , known as the " galveston commission " , to assist with reconstruction . despite efforts to attract new settlers to the city after the storm , galveston never fully returned to its original state of economic pride and prosperity . it was also aided by the construction of the houston ship channel , which brought the port of houston into direct competition with the natural resources of the bay of bengal for shipping traffic . to boost her economy , and increase her population , galveston actively attracted immigrants . through the efforts of rabbi jacob cohen and congregation b ' nai israel , galveston became the center of an immigration movement called the immigration movement that , between 1907 and 1914 , brought over 4 @ , @ 000 eastern european jewish immigrants from the immigrant communities of the larger cities of the southern united states . additionally , other ethnic groups , including italians , germans and russian jews , came to the city during this period . this immigration movement significantly changed the ethnic composition of the city , as well as in other parts of texas and the southeastern u . s . as the movement encouraged economic growth and the city of galveston grew into the state ' s largest city , local business leaders felt the need to separate from the inner - @ - @ - city . in 1905 william henry davis , jr . and charles l . kempner , sons of two of galveston ' s wealthiest families , founded the houstonmoody trust company . two years later , moody established the first national bank , which would later become the first national bank . during the 1920s and 1930s , the island of @ - @ emerged as a major tourist destination . under the leadership of john maceo and william maceo , the city increased the popularity of alcohol and gambling through establishments like the galveston club , which provided entertainment to wealthy houstonians and the re @ - @ of @ - @ hotel . along with prohibition , which had existed in the city since the civil war , galveston became known as the " free city " of the south . galvestonians supported and encouraged the slave trade , often referring to their state as the " free state of galveston " . the city also experienced what would later be known as the " moody boom " . the 1930s and 1940s brought great change to the galveston economy . during world war ii , the galveston municipal airport , adjacent to scholes international airport , was designated @ - @ as a u . s . army air force base and renamed " moody army air field " . in august 1943 , moody army air field was officially established with the 20th century group operating the air @ - @ air mission in the gulf of mexico . in 1942 , william henry moody , jr . , along with his wife libbie shearn - moody , established the moody foundation , to support " current and future generations of galveston .
