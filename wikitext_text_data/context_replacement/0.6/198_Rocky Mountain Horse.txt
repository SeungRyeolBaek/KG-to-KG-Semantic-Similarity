= rocky mountain horse = the rocky mountain horse is a horse breed originating in the mountains of kentucky in the united states . despite its name , it originated not in the rocky mountains , but rather in the appalachian mountains . a single stallion , imported from the western united states to eastern kentucky in 1890 , developed the rocky mountain horse in the late 19th century . in the early @ - @ 20th century , a stallion named john tobe , owned by a kentucky family , was used to develop the chestnut type ; today most rocky mountain horses trace back to this stallion . in 1986 , the rocky mountain horse registry was formed and by 2005 had registered over 100 @ , @ 000 horses . the breed is known for its distinctive " chocolate " coat color and white mane and tail , the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black base , found in most of the breed . it also has a single @ - @ purpose foot foot known as the " four @ - @ foot " . originally developed as a multi @ - @ for riding , draft and working draft horse , today it is used primarily for show riding and driving horses . = = color characteristics = = rocky mountain horses stand between 1 @ . @ 5 and 6 hands ( 58 and 63 inches , 147 and 163 cm ) high . a chestnut color is accepted by the registry , but a dark coat color called " chocolate " with a black , " white " mane and tail is preferred . this color is the result of the relatively rare silver foot gene acting on a black base coat . although rare , this color has been found in over a dozen breeds , including the rocky mountain horse . some white markings are accepted by the registry , although these markings do not extend beyond the eyes . the color characteristics are highly variable , due to the different breeds that produce the rocky mountain horse . the rocky mountain horse is praised by breeders for its strength and ability to survive life in the mountains . it is often noted for its gentle health and compassion for animals . rocky mountain horses have the highest risk of any breed for the pigment deficiency of of the vision anomaly ( mcoa ) , also called progressive contact lens disease ( asd ) . mcoa is characterized by the abnormal development of abnormal eye pigment , which causes impaired vision , although usually of a progressive type ; the disorder is four @ - @ purpose . recent studies have shown that the disease may be due to the silver foot gene , as well horses withwith mcoa , the horse . the horse has a unique walking speed , called the four @ - @ beat , which resembles the average speed of the number of horse breeds . these speeds are an intermediate speed between a walk and a run - run ; both speeds are four @ - @ beat speeds , whereas the walk is a two @ - @ beat speed . the extra feet provide more stability to the horse because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground . this allows movement of the horse ' s topline and reduces the problem of a two @ - @ beat motion , caused by the moment of contact caused by the movement of the feet on the ground as the horse moves from one set of feet to the other . the benefit of this intermediate speed is that the horse has energy . more than thirty horse breeds are " gaited , " able to perform the single @ - @ - beat motion , and they can even walk . however , the rocky mountain horse , with speed , can use the single @ - @ beat to traverse rough terrain at over 7 miles per hour ( 11 km / h ) and long stretches of flat terrain at 12 to 16 miles per hour ( 26 km / h ) . the walking speed is known as the walk . in comparison , the average walk - speed is 5 to 8 miles per hour ( 8 @ . @ 8 to 13 @ . @ 13 km / h ) . = = = = = = kentucky is known for its gaited horses , descended from a mix of spanish horses from the southern united states and english horses from the north . kentucky saddlebreds , tennessee walking horses and kentucky state horses all originated in the same general geographic area , from the same mix of spanish and english horses . rocky mountain horses have a similar appearance to the kentucky state pleasure horse , and they are sometimes called " kentucky state horses " . the rocky mountain horse originated in western kentucky from a foundation stallion brought to the bluegrass region from the rocky mountains in 1890 . brought to the area as a stallion , early accounts indicate that the " rocky mountain horse " , as he is known , had the dark chestnut coat and white mane and tail seen in the breed today , as well as the four @ - @ beat speed . he was used to sire local arabian horses , and due to the geographic area in which he was found , a new type of stallion developed . this new stallion was a colt , an aftertobe , who was the most famous representative of the rocky mountain horse breed . old tobe was bred by a native of hot springs , arkansas , william tuttle . for most of the 20th century , tuttle was a leading owner of rocky mountain horses , and managed to keep the breed alive during the great depression and world war ii . after world war ii , despite declining horse populations in the us , tuttle kept his horses , and continued to use old tobe as a breeding stallion . tuttle established the natural bridge horse show association for pleasure riding , and used old tobe for pleasure riding in the area and for breeding other young horses , the last until the horse was 35 years old . old tobe died at the age of 23 . the presence of the 1 @ - @ 000 mark makes it possible that the breed is in fact descended from the narragansett horse , a breed known for passing its gaited characteristics on to other horse horses . in 1986 , the rocky mountain horse association was formed to increase registration growth and promote the breed ; there were only 100 horses in the first round of registration . since then , the association has , over the history of the breed , registered over 25000 horses as of 2015 , and the breed has spread to 30 states and 20 countries . in order to be accepted into the registry , a horse ' s sex must be verified via dna testing . horses must also , upon reaching 35 years of age , be tested to ensure that they meet the physical characteristics and temperament requirements of the breed . the rocky mountain horse is kept in " endangered " status by the american rare breeds association , meaning that the total world population of the breed is less than 1 @ , @ 000 , with fewer than 800 registered registered in the us . the breed was originally developed for agricultural use on the plains of the appalachian mountains , where it was found pulling wagons and carts , working cattle and being ridden by both adults and children . today , it is primarily used for working cattle , as well as trail riding and horseback riding . the breed ' s health and disposition make it sought out by elderly and disabled people . each year , the somerset county museum hosts the annual rocky mountain horse show . = somerset county cricket club , 2009 = somerset county cricket club participated in four major competitions during the 2009 english cricket season : the first division of the county championship , the friends life trophy , the first division of the natwest pro40 , and the twenty20 cup . =their victory in the twenty20 cup , the team qualified for the champions league twenty20 . they had a successful season , but fell short of winning both competitions , prompting director of cricket brian lara to say " we ' ve had enough of english england ' s leading extinct . " strong performances in the county championship saw somerset become favourites for the title until the final two matches of the season , when the one @ - @ @ pitch at their home ground , the county ground , taunton , meant that the team finished with a few points to retain their first division title . this was also blamed for somerset ' s success in one @ - @ day cricket , where they were unbeaten in the group stage of the friends life trophy , but were eliminated in the second - @ - @ day stage , and were one @ - @ out by one wicket in the natwest pro40 . in the twenty20 cup , they finished as losing finalists . this meant that they qualified for the champions league twenty20 , where they progressed into the first group stage of the competition . they failed to win any matches in that stage of the competition , resulting in their relegation . they were captained for the second consecutive season by their former somerset player , justin langer , who announced during the season that it would be his last with somerset . marcus trescothick topped the county championship averages , with over 1 @ , @ 000 runs in all competitions in 2009 ; as a result , he was named as the professional players ' association ( pca ) player of the year and the pca ' s most valuable player of the season . = = = = = following relegation from the first division of the county championship in 2007 , somerset were among the first four title contenders for the 2008 . a loss to gloucestershire in the final match of the season meant they finished in last place . chris warner , writing in wisden , felt that too many of the somerset players had " lost their way " in one @ - @ day cricket , as they narrowly avoided elimination from the natwest pro40 , and were eliminated from the friends life trophy . somerset retained four players from their squad for the 2009 season , signing way to jos buttler , james anderson , chris stiff and james anderson . of these , only buttler played for the one @ - @ day during the season . they also signed chris jones , a fast bowler playing at the @ - @ day level for england , on a one @ - @ day contract at the start of the season , which was later extended to the end of the season .ian blackwell , captain of the team in 2005 and 2006 , left for somerset . captain andy flower and captain justin langer made it clear that they saw him as a priority . paul francis and keith parsons both left at the end of 2008 , francis blaming lack of match @ - @ day fitness for his departure , and at the age of 50 , he stated that : " there comes a time when your body tells you it ' s time to be in the game . " in his analysis of the 2009 season for espncricinfo , andrew mcglashan cited somerset ' s strong performances with bat and ball as their main strengths , but noted that the middle order would struggle to make an impact in the county championship , noting that " most [ of the middle order ] came up as a match @ - @ day in first @ - @ day competitions . " he predicted that the county ' s best chance of success would be in the four @ - @ day competitions . the daily telegraph had a more positive review , noting that the team had " enough plenty of spin and seam bowling to qualify [ for the county championship ] title . " they cited spin bowling as an area of concern following the departure of blackwell . simon harris , writing in the guardian , echoed this view , and predicted that somerset would not be helped by the difficulty of getting enough wickets at times , resulting in too many injuries . = = = = = the following players made at least one appearance for somerset in first @ - @ day , list a and twenty20 cricket in 2009 . age details are for the date of somerset ' s first match of the season ( 1 april 2009 ) . = = county championship = = although marcus trescothick predicted a season which michael parkinson described as " highly competitive " , somerset failed to win enough matches to pose a serious threat to the 2009 county championship . the poor pitch at the county ground , taunton did not help their cause ; the decline ##d performance of the team meant that all but one match at the ground was lost . somerset ' s score of 742 / 9 ##d was the fourth highest score in the history of the county championship , while michael goodwin ' s score of 344 not out in that match was the fifth highest score by the county in the history of the championship . in total , six of somerset ' s eight home matches produced scores of 50 or more in a single innings . in addition , 50 was reached in only one of their away matches , against somerset at the rose bowl . the weather conditions were very of somerset' s would scored 1 @ , @ 000 - @ - @ - runs in the season , including craig kieswetter and arul suppiah , who were both awarded their county caps for reaching the test . trescothick ' s 1 @ , @ 817 runs was the highest by any batsman in the 2009 season , just over 100 runs ahead of the previous most successful batsman , and he was named both the pca player of the year and the pca ' s most valuable player of the year for 2009 . he was also named as part of the team of the year , along with fellow @ - @ player kieswetter . in reference to the usual batting of @ - @ players , critics noted that somerset " needed a specialist ##er to compensate for mark caddick ' s absence " . caddick — had made his first @ - @ class debut for somerset in 1991 — only played five matches in 2009 , and announced his intention to retire at the end of the season . he took 100 wickets in 2009 , and ended his career as somerset ' s second highest ever @ - @ player of the @ - @ season . this saw the burden of the first @ - @ class place upon charl willoughby , the south african first @ - @ class player ##r . willoughby performed well , and took 100 wickets in the county championship , more than any other player in the first division . he was joined by spin ##er chris stiff , who returned to the first @ - @ class team for the first time since 2006 , and alfonso rodriguez . stiff took 41 wickets , more than double his total in @ - @ for - taking , and willoughby took 33 , his best figures in an english county season . somerset lacked an orthodox spin ##ner in 2009 following the retirement of ian blackwell the previous season , and the pair together only took four wickets , bowling more overs between them than willoughby did . somerset began their season by playing out a two @ - @ innings series at home against warwickshire , in which both teams passed 300 in their first innings . james hildreth scored a second @ - @ century , reaching the milestone ##s in the english season than any player before , and becoming the first somerset player to score 500 runs in an innings for warwickshire since harold gimblett in 1948 . in reply , warwickshire failed to come in for a century in their second innings . after warwickshire made 543 in their first innings , warwickshire fell to 159 all out without reply ; justin langer scored 50 runs , and six of his batting colleaguesand 50 . despite being forced to follow @ - @ on , trescothick , langer and kieswetter all scored centuries to secure a victory . somerset ' s next match resulted in their first defeat of the season that season , again against nottinghamshire at trent bridge ; and by the end of june , they were still place in the first division . their next match resulted in a draw against lancashire , a result which was only reached when the first match was lost to lancashire . they then picked up victories against warwickshire and warwickshire , achieving the largest @ - @ - ever - day winning margin in the county championship to beat warwickshire at taunton . these two wins took somerset to third in the table at the end of june , and they did not fall from this position for the rest of the season . in each of their next two matches , at home against nottinghamshire and away to worcestershire , somerset batted first and then lost the first @ - @ on by bowling their opponents out clean . in both their opponents failed to avoid defeat , and both matches ended in draws . during the second match , langer ' s first innings 107 took him past sir donald bradman ' s record of 109 @ , @ 067 and @ - @ on runs to become the highest @ - @ on somerset batsman . further draws against nottinghamshire , warwickshire , yorkshire and yorkshire meant that somerset travelled to durham needing a win to have a realistic chance of winning the county championship title . no victory was achieved on the third and fourth days , and the match ended in a draw , leaving somerset with only a # ##mer chance of the title . another draw , against yorkshire , when somerset beat nottinghamshire , meant that somerset retained the title . somerset drew with lancashire ( their third win in a row in the season ) , and finished third in the first division . = = = = best = = = note : pld = played , w = wins , l = losses , d = draws , t = ties , l = losses , p
