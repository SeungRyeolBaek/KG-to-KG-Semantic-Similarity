= zhou tong ( [UNK] ) = zhou ( or jow ) tong ( chinese : [UNK] 同 and [UNK] [UNK] ; pinyin : zhou tong ) ( died after 1121 ad ) was the archery master and chief martial arts instructor of the song dynasty general yue fei . originally a folk hero from henan , he was appointed to oversee yue fei ' s archery training in song . the general had already mastered spearplay from his archery training . in addition to the famous general , he had several generals as his students . during his lifetime , he taught the boy many of his skills and also gifted him with his two favorite weapons because he was his favorite archer . after zhou ' s death , yue would often visit his grave once a year and offer animal sacrifices that far exceeded that required for his archery training . he also taught what he had learned from zhou to his sons and they were successful in learning . with the publication of yue fei ' s 17th century novel , the life of yue fei ( 1684 ) , a new chinese character zhou tong appeared , which differed greatly from his original counterpart . not only was he originally from shaanxi ; but he was yue ' s adoptive father , a renowned archer with knowledge of the five arts of archery , and his given name was replaced with a different , but similar , chinese character . the novel ' s plot portrays him as an elderly archer and martial arts teacher who counted li chong and li junyi , two of the famous 108 immortals on which the water margin is based , among his many students . a chinese traditional folk tale by the yangzhou poet wang shaotang not only adds the latter to this list , but describes him as @ - @ - @ man with great courage . the tale also gives him the nickname " iron fist " , which he shares with the poem @ - @ ray @ - @ by cai fu , and with the outlaw zhou zhishen his sworn brother . because of his association with the latter , he is often confused with the similarly named general zhou tong . various wuxia legends and folk tales have associated him with various types of weapons and martial arts . these range from that of the spear , double bow , and double swords to that of wudang , qigong and even the @ - @ x ##gun . members of dragon clan , chuojiao and xingyi also include him in their oral histories because of his association with yue fei , the direct founder of these arts . he is also linked to thepraying monk , via wang chong and yan yu . wang shaotang ' s biography also mentions him as a member of the five hundred archery . however , the official historical record that bears his name only mentions he taught archery to yue fei . nothing was ever written about him practicing or teaching any specific style of the martial arts . zhou has appeared in various forms of literature such as novels , comic books , and poetry . his late 13th century novel , iron fist , iron horse , serves as a precursor to the biography of yue fei because it describes his life just prior to taking over as his successor . this was later adapted into a three volume lianhuanhua ##ng book . he also appears in a story about one of his two martial arts schools . zhou was portrayed by three different actors in a series of black and white yue fei films made in the 1940s and 1950s , one of which featured a sword @ - @ - @ - @ with sammo hung in the lead . the martial arts actor yu chenghui , who played the sword @ - @ - zhou in wu ##xia ' s shaolin temple , said in a 2005 interview that he had always wanted to play zhou in a film . = = = = = = = = = = his family tree = = = on his death , yue fei ' s third son yue yi ( [UNK] [UNK] , died 1130 ) commissioned his fourth son , the poet and scholar yue ke ( [UNK] [UNK] , 1183 – post @ - @ 1240 ) , to write yue fei ' s biography . this 10 @ - @ year work was begun in 1203 , about ten years after the latter ' s early death , but was not published until 1234 . it was later completed in 1345 and published in the yuan dynasty ' s the red book of the yuan dynasty under the title yue fei biography ( volume 365 , page 124 ) . zhou ' s role in yue ke ' s biography is also briefly mentioned in the 2002 film . it says , " he [ yue fei ] learned everything from master tong . he knew everything and could shoot with his left and right hands . after tong ' s death , he would offer speeches at his funeral " . george washington university english professor david kaplan says zhou was a " local hero " ( [UNK] - " hero ( hero ) " ) . he says he can also mean " a ' noble man ' in political terms , or in military terms , ' hero and warrior . ' " this means he was a ' noblefrom tangyin county , anyang prefecture , henan province ( the same county as yue fei ) . historical and literary sources give his given name [UNK] 同 ( tong ) , meaning " archer , archer " . this differs from the one given in other sources , which can be further explained later . thus , " [UNK] 同 " means the great archer . = = = = = = = = being poor , giving him a chance to become a soldier , young yue fei chose the military career because there had never been any mention of martial @ - @ - chinese military officers in his family history . he would stay up all night reading military history books and studying such famous military figures as xiang yu . however , the yao family was far too poor to afford archery lessons for their sons , so , yao dewang , the boy ' s maternal grandfather , sent chen guang ( [UNK] 广 ) to teach the young @ - @ - @ - @ - how to shoot the long ##bow . yao was very pleased when his son had mastered the weapon by the age of eight . chen was then brought in to oversee zhou ' s archery training in henan . dr . kaplan describes zhou as the " most brilliant " of the early generations . a section of the jin tuo xu pian , the first volume of sima ke ' s posthumously published biography , describes some of zhou ' s archery lessons and states that he took his sons as his pupils : " one day , [ [UNK] ] t ' ung took his children for an archery lesson and to prove his skill shot two arrows in succession into the middle of the target . pointing to the arrow to his grandfather [ yue fei ] , he said : ' if you can shoot like this , you can prove you are an archer ' . grandfather , approached him and asked to be allowed to practice . he drew his bow , let fly his arrow and caught the end of t ' ung ' s arrow . he shot again and shot into the target . t ' ung was very impressed and he showed to grandfather his two new arrows . then he practiced even more [ until ] he was able to shoot to the left and right , while letting fly the arrows as he went . when he became a general he taught this to his officers and soldiers so that his entire army was adept at shooting to the left and right and he used this skill to penetrate the enemy ' s ranks " . the same section of the biography is similar to one from the song era biography of li ji , author of song .but instead of teaching them his archery technique , it seems he taught what he had learned from zhou to his students who were killed in battle . = = = = = = = zhou continued to teach the technique until his death , leading to yue ' s eventual death . after his death , yue became increasingly depressed since zhou had had the greatest influence on his own life . zhou ' s son would reportedly visit his grave on the first and fifteenth of the month with offerings of meat and wine and would shoot three arrows in combination with one of the three arrows his teacher had presented him with ( it is not known whether any of zhou ' s other former students came to visit his grave ) . dr . kaplan believes this " public display of mourning " went far beyond the standards set for such a " great teacher " . german historian hellmut wilhelm argues that while the act of mourning was significant , it was merely a means of spreading the image of his false teacher and " [ putting himself ] in the public eye " . zhou ' s son later followed him back to zhou ' s tomb , confronting him during an argument over his inappropriate behavior . there , he watched him perform the traditional ritual of the meat , wine , and three arrows . when he finally confronted him , the latter stated that " his admiration for zhou ' s teaching could not be accounted for by the traditional first and fifteenth of the month , and so he . . . shot down the three arrows to show that zhou had been the source of his success as an archer " . dr . kaplan ' s believes this occurred just prior to zhou ' s entry into the military and that the whole event served as a metaphor for yue ' s " transformation into an archer " . the author of the wumu dates the burial at zhou ' s tomb as in 1121 when he was seventeen , although he would have been born earlier that year since he was born on " the fifteenth day of the first month of 1103 " . the author of the primary chronicle however suggests a xusui age frame , in which a person is born exactly one year old at birth . since zhou entered the military shortly after zhou ' s death , a different time ##frame can be used for when he died . during the early months of 1122 , the song dynasty sent its military forces to assist the jurchen in fighting their common enemy , the jin dynasty . however , it appears that zhou died in late 1121 , before the call to arms was issued . == = = = zhou tong ' s early life story can be put together from two novels : the story of yue fei and iron arm , golden sabre . the story of yue fei is a fictional account of yue fei ' s early life , military career , and death . it was written by a native of renhuo named qian cai ( [UNK] [UNK] ) , who lived sometime between the reigns of the kangxi and qianlong emperors of the qing dynasty . the author dates the novel ' s publication to 1684 . it was considered a fabrication by the qing government and banned during the qianlong era . in the novel , zhou is portrayed as an elderly man and yue ' s first martial arts instructor . the emperor ' s favorite assassin , li guang is also present . zhou taught yue fei and his younger brothers martial and fighting skills from age one to ten , until his death . at the beginning of his novel , qian cai used a different character when writing zhou ' s pen name . instead of the original character meaning " great " , it was changed to [UNK] , meaning " rude , rude " . thus , " [UNK] [UNK] " became zhou ' s first public persona . this character has since been carried over into many chinese martial arts books . iron arm , golden sabre was written by wang yun heng and xiao yun , and published in 1986 . this novel , which serves as zhou ' s first published work , is a prequel to the story of yue fei because it covers his life immediately prior to accepting yue fei as his student . it covers his life as a young martial arts instructor in the qing dynasty ' s imperial guard , his campaigns against the xixia and the # ##i tribes and his defeat of water margin outlaws . the first five chapters contain the material from the five chapters that first appeared in the story of yue fei . this was later adapted into a [UNK] - lianhuanhua @ - @ - comic book titled the story of zhou tong in 1987 . = = = = life and death = = = zhou was born in shaanxi and trained in the martial arts from a young age . he is known as one of the students of shaolin master tan zhengfang ( [UNK] 正 [UNK] ) and , learning the very basics of shaolin kungfu , becomes interested in things both literary and martial . tan ' s other students include the famous poets jin shi ( 金 [UNK] ) and zong ze ( 宗 [UNK] ) and the famous water margin outlaws zhang yi and luan tingyu. as a young man , zhou catches the eye of general bao zheng and serves in the court as an officer . his parents take notice of his martial skill when he helps his fellow general jin ##shi liao jin conquer northern china and hire him as a teacher at the capital palace martial arts school . the school has three official posts , in order of rank : " emperor , " " heaven , " and " heaven . " since he has the greatest skill , zhou takes the top position . he uses this skill and his friendship with sun zong to get their friend sun quan appointed as the commander of defense of dengzhou . he later becomes an officer under chao gai and helps defeat the rival zhu ##ang , and learns martial arts from his teacher luan tingyu . as he grows older , he becomes dissatisfied with himself because the song dynasty prefers to honor the common chinese people instead of fighting against them . he eventually devoted himself entirely to his martial arts , and learns several new and improved styles : the " twelve swords , twelve s ##s ##s " , which is a form of shaolin fanzi style , and the " zhou tong style . " zhou makes a great effort to improve his martial skills while teaching at the capital martial arts school and eventually recruits two students : " golden tiger " lu junyi and " dragon tiger " lin chong . lu junyi is a man with large land holdings and does not hold office , so lin chong inherited lu ' s estate upon his death , and continues to serve as the martial instructor for the 800 @ , @ 000 soldiers of the song dynasty ' s imperial guard . during this time , zhou tong also recruits an additional student , wu song . wu song is famous for killing a 100 @ - @ 000 man with his bare hands and is serving as county magistrate in his native shandong . the county magistrate wu guoqin then sends him on a mission to kaifeng with a special ear ##piece in order to curry favor with the officials . during his stay in the city , wu makes the acquaintance of zhou . zhou finds wu to be a man of great character , but feels that wu lacks confidence in his martial skills and , therefore , demands money for wu ' s training . however , these two men only meet for a mere two years before wu decides to return home , never to see zhou again . upon his return , zhou serves for a time as an advisor to general liu guangshi ( 劉 光 世 ) , whose troops are stationed in henan .. . he eventually becomes an outlaw himself when he loses the battle of the water dragon and is forced to flee from imperial china . later , zhou learns his old friend jin yu was sentenced to death and returns to shaolin ( where the latter has become a buddhist monk after the death of his father ) to pay his last respects . as the last of jin ' s followers , jin encourages zhou to find a suitable teacher to pass on all of his martial arts knowledge to . however , this opportunity is cut short when the children return him to shaolin . zhou returns to pine tree village and lives in poverty for years before being invited by his old friend wang ming ( 王 明 ) to teach the children of the wang family in his school . = = = = training and experience = = = one day , zhou surprises the children with a mysterious note and leaves the room to meet with his servant . wang ' s servant , wang ming ( 王 [UNK] ) , tricks their master ' s son , wang fei , into completing their task while they are out to work . after successfully completing the task at work , yue writes a long poem on a nearby wall and signs it with his name . the children all rush into the room upon hearing of yue ' s unexpected arrival and allow him to escape in order to avoid capture . the school master then reads the note and , after laughing at yue ' s miraculous escape , tells zhou to summon his mother , fu yao ( [UNK] 夫 人 ) , for an important meeting . with the entire wang family gathered in the dining hall , zhou asks the mother for her blessing to accept the boy as his own son and heir . she agrees and zhou takes his place amongst zhou ' s students the next day . because zhou believes he is right , he encourages the young boys to become his brothers . zhou then decides to teach them one of the four arts of war . several months later , zhou takes the children to visit his old friend , the abbot of a local buddhist temple called the " hill of dripping water " . - @ - @ - @ - @ - zhou goes to the temple and finds the " hill of dripping water " , on which resides a legendary dragon . when it comes at him , he runs to the side and pulls on its tail with his wooden spear , causing it to transform into an 18 @ - @ - @ - @ - ( 18 @ . @ - [UNK] ) , 18 @ - @ - sword called the " great spear of dripping water " . when they reach it ,zhou begins to train all of his sons in the martial arts — the use of sword , spear , and year @ - @ to @ - @ hand grenade . after two months of training , zhou enters them into a mock archery tournament at tangyin in which year @ - @ to @ - @ year ##n wins first place by firing a volley of eight arrows into the bullseye of a cannon a hundred and fifty meters away . after his display of skill , he is persuaded to marry the daughter of li chun ( 李 春 ) , an old friend of zhou ' s and the local magistrate who presided over the imperial examination . father and son then return home to their families . zhou then writes out the marriage contract and sends a messenger to deliver the document to li fei at the palace . zhou and yue set out at dawn and travel back to tangyin to thank the magistrate for his hospitality and hospitality . later , li prepares a large feast for them , but when food is laid out for any visitors that might have disturbed them , li notices that they have traveled on foot without food . li offers to have li buy from them one of his breeds of horse because an ambitious young man needs a good meal . after finishing their meal , zhou and yue meet li once again and leave tangyin to return home . during their journey , li suggests that yue ride the horse to test its endurance . yue runs the horse , with li in pursuit . when they reach the village again , the two separate and zhou returns to his house where he grows tired from the journey and uses his silk garments to dry himself . then he suddenly falls ill and is hospitalized for several days . as the narrator describes his death and burial : " . . . his blood dried up and he died . this was on the seventh day of the seventh month of the seventh year of the reign of xuan he , and his age was seventy @ - @ . . . . monks and buddhist monks were invited to pray and offer prayers , for seven and seven , for seventy @ - @ seven years . then the body was taken away to be buried beside the well of pure water " . zhou stays in a building beside his house for the night and in the first lunar month of the seventh year , his imperial guards arrive and burn the house down , forcing him to return home and take care of his family . the actual burial date is not only disputed because the story is legendary , but also because the xuan he reign period of emperor huizong was only nine years( 1119 – 1125 ) and is married . although the story of yue fei says zhou died long before he took a wife , he actually died before he married . it is possible that the same author created this chinese character . = = = = = = = according to the story of yue fei , zhou was born with a son . but he says that his " old son " died and his " young son " was killed in battle against the song before joining with the general li junyi to fight in the war . in the story of zhou tong , his daughter is named meng cuiying ( [UNK] [UNK] 英 ) and his son is named zhou yunqing ( [UNK] [UNK] 清 ) . zhou challenges meng to a traditional tai chi fighting match and takes her as his wife . but she is soon after kidnapped by the buddhist monks of the great dragon temple . both zhou and meng easily defeat the monks with their superior martial skills and they meet at the miaochuan mountain in hubei province . zhou yunqing first appears as a drunken , blind old man who rides his horse into the midst of enemy forces with a long sword . he later dies in battle against the song army . after his son ' s death , zhou goes to the xiangguo river for a long mountain walk . he then names the @ - @ year @ - @ young yue fei as his adopted son and rightful heir , after the latter ' s father drowned in a sudden flood : " i believe that he [ yue fei ] is beautiful and talented and i , the old man , want to take him as my adopted son . . . i can change neither his name nor his appearance . i only want him to call himself zhou , so that he can safely teach all the things i have learned in my life to a new generation . then , when i die , all he has to do is to bury my old books in the river and not allow them to be buried , and that is that " . however , in the accounts from the story of yue fei and the account of zhou ' s life from the year @ - @ year book 1 of the southern song dynasty : the story of emperor wu ( 大 [UNK] 中 [UNK] [UNK] 王 [UNK] ) , literary critic c . h . hsia wrote " that his son did not [ zhou ] drown in the flood and that , although yueh fei had a high regard for the works of his father wu ch ' ung 同 ( [UNK] [UNK] ) , the latter could not read his works[UNK] " . the story of the wu song was one of the first of several " sky novels " ( or historical stories ) written by writers during the ming dynasty , most of which followed the story of yue fei . despite the popularity of historical fiction , xiong damu ( died 1552 ) , the author of the the story of yue fei , relied heavily on traditional sources like zhu xi ' e ( 1130 – 1200 ) , and illustrations based on the t ' ung @ - @ chien , li ke ' s family tree , and the ming dynasty ' s official yue fei himself to tell his story . thus , the story of yue fei was the first sky @ - @ blue historical novel to follow the modern trend . = = = image and description = = = zhou is often portrayed as a tall military man with a strong personality . a contemporary account by the yangzhou scholar wang shaotang ( 1889 – 1968 ) , whom the historian vibeke børdahl called " the greatest master of this [ the 16th ] century " , describes him thus , " he lived to the age of sixty , he was more than forty , and standing , he was over seven feet . his face had a fair complexion , thick eyebrows , a pair of blue eyes , a round nose shape , a strong jaw , a pair of pointed ears , and on his head there were two locks of hair , a long beard . on his head he wore a sky @ - @ blue silk cap , and he was dressed in a long sky @ - @ blue silk robe with a white collar , a pair of long silk trousers without sleeves and blue shoes with pointed toes " . military and military men with a tall height are a common theme in chinese folklore . for example , his master wu song is said to be over seven feet tall in the chinese folklore . in the story of yue fei , the master successfully competes with two young men competing for a place in a military academy ; one is six feet tall and the other is seven feet tall . the biography of the chinese writer zhang daoling says he is over seven feet tall . when he is mentioned in " yangzhou storytelling " , he is in " square mouth public talk " , which is a style of speaking reserved for great heroes , highly regarded people , and , occasionally , for characters that claim to be an actual hero . square mouth public talk is also useduse of two forms of dialogue : fangkou and guanbai . fangkou ( square mouth ) is a style of speaking , or speaking , form of dialogue that is heavily influenced by han chinese culture . guanbai ( square mouth ) is speech and dialogue that is primarily used for " great ##ness " . this combination of styles means zhou tong is portrayed as a highly successful businessman . in her study of yangzhou storytelling , børdahl notes that the main story of zhou and wu " uses two forms of dialogue for the characters . wu speaks square mouth using high tones without rusheng ( or double stops ) . on the contrary , zhou speaks squaremouth using the yangzhou dialogue system , which does include rusheng " . therefore , she suggests " square mouth " should at least be divided into two subcategories , namely the wu song variant — without rusheng , and the zhou tong variant — with rusheng " . = = = = = = = = = = = water margin = = = = = the water margin ( c . 1400 ) is a ming dynasty short story about one hundred and fifty - @ - @ - @ - @ men and women who band together to fight against the southern song imperial government . wang chong and li junyi , two of these men , are also mentioned as among zhou ' s previous students in the story of yue fei . they are not mentioned in the main story , however , since they were killed by " corrupt officials " prior to zhou becoming head of the wang clan . more importantly , the outlaws are not among his previous students since they are fictional characters . zhou ' s role as their teacher is related to a long tradition in chinese literature where tang and song dynasty heroes studied with a " celestial teacher " , usually a male teacher , prior to their military service . y . c . hsia says the source from which all the hero stories are derived is guiguzi , one of the military heroes sun ce and sun juan , from the song and the later part of the spring and autumn period of the three kingdoms ( [UNK] 國 春 秋 後 [UNK] ) . hsia goes on to say that qian cai , zhou ' s celestial teacher , identifies zhou with the teacher because " all good teachers [ in the military romance ##s ] are celestials " with at least two sons . but in rejecting this interpretation , qian follows the same principle of " celestial teacher " since zhou is identified as the teacher , and his students are the##s of wu ( lin and lu ) and the mythical giant yue ( yue fei ) . although lin and lu have been linked to wu since the late han dynasty , wu song did not become acquainted with him until wang shaotang wrote a 20th @ - @ century story in which the two meet in kaifeng . the story takes place during wu ' s visit to kaifeng , shortly before the arrival of his sworn brother wu dalang . wu teaches wu the " iron shirt " style of fighting during the latter ' s two @ - @ month stay in the forbidden city . this story is part one of wang ' s " five stories of wu song " storytelling series , which was first collected and published in the anthology wu song in 1959 . it also carries over into the story of iron arm , golden sabre and , later , the story of zhou tong . in the latter story , wu song learns chuo - ji from zhou during his two month stay in the city . wang ' s story portrays him as an eccentric wandering swordmaster with " a voice sounding like thunder " in the mountainous region of jianghu . he is also the sworn brother of the legendary " great warrior " lu zhishen , a military officer @ - @ turned @ - @ buddhist monk , and is , according to hsia , " among the most important characters of the water margin . wu is also given the nickname " iron arm " ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) , which carries over into the narrative of his later story iron arm , golden sabre . although the story fails to explain the reason for the nickname , it does explain wu ' s inability to attach his sword to any part of his body to make it difficult not to use the " iron shirt " style of a martial artist . additionally , he shares the same name with cai fu , an officer @ - @ turned @ - @ , known for his skill of wielding a long sword . because of his association with these two , he is often confused with the similarly named legendary " great warrior " zhou tong . in the water margin , this zhou tong is a feudal lord of the forbidden land whom lu zhishen kills for trying to secretly marry the daughter of the liu family . he dies brutally by the hands of liu tianrun , an officer in the imperial army of . ##cheng . however , the confusion between the character ' s is based solely on the phonetic pronunciation of their names . = = = = yue fei = = = = the story of yue fei comments lu jun##yi is zhou ' s first student prior to creating the sword @ - @ to @ - @ , yue fei and his three young @ - @ students wang gui , tang huai ( [UNK] [UNK] ) and zhang zhang ( 張 [UNK] ) . he teaches them literary and military matters on odd and odd occasions . the book says he is trained in all sorts of " literary and military matters " and he learns the art of ji and hook . after he learns his " great art of cold steel " , he trains each of his students in the four arts of warfare , and each begins with one in particular ; yue fei and tang huai , the sword ; zhang zhang , the spear @ - @ the hook and wang gui , the yanyue dao . all of them learn the art of archery in secret . all of these and their descendants are mentioned in yue ke ' s autobiography as being his father ' s close childhood friends , but they are not mentioned as being yue ' s ancestors . books written by the @ - @ chinese martial artists make various claims that are not consistent with historical fact or with historical context . for example , internalist lee jwing @ - @ day says zhou was a monk who studied martial arts at the shaolin temple and who took yue as his student . the young yue worked as a tenant farmer for the military @ - @ general han qi ( [UNK] [UNK] , 1008 – 1075 ) . during this time , he learned all manners of military tactics , horse ##manship , and sword @ - @ to @ - @ hand boxing . the monk later created xingyi and eagle claw boxing from his internal and external training with yue . however , evidence varies . david shahar notes that these fighting arts did not appear at shaolin until the late ming dynasty . he also notes that yue ke himself and ming dynasty historians say xingyi was created hundreds of years before the birth of yue by a spearplayer named han jike ( d . 1651 ) . in fact , the name of han qi in the book is a historical fact since he lived over 100 years before yue ' s birth . he had worked as a tenant farmer and instructor for soldiers of han qi in 1124 before joining the army upon the death of his father in late 1122 , but he learned from him long before this time . eagle claw boxers leung shum and david lau say " jow tong " ( the cantonese pronunciation of his name ) was the person who taught young yue tothe shaolin monastery and taught him a number of hand techniques , which he later used to create his ying kuen ( dragon fist ) . liang shouyu and practitioners of emei dapeng qigong believe he studied under zhou as a child and rose to become zhou ' s military general at an early age . their own account says zhou then introduced him to a " great hermit " who taught him said qigong techniques . the chinese chan master yuen mankai believes zhou taught him the " same school " of martial arts as he taught his golden fist , and that the latter called the inventor of the praying dragon claw " self - strengthening [ his ] fist " . although martial arts scholar peter henning notes that zhou ' s biographies do not mention yue , he says " he [ zhou ] almost certainly did learn a bit of chinese hand boxing " to prepare for his military career . but he does not say who he may have learned boxing from . = = = martial arts = = = there is no historical evidence to support the claim zhou had formal training in boxing . chinese sources never even mention zhou or his boxing . despite this , the wuxia legends and folk tales have attributed many other supernatural and magical skills to zhou . these range from that of the sword , double swords and the spear to that of wudang , qigong , chuojiao , and even the @ - @ of boxing . wang shaotang ' s biography also mentions him as a member of the eight dragon order . he may also be connected to these martial arts through his biographies and his teachings . practitioners of dragon fist , chuojiao and xingyi also include him in their # ##s because of his association with yue fei , the direct founder of these arts . yuen mankai believes zhou taught lin chong and lu junyi the " original school " of martial arts that was later combined with several other schools to create dragon fist . this list of eighteen masters refers to an early @ - @ chinese martial arts text that describes the gathering of eighteen masters at the shaolin monastery that allegedly took place during the early years of the song dynasty . lin chong and yan qing are listed as two of the eighteen masters invited , which means their schools of boxing , archery and unarmed combat are listed as two separate schools , instead of one . thus wu - chan boxing was established during the song dynasty , and was probably taught by these two masters from the beginning . he also considers lu junyi and yan qing the two mastersclaims that he learned from him . very few references are made to the man who first taught the arts to him . in the legend of zhou tong , zhou learned as a child from a shaolin monk named zhou zhengfang . practitioners of chuojiao claim he learned the art from its founder , a chinese monk named deng liang . practitioners of geok - kuen , a style similar to yue fei , claim he studied from li jing , a " great general " from shaanxi . = = = = culture = = zhou has appeared in various forms of media including novels , comic books , and films . aside from the legend of yue fei and iron fist , golden sabre , zhou appears in a series based on his older martial arts teacher , jin yong . this modern graphic adaptation of the legend of yue fei , removes the historical elements from the story and places it in a modern setting . instead of traveling from henan to hubei to conquer china , zhou travels from shaanxi to kaifeng city in henan to visit an old friend who has been promoted to general . while en route to the capital city , zhou makes note of a severe famine in the city and also hears rumors of the city turning to stone . however , when zhou arrives in kaifeng , he finds the government is spending money on the construction of new stone palaces , the court officials cai jing and wang jing have expensive tastes , and believe that the generals are promoted because they are holding high government positions . upon meeting his friend , zhou is shocked to find him in stocks and bonds and being escorted to the far east of china by palace guards . he also learns that the general has already killed several court officials and was sentenced to perpetual exile on various cover up charges . despite having little or no experience , zhou decides to visit wang mansion in hubei ( now in henan ) and become the abbot ' s apprentice . a major difference in the story takes place when zhou goes with his other disciples to visit his friend the abbot . instead of yue going to the wall to fight the giant dragon , zhou stays with wang and the abbot , while the other disciples go outside to investigate . zhou watches as the abbot tests zhou ' s skills by asking him to remove an ornate @ @ - @ - @ copper statue dating from the tang dynasty . the abbot then removes the wooden floor sculpture and presents the monk with a small book on military tactics . he goes on to tell zhou how he was once agreat warrior who participated in battles against the song and western xia dynasties , he became a hermit after the king refused to become a vassal of his kingdom . he eventually makes a name for himself by teaching martial arts to people from the mountain villages . since he has no sword of his own , the king presents him with his own legendary sword and trains him in the proper use of the weapon . zhou initially refuses the sword at first , but allows yue to use it out of gratitude . a modern chinese film also tells the story involving zhou . in the first , zhou is the head of the wang estate , but , when news of his success causes many families to send their sons to learn from him , zhou is forced to teach all of these students on a regular basis . zhou eventually accepts his sons ' sons as his martial students and yue as his " apprentice " . years later , zhou tells his three young students not to follow the buddhist teachings , but to teach them his training techniques in the mountain village . zhou causes trouble when his three students decide to leave the village and sets out to find them , only to be attacked by a giant beast . after killing the beast with his sword , yue finds a mysterious metal object in a cave and comes back to zhou . during their journey , zhou becomes ill from exposure to the cold night air on the return journey , and dies soon after . instead of burying him , some of his friends stand beside his grave for a short period of one hundred years before returning home to their families . these events take place three years after zhou had died . the story of yue fei . stories like these have also been adapted to film . the public school system of hong kong teaches students the importance of mentorship by having them learn about the special teacher @ - @ - relationship between zhou and yue . a short story called " yue fei short story " in children ' s literature , a monthly magazine written for children aged two to seven , describes how the lessons are only made possible via hard practice . the story describes how young yue happens upon zhou ' s study techniques in the mountain village while exploring wild animals . yue wants to become a teacher , but zhou tells him he should instead practice the role of the " teacher @ - @ - student " by looking into the setting sun to improve his skills . after hours of hard practice , he is able to see a lone bird flying off into the distance and seeing it through a window and into the forest . heand he names him as his apprentice and adopted son . under his guidance , dillon is able to master the great art of archery and to catch a falling arrow from a @ - @ 100 meters distance . he is mentioned several times in director john liparulo ' s the assassins ( 2009 ) . zhou tong is mentioned in chapter fifty during a conversation between the main character andrew " andy " wong , a detective intent on stopping the evil plans of a mysterious man , and his wife ' s adopted son dillon , an archery instructor . when andy asks him if he has ever heard of the famous @ - @ year @ - @ turned @ - @ actor howard hill , dillon replies : " i don ' t think so . . . you told me about zhou tong " . andy then replies : " oh , yes . zhou tong was something . in the song dynasty to be the best of archers in china . and howard hill [ was the champion ] " . later in chapter fifty , when dillon is investigating a murder at an airport , a page goes out on the internet asking for a " mr . zhou tong " . when the page goes out again , dillon says : " zhou tong had been a famous archery champion and martial arts instructor in the song dynasty . [ dillon and i ] had many long conversations about him , because of tong ' s knowledge of archery , and his @ - @ knowledge . he was an inspiration to [ dillon ] . dillon always wanted that and wanted to know everything about him " . dillon then realizes that the page seems to have been sent by dillon ' s wife laura to get his attention . the page was sent to warn him of a trap , but dillon realizes it too late . other actors who have portrayed zhou in film ' s from the 1950s and 1960s include wong sau nin , wu jing , and jing wei bo . jing starred alongside top star @ - @ turned @ - @ actor sammo hung , who portrayed master yue fei . the martial arts actor yu chenghui , who played the champion @ - @ year @ in jet li ' s shaolin monks , said in a 2005 television interview that he only grew his own beard , possibly at the request of the actor , because he wanted to play zhou in a hollywood film . yu went on to say " he was an extremely famous archer from the song and southern song dynasties and many famous dragon students were his students . this man was very good in the martial arts and many people want to see him in films ".
