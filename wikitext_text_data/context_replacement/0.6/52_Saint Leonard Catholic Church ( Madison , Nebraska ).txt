when it was completed , a porch was added between them , increasing the church ' s seating capacity to 200 . the church on the new site was dedicated in june 1898 . == = 1900 – 1913 = = = in the early 20th century , the sisters decided that the old church should be remodelled into a school and a convent for the nuns , and that a new church should be built . father joseph darscheid , a franciscan friar , drew up plans for the church ;

by 2010 , the percentage had increased to 4 % . in the city of omaha , whose single largest employer is a food plant with over 400 employees , operated by ibp and owned by kraft foods , the impact was even greater : the hispanic percentage of the population increased from less than 1 % in 1980 to 4 @ . @ . % in 2010 , as the spanish @ - @ hispanic population increased and the hispanic english @ - @ hispanic population decreased . in 2011 , an estimated two @ - @ percent of st . leonard ' s residents were hispanic . beginning in 1991 , the parish assigned two @ - @ speaking priests to the parish , and both english - and spanish @ - @ speaking services were held . the centennial of the church building was celebrated in may 2013 , with a dedication service celebrated by elden ryan , archbishop emeritus of the archdiocese of omaha . = = architecture = = in 1989 , three of the church ' s buildings — the church , the rectory , and the church ' s cemetery — were added to the national register of historic places , for the work of noted nebraska architect william h . nachtigall . beside st . leonard ' s , nachtigall designed a number of other church buildings in nebraska , most of them churches ;
