= hurricane omar ( 2008 ) = hurricane omar was a major hurricane that took an unusual southwest to northeast track across the eastern caribbean sea during october , 2008 . forming out of a tropical wave on october 13 , omar initially moved westward in the eastern caribbean sea . on october 15 , omar began to rapidly organize as deep convection developed around the center of circulation . later that day , an eye developed and the storm began to curve to the northwest . early on october 16 , omar reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 958 mbar ( hpa ; 15 @ . @ . inhg ) . shortly thereafter , the storm rapidly intensified to category 4 intensity . after undergoing a @ - @ analysis the next day , omar weakened to a tropical depression before weakening into a - @ - @ convective low pressure area . the remnants of omar persisted until october 17 at which time it dissipated to the east of the azores . in the eastern caribbean , omar affected several islands , most of which only sustained minor damage . high waves and heavy rainfall affected the cayman islands . antigua and barbados sustained $ 1 million in damage , primarily to agriculture . nine homes were destroyed , many others damaged and many others were inundated by flood waters . one person died in puerto rico after suffering a - @ - @ level cardiac arrest . the united states virgin islands also sustained significant damage , totaling over $ 10 million . several homes and ships were damaged and over 100 power lines were downed . total damages from the hurricane were estimated at $ 100 million . = = meteorological research = = on september 30 , a - @ - @ level tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa and entered the atlantic ocean . deep convection developed around a broad - @ - @ level circulation as it moved towards the northwest . however , the wave dissipated on october 12 before entering the caribbean sea a day later . upon entering the caribbean sea , convection and wind activity increased around the system . further development occurred and the system was classified as tropical depression eleven at 0600 utc on october 13 while located about 190 mi ( 305 km ) east of the southern tip of the dominican republic . the initial slow forward motion that the depression began across the atlantic ocean as it entered an area of weak steering currents and forward motion was not resumed for a day or two . as the condition of the system improved , it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the national hurricane center ( nhc ) gave it the name omar . moving to the southeastof a broad and deep tropospheric circulation and to the east of a low to mid @ - @ level ridge , omar began a mid @ - @ level turn on october 14 . upon becoming a tropical storm , omar began to undergo an initial phase of rapid strengthening as more deep convection developed around the center of circulation . wind shear around the center , which was previously preventing further development , increased , allowing for rapid strengthening . later that day , an 11 @ . @ . to 17 @ . @ 50 mi ( 11 @ . @ . to 19 @ . @ 50 km ) wide eye developed as the storm began to move towards the west due to the ridge . with the development of the eye , the satellite technique produced an intensity of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , indicating that omar had intensified into a hurricane . the storm briefly stalled as the eyewall developed and the eye of the storm became more defined . however , deep convection persisted and strengthening was observed as the storm approached puerto rico . shortly thereafter , the eye ##wall became well @ - @ level and visible on the satellite imagery , an indication the storm was strengthening . the chances of further strengthening were high as the eye had high @ - @ level ridge and deep convection features . with relatively warm sea surface temperatures , low body heat temperatures , low wind shear , and a dry air layer , omar eventually reached its peak intensity early on october 15 as a category 1 hurricane with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) . during the strengthening phase , the wind speed of the storm increased to 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) . once over the atlantic ocean , omar began to rapidly weaken , with winds decreasing to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) within 24 hours . the satellite imagery showed an increased mid @ - @ level , with convection displaced to the west due to a combination of the high wind shear and dry air . on october 16 , most of the deep convection associated with the storm dissipated ; however , a slight increase in wind shear allowed omar to continue @ - @ level to a new level , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . during this time , convection increased around the eye and an eye formed . later that day , the shear that caused the rapid forward motion weakened omar , leading to slow weakening . after weakening further , omar turned towards the west due to a mid to high @ - @ level ridge located south of the center and the high @ - @ level ridgeto the northeast . early on october 17 , wind shear increased even more as omar passed over waters at 26 ° n ( 79 ° e ) . by 0000 utc on october 18 , omar weakened to a tropical depression as the convection associated with omar dissipated . several hours later , while still maintaining tropical storm @ - @ force winds , the depression transitioned into a remnant low pressure area . the remnants of omar persisted until 0600 utc on october 19 when it dissipated about 805 mi ( 510 @ , @ 295 km ) east of the azores . = = = = = on october 15 , the governor of the united states virgin islands announced the final preparations for hurricane omar . he issued a state of emergency warning for the island . all schools would be closed on october 15 . all hurricane @ -

@ jesuits and anti @ - @ jesuits , and most cardinals were catholic . the pro @ - @ jesuits faction , including zelanti , included some curial ##ists who supported the secular influenceson the continent . their leaders were gian francesco and alessandro albani and crown @ - @ supporters of the late cardinal carlo rezzonico . the crown @ - @ catholic group ( see also " catholic bloc " ) included crown @ - @ members of the three powers : france , spain and italy . it led at the time to louis xiv of france , charles ii of spain and charles iii of spain / charles iv of naples . in spite of the strong opposition they worked together for the common goal – suppression of the society of jesus . the two powers had decided to place the actual leadership of this movement in the hands of the french cardinal de bernis . he and his supporters were ordered to block the crown @ - @ catholic group , along with the papal government if possible . some cardinals , among them lorenzo ganganelli , did not belong to this group . the spanish and french governments had divided the five catholic cardinals into five groups : " good " ( five cardinals ) , " good " ( four ) , " bad " ( three ) , " bad " ( two ) and " very bad " ( ten ) : cardinal orsini , the official leader of the bad faction , and all the others , were not elected because it was expected that none of them would be directly elected pope . the french government was more powerful than spanish and italian . only three cardinals were considered serious candidates : conti , durini and ganganelli . of these cardinals , only 27 or 28 were actually elected papabile , and the remaining 15 were rejected due to their age and gender . = = = = = the voting began on february 22 , 1769 . initially only 43 cardinals entered . zelanti , taking advantage of the small number of the cardinals and the support of the french and spanish governments , managed to secure a quick election of cardinal flavio chigi . by one vote he was only two votes short of being elected . the election of zelanti met with strong opposition from the governments of france and spain , but , fortunately for them , cardinal orsini , governor of the kingdom of naples and the only crown @ - @ member elected during the two ballots , was able to convince the other cardinals to support chigi ’ his election . another important event was the arrival of joseph ii , holy roman emperor , who arrived unexpectedly in rome on march 3 and was allowed to enter the city . he stayed for two days , personally meeting with thedegree . however , he did not reject them and instead expressed the desire for the election of a pope who would be able to carry out his duties with the utmost respect for the bourbon ##s . cardinal de bernis entered the chamber at the end of march and removed the leadership of the anti @ - @ jesuit faction from the hands of cardinal orsini , who could have prevented zelanti ’ the election even with the overwhelming majority . bernis then began a regular correspondence with french ambassador jean d ' aubeterre , which was in violation of the normal rules of the church . representatives of france and spain induced bernis to request that the election of the next pope be made to rely on his personal promise to destroy the society . bernis refused , saying that receiving from the new pope a written or verbal promise to destroy the society of jesus would be a violation of the canon law . in spite of this opposition , during the next two years bernis had rejected all proposals rejected by zelanti as being hostile to the jesuits . in this election anti @ - @ three out of four @ - @ jesuit papabile were elected , among them the anti @ - @ jesuit cardinal fantuzzi , who at that point was very close to the election to the papal throne , as well as cavalchini , colonna , stoppani , pozzobonelli , sersale , and many others . the election of spanish ambassadors solis and de la cerda on april 6 weakened the anti @ - @ jesuit faction . they also violated the rules of the church by establishing a correspondence with spanish ambassador azpuru . the jesuits received more votes than bernis and , led by cardinal malvezzi , took the matter into their own hands . they paid homage to the dominican superior of the sacred heart , cardinal lorenzo ganganelli , o . f . m . conv . the attitude of ganganelli towards the jesuits was a great one – he had been educated by the jesuits and it is said that he wore the red hat at the court of cardinal lorenzo ricci , founder of the society of jesus , but during the reign of pius vii he did not involve himself in the affairs of the order . cardinal solis responded by calling him out as to his willingness to take the oath made by the french ambassador as an acceptable condition for election . ganganelli wrote that " i have in the greatest power the power to destroy , with good reason , the society of jesus ,that he respected the new constitution ; and that it was " that the pope should do everything in his power to secure the union of the churches " . it is not known whether this was a written or merely an oral promise , but this promise evidently satisfied the cardinals . at the same time zelanti , however continued to refuse to give their votes to ganganelli , looking upon him as hostile or even hostile to the pope . it seems that the appointment of zelanti was influenced by the secret correspondence between their brothers alessandro and gian francesco albani and the french ambassador . cardinal de bernis , the new head of the jesuit order , apparently did not take any part in the appointment of ganganelli and only followed the papers of cardinal d ' aubeterre when they had been first issued . = = = results of the ballots = = = the results of the ballots on april 27 and may 1 were : ( where the other votes are included ) : april 27 – fantuzzi – 8 ; colonna – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 5 ; stoppani – 4 ; ganganelli – 4 april 28 – fantuzzi – 8 ; colonna – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 10 ; stoppani – 8 ; ganganelli – 5 april 28 – colonna – 7 ; fantuzzi – 8 ; stoppani – 9 ; pozzobonelli – 9 ; ganganelli – 5 april 28 – colonna – 9 ; fantuzzi – 8 ; stoppani – 9 ; pozzobonelli – 8 ; ganganelli – 2 may 1 – colonna – 8 ; fantuzzi – 9 ; stoppani – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 9 ; ganganelli – 2 may 1 – colonna – 10 ; fantuzzi – 9 ; stoppani – 10 ; pozzobonelli – 5 ; ganganelli – 2 may 3 – colonna – 4 ; fantuzzi – 5 ; stoppani – 5 ; pozzobonelli – 5 ; ganganelli – 2 may 5 – colonna – 8 ; fantuzzi – 4 ; stoppani – 4 ; ganganelli – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 3 may 5 – fantuzzi – 8 ; colonna – 9 ; stoppani – 9 ; ganganelli – 8 ; pozzobonelli – 3 may 1 – fantuzzi – 9 ; stoppani – 5 ; colonna – 5 ; ganganelli – 4 ; pozzobonelli – 3 may 1 – colonna – 8 ; fan##tuzzi – 5 ; stoppani – 5 ; ganganelli – 5 ; pozzobonelli – ##1 -
