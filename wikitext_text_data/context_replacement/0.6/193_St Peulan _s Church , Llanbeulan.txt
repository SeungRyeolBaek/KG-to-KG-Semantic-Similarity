others made of stone are attached to the roofs of the north and south chapels . the nave of the church , which has three bays , was originally built in the 14th century . the doorway at the west end of the nave has been walled up and covered over from the inside . the chancel , which is wider than the nave , and the chapel ( on the north side of the chancel next to the nave ) were built in the 19th century , and the walls separating the nave from the chapel and the chancel are of this date . the west doorway , from the 14th century , is located on the south side of the chancel and has a pointed arch . above the doorway is a stone window with the date 1637 , and next to that is a 15th @ - @ century perpendicular window dating from the 15th century , and in the north wall of unknown date . it has been suggested that this window has been removed from the original south wall . the east window of the chancel , from the 15th century , has three lights decorated with flowers and topped with carved figures . there is also a blocked 15th @ - @ century window in the chancel ' s north wall and a blocked 16th @ - @ century window in the south wall . the windows in the chancel date from the 15th century ( door and window ) and 18th century ( window ) . the pewsmonuments from the 17th century : a tomb in the church has an inscribed slab of marble , dated 1664 , indicating that it was the seat of william jones of treyrddol . there are a number of monuments in the church from the 17th , 18th and early 19th centuries . the church ' s pre @ - @ century furnishings , such as the pulpit and communion table , are norman . the most striking feature of the church is the font , which dates from the late 10th century , or possibly from the second half of the 11th century . it measures 2 feet 1 inch ( 61 @ . @ 17 cm ) by 1 feet 6 inches ( 51 @ . @ 17 cm ) ( standard size ) and is 11 inches ( 28 @ . @ 28 cm ) high . it is octagonal and stands on three sides . one of the longer sides has a circle with two crosses of equal size arranged in a circle ; on the other are two smaller crosses , and the design is decorated with crosses ( some plain , some decorated with crosses in a simple geometric pattern ) . it has been suggested that the crosses represent the ##keepers . one of the shorter sides has a row of crosses forming an arch above a row of benches . the other shorter side has a chequerwork border . the historian peter petts has noted that it is one of a number of churches in glamorgan that cover an area with little or no decoration , either because it was never intended that the long sides of the font would be used or because the font was removed before being placed in its place in the church . although similar in style to other norman churches , its unusual shape is " unusual " , according to petts , and the cross at its side " has no place among those of this period . " another observer , the historian peter jones , has suggested that it was originally used as an altar . despite the 19th @ - @ century dating , he noted that " as an example of the pre @ - @ century , it is a rare example in glamorgan and , indeed , in england " . petts considered this " remarkable " , suggesting that it may originally have been a chapel . the inventory of welsh churches describes the font as the county ' s " greatest treasure " . it has also been called " the finest of glamorgan ' s early norman churches . " it has similarities of material and style with the churches of two other churches in glamorgan ( st llwydian ' s church , heneg##lwys and st iestyn ' s church , llaniestyn ) and with one of the three stones from st seiriol ' s church , penmon . = = = = = the church is a grade ii * listed building – the second @ - @ - ( of three ) grade of listing , for " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . it was given this status on 1 april 1971 , and has been designated because it is " a small parish church in a simple form . " it is described by cadw ( the welsh assembly government body responsible for the national heritage of wales ) as a church " of the welsh tradition " , where the second @ - @ - restoration work has " preserved the simplicity of design and form " , and restored the church ' s original appearance . in the 19th century , the writer david davies wrote that it was " small and of simple design " , but had " many interesting features " such as the windows that made it " unique " . the writer angharad llwyd , writing in 1833 , described it as " a small small church , situated in a small wooded area " , with the south wall " showing features of a great antiquity . " she noted that there were some windows " in the early english style , of good quality , in the east window of the chancel , which is of very good quality . "
