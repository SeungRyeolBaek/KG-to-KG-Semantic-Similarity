= mount jackson ( [UNK] ) = mount jackson ( mount andrew jackson and mount ernest gruening ) is a mountain that dominates the landscape of the central part of the antarctic peninsula . it is located in palmer land , in the southern region of argentina , antarctica and the united states . with an elevation of 3 @ , @ 184 metres ( 13 @ , @ 446 ft ) , mount jackson is the highest mountain on the antarctic peninsula and the british antarctic territory . discovered by members of the united states antarctic expedition , 1939 – ##山 , it was named for andrew jackson , the seventh president of the united states . the first ascent of mount jackson was made by a party led by john crabbe , of the british antarctic survey ( bas ) in 1964 . mount jackson ' s geology was studied in 1972 as part of the ross sea expedition by a party of scientists . mount jackson and the jackson massif dominate the central palmer land , which is covered by numerous glaciers and is bounded to the west by the ice of southern palmer land . the two peaks rise above the ice , with heights of between 2 @ , @ [UNK] – [UNK] @ , @ 280 metres ( 7 @ , @ 900 – ##1 @ , @ 900 ft ) towards the east . they are separated by glacial valleys and a ridge with steep ##er slopes . mount jackson rises from the southeast side , forming a glacial ridge , while the northwest side is dominated by a glacial valley . supraglacial valleys on the mountain ' s west side are about . – square kilometres ( 2 @ . @ [UNK] – ##0 @ . @ 1 mi ) in area and have glaciers at their western ends . = = = = = the first aerial survey of mount jackson was carried out in december 1940 by a field party of the united states antarctic service ( us ) . the survey ##ing was made by ground photography and aerial photography . the height was estimated at 3 @ , @ 240 metres ( 13 @ , @ 800 ft ) , and the mountain was named mount ernest gruening for the governor of the antarctic territory at that time , ernest gruening . he later renamed it mount jackson for the seventh president of the united states . president jackson signed the bill into law as the united states antarctic act of 1838 – ′ . the expedition , led by lt . charles wilkes , conducted exploration and surveying of the southern ocean and antarctic peninsula , including antarctica . in december 1947 , a falkland islands geological survey ( fids ) field party landed at stonington ,named mount jackson and estimated its height at 3 @ , @ 050 metres ( 10 @ , @ 010 ft ) , much higher and more distant than the first ascent in 1940 . when the falkland islands land survey was renamed british antarctic survey in 1962 , a number of stations were established , including one at mount jackson . bas personnel were involved in conducting the first survey of the interior of the antarctic peninsula , and peter scott , who worked at the bas station at davis station , was the first to climb mount jackson . travelling by dog ##leg for 640 kilometres ( 400 mi ) , his party reached the summit on 5 december 1964 . the first measurement of the height was made by a british survey party which climbed the mountain during the antarctic summer of 1996 – ad . = = = = = the peak is 3 @ , @ 184 metres ( 10 @ , @ 446 ft ) in height , with a prominence of 3 @ , @ 187 metres ( 7 @ , @ 610 ft ) and a summit dem of 997 metres ( 3 @ , @ 271 ft ) . mount jackson and the adjacent mountains form the southern black coast , which is drained by numerous glaciers and is bounded on the west by the coast of southern graham land , with heights varying between 1 @ , @ 000 – 2 @ , @ 000 metres ( 2 @ , @ 600 – 4 @ , @ 800 ft ) , and by the east side of the northern scott coast . the adjacent mountains rise above the coast , with heights of between 1 @ , @ 900 – ##0 @ , @ 900 metres ( 3 @ , @ 900 – ##1 @ , @ 900 ft ) towards the east . they are separated by deep valleys and a ridge with the ##er ##s . the southern portion of the mountain range , which extends for 3 @ , @ 590 kilometres ( 990 mi ) , covers most of the antarctic peninsula , and mount jackson is its highest point . mount jackson rises from its south side , forming a prominent peak , while the north side is surrounded by a low plateau . supraglacial ridges on the mountain ' s south flank are about 1 – ##5 kilometres ( 1 @ . @ 10 – ##0 @ . @ 3 km ) in length and have glaciers at their northern ends . mount jackson and the rowley range are separated by odom glacier . scott glacier drains from mount jackson before terminating at odom glacier . mount jackson ' s geology was studied in 1972 as part of the ross sea survey by a party of scientists. they represent unusual rock types and recent volcanic activity . the slope of the west side slope is gentler when compared to the east side , characterized by a steep ##er slope . chemical alteration is common in the area spread with basalt and felsenmeer . unusual rock types and soil types are common .
