= = – corey – chaykovsky reaction = the name – corey – chaykovsky reaction ( also referred to as the corey – chaykovsky reaction or ccr ) is a chemical reaction used in organic synthesis for the synthesis of epoxides , aziridines , and derivatives . it was discovered in 1961 by j . william johnson and more further by a . w . corey and alexander chaykovsky . the reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a carbon , alcohol , imine , or enone to form the desired 9 @ - @ transfer ring . the reaction is diastereoselective with trans ##folding of the ring instead of the original stereochemistry . the synthesis of epoxides via this reaction serves as an important retrosynthetic route to the traditional epoxidation reactions of synthesis . the reaction is most commonly used for epoxidation via electron transfer , and to this extent has been used in several other organic synthesis ( see synthesis of epoxides below ) . more , below are the structure , mechanism , details , and enantioselective nature of the reaction . several versions have been reported . = = mechanism = = the original work by corey described the reaction of a @ - @ dimethylsulfonium fluorenylide with its benzaldehyde ##s . the original wittig @ - @ transfer reaction failed and the benzalfluorene derivative was used instead , meaning that " reactions between the sulfur ylid and benzaldehydes did not yield benzalfluorenes as did the sulfur and sulfur ylids . " the subsequent addition of ( dimethyloxosulfaniumyl ) methanide , ( ch3 ) 2soch2 and ( dimethylsulfaniumyl ) methanide , ( ch3 ) 2sch2 ( known as corey – chaykovsky reactions ) by corey and chaykovsky using the 3 @ - @ transfer products established the reaction as a part of the synthesis pathway . = = history = = the general mechanism for the corey – corey – chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the methyl or imine ring . the negative charge is applied to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium ion is a strong leaving group it is stronger from the ring . in the modified wittig reaction , the reaction of thethe larger 4 @ - @ limiting central bond prevents oxirane formation and instead , olefination takes place with a 4 @ - @ - total intermediate . the trans diastereoselectivity also results from the stability of the initial step , with respect to the favored strong base , the syn base . the addition of the ylide results in a product with negative electrons ; however of ##ization studies have shown that the rate @ - @ limiting rotation is rotation of the central bond into the conformer allowing for an attack of the sulfonium . the amount of stability of the overall addition ( and thus the diastereoselectivity ) depends on several factors , with greater stability leading to greater stability : stability of the intermediate with greater stability leading to greater stability by choosing the starting material over the substrate . stability of the ylide with greater stability , corresponding to greater stability . steric substitution of the substrate with greater stability leading to greater stability by increasing stability of the substrate and increasing the 4 @ - @ limiting step of the central bond . replacement of oxygen in the substrate by counterions such as oxygen with less stability allowing more backside rotation of the cyclic intermediate , increasing the conservation of charge . = = = = = the application of the corey – corey – chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is extensive . the term has grown to dominate naming of many types of substituted ylides with electrophiles , beyond the organic synthesis . it has found application in a variety of 4 @ - @ - cyclic reactions , as described below , and is widely regarded as a useful transformative step in the synthesis synthesis . = = = variety of ylides = = = various types of ylides can be prepared with different functional groups depending on the parent sulfur ##yl and on the oxygen . the functional ##s can affect the method of preparation for the product ( starting from the sulfonium ion , e . g . trimethylsulfonium chloride ) and the reaction conditions in various ways . the general scheme for the reaction is shown on the right . preparation of the sulfoxonium allows more efficient rotation of the product with strong bases as compared to sulfonium ylides . ( the difference is that the sulfoxonium has a weakly substituted bond whereas the sulfonium does not. ) the latter react faster due to their greater stability . in contrast , the dialkylsulfoxide by @ - @ products of sulfoxonium compounds are generally similar to the much more toxic , unstable , and unstable dialkylsulfide by @ - @ products from sulfonium compounds . the vast majority of products are monosubstituted on the ylide carbon ( often r1 or r2 as well ) . disubstituted forms are much preferred and have been developed : if the ylide carbon is substituted with an extended @ - @ methyl group ( ewg ) , the product is referred to as a stabilized ylide . these , compared to sulfoxonium compounds , react much faster and are much harder to prepare . these are limited in their use and the reaction rates are very slow : reactions involving sulfur are common , with far examples involving hydrogen and almost no examples involving other ewg ' s . for these , the modified darzens reaction is much more common . if the ylide carbon is substituted with an aryl or methyl group , the product is referred to as a r @ - @ stabilized ylide . these have been studied extensively , compared only to the traditional suzuki reactions ( r1 = r2 = 2 ) . the substitution ##s of aryl groups can greatly affect the yield of the reaction as per the examples above . if the ylide carbon is substituted with an amino group the product is referred to as an unstabilized ylide . the size of the methyl groups are the major factors affecting dealing with these reactions . the electron @ - @ groups on the carbon , most commonly methyl , have been used to develop compounds that can perform enantioselective versions of the reaction ( see examples below ) . the size of the groups can greatly affect diastereoselectivity of alicyclic reactions . = = = synthesis of epoxides = = = reactions of aromatic ylides with acids and bases to form epoxides are by far the most common variants of the [UNK] – corey – chaykovsky reaction . reactions of aromatic rings and ' complex ' ylides have been reported , as described below . the reaction has been used in a number of other organic synthesis including the danishefsky taxol total synthesis , which was the che##motherapeutic of taxol , and the kuehne - schmidt synthesis which produces the drug ecstasy . = = = synthesis of aziridines = = = the synthesis of aziridines from imines is an important application of the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction and is an alternative to electron synthesis from oxaziridines . although less commonly used , the reaction has a wider reaction preference and functional group structure to the direct addition . the reactions shown below are examples ; in the reaction , the aziridine forms in situ and is reduced via nucleophilic attack to give the corresponding alcohol . = = = synthesis of alcohol = = = for conversion of sulfur ylides to enones , a 1 @ , @ 4 @ - @ addition is more observed with sulfoxonium compounds than with sulfonium salts . the other @ - @ functional groups have been more associated with the reaction of derivatives , derivatives , and derivatives ( the example below is the weinreb reaction ) . with the reaction , 1 @ , @ 4 @ - @ addition tends to dominate over 1 @ , @ 4 @ - @ addition . = = = ring reactions = = = in addition to the reactions previously reported by johnson , corey , and chaykovsky , sulfur ylides have been used for a number of ring homologation reactions that are to be described under the same name . with epoxides and aziridines the reaction proceeds as a 1 @ - @ addition to form the corresponding oxetane and azetidine . the short reaction times required for these reactions prevent them from serving as useful side products when producing epoxides and aziridines . several cycloadditions wherein the ylide acts as a " nucleophilic carbenoid intermediate " have been reported . reaction systems with trialkylboranes as the solvent and ( dimethyloxosulfaniumyl ) methanide as the solvent have been reported for the synthesis of complex organic systems . = = enantioselective reaction = = the formation of an enantioselective ( i . e . without an enantiomeric product , which is denoted as " stable " ) version of the [UNK] – corey – chaykovsky reaction is an active area of chemical research . the synthesis of chiral ##ity , athis synthesis has been more successful than the other catalytic methods , although the substrate scope is very limited in many cases . the catalytic variants have been developed almost exclusively for enantioselective reactions ; the organosulfide variants are not as expensive and the racemic reaction can be carried out with equimolar amounts of ylide without reducing yields significantly . chiral variants , on the other hand , are more expensive to produce , despite the development of the enantioselective method . = = = catalytic method = = = the most common variants developed in a catalytic fashion are shown below . the first is a modified oxathiane that has been used in the synthesis of the β @ - @ derived - dichloroisoproterenol ( s ) which is limited by the shape of only one face of the compound . the formation of the cis diastereomer is controlled via the β @ , @ , @ - @ anomeric addition which increases the nucleophilicity of the central lone pair . the formation of the ylide is determined by transannular ##ity and formation of the acid is restricted to one half of the ylide via steric interactions with the other substituents . the other catalytic variant is the β @ - @ - , developed by varinder aggarwal of the university of delhi . both variants are easily prepared , although the yields are lower than for the oxathiane ##s . the ylide shape is limited by interactions with the two , and formation of the acid is controlled by the methyl group . the latter uses a phosphazene group to promote formation of the ylide . = = = other method = = = other variants have been moderately successful , with most reactions resulting from poor yield , poor enantioselectivity , or both . there are also problems with substrate availability , both notably problems with electron groups and other addition . the difficulty arises from the need for a nucleophilic base that first attacks the ylide which can then act as a reactive leaving group to form the epoxide . since the mechanisms for these problems are at odds , understanding of the catalytic mechanism has been neglected . shown below are some of thethe are , improve with the structure and enantiomeric ratios for their use in production of ( + ) - stilbene derivatives . aggarwal has developed an alternative method using the hydrogen catalyst as above and a similar alkylation using a single carbenoid prepared in situ . the method however has limited application availability , not for the electrophiles or suitable substituents due to the inhibition of the carbenoid .
