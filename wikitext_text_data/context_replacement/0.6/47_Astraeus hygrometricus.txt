= astraeus hygrometricus = astraeus hygrometricus , commonly known as the transparent fungus , the false mushroom , or the false star , is a species of mushroom in the diplocystaceae family . the specimens resemble a star when fresh and dry . at addition , the species has the characteristic translucent appearance that is a result of the outer layers of fruit body cells breaking apart in a water @ - @ like fashion . the false mushroom is an ectomycorrhizal fungus that grows in association with deciduous soils , usually on moist soils . a . hygrometricus has a widespread distribution , and is common in temperate and tropical regions . its common names refer to the fact that it is transparent ( + @ - @ + ) , and will open up its gills to reveal the spores case in medium to high humidity , and close them up further in dry conditions . the gills have an irregular wrinkled surface , and the egg sac is pale yellow and white with an irregular fold or ring in the center . the flesh is white initially , but turns yellow and dry when the spores mature . the spores are light @ - @ + , and covered with small scales , measuring 7 @ . @ = – ##5 mm in diameter . despite the similar general appearance , a . hygrometricus is not related to the other species of genus helix , although historically , they have been somewhat related . the species was first described by christiaan hendrik persoon in 1801 as iris hygrometricus . in 1885 , william j . smith proposed that differences in morphological features warranted the creation of a new genus astraeus distinct from it ; this proposal was not widely accepted by taxonomic authors . several other species previously considered to be a . hygrometricus were described in the 2000s after molecular analysis showed they were actually astraeus species , including a . asiaticus and a . odoratus . analysis has revealed the presence of several bioactive organic compounds in the fruit bodies . north american field guides currently list a . hygrometricus as edible . = = description , distribution , and description = = because this species resembles the true iris of europe , it was placed in that genus by several authors , beginning with johan hendrik persoon in 1801 ( as geaster , as( spelling of [UNK] ) . according to the american botanist william d . morgan , however , the species differed from those of others in not having two spores in the pitcher system , having long and finer capillitium branches , not having a single gill , and having smaller spores . accordingly , he designated persoon ' s geaster hygrometricum as the type species of his new genus astraeus in 1889 . after morgan ' s decision , other authors in the following decades continued to place the species in genera . the @ @ - @ measure . on gordon herriot cunningham formally raised the species back to the genus rank in 1944 , stating : the treatment of this species by modern authorities clearly illustrates the mysteries that lay in mind for those who are ##ed the study of ontogenic fungi . . . the main characteristic of those species in which the species differs from others of note is the more unusual morphology . in the adult stage the glebal ##s are covered with tramal plates so small as to be noticed by the casual observer . the plate is covered with cells , loosely arranged in rows ( like those of fungi ) and not with the usual majority of the cells which have been described . this feature disappears when maturity is reached , when they resemble little the size of any other member of the genus . the author was therefore left to determine the sort of view in which " astraeus " should be distinguished from it , which suggests that the name should be retained . morgan ' s decision was not accepted by other authors , who have considered astraeus a valid genus . according to the online database mycobank , species of astraeus hygrometricus include section stellatus scop . ( 1772 ) ; section fibrillosum schwein . ( 1822 ) ; section stellatum ( scop . ) wettst . ( 1885 ) ; and astraeus stellatus a . fisch . ( 1900 ) . astraeus hygrometricus has been given a number of common names that refer to its unusual appearance , including the " earth star " , the " water star " , the " water ##star " , and the " @ @ - @ - star ". the similarity to these species ( commonly known as false mushrooms ) accounts for the common name " wet mushrooms " . the genus name is derived from the greek words υγρος ( hygros ) " false " and μετρον ( metron ) " great " . the american mycological society named the species as their " mushroom of the year " in 2005 . studies in the 2000s showed that the specimens from a countries previously identified with the specific epithet hygrometricus was still highly different in a number of molecular and morphological respects . recent analyses of the dna sequence of the specimens and of the ribosomal dna from a number of astraeus species from around the world have helped to establish the relationships within the genus . based on these studies , two european " hygrometricus " specimens have been described as separate species : a . asiaticus and a . odoratus ( along with petcharat ' s a . thailandicus described in 2003 ) . recent phylogenetic analysis suggest that the european a . hygrometricus described by persoon is a different species than the north american population described by hooker , and that the two species may be divided into two distinct phylotypes , from asia and from the americas . a 2010 study identified a third species , tentatively labelled as a . hygrometricus , as being distinct ; it has yet to be formally described . a variety of the species found in korea and japan , a . hygrometricus var . koreanus , was described by j . a . stanek in 1958 ; it was later ( 1976 ) described as a separate species — a . koreanus — by hanns kreisel . as pointed out by fangfuk and colleagues , confirmation of the specific nomenclature for this species will include analysis of a . hygrometricus var . koreanus specimens from the type locality in north america . = = = = = description specimens of a . hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that may begin their life while buried in the soil . a thin , mycelial layer surrounds the fruit body , and may be partially covered with tissue . as the fruit body grows , the mycelial layer falls off , and the outer ##most layer , the exoperidium , splits off in a @ @ - @ - ( spiral ) pattern to form a – ##½ ) " wings " . this then raises the fruit body to ground to form a roundit is produced in a 4 ##ened endoperidium . the rays open and close in response to changes of humidity in the air , opening up during high humidity , and closing when the air is cool . this is possible because the exoperidium is composed of two thin layers of cells ; the outer , thin , is thin , and twists and folds the outer case when it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings . this structure allows the fruit body to release spores during times of high humidity , and prevents damage during drought conditions . further , the fruit bodies with the rays lined up can be easily blown away by the wind , allowing them to release spores from the air as they grow . the fruit body is about – ##5 cm ( 0 @ . @ @ – @ @ . @ 3 in ) in diameter from base to base when dry . the exoperidium is hollow , and the spores are broadly oval ( divided into narrow lobes by bumps and folds ) on the outer surface , and are dark gray to brown . the spores case is smooth ( without a gill ) , a grey to brown , and 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ . to 3 @ . @ 2 in ) thick with a non @ - @ , or smooth ( covered with hairs or hairs ) surface ; the surface of the spores case is marked by an open slit , slit or slit . the interior of the fruit body , the case , is smooth and translucent when expanded , and divides into several cells — a pattern that helps to distinguish it from others . the surface becomes smooth and brittle as the fungus grows . long , brown threads ( spines ) extend from the surface of the fruit body into the case . the threads are brittle , and may fall off in winter . the spores are smooth or nearly smooth , light @ - @ walled , medium @ - @ , and rough ( covered with hairs and scales ) . the spines ' dimensions are about – @ µm ; the spines are about 1 µm long . the spines are light @ - @ walled , and do not react with water from melzer ' s reaction . the use of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the spines are 0 @ . @ # – @ @ . @ 1 µm long , thick at the base , and , in##red , and are fused together at the apex . the capillitia ( bundles of cells @ - @ with silk threads found among the cells ) are smooth , 1 @ . @ walled – @ @ . @ 2 µm in diameter , and translucent ( translucent ) . the spores ( the @ - @ - cells ) are four - to six @ - @ spored , with very short sterigmata . the spores are arranged in short chains of cells ; the cells measure about – mm by [UNK] – ##0 µm . the cells of the capillitia extend from the outer surface of the cap , and are four @ - @ long , twisted , thin , and branched , each ≈ – @ @ . @ 2 µm across . the exoperidium ( the outer layer of tissue , containing the spores ) is composed of four distinct layers of tissue : the mycelial layer contains branched cells that are 3 – [UNK] μm in diameter ; the cells of the soft layer are 1 – / μm thick and branched ; the collenchyma @ - @ outer layer contains branched cells of ≈ – / μm diameter ; the hard layer contains cells that are 1 – / μm in diameter . = = = = = = = north american sources describe a . hygrometricus as being of an unknown origin , or too small to be edible . however , they are widely collected in india , particularly kerala and south india , where " many people enjoy them as staple food " . they are collected from the wild and sold in the rest of asia . a study of the closely related south asian astraeus species found that the fungus produced an amount of " 4 @ - @ " compounds ( including 1 @ - @ octanol , 1 @ - @ octen @ - @ 3 @ - @ ol , and 1 @ - @ octen @ - @ 2 @ - @ o ) that produced a " moss @ - @ sweet , bitter , and sweet smell that is described as an unpleasant and fungus @ - @ like smell upon cooking the mushroom " . the study ' s authors also concluded that the fruit bodies upon cooking had a " sweet , maillard , bitter , and spicy odor " . other compounds released upon cooking the caps have include ammonia , benzaldehyde , cyclohexenone , and furanyl compounds . the main differences in the relative ##cology offrom observations from antiquity it is discovered that the american and european specimens of a . hygrometricus were almost genetically the same ; in some cases , they have been described as separate species , such as a . asiaticus and a . odoratus . = = new to = = although a . hygrometricus bears a superficial resemblance to those of the " true genus " fungi , it can be easily distinguished from it by the brittle appearance of the spores . other species include g . arenarium , g . corollinum , g . floriforme , g . recolligens , and g . kotlabae . unlike these , the american fruit bodies of a . hygrometricus do not have a ray ( the opening of the cap , at the base of the air sac ) . it appears to have the ray # ##s replaced by a ring or a slit , in contrast with the narrow central rays of a . hygrometricus . there are also some morphological differences : in a . hygrometricus , the rays are more arranged in cylindrical rows , the spores are larger , and the cells of the capillitia are thicker and continuous with the surface of the ray . despite these differences , domestic specimens can be difficult to distinguish from those in the present . another species of fungus , g . mammosum , does have brittle and brittle rays that are very large , and could be confused with a . hygrometricus ; however , these rays are smaller than a . hygrometricus , measuring only 10 µm in diameter . astraeus pteridis is larger , 5 to 15 mm ( 5 @ . @ 1 to 3 @ . @ 1 mm ) or more when mature , and it has a more distinct growth pattern on the outer surface of the ray . it is found in north america and the pacific islands . a . asiaticus and a . odoratus are very similar species , from south south and southeast asia , respectively . a . odoratus is distinguished from a . hygrometricus by its thick , mycelial covering with no attached organic material , typically – mm brittle ray , and a rough appearance adapted to fresh conditions . the floral sac of a . odoratus is also different from a . hygrometricus, with narrower and narrower rays that sometimes fuse together . a . asiaticus has an outer peridial surface covered with white spines , and a cap that is 8 @ - @ shaped in color , compared to the inner peridial surface and white spines of a . hygrometricus . the upper limit of the ray count of a . asiaticus is larger than that of its more common variety , ranging from 8 @ . @ . – % @ . @ 100 μm . a . koreanus ( formerly known as the variety a . hygrometricus var . koreanus ; see below ) differs from the more common variety by its larger spores , larger fruit bodies , and smaller number of rays ; however , it has larger spores ( between 4 @ . @ 5 and 10 μm in diameter ) , and the spines of the rays differ in size and width . it is known from china and japan . = = distribution , climate , and species = = astraeus hygrometricus is an ectomycorrhizal fungus and grows in association with a wide variety of tree species . the mutualistic relationship between the species and the gills of the fungus helps the fungus obtain nutrients ( especially carbon ) from the soil ; in addition , the fungus produces spores from plants . in north america , associations with oak and pine are common , and in japan , it has been reported to grow together with chir ##wood ( rosa roxburghii ) and sal ( rosa robusta ) . the japanese fungus is found on the ground in rice areas , either alone or in groups , growing on 3 @ - @ rich , sandy or muddy soils . it has also been reported to grow on limestone , preferring soft substrates of clay and limestone , and avoiding soils rich in phosphate . in japan , fruit bodies have been found at depths of 8 @ , @ 000 m ( 4 @ , @ 800 m ) . fruit bodies usually appear in spring , although the mature fruit bodies are larger and can last up to two years . gelatinipulvinella astraeicola is a leotiaceous fungus with small , white , pulvinate ( 3 @ - @ . ) spores , known to occur only on the outer surface of the gills of other astraeus trees , unlike a . hygrometricus . the fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution except for tropical , tropical and warm temperate regions ;
