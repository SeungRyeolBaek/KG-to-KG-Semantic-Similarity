= elephanta island = elephanta caves are a group of buddhist caves located on elephanta island , or gharapuri ( literally " the island of elephant " ) in mumbai harbour , 10 km ( 6 @ . @ 6 mi ) to the east of the city of mumbai in the indian state of maharashtra . the island , located on an island of the arabian sea , consists of two groups of caves — the first , a large group of four buddhist caves , the second , a small group of four hindu caves . the buddhist caves are rock cut cave temples , of the shaiva ##ite style , dedicated to the god vishnu . the rock cut architecture of the caves has been dated to between the 5th and 8th centuries , although the identity of the original builders is still a matter of debate . the caves are carved from black volcanic rock . = the caves were probably also inhabited in the past , but today only two remain . the first cave ( cave 1 , or the elephant cave ) was a hindu place of worship until european settlement began in 1534 , after which the site suffered from neglect . this cave was restored in the 1970s after years of neglect , and was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1987 to protect the caves . it is currently maintained by the archaeological survey of india ( asi ) . = = = = = elephanta island , or gharapuri , is located 10 km ( 6 @ . @ 7 mi ) east of the port bunder ( bunder in marathi means a " port for arrival and departure of passengers and cargo " ) in the mumbai harbour and 10 km ( 6 @ . @ 6 mi ) west of pir island or trombay . the island is about 15 km2 ( 4 @ . @ 1 sq mi ) at high tide and about 2 km2 ( 4 @ . @ 1 sq mi ) at low tide . gharapuri is a village on the eastern side of the island . the elephanta caves can be reached by passenger ferry from the capital of maharashtra , mumbai , which is the nearest airport and railway station . the ferry is operated every day . the island is 2 @ . @ 3 km ( 2 @ . @ 2 mi ) in length with steep hills that rise to a height of about 150 m ( 490 ft ) . a deep ravine runs through the middle of the island from north to south . to the east , the island rises abruptly from the ravine and spreads out into the hills and rises again to the south , to a height of 173 m ( 568 ft ). this hill is known as the elephant hill . new forests with groves of mango , coconut , and karanj ##ra cover the hill with coconut palm trees . paddy fields are found in the vicinity . the entire island is made up of sand and rocks with rock ##s on the shore . these points are the three small islands known as raja bunder on the rock @ - @ side , mora bunder in the north , and gharapuri and raja bunder in the south . the two sides of the island , the western and the eastern , have two rock @ - @ cut caves on the western hill and a small one on the eastern hill , its base consisting of three steps with a single rock @ - @ cut entrance . one of the caves on the eastern hill is ruined . it is a protected area with a buffer zone according to a decree issued in 1985 , which also includes " a protected area " that is 1 kilometre ( 1 @ . @ 0 mi ) from the island . = = = = = since no caves on any of the hills have been found , the known history of the island is uncertain , at best . pandavas , the heroes of the hindu epic ##s , and banasura , the first king of vishnu , are all credited with building these and other caves to survive . local tradition holds that the caves were originally rock @ - @ built . the elephanta caves are " of uncertain date and origin " . some historians have dated the caves to the period of late 5th to early 6th century ad . archaeological excavations have revealed a few kshatrapa caves dated to 6th century ad . the known history is limited mainly to the defeat of mauryan kingdom of konkan by the badami chalukyas under pulakesi i ( 609 – 642 ) in a naval battle , in 635 ad . elephanta was then called puri ##ya purika , and served as the capital of the konkan mauryas . some historians attribute the construction to the konkan mauryas , linking them to the man @ - @ 6th century , while others dispute this , as a very small dynasty of the konkan mauryas could not afford " the near impossible construction cost , " which was required to make the stone sculptures from the rock and could not afford the skilled labour to make the " high quality " sculptures . some art historians attribute the construction to the kalachuris ( late 5th to 6th century ) ,they may have had a close relationship with the konkan mauryas . in an era where buddhism was widespread , the elephanta shiva cave saw the worship of the pashupata shaivism sect , a sect to which kalachuris as well as konkan mauryas belonged . the chalukyas , who defeated the kalachuris as well as the konkan mauryas , are also believed by some to be builders of the shiva cave , in the early @ - @ 7th century . the rashtrakutas were the main contributors to the construction of the shiva caves , dating to the early 7th to the 8th century . the elephanta shiva cave resembles in many ways the 7th @ - @ _ rashtrakuta rock @ - @ _ kailash of ellora . the image of elephanta with the three arms of shiva is similar to the images of shiva , vishnu and mahesh ( shiva ) , which were the religious symbol of the rashtrakutas . the nataraja and ardhanarishvara temples are also attributed to the rashtrakutas . later , elephanta was ruled by the chalukyan dynasty , and then by delhi sultanate , who ceded it to the portuguese in 1534 . by then , elephanta was called gharapuri , which was a portuguese fort . the name is still used in the local marathi language . the portuguese called the island " elephanta island " in honour of a large rock @ - @ _ _ stone statue of an elephant that was supposedly carved on a rock , a short distance south of gharapuri fort . the statue now resides in the jijamata udyaan temple in goa . portuguese rule caused a decline in the hindu presence on the island and the destruction of the shiva cave ( main cave ) as a major hindu place of worship , although worship of mahashivratri , the birthday of shiva , continued and still continues . the portuguese caused considerable damage to the caves . portuguese also destroyed the statue of shiva in the shiva cave for religious purposes , leaving behind the stone statues . they also left an inscription relating to the destruction of the caves . while some historians still blame the portuguese for the destruction of the caves , others also cite rock @ - @ _ and rock ##s as the main factors . the portuguese left in 1661 as per the peace treaty of charles ii of france and catherine of braganza , wife of king john iii of1 . this treaty transferred control of the island to the british crown , as part of mary ' s marriage to him . although the main cave was restored in the 1970s , the caves , including two groups of hindu sculptures , are still badly damaged . the caves were declared a unesco world heritage site in 1987 as per the main statement of unesco : the caves " represent a culture of great artistic genius " and " are a rare or at least unique monument to a long tradition and to a culture which is alive and which has died " . = = = = = the island has two groups of caves in the rock @ -
