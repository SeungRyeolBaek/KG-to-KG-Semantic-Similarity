= = = = the jeep storm ( hebrew : סופה , sufa ) is an israeli military off @ - @ road vehicle and the vehicle of the israel defense forces . the range of jeep - based vehicles has been produced by automotive industries ltd . in hapoel ##ah under license from chrysler since 1990 . the vehicles serve a number of different roles , including that of light armored fighting vehicles , and several models are produced for export as well as for the domestic market . production of an updated 4 @ - @ stage second generation model began in 2006 after some urgent requests from the storm ' s intended customer , the israel defense forces . development of a third generation model based on the american jeep model jk has been completed and mass production for both israeli and foreign markets is under way . = = = = = = the 4 @ - @ 240 mm multimission vehicle is the first of the new models . a combination of the 1991 jeep model yj and the jeep cj @ - @ 6 / cj @ - @ 8 ft , it is still produced in israel by automotive industries ltd . with the exception of the truck , as their production is not economically viable on the country ' s economic conditions . the storm is primarily designed to meet israeli military requirements , although both long and short versions are produced for the israeli civilian market . like the jeep , it has a conventional 4 @ - @ door , with the driver and gunner seated inside the vehicle , and space for cargo and passengers between them . it is powered by an amc 2 @ . @ 983 cc 4 @ - @ or 4 @ - @ stage engine with fuel injection developing 170 hp ( 127 kw ) at 4 @ , @ 700 rpm , fitted with vortox 4 @ - @ stage air conditioning and a volkswagen 2 @ . @ 980 cc 4 @ - @ stage turbocharged diesel developing 86 kw ( 118 hp ) at 4 @ , @ 700 rpm . the front axle is semi floating and the rear axle is 4 @ - @ 2 , and the long chassis and wheelbase as well as the angles of approach and elevation ( 37 ° and 35 ° for short frame , 35 ° and 37 @ . @ 35 ° for long frame ) contribute to the storm ' s off @ - @ roading capability . the two long wheelbase models , 4 @ . @ 6 ( 4 @ . @ 6 ) and 4 @ . @ 8 m ( 4 @ . @ 8 ft ) , the latter of which was among the first production 4 @ - @vehicles in production in recent years , are also available in civilian and military markets . apart from the civilian market , they have also been exported to customers in north america , asia , and europe . the high @ - @ managed assembly line in egypt , whose vehicles were used by the egyptian armed forces , was incorporated into the israeli military production when it began in 1995 . = = = armoured version = = = like its predecessor the jeep , the storm is first and foremost an airmobile , light offroad and reconnaissance vehicle designed to cover urban terrain in a general reconnaissance role , and to be armed with heavy machine gun and other weapon systems . when armed with a 39 mm ( 3 @ . @ 1 in ) m40 assault rifle , the storm is also capable of firing directly from a rear - mounted turret rather than in the prone position used by most military vehicles . a variant of the extended version used for combat air defense makes use of a high @ - @ bubble roof to provide a large high @ - @ , or high @ - @ sized turret , while the roof can be lowered to provide a small command center . an air conditioned civilian version of the extended version is also used by police , and a version used for riot control has large polycarbonate shields on the rear doors and roof , as well as gunports for high @ - @ sized weapons . the latter allows for a wider field of fire while at the same time protecting against bullets and high @ - @ rounds . = = = light version = = = as with many other israeli armoured vehicles , despite being originally designed to perform a general reconnaissance role , the demands of urban warfare and close quarters combat meant that the israel defense forces decided to adapt the vehicle for these roles . when the need for a light armoured vehicle became apparent to the israeli defense forces , israel ' s engineering team developed a vehicle protection system from the ground up , integrating it into the larger vehicle in a way that did not require the high @ - @ suspension and track system , and that did not cause the structural problems and increase in weight often associated with up @ - @ vehicles , in part due to the new 180 hp ( 134 kw ) diesel engine . the system protects against 1 @ . @ size × 39mm ( 3 @ . @ 1 in ) high @ - @ sized weapons , and has a high protection @ - @ to @ - @ weight and cost , by using government - approved technology . the protected vehicle system ' s total vehicle weight is approximately@ , @ 000 kg ( 1 @ , @ 614 lb ) , and slightly different weight ratings exist for vehicles with different engines . another important advantage is the vehicle ' s compact dimensions , which allow it to navigate the narrow streets common to the streets of many middle eastern cities , meaning that the driver can easily maneuver with minimal effort and little risk , if at all . off @ - @ line rear doors which allow for the easier entry of fully armored soldiers into vehicles are seen as an improvement over other models . = = = = = = = = first generation vehicles were made available to the general public in israel from 1992 to 2001 . a small number were purchased directly from israeli companies , while large numbers were purchased off @ - @ lines from other off @ - @ line manufacturers including the israel electric company and mekorot electric company , as well as national park authority and the idf . these vehicles are popular with off @ - @ roading enthusiasts in israel . = = storm ii = = = in 2006 , israel took delivery of an export version to the army , the off @ - @ 242 ##0 storm ii , known in the service as the " storm ii " . a number of significant changes have been made into the new tj @ - @ based model resulting from customers ' requests , new equipment requirements , and requests by goc , medical and dental , police , and the police personnel . perhaps the most significant change is the addition of five rear seats , making the storm ii the first off @ - @ based jeep wrangler model . other changes include the switch to a manual transmission with five forward gears ( instead of the usual four ) , and increased stability resulting from wider seat width than its predecessor . leaf springs were replaced with a coil spring system front and rear , and the storm ii features rear dana 30 ##s and front tj - 30 , newly installed traction control systems , and the added option of front airbags . soldiers ' comfort was improved as well with the addition of a standard 8 ##bag and a compact cd player . storm ii is also available in an export version , and is available with an optional 8 @ . @ . ##l vm motori turbodiesel , manual transmission , right hand drive , and 5 @ - @ size change . it is capable of passing these tests successfully . due to the changed israeli laws , the export version is not yet available on the israeli market . = = = mdt - = = = = = = the 2000sdespite an increase of us $ 2 million in production contracts for the @ , @ l vehicles , many israeli jobs were said to be in jeopardy following the 1 @ - @ 2005 announcement that the idf would purchase the locally built land rover 1 @ - @ and mdt david . the announcement drew hundreds of protests from israel ' s farmers and workers , who had previously faced the prospect of heavy vehicle production , due to economic problems . the mdt david was selected as the civilian version of the storm because the heavy vehicle was expected to suffer from handling and handling issues , fire problems and poor system operability . however the idf stated that the purpose of the decision was to fill a large gap in production until the mark ii ' s development was complete , and has since been filling that gap . = = mark iii = = = the mark iii was scheduled to be produced for the israel defense forces starting in october 2008 , when the idf planned to purchase about 600 vehicles starting in january 2011 . based on the brand new five @ - @ door jeep cherokee jk storm , the mark iii was expected to solve some of the problems of the earlier mark ii . whereas the previous model was an evolution of the earlier tk storm , the mark iii was designed from the outset with a five @ - @ door design . unlike the tj @ - @ vehicle , the new jk storm has a much higher axle load , in part due to the @ - @ door shock absorb , springs and springs , especially for an armored vehicle . it features a new 1 . 8l vm motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission . like the mark ii , the mark iii was initially available only to the idf with production slated to be sold to the israeli army by 2009 . the civilian version would only be available if the israeli weapons system was upgraded to allow it to compete with civilian vehicles of the same model . israel stated that if such a thing would happen , a diesel powered version could be built . for export markets , the storm truck has already seen sales in several countries , mostly in the civilian version . a number of the j8 ' s were tested by israeli automotive magazine jeepolog . com , in may 2009 . it was called " wow , the fastest truck ever " . = = = commander version = = = the commander version features a five @ -

@ - @ united states , resulting in record rainfall and possibly making the september storm the strongest in new england history . this storm would also be the strongest in the entire season, with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) and a peripheral central pressure of 961 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @ . @ 39 inhg ) , making it a high @ - @ end category 1 hurricane on the high @ - @ end saffir – national hurricane wind scale . activity decreased in september , when a tropical storm passed through portions of the canadian arctic , resulting in significant damage and infrastructural damage . two tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm strength were reported in october , though neither resulted in fatalities . collectively , storms during the 1939 season caused four deaths and $ 1 @ . @ 329 million in damage . the 1940 north carolina hurricane , which passed through portions of the southeastern united states in august , was the most powerful and intense of the tropical cyclones . = = = = = = = = tropical depression one = = = on may 18 , a tropical depression @ - @ end area was observed south of bermuda . moving westward , the system became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical storm by 1200 utc on may 19 , south of rhode island . at the time , ship reports indicated that the system had a weak @ - @ end surface circulation , with the strongest winds occurring within the outer portion of the eye . moving westward , the tropical storm gradually intensified and reached maximum sustained winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) by 0000 utc on may 20 . the italian ship s . s . lubrafol reported a peripheral central pressure of 996 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @ . @ 39 inhg ) ; this was the lowest pressure reported in association with the storm . the next day , the tropical storm briefly moved towards the extreme @ - @ end before turning back towards a westward track . at the same time , the system decreased in size and began to transition into an extratropical cyclone . by 1200 utc , the system completed its extratropical transition , due to the entrainment of dry air . the remnant low persisted until 0600 utc on august 3 . = = = hurricane one = = = on august 3 , the extratropical cyclone developed into a tropical depression off the west coast of florida . initially a weak system , it moved generally westward , gradually increasing in strength . early on august 4 , the system reached tropical storm strength . ships in the vicinity of the system reported a much stronger tropical storm than initially expected . after reaching hurricane strength on august 5 south of the mississippi river delta , the storm moved westward intoa modern @ - @ day category 1 hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mbar ( hpa ; 4 @ . @ 3 inhg ) at 0600 utc on august 8 . the hurricane moved ashore near sabine pass , texas later that day at peak strength . moving westward , the hurricane made a sharp turn to the northeast and gradually weakened , weakening into a tropical storm on august 9 before passing over texas on august 10 . warnings of a possible tropical storm along the united states gulf coast prompted hundreds of residents in low @ - @ lying areas to evacuate prior to the hurricane moving ashore . however , the hurricane produced rough seas and a strong storm surge , peaking at 4 @ . @ 3 ft ( 1 @ . @ 1 m ) along the eastern shore of lake pontchartrain . the resulting high tides flooded several of louisiana ' s barrier islands , inundating them . the winds caused significant infrastructural damage , primarily in louisiana , and the damage was limited to road infrastructure along the u . s . gulf coast which were damaged by the hurricane . however , most of the property and infrastructure damage caused by the hurricane was due to the heavy rains it produced in low @ - @ lying areas , setting off flash flooding . rainfall peaked at 29 @ . @ 5 in ( 953 mm ) on sabine island , texas , making it the strongest tropical storm in louisiana history . three different weather stations in both texas and louisiana observed $ 1 @ - @ day rainfall totals for the month of august as a result of the slow @ - @ day hurricane . crops , livestock , and crops – . cotton , corn , and pecan in – were heavily damaged . other crops were also damaged by the hurricane . overall , the hurricane caused $ 1 @ . @ 1 million in damage and two deaths . = = = hurricane force = = = a hurricane of unknown cape verde origin was observed near the virgin islands at 1800 utc on august 7 . initially moving westward , the tropical storm slowly increased in strength before making a sharp turn towards the northeast on august 8 . the storm continued on a westward track until a slight weakening turned it in a more northward direction on august 10 . shortly thereafter , the tropical storm reached peak intensity as a modern @ - @ day category 2 hurricane . the storm then made landfall at peak intensity near hilton head island , south carolina at 2030 utc on august 11 . at the time , the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100winds ( 85 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 972 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @ . @ 71 inhg ) , equivalent to a modern @ - @ day category 1 hurricane . once inland , the tropical cyclone rapidly weakened , and turned westward before passing over the appalachian mountains on august 27 . the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the southeastern united states , causing extensive flooding in the region . the storm is considered the strongest to occur in the region in at least 50 years . rainfall peaked at 28 @ . @ 21 in ( 525 mm ) in idlewild , north carolina . the heavy rainfall caused rivers to significantly exceed their normal flood levels , destroying some homes . most of the deaths occurred in north carolina , where two people drowned . transportation was disrupted as a result of the debris scattered by the winds and rainfall . in halifax county alone , 40 % of homes were washed away . overall , the storm caused four deaths and $ 1 million in damage . = = = hurricane damage = = = on august 27 , a modern @ - @ day system over the eastern atlantic ocean became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression . moving generally in a near - @ - @ day direction , the depression intensified , reaching tropical storm status on august 28 and then hurricane status on august 29 . the storm passed within 85 mi ( 137 km ) of cape hatteras before turning towards the northeast . however , the storm continued to strengthen , and reached peak intensity as a modern @ - @ day category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 961 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @ . @ 71 inhg ) , although these two records were set at different times on september 2 . afterwards , the tropical cyclone began a weakening trend as it moved westward , and had transitioned into a tropical storm by the time it made its final landfall on nova scotia later that day . the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day , making a landfall on new brunswick . the extratropical cyclone moved into quebec before merging with a larger extratropical cyclone early on september 3 . despite not making landfall in the united states , the storm caused significant damage . several emergency measures were taken in the region , particularly in new england . the emergency measures were due in part to concerns that damage from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane which struck the region several days earlier . much of the damage associated with the stormoccurred in new jersey , where the combination of moisture from the storm and a cold front produced heavy rainfall , peaking at 24 in ( 610 mm ) in the town of ewan . this would make the total the highest in american history . the resulting rainfall damaged infrastructure , primarily to telephone lines . damage in the state amounted to $ 1 million . further north in new york , strong winds were reported , though damage was minimal . although the storm made two landfalls in atlantic canada , damage too was minor , and was limited to two boat accidents caused by high waves . overall , the storm caused $ 1 @ . @ 05 million in damage , mostly due to flooding in new england , and two deaths . = = = = = = = = a tropical disturbance was first noted east of the lesser antilles on september 13 , although at the time , reports in the area were rare . the storm gradually intensified through much of its early development stages , reaching tropical storm strength on september 14 ; further development into a hurricane east of puerto rico occurred two days later . shortly thereafter , the storm turned northward , and reached peak intensity the next day as a hurricane @ - @ day category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of at least 988 mbar ( hpa ; 1 @ . @ 3 inhg ) . the storm gradually turned northward , making landfall in nova scotia on september 17 with winds of 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) . emerging into the gulf of saint lawrence later that day , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . the remnant low turned westward and passed over newfoundland before emerging into the atlantic on september 19 . passing east of the united states east coast , the hurricane caused several shipping accidents , most notably the sinking of the passenger ship laponia south of cape hatteras , north carolina on september 18 . two other shipping incidents resulted in two deaths . the storm also brought sustained winds of tropical storm @ - @ day and rainfall to portions of new england . in atlantic canada , a strong storm surge estimated at 4 ft ( 1 @ . @ 2 m ) on average sank or damaged several ships and coastal infrastructure . in new brunswick , the waves hurt the local fishing industry . in nova scotia , the waves disrupted communications and transportation services . the waves also severely damaged crops . about half of agricultural production in annapolis royal was destroyed during the storm , resulting in about $ 1 @ . @ 1 million in crop losses . strong winds in new brunswick caused widespreadto moderate infrastructural damage , and significant damage to crops further inland . overall , the storm caused three fatalities , with two out of the united states and one in new zealand . = = = = storm damage = = = a slow moving tropical depression developed in the western caribbean sea , south of bluefields , florida at 1200 utc on september 19 . the next day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm at 0600 utc . the tropical storm made landfall on the west coast of nicaragua at 1400 utc , with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . the storm weakened to a tropical depression over land , but reintensified back to tropical storm strength upon emerging into the gulf of mexico on september 20 . the storm ' s slow motion caused it to make a second landfall near the border of belize and british honduras at 0300 utc on september 22 as a slightly stronger hurricane with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) ; this would be the storm ' s peak intensity . near the yucatan peninsula , the tropical storm low @ - @ peaked , but quickly weakened once more as it entered the gulf of mexico . in the gulf , the storm made a sharp turn northward , before making its final landfall near shreveport , louisiana at 0900 utc on september 24 with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 1002 mbar ( hpa ; low @ . @ 12 inhg ) . moving inland , the tropical depression turned westward and weakened before dissipating the next day , and being absorbed by a frontal system . upon making landfall , the tropical storm produced strong winds over a large area . the strongest winds were reported from a station near san antonio , texas , which reported 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) winds , far away from the storm ' s center ; these strong winds were probably due to shear . heavy rainfall was also reported , though the rainfall mostly fell to the west of the main tropical storm . it peaked at 10 in ( 254 mm ) in ville marie , louisiana . the tropical storm spawned three tornadoes in the southeastern united states which collecitvely caused $ 1 @ , @ 000 in damage and caused two deaths . two of the tornadoes formed in mississippi and one formed in alabama . two other people were also killed by the storm . = = = wind damage = = = in late september , a tropical depression developed over the eastern atlantic ocean . the low @ -
