" " ramblin ' man " is a conversation between an actor ( the voice of fred deakin — voice of lemon jelly ' s fred deakin ) and " fred the ramblin ' man " ( the voice of standing ) , during which standing describes the elements fromaround the world , ranging from " from small dutch towns to big american cities . " when placed in the order in which the songs are recorded , the phrase " bagpuss does strange things " is spelled out halfway through the album ( from brixton at four minutes ten seconds , to san jose at four minutes ten seconds ) , the first syllable of each word . the final track , " true to life " , contains some re @ - @ - experimentation . the track " bad day for me " is built around a melody inspired by david langstaff ' s song " all the ducks " . this song is based on the traditional dutch children ' s song , " alle eendjes zwemmen in the water " ( english : " all the ducks are swimming in the water " ) . franglen has said that he and deakin were drawn to langstaff ' s song because it " had a certain edge to it , almost magical " . the band also tried to use langstaff ' s sample for recording , but were unable to . in the end , they had enn reitel and @ - @ record the title track . franglen , while admitting that reitel ' s sample was good , said that once the song was re @ - @ recorded , the " message disappeared " . " patient # 1 " , perhaps the album ' s best track , is a re - creation of a hospital and the side effects of an experimental drug given to the patient ; the song describes how the patient goes from depression , to an " overwhelming sense of re @ - @ love and happiness " , before eventually dying . the album closes with " the return of d ' zar " , which features " a full @ - @ vocal range , and complex drum patterns " . = = = = = = = = positive = = = = lost souls received generally positive reviews from music critics , although some reviewers noted the album ' s re @ - @ - experimentation . rick anderson of allmusic called the album " a fun if slightly odd mix of rock music , vintage funk , electronic sounds , with some electronic influences . " a reviewer for entertainment . ie praised the band for exploring electronica from a different angle , saying , " this new @ - @ - band uses grand pianos , acoustic guitars and electronic sounds to enhance the @ - @ - instrumentals enough to satisfy even the most humble of listeners . [ .. . ] what really distinguishes lemon jelly as their musical contemporaries is their wry sense of humor , which they use to sum up their sound with the [ sic ] blend of nursery rhymes , garage rock and clever lyrics . andrew wyse of the guardian wrote , " everything is simple and well done , and new order combines that with some amazing elements : amazing string arrangements , amazing singing , and sound effects . " chris dahlen of pitchfork media felt that the album was a bit too heavy at times , but that it was " the perfect album to sleep on , your first @ - @ - ultrachill - ep that will put the whole world to sleep . it ' s got 30 minutes of electronic pop , disco beats hitting the floor like bullets , and a big fat smiley face that pops up . " many critics singled out " nice weather for ducks " as the album ' s stand @ - @ best track . mason cited the " slow , sweet , @ - @ pop " song as one of the album ' s highlights in his review . dahlen described it as " the most memorable " on the album , and wrote that it was " a stand @ - @ slappy gem of a song that perfectly sums this album up : fun , funny , and very funny . " wysel concluded , " when the light shine on ' nice weather for ducks ' it is hard to believe there is any light in the world . " however , some critics felt that " the number one " did not fit with the mood of the rest of the album . wysel called it a " string of surprises " that " comes as quite a surprise . " dahlen wrote that the song was " easily the best thing about the [ album ' s ] sound . " while he praised the song ' s lyrics , calling it " so dark and dark that it ' s more interesting than the rest of the album " , he felt that it was " easily boring . " mason , on the other hand , called the song " fun " and " fun " with " lyrics . . . so well written that [ the song ] works " . = = = sales and airplay = = = in the uk , the album charted at number 13 on the albums chart . in the us , it charted at number 2 on the billboard top independent albums chart . in both countries , it was the first lemon jelly album to do so . the album ' s two singles , "" money " and " no place for me " , also managed to chart on the uk singles chart , reaching numbers 14 and 12 respectively . however , this was a disappointment for the group . on 22 july 2002 the album was certified platinum . nearly 20 years later , on 22 july 2013 , it was certified gold , for sales of over 100 @ , @ 000 . in 2003 , the album was nominated for the mercury music prize , although the album lost to dizzee q ' s album in my life . = = track listing = = = = production and personnel = = = = = = =
