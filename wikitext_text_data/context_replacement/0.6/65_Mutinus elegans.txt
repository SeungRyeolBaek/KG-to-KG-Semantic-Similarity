= = elegans = = elegans , commonly known as the devil mushroom , the devil mushroom , the dog mushroom , or the devil ' s mushroom , is a species of fungus in the mushroom family . a widespread species , it is commonly found growing on the ground , often in small groups on plant debris or leaf litter , during summer and autumn in asia , europe , and eastern north america . the fruit body begins its life in an " oval " shape , resembling roughly a dog partially buried in the ground . as the mushroom grows , a bright red to orange cylindrical stalk forms that narrows down to a pointed tip . the stalk is covered with a 0 @ - @ shaped , white egg print on the upper half of its surface . flies and other insects feed upon the stalk which carries the spores , aiding in their dispersal . due to their poisonous properties , mature specimens are not generally considered edible , although there are reports of the young " eggs " being edible . in the wild , = elegans has been known to inhibit the growth of other fungi that may be harmful to humans . = = = = = = elegans was first described by english naturalist john latham in 1679 who wrote the natural history of america ; this first description is believed to be the first record of the fungus in north america . it was first described formally by french botanist , jean francois camille montagne in 1856 , who named it corynites elegans . the species name probably refers to the roman god , jupiter mutunus , one of the four di indigetes mentioned by roman mythology . the species is also known variously as the " dog mushroom " , the " dog mushroom " , the " devil mushroom " , and the " devil ' s mushroom " . the specific epithet elegans is derived from the latin , meaning " elegant " or " beautiful " . = = = = = the young fruit bodies are roughly oval and white , 0 @ - @ shaped , partially buried in the soil , with dimensions of 2 to 5 cm ( 0 @ . @ 1 to 0 @ . @ 2 in ) by 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ 4 to 0 @ . @ 6 in ) . as the fruit body grows , the spores expands and the number 0 @ - @ becomes theyoung ; fully grown , it may be from 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ 0 to 0 @ . @ 6 in ) long and 1 @ . @ 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @ . @ 6 to 0 @ . @ 7 in ) wide . the stalk is slender and slightly convex above ; the shape is similar throughout , but it gradually narrows to a rounded shape with a small notch at the base . the upper surface of the stalk is bright yellow to bright orange , and the color gradually loses , fading into dull red brown . the stalk may be straight , or slightly curved . a dark 0 @ - @ brown ring covers the upper surface of the stalk in fully grown specimens . the gills of the " egg " form a ring at the base of the stalk . the taste of the fungus is unpleasant ; one source describes it as " very sweet and bitter " . the spores have a 0 @ - @ brown ring . fruit bodies are attached to the stalk by short cords that resemble tree roots . botanist john smith notes that the spores are very difficult to harvest , sometimes taking one to two days before the cap opens . the spores are about – mm , or – @ µm , 0 @ - @ brown , smooth , and embedded in the stem . a 1982 study found that spores of species in the same genus , including most elegans , have a circular scar ( 0 @ . @ . – ##0 @ . @ . µm . ) that is visible with scanning electron microscopy . the circular scar is a small scar at the base of the stalk , and it most commonly forms during the attachment of the stalk of the stem to the sterigma of the spores . = = = = = = = the two 0 @ - @ forms of most elegans are edible , or " not edible " . some field guides note that the eggs of the two forms " smell like the eggs that are attached to them . " the strong odor of the eggs would likely be harmful to humans , although they are not considered edible . = = = type species = = = the " egg ##wood " ( = caninus ) is smaller , has a more pointed or 0 @ - @ brown ring , a shorter stalk and lacks the red color of c . elegans ; it has none of the color produced by gle##ba . the surface of the stalk and the spores print are smooth in m . caninus , compared to " rough " in m . elegans . m . caninus is much less hairy than m . elegans . the bambusinus is similar in size and appearance , but it does not have a clear white border between the upper and lower parts of the stalk ; instead , the upper part has different colors . the stalk of m . ravenelii is less hairy than m . elegans , and it has a clearly visible white cap . = = distribution and distribution = = . elegans is found — producing spores by breaking down dead or rotting organic matter . it is commonly found in woods and other areas covered with soil , in wood @ - @ by wood and wood , and in wood chips . a japanese researcher reported its presence in takatsuki and okinawa @ - @ fu , where it occurs in november and december on the ground along roads and other open spaces , on or near bamboo ( bamboo bambusoides ) and trees such as the white pine , the birch zelkova , and the plane tree . this widespread mushroom has been collected in eastern north america , in the region stretching from maine to florida and west to the great lakes , illinois , and wisconsin . in europe , it has been collected from germany and in asia , it has been collected from japan . = = biological description = = a study of several different mushrooms found that . elegans was the first mushroom to show defensive ( both fungal and bacterial ) activity against all the organisms studied , including , the fungal pathogen bacteris ##cin complex , fungi subtilis , tuberculosis aureus , e coli , genus typhimurium and the bacterial genus albicans . = the boat race 1900 = the 57th boat race took place on 1 june 1900 . held annually , the boat race is a side @ - @ - @ - @ by boat race between crews from the universities of oxford and cambridge on the river thames . cambridge won by ten seconds in a side @ - @ by time of 3 minutes 30 seconds , taking the overall record for the event to twenty – seconds in oxford ' s favour . = = = = = the boat race is a side @ - @ by@ - @ is the competition between the university of oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " dark blues " ) and the university of cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " light blues " ) . the race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @ . @ and @ - @ . ( 4 @ . @ - miles ) rowing course on the river thames in southwest london . the rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and known throughout the united kingdom and worldwide . cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1899 race by two @ - @ and @ - @ and @ - @ - lengths , while oxford led overall with 31 victories to cambridge ' s 29 ( including the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . leading up to the race , oxford suffered a series of injuries : j . w . mcthornhill was advised by his doctor not to race , h . h . dutton was injured and rower felix warre contracted scarlet fever . oxford were coached by john henry smith , who had played for the dark blues five times between 1872 and 1874 , and william muttlebury , an @ - @ time blue for cambridge between 1886 and 1890 . oxford ' s captains were harcourt gilbey ##s ( light blues captain the previous year and five @ - @ time blue ) and john mclean ( an oxford captain three times between 1883 and 1887 ) . the umpire for the race for the fifth year in a row was william willan who had won the race five previous times , rowing for oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races . = = = = = the oxford crew weighed an average of 1 st . @ . @ 625 pounds ( 0 @ . @ 28 kg ) , 1 @ . @ 12 pounds ( 0 @ . @ 11 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . cambridge ' s crew included three men with boat race experience : j . w . dutton , j . j . tomlkinson and john w . h . maclagan . cambridge saw two of their 1899 crew members , john william dudley smith and raymond william etherington @ - @ - , both of whom were rowing in their 1899 crews . seven of the eight dark blues were graduates of trinity college . cambridge ' s cox h . h . dutton , a native of south africa , was the only cambridge @ - @ - rower rowing in the race . author and former oxford rower john drinkwater wrote that this year ' s cambridge crew , along with the oxford boat which rowed inthe 1897 crew , " was in first class for themselves among british universities . " he later described the 1897 race as " one of the best that ever came from the university " . = = = = = oxford won the toss and elected to start from the surrey station , handing the middlesex side of the river to cambridge . in wet weather , captain willan ordered the race under way at 1 : 00 p . m . whereupon oxford took the lead again . at the finish they were two lengths ahead and began to pull away from the light blues , to win by two lengths in a time of 18 minutes 45 seconds . it was the fastest winning time in the history of the race , beating that set by cambridge in the 1893 race . although it was the light blues ' sixth consecutive victory , it began a run of five consecutive victories for cambridge – which the dark blues won by – seconds .
