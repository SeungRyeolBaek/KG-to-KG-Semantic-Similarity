@ feodosiya operation krasnyi kavkaz went into the bay of feodosiya on 31 december 1941 and transported troops and provided gunfire support for the troops coming ashore . she was hit several times by german artillery and mortar fire in december . between 1 and 3 january she carried supplies and reinforcements for the soviet forces on the kerch peninsula . on the return voyage she was badly damaged by three german ju 87 stuka anti @ - @ aircraft from i . / stg 1 . the anti @ - @ hits each to her stern , her bow , her starboard propeller shaft , blew out her boilers and opened such holes in her hull that they caused her draught to increase by 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . she made it to novorossiysk , escorted by the destroyer sposobnyi , where she was broken up enough to return to poti where more extensive repairs could be made . these lasted until march 1942 and the decision was taken to remove her anti @ -

@ and plans to upgrade the southern portion of route 4 to freeway standards by adding ramps at oak hill road and at allenton road and agrade intersection with us 1 . although the project was originally scheduled to be completed in 2007 , the $ 100 million project has been delayed indefinitely . = = route 4 = = route 4 begins at a fork in the alignment of u . s . route 1 in the town of north greenwich ; the two northbound lanes of us 1 continue onto route 4 southbound , with the four @ -

@ mile ( 4 @ . @ 7 km ) , four @ - @ lane divided highway south of u . s . route 1 in wickford . construction of the bypass began in 1952 and was completed in 1954 , at which point the highway continued as an elevated divided highway running from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 in wickford . during the late 1950s , a few years after the completion of the bypass , the rhode island department of public works ( ridpw ) proposed a bypass of route 2 , which , at the time , was the busiest highway in the state . no action was taken until 1964 , when the ridpw conducted a study for the " new route 4 " freeway . during the study , traffic still used the old rodman highway , and those headed for the state capital of providence were diverted onto route 2 , an 8 @ - @ mile , four @ - @ lane divided highway near the modern exit 5 . in 1965 , the old route 2 freeway was assigned the route number of route 4 , replacing route 2 on the new highway . a public hearing was held with the governor of rhode island regarding the new freeway , which was to be four lanes and have a wide , wide median . this request was eventually granted , and construction began two years later . construction of the 3 @ . @ - @ - @ mile ( 4 @ . @ 7 km ) arterial section of route 4 from what is now exit 5 in east greenwich to i @ - @ 95 in providence began in 1967 and was completed in 1972 . that year , the 3 @ - @ mile ( 4 @ . @ 8 km ) section south of the modern exit 5 was officially designated as part of route 4 . the old alignment remains largely intact to this day . the section of route 4 from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 at exit 5 ; the only section of the highway that has been significantlyand by the construction of a bridge for amtrak ' s northeast corridor line . by the late 1970s , route 4 was completed north of exit 4 and south of what would become exit 7 , but there was a still - missing link in the highway between the two exits . in the 1980s , the state of rhode island faced both financial problems and environmental concerns , all of which delayed the completion of the missing link for nearly 20 years . feasibility studies on the missing link began in 1977 , and the state estimated that the 1 @ . @ of @ - @ way ( 1 @ . @ - km ) new segment of highway would cost $ 100 – - million ( equivalent to $ 1 – - billion in 2016 ) to build . in 1983 , the rhode island department of transportation ( ridot ) began construction of the new section of route 4 between exits 5 and 6 . the project , which initially went over budget ( $ 20 million ( equivalent to $ 30 million in 2016 ) ) , was funded from a $ 10 million federal grant . in 1986 , during excavation for the new ribbon @ - @ of @ - @ way , the department of transportation found archaeological artifacts from the narragansett culture dating from ad 4 @ , @ 000 to 1 @ , @ 500 years ago . although the tribes were still present in the area , this caused delays for the construction of the highway . on october 1 , 1988 , riodt began construction and held the ribbon @ - @ opening ceremony for the new highway . in august 1990 , two police officers were seriously injured during a robbery on route 4 . the driver was stopped in the left lane of route 4 at exit 7 ; when the driver turned on route 402 ( frenchtown road ) , the police officers got into some trouble in their attempt to stop the driver . following the incident , the american civil liberties union began efforts to change fire fighting tactics and prevent further ribbon @ - @ way accidents for officers in the line of duty . in 2000 , construction began on the quonset expressway , a new route 403 that enters the quonset valley district from exit 7 . the project included the rebuilding and expansion of exit 7 on route 4 , which was the only @ - @ way exit on both route 403 and route 402 when built . the exit was rebuilt into a diamond interchange with access ramps to route 4 , route 403 and route 402 and was completed in late 2008 , one year ahead of schedule . the project included the construction of a new northbound exit 7 on route 403 instead . = = = = = the rhode island department of transportation( ridot ) has laid out long @ - @ range plans for improvements to both the southern and northern portions of route 4 . during the 1980s and 1990s , ridot announced plans to remove the red traffic lights along the southern portion of the highway . the state planned to rebuild the previously existing us 1 and route 4 interchange , turning it into a long @ - @ range interchange with an expressway median . this would cut @ - @ range access to the local roads that crossed us 1 at the interchange . the project also included the replacement of the two other major intersections at west allenton road and oak grove road with ramps ; the interchange for west allenton road was planned to be rebuilt as the new route 4 . during the 1990s , the state purchased and demolished several homes in the area to allow for an improved route 4 from @ - @ of @ - @ range to the vicinity of west allenton road . the freeway project proved to be very unpopular with the ##erly residents who lived along the two main roads . consequently , ridot straightened the highway slightly so that route 4 would bypass major wetlands in the area . this raised environmental concerns , as one of the major wetlands that would be affected , froberg ' s pond , was considered to be of great importance to rhode island residents . despite these and other concerns , ridot still considered the route 4 project to be the best way to improve water flow in the area . although the department of transportation considered upgrading nearby route 4 to interstate standards as a possible solution , this proposal was ultimately rejected because of its impact on flooding in the area . although the project was originally planned to be completed in 2007 , the $ 100 million project has been delayed indefinitely . ridot has announced long @ -
