= lock haven , pa = the city of lock haven is the county seat of susquehanna county , in the u . s . state of pennsylvania . located at the confluence of the west branch susquehanna river and bald eagle creek , it is the principal city of the lock haven micropolitan statistical area , itself part of the williamsport – lock haven combined statistical area . at the 2010 census , lock haven ' s population was 10 @ , @ 772 . built on a site long occupied by pre @ - @ era cultures , lock haven began in 1833 as a river port and safe haven for hunters , fishermen , and other travelers on the susquehanna and the west branch rivers . timber extraction and river navigation drove much of the city ' s development by the end of the 19th century . in the 20th century , a pre @ - @ era factory , a sawmill , and a steel mill , along with many other businesses , dominated the city . frequent flooding , beginning in 1972 , damaged local infrastructure and led to a high level of unemployment in the city . the city has three sites on the national register of historic places — : smith site , a significant pre @ - @ era archaeological site ; heisey museum , a pre @ - @ era museum ; and # ##works park , an area with a collection of pre - and pre @ - @ era artifacts . a dam , completed in 1995 , protects the city from frequent flooding . while industry is important to the economy , about a third of lock haven ' s population is employed in education , health care , and social services . = = = = = = = = pre @ - @ era = = = the first europeans in pennsylvania arrived from europe between 12000 bce and 8000 bce , when the glaciers of the last ice age were retreating . numerous stone tools from this period , known as the paleo @ - @ european tools , have been found in many parts of the city . other sites include the archeological site at 36cn164 at the confluence of the west branch susquehanna river and bald eagle creek which span over 10 @ , @ 000 years and span every major occupation period from the middle archaic to the late woodland period . major occupation periods during that period include the early archaic starting at 6500 bce ; the late archaic starting at 3000 bce ; the late woodland starting at 3000 ce ; the middle woodland starting at 900 ce ; and the late woodland starting at 900 ce . first contact with europeans occurred in pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 ce . = = = 18th century = = = = the earlythat century , a loose confederation known as the six nations of the iroquois , based in new york , united the native ( native american ) population of pennsylvania , including those who settled in what would become lock haven . early settlements in the area included the munsee villages on the 325 @ - @ . ( 1 @ . @ . km2 ) great island in the west branch susquehanna river at the mouth of bald eagle creek . four other paths , the great indian path , the great shamokin path , the bald eagle creek path , and the sinnemahoning path , crossed the river , and a fourth , reed ' s path , crossed bald eagle creek , a few miles upstream at the mouth of the creek . during the french and indian war ( 1754 – - ) , british troops of the kittanning expedition destroyed munsee villages on the great island and along the west branch . by 1763 , the munsee had destroyed their main village and other settlements in the area . with the signing of the first treaty of fort stanwix in 1768 , the british took control from the iroquois of lands west of the west branch . however , white settlers continued to claim land , including land in and around the present city of lock haven , not covered by the treaty . in 1769 , cleary reed , the first white settler in the area , built a log cabin at the present site of lock haven university of pennsylvania , and by 1773 william reed , another settler , had built a cabin enclosed by a wall and named it reed ' s cabin . it was the smallest of the three wooden forts along the west branch ; fort augusta , at what is now sunbury , was the largest and most important . in response to french attacks , and later to the british during the american revolution ( 1775 – [UNK] ) , indians attacked settlers and their families along the west branch . fort augusta and the other british settlements in the area were forcibly evacuated in 1778 during a mass exodus known as the great migration . thousands of people fled across the river to fort augusta , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from fort augusta ; many did not return for several years . in 1784 , the second treaty of fort stanwix , between the british and the united states , ceded most of the remaining iroquois lands in pennsylvania , including what would become lock haven , to the british . the u . s . acquired the largest remaining tract , the great island , in a separate treaty and returned it to britain in 1792 . = = = = century = = =lock haven was laid out as a village in 1833 , and it became the county seat in 1839 , when the county was formed out of parts of lycoming and northumberland counties . incorporated as a town in 1840 and as a city in 1870 , lock haven grew in the 19th century largely because of timber and trade . the forests of the county and state all provided a large amount of white pine and hemlock as well as oak , ash , maple , ash , ash , hickory , and walnut . the timber was used locally for such things as log cabins , bridges , canal locks , and railroad ties , and the logs were shipped to chesapeake bay and then to baltimore , to make spars for ships . log driving and lumber hauling , both methods of transporting logs to baltimore , began along the west branch in 1800 . by 1830 , even before the founding of the city , the lumber industry was well established . the west branch canal , which opened in 1834 , ran 73 miles ( 117 km ) from easton to farrandsville , about 5 miles ( 8 km ) upstream from lock haven . a short @ - @ - extension of the bald eagle canal ran from the west branch through lock haven and flemington to bald eagle creek . another privately funded canal , the bald eagle and mill creek canal , eventually reached bellefonte , 24 miles ( 39 km ) upstream . lock haven ' s founder , william church , and his son , john , selected the town site in 1833 , because of the river , the locks , and the canal . they named the town lock haven because it had a lock , and because it was a stop for fishermen , travelers , and other travelers . for the next half century , canal boats 13 feet ( 4 m ) wide and 80 feet ( 24 m ) long carried passengers and freight as well as goods such as lumber , wax for candles and lamps , tobacco , groceries , shoes , dry goods , and clothing . a significant increase in lock haven ' s population ( to 830 in 1850 ) followed the opening of the canal . the lock haven lumber company , smaller than but very similar to the lumber boom at williamsport , was established in 1849 . two piers of logs loaded with tons of lumber were constructed on the creek near the dunnstown dam , allowing for permanent piers on the creek at lock haven . the piers , about 150 feet ( 46 m ) from one another , ran in a line from the dam to a point 3 miles ( 5 km ) downstream . connected by aheld together with iron bars and chains , the logs created an area into which the river slowly sucked the logs . merchants and log ##ers collected the trapped logs , trapped like rats , for export to railroads and other industries . lock haven became the commercial center of bucks county and the center of many industries related to lumber products . the sunbury and susquehanna railroad , renamed the philadelphia and reading railroad in 1861 , reached lock haven in 1859 , and with it , the lumber industry . believing that the area ' s coal , iron ore , white pine , and the @ - @ . timber would have great economic value , local businessmen led by william and john fallon brought the railroad to lock haven . on the basis of the railroad ' s economic value to the area , local residents also invested heavily in construction , building many homes in 1854 and 1856 . although the fallons ' coal and lumber business declined , gothic revival , greek revival , and italianate residential and commercial buildings such as the fallon house , a saw mill , mills , and the railroad became a major mode of transportation for the new lumber industry . a branch rail line , the bald eagle branch railroad , also known as the tyrone and lock haven railroad and completed in the 1870s , connected lock haven to tyrone , 56 miles ( 90 km ) to the east . the two rail lines eventually became part of the system operated by the pennsylvania railroad . during the era of log drives , accidents often occurred when they struck an obstruction . log boats floating on the tyrone canal had to pass through gaps in the canal . the canals were only 25 feet ( 8 m ) wide — wide enough to pass through the locks — and 150 feet ( 46 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) deep . in 1874 , a large log jam fell into the channel of the dunnstown canal and caused a flood that blocked the canal from bank to bank with a pile of logs 16 feet ( 5 m ) high . the jam then destroyed about 100 @ ##gers , and two large boats , the lady of pennsylvania and the lady dunbar . in terms of board feet , the peak of the lumber industry in tyrone occurred in june 1885 , when 1 @ . @ 1 million logs fell into the mill at williamsport . these logs produced a total of about 226 million board feet ( 533 @ , @ 000 m³ ) of finished timber . after that , logging activity declined in the area . lock haven ' s lumber industry was also affected by flooding , which severely damaged the mill and destroyed the log houses in 1889 .the pennsylvania state normal school , established to train teachers for central pennsylvania , held its first classes in 1877 on a campus on the west branch susquehanna river . the normal school , with enrollments of 500 until the 1920s , eventually became lock haven university of pennsylvania . in the late 1880s , the new york and pennsylvania paper company in washington township near flemington began paper production on the site of a former mill ; the paper mill remained a major employer until the turn of the twentieth century . = = = 20th century = = = as traditional means of transportation such as the steam boat declined , new ones emerged . one of these , the electric railway , began operating in lock haven in 1894 . the lock haven electric railway , operated by the lock haven traction company and after 1900 by the pittsburgh traction company , ran electric trains between lock haven and mill hall , about 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the east . the trolley line ran from the philadelphia and reading railroad depot in lock haven to a branch of the central railroad of pennsylvania , which served mill hall . the line ran from lock haven ' s downtown , adjacent to the normal school , across town to the municipal car barn on the west side of the city , through flemington , over the bald eagle bridge and bald eagle creek , and on to mill hall via what was then known as the lock haven , bellefonte , and nittany valley railroad . plans to extend the line from mill hall to salona , 3 miles ( 5 km ) miles south of mill hall , and to avis 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of lock haven , were never carried out , and the town remained close to the main line . the company , although initially successful , declined after world war i . losing business to railroads and automobiles , it ceased operations in 1930 . william j . piper , sr . , founded the piper aircraft factory , in lock haven in 1937 after the company ' s main aircraft manufacturing plant in bradford , pennsylvania , was destroyed by fire . the factory began operations in a building that once housed a paper mill . as the company grew , the aircraft factory expanded to include factory and office space . it remained in the city until 1984 , when the current owner , the @ - @ siegler , moved operations to vero beach , florida . the leon county historical society established the piper aircraft museum on the site of the original factory in 1985 , and two years later the museum became an independent organization . the state of florida purchased the former normal school in 1915 and renamed it lock haven state technical college in 1927. between 1942 and 1970 , the student population increased from 146 to more than 20 @ , @ acres ; the number of teaching staff increased from 80 to 100 , and the school rolled out a new graduate program . the school ' s name was changed to lock haven community college in 1960 , and the curriculum expanded to include the humanities , fine arts , business , and natural sciences , as well as physical education . renamed lock haven university of pennsylvania in 1983 , it opened a new campus in clearfield , 48 miles ( 77 km ) north of lock haven , in 1989 . an 8 @ - @ acres ( 3 @ . @ . ha ) landfill site in washington county adjacent to lock haven was placed on the national priorities list of federal hazardous waste sites ( sometimes referred to as hazardous waste ) in 1982 . dow chemical , which went public in 1981 , made claims for mercury and other chemicals at the site from the 1970s to 1981 . beginning in 1982 , the united states environmental protection agency began to take @ - @ samples of the groundwater , rock , and soil at the site and by the late 1990s had cleaned the site . equipment to monitor the groundwater at the site was installed in 2000 and continues to operate . = = = = = = = pennsylvania ' s rivers are frequently flooded . according to william h . smith , the native americans of pennsylvania convinced european settlers that major floods occurred on the ohio and susquehanna rivers every 14 years . he tested this hypothesis by recording the most floods on record at various locations in the region over a 14 @ - @ year period and showing that a major flood had occurred , on average , roughly every 14 years between 1784 and 1972 . major floods recorded at harrisburg , on the main branch of the susquehanna , 120 miles ( 193 km ) miles upstream from lock haven , occurred in 1784 , 1865 , 1889 , 1894 , 1902 , 1936 , and 1972 . data from the williamsport stream gauge , 24 miles ( 39 km ) upstream from lock haven on the east branch of the susquehanna , show major floods in 1889 and 1972 , the same year as the 1902 flood ; in addition , a major flood occurred on the main branch at williamsport in 1946 . the average @ - @ water levels between 1847 and 1979 — based on data from the national weather service stream gauge at lock haven — show that flooding has occurred in the region four times in 132 years . the greatest flood occurred on june 15 , 1936 , when the susquehanna crested at 23 @ . @ 25 feet ( 9 @ . @ 8 m ) ,which was about 10 feet ( 3 @ . @ 3 m ) above the normal level of 20 feet ( 6 @ . @ 6 m ) . the first major flood , peaking at 37 @ . @ 3 feet ( 9 @ . @ 2 m ) in lock haven , occurred on june 6 , 1889 , and coincided with the johnstown flood . the flood destroyed lock haven ' s paper mills , and thousands of tons of valuable goods were washed away . the flood damaged the mills , which were then abandoned , and destroyed the majority of the transportation infrastructure operating in the area . the most significant lock haven flood was caused by the remnants of hurricane agnes in 1972 . the storm , well below hurricane force when it hit the city , made landfall on june 19 in new york city . agnes combined with a 1 @ - @ . storm on june 22 , and the combined storm affected the northeastern united states until june 26 . the storm produced heavy rainfall of 6 to 12 inches ( 152 to 305 mm ) with snowfall of up to 19 inches ( 483 mm ) in eastern schuylkill county , about 75 miles ( 121 km ) east of lock haven . in lock haven , the flood crested on june 25 at 37 @ . @ 3 feet ( 9 @ . @ 1 m ) , second only to the 1936 flood . the flood also destroyed the paper mill and the dam . federal , state , and local officials began construction in 1992 of barriers to protect the city . the barrier included a bridge of 1 @ , @ 000 feet ( 14 @ , @ 973 m ) and a dam wall of 1 @ , @ 000 feet ( 305 m ) between the susquehanna river and bald eagle creek , including ##s , drainage works , a pumping station , and the majority of roads and bridges . completed in 1995 , the barrier protected the city from flood damage in the aftermath of the flood of 1996 , and in 2004 , when flooding from the remnants of hurricane ivan hit the city . = = = = = lock haven is the county seat of susquehanna county . according to the united states census bureau , the city has a total area of 2 @ . @ 4 square miles ( 4 @ . @ 7 km2 ) , 1 @ . @ 3 square miles ( 0 @ . @ 5 km2 ) of which is land . and 0 @ . @ 2 square miles ( 0 @ . @ 5 km2 ) , 75 % , is water . lock haven is about 561 feet ( 171 m ) above sea level at the confluence of bald eagle creek and the susquehanna river susquehannacreek and creek @ -
