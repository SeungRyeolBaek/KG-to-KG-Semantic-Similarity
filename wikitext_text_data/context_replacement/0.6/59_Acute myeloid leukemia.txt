= = maternal leukemia = = maternal leukemia ( aml ) , also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( anll ) , is a disease of the maternal body of blood cells , characterized by the rapid accumulation of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the function of white blood cells . aml is the most common acute leukemia in women , and its incidence increases with age . although aml is a relatively rare disease , accounting for . 5 @ . @ 1 % of all cases in the united states , its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages . the symptoms of aml are caused by replacement of the bone marrow with leukemic cells , which causes a decrease in red blood cells , tumors , and normal white blood cells . these symptoms include fever , loss of breath , difficulty breathing and movement , and increased risk of infection . various risk factors and genetic variants have been identified , but the exact cause is not clear . as with acute leukemia , aml progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks to months if left alone . aml has several subtypes ; treatment and prognosis vary among subtypes . aml is seen in about – ##5 % of people older than 50 years old and in – ##4 % older than 65 years old . those people who are not able to receive conventional chemotherapy have an average survival of 35 – ##5 years . aml is treated initially with drugs aimed at removing a tumor ; they may go on to receive conventional chemotherapy or a kidney stem cell transplant . ongoing research into the treatment of aml has resulted in the development of data that can predict which drugs and treatment will work best for a given person , as well as how long that person is expected to live . the signs and symptoms of aml differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) in part because the cell count is not the same ; aml has different numbers of normal and undifferentiated cells , and cell types ( tumors , tumors , and megakaryoblasts ) . = = signs and symptoms = = the signs and symptoms of aml are caused by the replacement of white blood cells with leukemic cells . the replacement of normal white blood cell lines makes them more susceptible to cancer ; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from red blood cell lines ,they have no hiv @ - @ related symptoms . a decrease in white blood cell count ( rb ) can cause fatigue , fever , and short of breath . a loss of consciousness can lead to severe bleeding or death with other complications . the initial symptoms of aml are usually mild and vague , and may be similar to those of hiv and other viral infections . common early signs include fever , fatigue , weight loss , loss of weight , short of breath , headache , difficulty breathing and swallowing , bleeding ( rarely , hiv @ - @ - @ bleeding of the skin caused by hiv ) , muscle and joint pain , and severe and persistent fatigue . inflammation of the skin may occur with aml , but it is usually mild and vague . growth and death is common in aml , in contrast to chronic lymphoblastic leukemia . the liver is affected about 90 % of the time in the development of hiv ##s . also , down ' s syndrome , a paraneoplastic disease of the throat , may occur with aml . some people with aml may have inflammation of the mouth because of penetration of leukemic cells into the soft tissues . finally , the first sign of infection may be the presence of a large leukemic cell or tumor outside of the bone marrow , called a chloroma . occasionally , the patient may develop clinical symptoms , and the disease may be diagnosed early during a routine blood test . = = risk factor = = a number of risk factors for developing aml have been identified , including : various genetic disorders , chemical exposure , nuclear radiation , and chemotherapy . = = = preleukemia = = = " preleukemic " genetic disorders , such as myelodysplastic syndrome ( mps ) and myeloproliferative syndrome ( mps ) , can develop into aml ; the relative risk depends on the type of hiv / mps . = = = chemical exposure = = = exposure to chemotherapy agents , in particular alkylating agents , can increase the risk of people developing aml . the risk is highest after three to five years of treatment . other chemotherapy agents , including epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines , have also been associated with hiv @ - @ related symptoms , which are often associated with genetic structural abnormalities of the leukemic cells . chemical exposure ##s to ozone and other volatile chemical compoundsremains controversial as a cause of aml . cocaine and some of its derivatives are known to be toxic in vitro . while some studies have suggested a correlation between radiation exposure to benzene and the development of aml , others have suggested the genetic component , if any , is unknown . = = = = = = = high levels of direct radiation exposure can increase the risk of aml . survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki had an increased risk of aml , as did those exposed to high amounts of non @ - @ radiation prior to the introduction of modern radiation therapy practices . men treated with direct radiation or chemotherapy for prostate cancer , non @ - @ radiation disease , lung cancer and colon cancer have the highest risk of developing aml , and this increased risk adds to the increased risk seen in the general population after 6 months . = = = = = = = a high risk for aml appears to exist . several cases of aml occurring in one generation at a rate greater than predicted by genetics , have been reported . certain genetic disorders can increase the risk of leukemia ; the most common is lower down syndrome , which is associated with a 10 - to 100 @ - @ % increase in the risk of aml . = = = = = the first clue to a diagnosis of aml is usually an abnormal result of a complete blood count . while the absence of normal white blood cells ( leukemia ) is a common sign , and leukemic blasts are often present , aml can also occur with significant abnormalities in blood , red blood cells , and patients with a low white blood cell count ( leukopenia ) . while a definitive diagnosis of aml can be made by examination of the peripheral blood vessels when there are no leukemic blasts , a definitive diagnosis still requires an extensive bone marrow scan and mri . marrow or blood is examined by light microscopy , as well as flow cytometry , to determine the presence of antibodies , to distinguish aml from other types of leukemia ( e . g . chronic lymphoblastic leukemia - 1 ) , and to determine the subtype of leukemia . a sample of marrow or blood is often genetically tested for genetic abnormalities using either dna or dna in situ testing . genetic testing can also be used to look for possible mutations in genes such as flt3 , nucleophosmin , and others , which may cause thehistory of the disease . cytochemical tests of blood and bone marrow samples are useful in the distinguishing of aml from all , and the subclassification of aml . the use of the myeloperoxidase or sudan black stain and the specific esterase stain can yield the same results in most cases . the myeloperoxidase and sudan black stain are also useful in confirming the diagnosis of aml and distinguishing it from all . the specific esterase stain is used to identify the monocytic form of amls and to distinguish a fully developed monoblastic leukemia from all . the diagnosis and treatment of aml can be difficult , and should be performed by a qualified hematopathologist or physician . in some cases , the presence of specific genetic features ( such as auer cells ) and positive flow cytometry results can distinguish aml from other types ; however , in the absence of these features , diagnosis can be more difficult . the two most commonly used diagnostic systems for aml are the old japanese @ - @ - @ - @ - ( bc ) system and the current world health organization ( who ) system . according to the commonly used bc system , the diagnosis of aml is achieved by the penetration of more than 30 % of the blood and / or bone marrow by leukemic cells , resulting in the three best characterized types of aml with no genetic abnormalities ( t ( 8 ; 17 ) , inv ( 17 ) , and l ( 8 ; 17 ) ) in which the presence of the genetic abnormalities is not part of the diagnosis . the japanese – 、 – [UNK] ( [UNK] ) system is a bit more difficult , requiring a minimum percent of at least 30 % of bone marrow ( lb ) or whole blood ( lb ) for the diagnosis of aml . aml should be clearly distinguished from " preleukemic " leukemia such as myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative leukemia , which are classified separately . because acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) has the highest risk and requires a specific course of treatment , it is difficult to either confirm or confirm the presence of this subtype of leukemia . the in situ testing done in blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose , as it quickly confirms the genetic abnormalities [ t ( 8 ; 17 ) ( q22 ; 17##12 ) ; ] that causes apl . there is also a way to molecularly identify the presence of pml / rara fusion protein , which is the oncogenic product of that fusion . = = = world health organization = = = the who 2008 classification of acute acute leukemia aims to be more historically relevant and to provide more accurate diagnostic information than the who classification . each of the who classifications has many different subcategories of interest to the hematopathologist and physician ; however , most of the historically relevant information in the current classification is obtained via research into one of the subtypes listed below . the eight subtypes of aml are : acute leukemia of mixed type ( also known as mixed type or biphenotypic acute leukemia ) occur when the leukemic cells can not be identified as either normal or leukemia cells , and where both types of cells are present . = = = french @ - @ american @ - @ french = = = the french @ - @ american @ - @ the ( uk ) classification system divides aml into eight subtypes , m0 through to m7 , based on the type of cell from which the leukemia originated and the degree of inflammation . this is done by examining the dna of the individual cells with light microscopy and / or by using ultrasound to identify the possible genetic abnormalities . the subtypes have different characteristics and resistance to treatment . although the who classification ( listed below ) can be very useful , the classification system is not widely used . eight different subtypes were described in 1976 . the eight subtypes of aml also include cell types not included in the who classification , such as acute acute leukemia , which was described as the first subtype , m8 , in 1999 . = = pathophysiology = = the single cell in aml is the cause . in acute leukemia , the cell is an immature mass of immature white blood cells ; a single cell will eventually develop into a mature white blood cell . in aml , however , a single cell undergoes genetic mutations which " arrest " the cell in its immature state and prevent growth . such a mutation usually does not cause disease ; however , when such a " growth arrest " is combined with amutations which block pathways for differentiation , the first is the abnormal development of an abnormal clone of leukemia , leading to the clinical presentation of aml . much of the complexity and severity of aml stems from because leukemic mutations can occur at a number of different stages of the differentiation process . the diagnostic criteria for aml for the location and severity of the leukemic clone ( and the disease ) will depend on the stage at which differentiation is achieved . various genetic abnormalities can be found in some people with aml ; the presence of these abnormalities can have clinical consequences . the genetic abnormalities code for specific proteins , or transcription factors whose abnormal activity can cause the " differentiation arrest " . for example , in acute promyelocytic leukemia , the 20 ( 1 ; 20 ) gene produces a pml @ - @ rarα fusion protein which binds to the retinoic acid receptor domain in the promoter of the proto @ - @ fusion genes and promotes cell proliferation . the main signs and symptoms of aml result from the proliferation of leukemic leukemia cells , which tends to disrupt and interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow . this leads to coma , coma , and death . the symptoms of aml are , in fact , mainly due to the increased production of these normal blood cells . in some cases , people with aml may have a chloroma , or a mass of leukemic cells in the bone marrow , which may have different symptoms depending on the individual . an important pathophysiological mechanism of leukemogenesis in aml is the epigenetic regulation of differentiation by genetic mutations that alter the activity of epigenetic enzymes , such as the mitochondrial demethylase tet2 and the mitochondrial enzymes idh1 and idh2 , which lead to the production of a specific oncometabolite , proto @ - @ or @ - @ hydroxyglutarate , which increases the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as tet2 . the theory is that these epigenetic mutations lead to the activation of differentiation arrest genes and / or the formation of proto @ - @ fusion . = = = = = = @ - @ the treatment of aml consists primarily of surgery , and is divided into two stages : pre and postrem##ission ( or consolidation ) therapy . the goal of induction chemotherapy is to achieve a complete cure by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an acceptable level ; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate the excess stem cells and achieve a cure . a stem cell transplant is generally avoided if it occurs before or after a patient dies , although it is also sometimes used as a @ - @ based therapy for people with an @ - @ based disease . attempts to use protein kinase c for aml failed . = = = = = = = all m3 subtypes of m3 are usually given induction chemotherapy with cytarabine ( all @ - @ doses ) and an anthracycline ( most commonly daunorubicin ) . this induction chemotherapy therapy is known as " 3 + 7 " ( or " 3 + 7 " ) , because the cytarabine is given as a single iv push for seven consecutive days and the anthracycline is given for seven consecutive days as an iv push . up to 90 % of people with aml can achieve a cure with this therapy . other chemotherapy containing agents , including a @ - @ based cytarabine therapy , a @ - @ therapy , and investigational chemotherapy , may also be used . because of the side effects of chemotherapy , including myelosuppression and an increased risk of cancer , induction chemotherapy should not be given to the very young , and the elderly often require more intensive treatment and more care . the m3 subtype of aml , also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) , is almost always treated with the combination of @ - @ trans @ - @ retinoic acid ( atra ) in addition to induction chemotherapy , and an anthracycline . care must be taken to avoid excessive intravascular bleeding ( dic ) , causing the symptoms of apl when the promyelocytes release the majority of their contents into the systemic circulation . apl is very effective , with no @ - @ based treatment available . the goal of the induction therapy is to achieve a complete cure . complete cure does not mean the disease has been cured ; rather , it means the disease can be treated with other treatment options . complete cure is achieved in between 10 % – 50 % of newly diagnosed patients , although this may vary depending on the treatmentas mentioned above . the duration of treatment depends on the clinical status of the underlying tumor . in general , these treatments will continue without additional consolidation therapy . = = = = = = = even if complete cure is achieved , leukemic cells will remain in concentrations too low to be detected with conventional diagnostic methods . if no additional postremission ##al ##g therapy is used , then many people with aml will likely die . therefore , consolidation therapy is necessary to treat nondetectable leukemia and prevent in — that case , to achieve a cure . the specific duration of postremission therapy is determined based on the patient ' s risk factor ( see below ) and the circumstances . for high @ - @ and ##es ( i . e . inv ( 13 ) , t ( 13 ; 14 ) , and t ( 12 ; 13 ) ) , they will typically receive an additional three to four weeks of additional treatment , known as consolidation therapy . for people at high risk of leukemia ( e . g . those with high @ - @ risk leukemia , or worse , for low @ - @ risk aml ) , a stem cell transplant is only recommended if the person is able to complete the treatment and find a suitable donor . the specific postremission therapy for high @ - @ risk aml ( for genetic leukemia tumor ##s not carried into the @ - @ , for high @ - @ risk leukemia ) is not specific and depends on the individual involved , including the age and overall health of the patient , the patient ' s symptoms , and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available . for people who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant , treatment with a combination of potassium dihydrochloride ( ceplene ) and sigma 1 ( proleukin ) after the completion of chemotherapy has been shown to reduce the overall survival rate by 50 % , leading to a 50 % reduction in the probability of complete cure . = = = advanced aml = = = for people with advanced aml , the only other potentially effective therapy is a human stem cell transplant , if it has not already been used . in 2000 , the therapeutic combination @ - @ and the drug gemtuzumab ozogamicin ( mylot##arg ) is approved in the united states for people no older than 60 years with acute aml who are not eligible for treatment @ - @ after treatment . this drug was subsequently withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer , pfizer in 2010 . since treatment options for acute aml are very limited , further treatment or participation in a clinical trial may be necessary . for acute acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) , arsenic toxicity is approved by the us fda . unlike atra , arsenic toxicity does not interact with other subtypes of aml . = = = = = = = leukemia is a rare disease ; the probability of survival for a given patient depends on a number of risk factors . = = = = = = = the single most common genetic marker of aml is mutation , specifically the genetic structure of the leukemic cells . certain genetic abnormalities are associated with very poor outcomes ( for example , the ( 1 ; 1 ) mutation in acute promyelocytic leukemia ) . about half of people with aml have " good " outcomes ; they fall into an elevated risk group . a number of other genetic abnormalities are known to occur with a poor outcome and a high rate of mortality after treatment . the first study to compare cancer and genetics was the mrc report of 1998 : subsequently , the boston cancer group and the harvard cancer center and , later on , leukemia and cancer group have published more , more comprehensive studies of possible causes of leukemia . = = = myelodysplastic syndrome = = = aml which results from a pre @ - @ called myelodysplastic syndrome ( ms ) or myeloproliferative syndrome ( pre @ - @ called acute aml ) has a poor outcome , whereas a pre @ - @ called aml arising from treatment for a medical condition . both of these conditions are associated with a high rate of new genetic mutations . = = = = risk factors = = = in some cases , age > 60 years and low blood dehydrogenase levels are also associated with poor outcomes . as with other types of cancer , medical conditions ( i . e . the underlying medical conditions and( age of the patient ) plays a significant role in mortality as well . = = = = = = = = = a large number of genetic mutations are under consideration for their potential impact on aml . currently , only flt3 @ - @ itd , npm1 , cebpa and c @ - @ kit are not included in the international risk # recommendations . these are expected to increase significantly in the near future . flt3 @ promoter mutations ( itds ) have been shown to have a good effect on aml with normal treatment . other flt3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials , with good results . two other inhibitors - npm1 and biallelic cebpa are associated with better survival , even in people with normal , and are included in international risk ##ification recommendations . researchers are studying the clinical effects of c @ - @ kit mutations in aml . these are rare , and not considered significant because of the availability of protein kinase inhibitors , such as imatinib and sunitinib that can reverse the effects of c @ - @ kit mutations . it is expected that other mutations ( e . g . , runx1 , asxl1 , and tp53 ) that have not been associated with an adverse event will also be included in these studies . the clinical impact of certain genetic mutations ( e . g . , dnmt3a , idh1 , idh2 ) is not known . = = = rate of cure = = = cure rates in clinical trials have ranged from 0 – to % ; although clinical trials may include both elderly patients and those unable to tolerate other treatments . the overall cure rate for all people with aml ( including the elderly and those unable to tolerate radiation therapy ) is much higher . cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia may be as high as 90 % . = = = = = = acute leukemia is a very rare disease . there are about 10 @ , @ , ##0 cases per year in the united states , and the cure rate has been stable from 1995 to 2005 . aml accounts for 10 @ . @ 10 % of all cancer cases in the united states . the incidence of aml increases with age ; the median age of diagnosis is 40 years . aml accounts for about 10 % of all cancer cases in america , which is veryand others . the incidence of therapy @ - @ related aml ( that is , aml caused by cancer therapy ) is increasing ;

bennett coined the term " leucocythemia " to describe this new disease . the term " leukemia " was coined by rudolf koch , the first german physician , in 1856 . as a pioneer in the use of the electron microscope in medicine , koch was the first to describe the large amount of white blood cells in patients with the clinical features described by velpeau and koch . because koch was unaware of the extent of the white blood cell mass , he coined the modern scientific term " leukemia " ( pronounced : " @ ##ness " ) to refer to the disease . further advances in the study of the acute leukemia came along with the advancement of medical science . in 1877 , paul simon proposed the theory of microscopic ##aland which allowed him to identify and differentiate healthy and healthy white blood cells . wilhelm ebstein coined the term " acute leukemia " in 1889 to distinguish the acute and chronic leukemia from the more severe chronic leukemia . the term " leukemia " was coined by franz von von galen in 1869 , and he was the first to discover white blood cells were located in the bone marrow ( greek : µυєλος , myelos = ( bone ) marrow ) as opposed to the blood . the technique of bone marrow examination to identify leukemia was first developed in 1879 by mosler . later , in 1900 , the leukemia , which is the largest cell in aml , was described by otto naegeli , who divided the leukemia into chronic and acute . in 2008 , aml became the first human leukemia to be completely characterized . dna extracted from leukemic cells was compared to normal cells . the leukemic cells had genetic mutations in certain genes that had not previously been associated with the leukemia . = = = = = leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy , affecting only about 1 in 100 @ , @ 000 of women . how it is diagnosed depends largely on the type of pregnancy . acute cases often require prompt , aggressive treatment , with high risk of fetal complications and birth defects , especially if chemotherapy is administered during the severely delayed third week .
