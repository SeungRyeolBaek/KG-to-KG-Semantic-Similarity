@ leg spin bowler , somerset called up leg spin josh taylor to make his twenty20 debut in their first match of the season . taylor took five wickets in theonly to see somerset won by one wicket , and finished the tournament with england ' s best bowler @ - @ - - @ - @ , with nine wickets . despite a number of good performances from somerset ' s players , no player was awarded man of the match in any of the team ' s matches : james hildreth , craig kieswetter and marcus trescothick were all awarded the award once , while zander de bruyn picked up the award on three occasions . somerset finished the group stage with three wins , three draws and one no result , placing them third in the north / south / west group . they qualified for the bowl @ - @ final as they were the joint top @ - @ - team in the qualifying group . somerset ' s first @ - @ final , against sussex , was scheduled for saturday 22 june 2009 . bad weather meant that no play was possible on either the tuesday or wednesday , as a result of which the county sought special permission from the ecb for an extra rest day on the wednesday , which was granted . the bad weather continued , forcing the county to play the bowl @ - @ final . each team had to field three players , each of whom bowled three overs with a number of different boundaries . somerset won the bowl @ - @ final by – three , with michael phillips , james trego and willoughby each hitting the ball once , and thomas hitting them twice . in the first bowl @ - @ final of 2009 ashes series , somerset won the toss and elected to bat against kent . strong bowling from phillips and willoughby , as well as the quick bowling of joe denly and michael van jaarsveld , helped to restrict kent to 2 / 13 . on a wet pitch , trescothick played what espncricinfo ' s andrew mcglashan described as a " superb display " , scoring 100 runs off 50 balls . he shared an opening partnership of 62 with justin langer , and by the time of trescothick ' s dismissal in 9 @ . @ 9 overs , they had 50 runs off 50 balls . hildreth and de bruyn added 10 runs to add another 50 runs , and after hildreth was dismissed for 2 , kieswetter scored 10 runs to give somerset victory with two overs remaining . against sussex in the final , somerset once again won the toss and elected to bat . a strong batting performance against sussex , highlighted by dwayne johnson ' s 650 from 10 overs , giving somerset a target of 173 to win . in the early stages of somerset ' s innings , trescothick batted well , making the match " very promising " according to mcglashan . however , when he was caught off target , somerset lost two wickets . a partnership of 67 between de bruyn and trego set somerset for a draw , but when the pair were caught in their overs , their total fell from 104 / 4 to 109 all out . at the start of the tournament , somerset experimented with their bowling tactics , opening the bowling with kieswetter and trescothick for the first two wickets . this opening partnership only passed 20 runs together on one occasion , against glamorgan , and for the rest of the season , kieswetter dropped down the batting order and langer joined trescothick towards the end of the match , forming a partnership that kieswetter said " added a bit of depth to the game , putting a bit of skill at the bat and batting on top " . the more experienced pair passed 20 runs together on four out of five occasions . the team ' s bowling relied heavily on their pace , a fact which cricket writer scyld jones said was important to the match . = = = = best = = = note : pld = played , w = wins , l = losses , t = ties , nr = no result , pts = points , nrr = net run rate . note : teams marked * progressed to the next round of the competition . teams marked † were eliminated from the tournament . = = = = scores and results = = = = = natwest pro40 = = somerset ' s first match of the 2009 natwest pro40 , against nottinghamshire , fell just one run short of the requirement for a victory . needing 248 to win , somerset were well below the required target when rain stopped play in the first over . the team responded well to this run of luck , winning their next two matches by large margins , before losing to essex . having been called in to bat at taunton , three of somerset ' s top five players reached double figures , but none of them managed to pass 50 and the home side were eventually bowled out for 205 . despite taking four wickets during essex ' s innings — at one point leading the visitors 130 / 4 — the bowling of andrew strauss , james anderson and tim phillips pushed essex to somerset ' s target with two wickets remaining . the innings victory meant that somerset won their first match of thesomerset with a chance to take the title . somerset had started well but lost two points in both the division and @ - @ day competitions in 2009 , and could have won the title with victory in their final match . word filtered back to the county side during their final match , against worcestershire , that rivals sussex had lost to them , and that a win against the two @ - @ day opponents would give them the title . the result never seemed likely ; a late collapse to the bowling of somerset players phil taylor and ian blackwell ended any chance for their opponents to claim victory , and gave sussex the title . four of somerset ' s players took 15 or more wickets during the tournament ( michael phillips , 15 ; alfonso thomas , 11 ; charl willoughby , 10 ) , more than any other team in division one . = = = season results = = = note : pld = played , w = wins , t = ties , l = losses , nr = no result , pts = points , nrr = net run rate . note : represents england ( c ) in the natwest pro40 . = = = season results and fixtures = = = = = champions league twenty20 = = by finishing on one @ -
