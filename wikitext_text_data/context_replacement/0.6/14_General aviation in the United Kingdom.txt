= civil aviation in the united kingdom = military aviation in the united kingdom has been defined as any civil aviation activity other than a commercial air carrier , built to a civil or a specification . although the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) excluded any form of commercial aircraft from its definition , private commercial aircraft are also included in the sector of general aviation ( ga ) in the definition . the sector includes commercial jet , rotorcraft , piston and fixed @ - @ engined fixed @ - @ wing aircraft , helicopters of various types , and other than air taxi . air aviation operations include general ( or commercial ) aviation and air transport operations , and account for about half of the total income generated by the sector . other important aviation activities include aerial surveys , such as helicopters and air photography , and flight training , which play an important role in the recruitment of pilots to the commercial air transport ( cat ) industry . hobby aviation is mainly for leisure use and recreation . it has a large hobby aircraft collection , and includes a range of air sports , such as gliding , gliding , and gliding , in which both companies and individuals have competed in international competitions . of the 28 @ , @ 000 registered aircraft operating in the uk , 80 per cent are engaged in ga activities , and collectively the ga fleet accounts for between 1 @ . @ 100 and 2 @ . @ 1 million hours annually . the second most common type of aircraft is the fixed @ - @ engined light aircraft associated with the aviation , but the main source of growth over the last few years has been in the use of more modern aircraft , such as microlights , small model aircraft , and light helicopters . there are 10 @ , @ 000 commercial pilot licence ##s , and 6 @ , @ 000 private commercial pilots . most of the 28 @ , @ 000 people who hold these licenses are also involved in ga activities . although ga operates from more than 2 @ , @ 800 airports and other locations , ranging in size from small regional airports to small airfields , around 90 per cent of the work is undertaken at 134 of the 83 airports . the uk fleet , which is about 7 per cent the size of its us counterpart , employs 2 @ , @ 000 people , and contributes £ ##6 @ . @ 1 billion to the uk economy . ga is regulated by the civil aviation authority ( caa ) , although its powers are being gradually transferred to the european aviation safety authority ( easa ) . the main focus is on issues of safety and pilot training , and the aim is toand higher standards of flying . at the other end of the regulatory spectrum , regulatory authority is available to local bodies , and ga is in transition from a re @ - @ business body to a national regulation under easa . this regulation intended to accommodate the increasing number of airport users has reduced the way over which ga operations can be legally operated . the increase of cats is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the local market , and smaller airports are subject to expansion and re @ - @ expansion for more profitable purposes . the national planning commission has no authority to determine the economic impact of ga air transport operations , and generally does not favour the development of new airports catering to the general public . the planning system has become a tool for addressing the self @ - @ and other issues which , particularly aircraft noise , are the main source of the concern directed at ga . = = history = = the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) defines general aviation ( ga ) as " any aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight and an aerial work operation . " icao defines commercial air transport ( cat ) as " an aircraft operated for the transport of passengers , cargo or cargo for payment or hire " , and aerial work as " an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for various purposes such as manufacturing , forestry , engineering , surveying , navigation and mapping , search and rescue , aerial work , etc . " authorities in the united kingdom ( uk ) define ga in more specific terms that include those of general aviation . the national transport and commercial aviation authority defines ga to mean " all jet and helicopter operations except that performed by the commercial aviation and the charter operators " . the national airports regulatory authority uses the definition " all general aircraft operations other than commercial air transport and re @ - @ commercial air transport flights for payment or hire " . for the development of the current definition of aviation in the uk , the civil aviation authority ( caa ) adopted the definition of ga as " any commercial aviation operation other than a commercial air transport operation according to a destination " , and considered it necessary to depart from the previous definition and include aerial work and other aircraft operations . = = history = = the first ga in the uk was established by the aero club at muswell hill on the isle of sheppey , and in july 1909 it was the site of the first flight recorded in the uk by a private aviator , william re @ - @ brabazon . in 1910 the aero club , granted the ga charter , assumed responsibility for thethey started airfields in the uk , and began issuing the first civil flying certificates . the introduction of the de havilland dh . 60 moth in 1925 encouraged civil aviation , and the royal aero club , realising the " urgent needs of british light aircraft " , started the royal flying schools association . between 1925 and 1939 , 100 flying clubs were formed , and more than 1 @ , @ 000 pilots were trained . during world war ii many airfields were taken over for military use , and military airfields were closed , and civilian ones were built . this resulted in a large number of airfields becoming operational after the war . pre @ - @ and military airfields , for example sywell , were converted to civilian use . many military airfields were closed , and in some cases , for example beccles , almost all @ - @ operated as civilian airfields . the board of civil aviation was established to oversee all civil aviation in the uk , and this responsibility became the responsibility of ga , until the formation of the current caa in 1972 . with this established fleet in place , ga was revived after the 1950s when companies such as cessna and piper introduced powered aircraft intended for the civilian market . the cessna 172 , developed from the late 1920s cessna 172 , was introduced in 1956 , and became the world ' s best selling powered @ - @ engine model . small - @ - @ powered aircraft are now the most popular type of aircraft in the current aviation market . the introduction of the rogallo glider in the 1960s saw the introduction of large @ - @ aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s . the 1960s also saw success with powered hang gliding , but it was not until the 1970s that this range of aircraft began to develop , resulting in the development of the microlight category . a milestone in the history of ga was the 1964 introduction of the learjet ii . although it was not the first private jet , it introduced business flying , and introduced the business jet as a " revolutionary new class of aircraft " . = = = = = the ga fleet includes a variety of aircraft , including jet and helicopters , helicopters , hang gliding , paragliders , microlights , gyrocopters , trainers , amateur aircraft and mass @ - @ powered light aircraft , mass @ - @ powered jets , and business jets . ga can be broadly classified as ground flying , charity photography , and private flying , the latter two of which are commercial operations . = = = commercial operations = = = commercial operations are those activities whichand meet the broad definition of ga . they are , however , closely related to , and not part of , the aviation sector . air transport operators are on @ - @ land , on @ - @ wings , or at destinations designated by the icao , providing a more convenient service than air ambulance . air ambulance operators are providing operators for third parties , and government and commercial aviation uses school @ - @ owned aircraft to transport passengers and customers . aircraft used in these operations include business jets , helicopters , and small school @ - @ powered aircraft seating between five and eight passengers . an example of this type of activity is the transport by helicopter of competitors to the annual formula one grand prix at silverstone . this involves so many people that , according to cranfield air transport , on race days the circuit is considered the world ' s busiest airport . aerial work is a small but significant component of the traditional aviation activity , known in its modern form by its by @ - @ aerial work , such as photography , aerial photography , and operation aerial , ( air ambulance and rescue ) . = = = flying schools = = = flying schools are small organisations involved in the training of pilots , both for commercial purposes and for those wishing to fly professionally . they make extensive use of the @ - @ owned training aircraft equipped with the ga , not only for flight instruction but also of light aircraft rented out to professional pilots for training purposes . school @ - @ owned aircraft account for a significant amount of ga activity , both in terms of hours flown and aircraft maintenance . the flight training programme is seen by the aviation sector as a key element that is key to the recruitment of pilots for the airline industry . it is estimated by the uk aviation research council that 60 – ##0 per cent of new pilots have company @ - @ for their initial training through flying schools , and one uk chief executive has stated that the industry will rely on the – % per cent of new pilots coming from the ga sector . the caa estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots on the unsponsored flying programme dropped from 30 per cent to 60 per cent . the main ##point to this trend is that pilots cannot be recruited outside of the uk , and that the airline industry is therefore heavily dependent on a large ga sector outside the uk for its supply of pilots . the caa states that a significant decline in numbers would lend " some support to the claim that pilot training would be sustainable " , but that the literature on flying schools " does not have such a positive outlook ." of course , dependence on other countries for pilot training means that the government lacks the financial benefits of the latter programme . = = = private flying = = = private flying can be for both training purposes and public use , using aircraft that are owned privately , owned as part of a company , or rented from a private club . a survey of pilots surveyed in 2001 and 2002 found that the most common forms of private flying were night flights within the local area , flights to other bases , and overnight flights abroad . half of the pilots stayed at the base where they originated from , and only 10 per cent took an overnight stay away from home . private flying is often associated with the commercial use of the @ - @ , two and three @ - @ seater , or the @ - @ produced passenger and utility aircraft . examples of these include the cessna 152 , cessna 172 , and piper pa28 ##0 , all with their introduction in the 1930s , and the more recent version of helicopters . the average cost per hour to fly an aircraft has been estimated to be £ 133 , compared to an estimated £ 100 per hour for helicopters , and a modest £ 100 per hour for microlights . recent years have seen an increase in the use of microlights , and also in commercial private flying with the introduction of smaller and lighter aircraft such as the cessna r22 and r44 . the trend seen for private flying in recent years has been in the use of amateur charter aircraft , such as the children ' s fly , @ - @ , and the scout . there is a strong historic aircraft industry in the uk , with two @ - @ % of the uk having historic aircraft registered . these cover the full range of civil and military aircraft , and include the de havilland dragon rapide fighter of the 1930s , and the world war ii ( wwii ) spitfire fighter . there are also ex @ - @ wwii aircraft which could also be considered historic under a broader definition , as for example , ##1 @ - @ produced aircraft such as the hawker hurricane . these aircraft are regular fixtures at gliding shows , which are considered to be the second most popular flying sport after gliding in the uk . = = = = = = = competitive gliding in the uk takes place between may and september . regionals are glider races , organised and run by some of the major gliding clubs in the uk , and are the highest level to glider flying . they are organised according to pilot rank , and usually take place over three days . participation in the regionals allows pilots to fly to the nationals ,where there are three classes of competition . these are based on pilot size , the largest being open class , and then up to standard ( maximum 15 metres ( 49 ft ) wingspan , and flaps are permitted ) , 15 metres ( 49 ft ) ( not standard , and flaps are permitted ) , 18 metres ( 59 ft ) ( maximum 18 metres ( 59 ft ) wingspan ) , and the propeller @ - @ class ( no restrictions ) . competition at national level can lead to a place on the national championships and success at international level . in 2007 the british gliding association was ranked number one , and british pilots won the women ' s world championships and the club class world championships . handicapped air racing is open to all propeller @ - @ class , capable of reaching a maximum speed of 100 miles ( 160 km ) per hour in level flight . competitions are a form of " fly low , fly right , fly high " , consisting of two – flying out of a roughly – - mile ( or – - km ) course . faster aircraft are eliminated by landing behind slower aircraft , the result being that the race ends with both aircraft heading for the finish line simultaneously . there are 12 to 20 competitions per year , held at venues in the uk , ireland and the channel islands , for competitions that include the schneider trophy and america ' s cup , and the season ends with the world air championships and european air racing championships . aerobatic competitions take place for both powered aircraft and glider , with up to 20 competitions per year in the uk and ireland . starting at the national level , pilots can move up to standard ( powered aircraft ) and club ( glider ) classes , and then on to intermediate , advanced , and even unlimited levels . each step up requires a larger repertoire of aerobatic skills and requires more control from the pilot . national championships are held annually at standard / advanced , intermediate , club ( powered aircraft only ) , and unlimited levels , and pilots who have achieved advanced and unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the uk in international competitions . the competitions are conducted at local , regional , national and international levels , and include the disciplines of vertical gliding , freefall flying , formation skydiving , canopy formation , soaring and freeflying , and skysurfing . british pilots often win medals at the formation world championships , and a british team won the 2006 world championships in men ' s propeller @ - @ class formation flying . = = = = = aerodrome is a generic term for an aerodrome from which competitions may take place , although thereother terms may be used to describe these functions . the caa annual plan of 2008 applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support small ga ga operations , and regional to locations which predominantly support military operations . the general aviation uk aerodrome ##s association ( gasar ) lists 687 airfields in england which fall within the umbrella of ga , dividing 374 into six categories . these range in size from large airport to the largest landing airfield , although 80 per cent of ga operations come from 134 of the 134 airfields in the top six categories . = = = gasar airport classification = = = the criteria involved in determining how an english aerodrome is classified by the gasar association are based primarily on size and function . the six types of aerodrome are defined , in descending order , as : regional airports ( e . g . east ##bourne ) ; major ga airports ( e . g . oxford ) ; minor ga airfields ( e . g . andrewsfield ) ; minor ga airfields ( e . g . rufforth ) ; small airfields ( e . g . tilstock ) ; and rural airfields ( e . g . chilbolton , derbyshire ) . the technical criteria used to categorise airfields are developed , using many different criteria , backed up with extensive technical review by the ga staff . they generally have grass , well grass , + @ - @ grass runways , modern air traffic control , and navigation and communication aids . they are often located on rural areas , support civil and military operations , and generally handle certain types of light aircraft . on the most centrally located airports , the commercial form of aviation , such as microlight and helicopter operations , are more common , and there are little or no commercial operations other than flying schools . at this point runways are generally longer , and short runways are more common . navigation aids become increasingly scarce , and only available where they are available , and often limited to air , communication and air traffic control . the smaller airfields are too small to feature on general aviation ordnance survey ( os ) maps , and lack support facilities such as storage and maintenance . the majority of airfields are usually very short grass runways with no hangar ##s , although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon on the largest airfields . they do not appear on os maps , and are owned by flying clubs or , less rarely , individuals . = = = = classification = = = most aircraft used for air transport purposes are required to be licensed by the caa . to be granted a licence anthe ##s must inform the caa that : the operating conditions of the aerodrome , and its facilities , are good ; the standard of operation , and facilities provided , are appropriate for the aviation operations which are permitted to take place ; the appropriate safety management system is in place ; and that they are experienced and , where appropriate , well equipped . airfields classified as small category c or operated by the gasar ##c are , with few exceptions , licensed . only two small category airfields , silverstone and duxford , are licensed , and most others are not . the light aviation aerodrome working group , a major caa @ - @ c group , was established in 2005 to study the future of light aviation airports . a major focus of this group was a review of the restrictions placed on licensed flying . the group recommended that the requirement for air flight operations to be operated separately from licensed airfields should be further considered in the light of appropriate local and national legislation . it was recommended that restrictions on flying operations at licensed aerodrome should be lifted , and this was effective from april 2010 = = regulation of the aerodrome = = there are an estimated 40 @ , @ 000 ga aircraft registered in the uk , 80 per cent of which are engaged in flying operations . in 2005 the ga fleet included 6 @ , @ 000 foreign @ - @ registered aircraft , 2 @ , @ 500 microlights , 2 @ , @ 100 helicopters , 2 @ , @ 800 kite / balloons , 1 @ , @ 500 transports and about 3 @ , @ 000 active ##ers . estimates put the number of fixed @ - @ 000 ga aircraft operating in the uk at 900 . the number of pilots licensed by the caa to fly ga aircraft in 2005 was 40 @ , @ 000 , of whom 10 @ , @ 000 held a commercial pilot licence . the rest held commercial pilot licenses , either a commercial pilot licence or an air traffic operator licence , although not all of these would be used in ga activities . in 2008 , there were 10 @ , @ 000 registered commercial pilots , and estimates put the number of the @ - @ registered pilots and aviation pilots at 15 @ , @ 000 . the number of organisations that operate aircraft in the uk is difficult to estimate with certainty . pooleys 2008 united kingdom flight guide lists 355 , and the airplan aviation guide and vfr aviation guide 2008 list around 300 . lockyears 2008 ' a ' and the airfield aviation guide list more than 100 such strips . the gasar studyand include @ , @ 000 aircraft landing sites in london alone , a figure which includes flying sites known to local authorities but not listed in local records . and includes around 759 flying sites known only to aircraft owners , operators , and members of the pressure group foot @ - @ mouth . the industry is estimated to employ around 1 @ , @ 000 people and directly contributed £ ##4 @ . @ 1 billion to the uk economy in 2005 , making up around 10 per cent of the gdp of the aviation industry . nearly half of the total revenue is generated by private aviation . = = = = = all types of aircraft for which parts is available have shown growth in aircraft numbers and hours flown over the past two decades . the three sectors of the flying sector : microlights , home aircraft , and aircraft and helicopters , have in particular shown strong growth , although the growth of these activities was severely affected during the air @ - @ and @ - @ fire outbreak of 2001 , when access to land was restricted . after strong growth in the late 1990s , private ga has seen a steady decline since , reflecting a shift amongst amateur pilots towards microlight aircraft , and increasing use of foot @ - @ registered pilots . private aircraft activity has increased substantially due to the introduction of larger and lighter helicopters . gliding usage has remained relatively low , although there has been a slight increase in the number of foot @ - @ registered hang gliders . business aviation has shown strong growth , although the numbers of aircraft on the ga market has declined . this reflects a move away from light aircraft towards full @ - @ registered business aircraft operating in the uk , which are estimated to be increasing in size . however , small engine @ - @ engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly , putting pressure on the uk air @ - @ aircraft market from more popular and cheap jet services , and the more lucrative air jet industry . the amount of flying training offered by british schools has declined , largely at the expense of students from foreign schools , which benefit from lower costs and better facilities . since 1990 the average number of aircraft flown annually in the aviation industry has been in the range 0 @ . @ [UNK] – ##0 @ . @ 6 million , the largest sector being commercial private flying , which accounts for 0 @ . @ 20 million per year . an overall decline in aircraft numbers compared with a decline in hours flown has brought the total asset base per capita down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002 . the decline in aircraft base has led to concerns that the economic health of the ga sectorare available , although the lack of data on safety makes this difficult to achieve . = = = = = the aim of regulation is to " ensure appropriate standards of safety in all sectors of aviation " , and this is the main goal of cooperation between the caa and the aviation authorities . they focus on establishing common standards of safety , pilot safety , the safety for the occupants of aircraft , and equipment to be used . the caa was established as the primary regulatory body for civil aviation in the uk in 1972 . in 1991 it began working with the joint aviation authority ( jaa ) framework to establish the safety standards , known as the joint aviation regulations ( jar ) , across the european union ( eu ) . in 2003 this was taken a step further when the european aviation safety agency ( easa ) was established as the sole regulatory authority , taking over responsibility for all safety and safety regulations from the uk authority . the caa acts as an extension of easa on these matters , retaining its own regulatory powers in areas not previously transferred to easa . recent proposals are to establish easa as the primary authority in the eu , taking over from the member states the power to regulate all sectors other than that currently excluded from the scope of easa . = = = regulated and self @ - @ regulated = = = within this framework all aspects of aviation are regulated on a regional basis . in most cases the caa / easa has responsibility for aviation safety , but other authorities , consisting of sectors that are not included in the scope of easa , are given statutory powers of their regulation . the majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the british microlight aircraft association ( bmaa ) , although a small number are regulated by the light aircraft association ( laa ) , formerly known as the british aviation association . the laa is the primary authority for amateur light aircraft , as well as light and touring aircraft . gliding is regulated by the british gliding association , although the aircraft used for this purpose are not caa @ - @ registered . balloon and airship flying is regulated by the british balloon and airship association . the self @ - @ regulated national private pilots licence ( nppl ) is regulated by the private pilot licence scheme ltd . , supported by the laa , the aircraft owners and pilots association ltd , the british gliding association , and the british microlight aircraft association . apart from these licensing bodies , gliding in the uk is self @ - @ regulated . the british gliding association was until 2009 a for gliderga , is is regulated as a part of easa rules , and ga under status of aerodrome licence . hang gliding and gliding aircraft ( i . e . , @ - @ registered aircraft ) are regulated by the british hang gliding and gliding association . = = = = = = = under caa and easa rules , all aircraft are required to meet european standards of safety to fly safely and efficiently . aircraft that meet these standards are issued with a certificate of registration . however , uk @ - @ registered aircraft which are exempt from the scope of easa , and which cannot meet the requirements for the award of a certificate of registration , may be issued with a permit to fly . this allows them to fly in uk airspace subject to certain restrictions , for example being restricted to uk @ - @ registered flights under instrument flight rules ) . a number of organisations ( e . g . the british microlight aircraft association and the light aircraft association ) have obtained a limited uk @ - @ flight licence for pilots to fly aircraft in their area of responsibility with some other countries , including germany . these are also issued to current and vintage aircraft , amateur built aircraft , and microlights . = = = private certification = = = the pilot licence most relevant to gliding is the private pilot licence ( ppl ) , which allows the pilot to fly for recreational purposes without licence . in addition to the uk @ - @ / for aviation and for profit pilots ( jar @ - @ fcl ) standard , the caa also issues uk @ - @ flight licence standards . in the absence of licensing standards for glider , glider , and glider pilots , the caa licenses these pilots to the national uk ppl standard . as a response to the perception that uk @ licensing requirements were too restrictive and not for the benefit of private pilots , the national private pilot licence ( nppl ) was introduced in 2002 . the nppl is cheaper to obtain than the jar @ - @ fcl standard , has more strict licensing requirements , is less flexible in the licenses it grants , and is valid only for pilots of uk @ - @ registered aircraft operating in german and french airspace . although there are attempts to introduce private pilot licensing into the regulatory scope of easa , the gliding association is still not @ - @ compliant in this regard . the british gliding association is responsible for setting the standards of pilot licensing , and licenses , via a licensing system , pilots who meet those standards . pilots aresome areas of aviation that involve general aviation , such as commercial aviation and general aviation , are required to hold a professional pilot qualification which , at a minimum , is the commercial pilot licence . = = accidents = = between 1995 and 2004 there were 1 @ , @ 630 accidents involving ga aircraft , of which 139 were fatal , resulting in the loss of 317 lives . the majority of accidents involve were re @ - @ ga aircraft operating in formation flying , and have identified the most likely causes of these to : poor management errors ; poor judgment or judgment ; lack of training or experience ; and lack of , or delaying , training . there were 14 fatal accidents involving ga aircraft in 2007 , resulting in the loss of 48 lives . these compared with 17 accidents and a loss of 48 lives the previous year , and although the 2007 figures are lower than 2006 , they are still significant . = = safety = = the introduction of commercial air transport ( cat ) has reduced the operational effectiveness of ga , both in the air and on the ground at many airports . difficulty with access to these airports is caused by a decline in the number of airports available , and such operations are often threatened with closure and re @ - @ wing for more practical purposes . the aerodrome planning system is beginning to focus on safety issues , and much of the environmental ##isation of airport sites is not in its scope . this makes further planning difficult , thus leading those that can afford the land to remain on planning . = = = airspace : = = = airspace is shared by commercial , military and civil users . it is divided into controlled airspace , in which aircraft will only operate under the control of an air traffic controller , and restricted airspace , in which aircraft must operate autonomously . although ga aircraft may under certain conditions use controlled airspace , they operate mainly out of it . controlled airspace is required for the operation of a safe air traffic service and for the safe operation of aircraft . a caa report found that " combining [ ga ] flying with military activities is often difficult , and dangerous " for cat operators . adopting this approach has resulted in more of a controlled airspace with no runways , with some built close to the sea , and vfr access to others , resulting in greater numbers of cat operators operating close to the boundaries of controlled airspace that could not assist in approval of an air traffic controller . along with increased operational costs , hundreds of airspace accidents have been reported each year . both in the number of cat operators , and in the number of aircraft theyapart from , which results in a significant increase in class a controlled airspace . between 1997 and 2006 this has increased in size from 10 per cent of controlled airspace to 30 per cent overall , and from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of airspace in england and wales , leading to a perception within the ga community of being locked in . there are also problems for ga at regional airports , where class a controlled airspace drops to sea level . the growth of commercial aviation and increased demand for ga in the south east of england has also resulted in large amounts of class a controlled airspace available , which tend to affect future ga expansion into the @ - @ - @ - @ - hot spots . = = = = ##s = = = regional airports , such as manchester airport , have seen significant growth in ga operations in recent years . these operations are technically and legally incompatible with ga , and although there is no evidence of such interference , the effect has been to restrict or prevent ga . ga operations are also subject to significant increases in fees , including the imposition of parking fees in some airports . some airports allow or prohibit ga operations , and others allow or prohibit any ga services . as a result , large ga aircraft are now rarely or rarely used at large , busy commercial airports such as heathrow , stansted , gatwick and london . in addition to this de facto lack of ga , the number of ga in the uk has been in decline over the last 20 years , as a result of increasing traffic and the closure of airfields built during wwii . larger and less expensive demands for ga can also lead to smaller aerodromes being threatened with closure , for example north ##olt , or even being closed , as happened to ipswich airport . and to filton airport . due to the lack of a " viable viable network of ga airfields " , especially where ga has an air transport function , the caa states that " there could be cause for concern if a single further network of airports were to continue , or if the infrastructure of the ga network were to be lost . " = = = planning policy = = = the planning system is vital to the viability and operation of ga operations . with many airports having ga air transport services around them , and with road links to these airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive , a national network of airports supporting ga air transport operations is seen as an important planning priority . however , there is no single national planning policy relating to ga operations , and all decisions relating to these are based on local criteria that are not necessarilyto reduce the national impact . because aircraft are exempt from noise reduction regulations , the best way for those affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process , and this issue is the principal issue on which the majority of planning decisions relating to their land use are based . ga is a controversial issue often assigned to local planning authorities , and most planning authorities assigned to it either refuse it , or grant it with special restrictions . raf gransden is just one example of a private site refusing to comply with strict restrictions on the number of aircraft allowed , thereby preventing further development . such restrictions , if properly enforced , can make ga land unviable or even unsafe . = = = = = public attitudes towards aircraft noise is mixed , based on growing environmental concerns relating to noise and noise , and private land has been criticised by responding to the government survey on aircraft noise as a dangerous and dangerous activity . in terms of environmental concerns and recommendations made to the caa that relate specifically to ga , it is " by far " the most common complaint . most of the 1 @ , @ 000 environmental complaints , according to the caa concern aircraft operations , many of which relate to aviation , aircraft , landing zones , air traffic incidents , parachute drops , and other aircraft noise . the advice on aircraft noise states that " in certain areas the public perceive ##s aerodrome noise levels as more dangerous than noise levels at major airports . " this is a description of the noise characteristics of light aircraft engines and the activities they are engaged in , including : landing aircraft ##ing at high @ - @ altitude around the aerodrome , during which sounds are audible for long periods ; hill climbing aircraft engaging in parachute dropping ; parachute tug aircraft flying around the landing zone or runway , and audible for long periods ; erratic and repetitive engine sounds from aircraft engaged in gliding ; and low @ - @ operating at full power in areas of high engine noise , leading to the perception that aircraft noise is too loud . in an attempt to alleviate these problems , the majority of airports implement noise control measures designed to keep people away from environmentally affected areas , and more than 50 are licensed by the authority to provide public meetings in which noise concerns can be discussed with their staff .
