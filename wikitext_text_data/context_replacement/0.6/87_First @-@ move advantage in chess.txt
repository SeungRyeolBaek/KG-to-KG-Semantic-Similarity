= = @ - @ move advantage in chess = the first @ - @ move advantage in chess is the initial advantage of the player ( s ) who makes the first move in chess . chess players and theorists generally believe that white starts the game with an advantage . since 1851 , chess statistics support this view ; white generally wins much more often than black , usually by between 52 and 70 % . white ' s winning percentage is roughly the same for tournament games between humans and games between computers . however , white ' s advantage is more pronounced in tournament games and games between computers . chess players and theorists have long debated whether , with perfect play by both players , the game should end in a win for white , or a draw . since about 1889 , when world champion wilhelm steinitz raised this issue , the common view has been that a well played game would end in a draw . however , a few chess writers have argued that white ' s advantage may be enough to secure a win : jack white and vsevolod rauzer claimed that white was winning on the first move 1 . e4 , while max keller suggested that 1 . d4 would win for white . some players , including world champions such as jose raul capablanca , emanuel lasker , and bobby fischer , have expressed fears of a " renaissance , " where play is more closely controlled . to counter this view , capablanca and fischer have proposed chess reforms to increase interest in the game , while lasker proposed changes how draws and wins are counted . since 1988 , chess writers have made claims that @ - @ influences perceptions of white ' s advantage . grandmaster ( gm ) andras adorjan wrote a number of articles on the idea that " black is winning ! " , arguing that the popular belief that white has an advantage is rooted more in theory than chess . gm mihai suba and others argue that sometimes white ' s advantage grows for no apparent reason as the game progresses . the usual way of winning for white today is to play open , symmetrical games with little risk , rather than simply trying to win . some commentators also argue that white has some psychological advantage . the idea that white should try to win may be a psychological advantage for the opposing player , who often loses by trying too hard to win . open symmetrical games ( i . e . those where both players make the same move ) can lead to games where the first is a draw , either for psychological or tactical reasons . = = = position = =in 1946 , j . h . streeter compared the results of 56 @ , @ 598 games played in all international chess tournaments between 1851 and 1932 . streeter found that : white scored 54 @ . @ 4 % ( w : 45 @ . @ 52 ; d : 40 @ . @ 07 ; l : 30 @ . @ 31 ) . black scored 53 @ . @ 1 % in 1851 – [UNK] ( w : 45 @ . @ 52 ; d : 30 @ . @ 07 ; l : 40 @ . @ 31 ) , 54 @ . @ 1 % in 1881 – 1914 ( w : 36 @ . @ 07 ; d : 30 @ . @ 34 ; l : 30 @ . @ 31 ) , and 54 @ . @ 1 % in 1919 – [UNK] ( w : 36 @ . @ 1 ; d : 31 @ . @ 99 ; l : 30 @ . @ 04 ) . streeter wrote , " it now appears that it is becoming increasingly difficult to win with pieces , and increasingly difficult to lose .

" this is consistent with the traditional belief that white , by virtue of the first move , begins with the initiative and should strive to force it into the middlegame , while black should strive to break white ' s attack and achieve victory . because white begins with the initiative , a slight mistake by white usually leads directly to loss of the initiative , while a slight mistake by black can have more serious consequences . however , sveshnikov wrote in 1994 , " white simply cannot afford to make even the smallest mistakes . . . from a tactical point of view ,the roles of white and black in chess are reversed : white has to play for a win , black — for a draw ! " chess players have long debated how great white ' s advantage is and whether , if both sides play well , the game should end in a win for white or a draw . thomas jefferson wrote in 1846 that , " the first move is the answer , . . . and if not so , the first move is of no consequence " . steinitz , the first world champion , who is generally considered the father of modern chess , wrote in 1889 , " it is generally agreed by all players that with proper play by both sides the end result of the game ought to be a draw . " lasker and capablanca , the second and third world champions , disagreed . reuben fine , one of the world ' s leading players from 1936 to 1951 , argued that white ' s theoretical advantage is sufficiently great to be used for a win without any advantage by black . the assumption that a game of chess should end in a draw with proper play exists . even if it cannot be proved , this assumption is considered " reasonable " by rowson and " fair " by adorjan . fine wrote that " the end result of a well played chess game . . . is a draw . . . . of course , you can ' t prove this , and i doubt that you will find a very good player who would try . . . . i remember once , while playing top @ - @ round ##up , saying to the chess master : ' no , this is a game . ' " world champion bobby fischer thought that was almost certainly true . lasker and capablanca both believed that chess would be a " win , " as top @ - @ round ##ers won more and more of their games . more generally , they disagreed , believing that the game would get progressively better . all three suggested changing the rules of chess to reduce the number of winning moves . lasker suggested scoring less than half a point for a win , and more than half a point for capturing the opponent ' s pieces . capablanca in the end advocated capablanca chess , a chess variant played on a larger board and with more pieces . fischer proposed playing ##ian ##c , an opening game , in which the starting position of the opponent is chosen at random . " many of the chess opening rules have been studied so thoroughly that they are often used as chess rules . for example , at the highest level , black oftenand the same happens in the ruy lopez , a variation where black sacrifices a pawn for better winning chances , to create an opening where white is only a pawn behind and is able to win with good play . in 2007 , both kiril georgiev and atanas kolev noted that exactly the same is true of the 0 @ - @ 0 - 0 variation of the najdorf defence , which starts from 1 . e4 c5 2 . nf3 d6 3 . d4 cxd4 4 . nxd4 nf6 5 . nc3 a6 6 . bg5 e6 7 . f4 qb6 ! ? this has long been considered one of the best and most dangerous , or even dangerous , opening variations . the game then goes 8 . qd2 qxb2 9 . rb1 qa3 . georgiev and kolev noted that 10 . bg5 is best played at the highest level because the last move of this variation leads , with good play , to a win by perpetual check . they concluded that the following moves " will always be the last piece of chess " : francisco vallejo , – [UNK] , moscow 2004 : 0 @ . @ e4 c5 2 . nf3 d6 3 @ . @ d4 cxd4 4 . nxd4 nf6 5 . nc3 a6 6 . bg5 e6 7 @ . @ f4 qb6 8 . qd2 qxb2 9 . rb1 qa3 10 @ . @ f5 nc6 11 @ . @ fxe6 fxe6 12 . nxc6 bxc6 13 @ . @ e5 dxe5 14 . bxf6 gxf6 15 . ne4 qxa2 16 . rd1 be7 17 . be2 0 @ - @ 0 @ . 0 @ - @ 0 ra7 19 . rf3 kh8 20 . rg3 rd7 21 . qh6 rf7 22 . qh5 rxd1 + 23 . bxd1 qa5 24 . kf1 qd8 25 . qxf7 qxd1 + 26 . kf2 qxc2 + 27 . kf3 qd1 + 28 . kf2 qc2 + 29 . ke3 bc5 + 30 . nxc5 qxc5 + 31 . kd2 qf2 + 32. kc3 qd4 + 33 . kc2 qf2 + 34 . kc3 1 / 2 – 0 / 0 ( after 6 . . . qd4 + , white cannot escape the trap . ) however , georgiev and kolev ' s initial position of 9 . bg5 has since been called into question , and white wins with 9 . e5 ( a winning move ) in two @ - @ - @ level games . gm zaven andriasyan wrote in 2013 that after 9 . f5 , " a small improvement occurs " , and that after 10 . e5 , " we have a very good position , with good play .

" adams ' claim was not accepted , and he did not succeed in challenging the validity of his claim in tournament and match play . the year after his book was published , in the final of the 1940 u . s . chess championship , adams recorded only one win in his three games as white , but won all three of his games as black . he also lost a game to im i . a . fischer , who had the best position in the game . according to sveshnikov , vsevolod rauzer , a leading soviet player and commentator during the 1930s , allegedly " wrote in the [ book ] : ' 1 . e4 — and white wins ! ' and has tried to repeat it quite often " . = = = white wins with 1 . d4 = = = more recently , im boris stein , a former world champion of correspondence chess , wrote in his 1999 book the game that 1 . d4 gave white a strong , and possibly superior , position . stein claimed that with best play white won against the grunfeld variation , the sicilian benoni , the benko variation and the ( possibly ) " weak... " , and have at least a temporary advantage in some games of the king ' s indian opening . however , adams wrote that , " it is clear that the rules of chess are such that only a number of possible @ - @ moves prior to 1 . d4 can be achieved . " adams wrote that adams ' " theory , though looked upon with suspicion by many other chess theorists , made an immediate and lasting impression on me . george w . adams was the only person i knew who actually had ideas about how chess should be played . " adams ' s theory , like adams ' , has been widely criticized . = = other players = = as mentioned above , chess theorists in recent years have continued to debate the extent and nature of white ' s advantage , if any . aside from this , they have rejected the idea that white has a forced win from the beginning onwards . they also reject the accepted view that black ' s strategy should be to take white ' s advantage and promote it . = = = white has an obvious advantage = = = in 2004 , grandmaster larry kaufman took a more nuanced view than adams and adams , stating that the advantage gained from the first move can always be turned into some sort of lasting advantage , albeit not necessarily a permanent one . kaufman wrote , " i don ' t believe that white has a forced win in chess . i do not believe that with either 1 . e4 or 1 . d4 , white should be able to achieve some sort of advantage that continues into the end . if chess was played like this , with the game tied by the scoring awarded to the player ( if any ) who was ' closest ' to winning , then i think white would still have a forced win in chess . " = = = white is ok ! = = = = since 1988 , adorjan has stated in a series of books and journal articles that " white is ok ! " . amongst chess theorists , adorjan argues that white wins the game with absolutely no advantage . he writes , " in my opinion , the only real problem for white is that if he or she plays for a win , and does it well , then he does not do this without an obvious advantage . " adorjan goes so far as to say that , " the concept of white ' s advantage is a myth , and that chess is based on a myth . " rowson writes that adorjan ' s " theory is one of the most important chess theories of the lastfor example . . . because it has been our opinion that black plays the game with an objective , and not an objective basis " . however , rowson disputes adorjan ' s view that black has such an advantage , noting that " ' black is better ' and ' black is worse ' may not be mutually exclusive . " . in one of adorjan ' s articles , grandmaster lajos portisch wrote that " at least the @ - @ lines of the ' main ' variation give black an opening advantage . " according to portisch , for instance , " the root of the problem is that very few people know which of the positions where black is actually ok . those who know these positions have nothing to lose , because black is actually ok , but only in those positions ! " rowson considers this an important point , noting that " 1 . d4 players try to win easily against the @ - @ - , and 1 . e4 players find the najdorf and sveshnikov positions more difficult . " = = = = = = = = players often think of black ' s play in more abstract terms than black trying to win . rowson notes that " the idea of black trying to ' win ' is offensive . i think it has limited itself to a few variations , rather than as an overall strategy for black in general . " he notes that in one of his games against white , " he revealed his ' weakness ' to me : unlike other players , he preferred to play with the black pieces from the start . the idea that black has better pieces and should not be concerned with their value was the turning point in his game , he said . " however , watson notes that white , when playing black , avoids the question of whether he has an opening advantage " by thinking in terms of the exact nature of the power played on the board , and trying to take the advantage whenever possible " . watson notes that " even opening play by black can . . . lead to a game so difficult and complex that to speak of it is difficult . so we use ' equally good ' instead of ' equal ' to convey the idea that one side is as determined as the other to recover from defeat with an advantage . this type of opening strategy has become popular in modern chess , with world champions fischer and fischer among its most prominent proponents . " some authors also support the idea that black has an opening advantage . suba , in his influential 1991 book modern chess , ,and the idea that the advantage can easily be turned into an tactical advantage . he argues that sometimes the player with the initiative gains something with no further explanation , and that , " sometimes you can seize it , just like that . if you try to get to it , without winning the game , your tactical advantage will be limited and you won ' t be able to mount a successful counter @ - @ attack . " rowson and watson disagree . watson also writes , " because of the idea of white being superior , the point of the game at which black wins his initiative and takes white ' s position has often been deliberately chosen to give him advantage , even though in normal play , the loss of white ' s initiative most often means that black has taken it with ease . " = = = = = = = = rowson argues that both white and black have tactical advantages : = = = = white ' s advantage = = = = according to rowson , white ' s tactical advantage is that , " the advantage of the first move has some similarities with the advantage of black in that white can gain an ' advantage ' ( for example with a little tactical advantage ) , he has some control over the rhythm and tempo of the game , and he has a ' tactical advantage ' in that when things go wrong his position is not worth defending . " second , white starts the game with the initiative , although rowson sees this as a tactical rather than a tactical advantage , " and whether it leads to a tactical advantage depending on the relative strengths of the players . " third , both players are able to use the initiative to " play a form of tactical ' rook and pawn ' , in which white is equipped with a combination of tactical advantage and tactical advantage . " fourth , " if white attempts to cheat , it is often not very easy for him to do this . this advantage is especially important in games where there is a strong tactical advantage , because white can win the game without agreeing to a move and he has to decide whether to move before he decides whether he is better . " rowson uses as an example of the first move the counter @ - @ - zaitsev variation of the ruy lopez . " 1 . e4 e5 2 . nf3 nc6 3 . bb5 a6 4 . ba4 nf6 0 @ . @ 0 @ - @ 0 be7 6 . re1 b5 7 . bb3 0 @ - @ 0 8 . b##3 d6 9 . h3 bb7 10 . d4 re8 ( in the zaitsev variation ) , black can play it again with 11 . ng5 rf8 12 . nf3 . this leaves white in an open position , since black can either ( a ) draw at the zaitsev with 12 . . . re8 , which allows black to decide whether to win by making play with 13 . ng5 rf8 14 . nf3 , or win it with a single move , or ( b ) play a better ( and often better ) game by playing something other than . . . . re8 . = = = = black ' s advantage = = = = rowson notes that black often has several advantages . first , " black ' s initial position is often a matter of trying to play for a draw , and black will often use this to his advantage . " second , " black ' s ' first move ' can be a mistake , and often black finds himself in a bad position of zugzwang ( ' zugzwang ##ing ' ) . " third , although white starts the game with the advantage , if " black has a good opening with many attacking possibilities , this advantage can be taken and then passed on to white . " fourth , " the fact that white moves before black can gives white valuable advantage " . suba also notes that black ' s advantage is often greater than a draw , since black can open his pawn ##s , allowing him to respond to black ' s attack . suba notes , " in terms of the actual game played , this is a case of the ##ness , and black ' s advantage is often greater — than a move ! " rowson also notes that black ' s chances improve considerably when playing other pieces , which tend to be those with strengths and few weaknesses , " rather than those that give him few options and that tend to take the initiative immediately . " he also notes that " black plays ' the advantage ' , not ' the advantage ' . playing with white depends on thinking of the advantage and speaking of it in terms of ' advantage ' . " these ideas are exemplified by the sicilian , a successful counter attack against the english opening that can arise from multiple attacking combinations . a typical example is from 1 . c4 c5 2 . nf3 nf6 3 . g3 b6 4 . bg2 bb7 - @ . @ - @ - @ . e6 6 . nc3 be7 7 . d4 cxd##4 8 . qxd4 d6 9 . e4 a6 . white has a space advantage , as black usually places his pieces on the last two squares of the board , and white " has to keep a close eye on the weak pawn moves ##s . . . b5 and . . . d5 . " he writes , " black ' s strategy is to be quick and flexible , with many opportunities for his pieces , whereas white may be distracted at some point by the need to defend against all possible threats ##s . " he also notes that , " white seems to be as much tied up by black ' s material weaknesses as black himself is tied up by white ' s space advantage . " however , attempts by white to exploit black ' s position can end badly . an example of this is the following opening game : mikhail polugaevsky – lubomir ftacnik , moscow , 1982 : 1 . nf3 nf6 2 @ . @ c4 c5 3 . nc3 e6 4 @ . @ g3 b6 5 . bg2 bb7 6 . 0 @ - @ . be7 7 @ . @ d4 cxd4 8 . qxd4 d6 9 . rd1 a6 10 @ . @ b3 nbd7 11 @ . @ e4 qb8 11 . bb2 12 @ - @ . suba says of a typical opening game , " white ' s position is ideal . that ' s the simple part of it , because the ' game ' has in itself the condition — it cannot be won .

" the russian master mikhail botvinnik also held the opposite view . he supports this view , citing suba ' s observation that black , in the diagram , has more useful moves than white . he writes , " everyone has no problem playing as white against the sicilian defence ( 1 . e4 c5 ) , and . . . the russians have no concerns about playing 1 . c4 with a . . . e5 . " to illustrate this point , watson discusses the various russian opening systems , and how black can gain the advantage of the " extra " moves for white . he writes , " the fact is , black ' s # @ - @ system in the diagram is intended as a defensive strategy , but is worth considering when trying to play the position against white . this is precisely because black is able to stick to the same position white has ; in suba ' s view , his position is always a tempo up ! thus , black is able to take advantage of the black ##ities which white ( trying to gain the advantage of the extra move ) would not do . " he also writes , " however , the sicilian defence is almost perfect when black gets the same result a tempo up ( it turns out that black has nothing better to do ! ) ; and similarly , the other russian openings are not as perfect when black plays them as white , even in hand . " gm alex yermolinsky also writes that gm vladimir malaniuk , the top player of the sicilian defence ( 1 . d4 f5 2 .g3 g6 ) at the highest level , " he made a great impression on me by politely rejecting owen ' s suggestion that i should play 1 . f4 as well . he laughed and said , ' that little move ' s gonna kill you . ' " yermolinsky also agreed with alekhine ' s definition of 1 . g3 e5 2 . nf3 , a typical alekhine ' s move , and reti – alekhine , baden @ - @ baden 1925 , writing that alekhine " saw the difference in the strategies for white and black , and thought they simply couldn ' t be the same ! white is free to go for more than just playing a good position with a good pawn at @ - @ baden , and , as the results are — good for a lot of players , but not for them — white doesn ' t always do as well as black does in the same position with his own material and material . " william staunton , widely considered to have been the best player in the world from 1843 to 1851 , made a similar observation over 100 years ago , stating that owen ' s defense ( 1 . e4 b6 ) is better for black , but that 1 . b3 is inferior to " the most common [ white ] move , from not being completely symmetrical " . the general consensus is that owen ' s defense is much better for black , and 1 . b3 is better but less likely to provide an absolute advantage than 1 . e4 or 1 . d4 . he argues that ( a ) " both moves have costs as well as benefits , and an increased tempo is not necessarily an absolute advantage " ; ( b ) " with his intimate knowledge of what he is doing , he can easily adapt to the new move " ; and ( c ) because the move is likely to be more beneficial to black than to white , white is expected to play lines that involve drawish moves , and black does not respond to such moves . = = = = = symmetrical opening = = = = = rowson concludes that " in theory one would expect that the advantage white has would be displayed more effectively in symmetrical openings . " however , watson , suba , evans , and the russian grandmaster and theorist aron nimzowitsch ( 1886 – 1935 ) have all argued that it is in white ' s interest to avoid draws . however , while symmetrical opening positions can show the true nature of white ' s advantage , in some respects. it is very difficult for white to find an advantage in symmetrical opening positions . " john bent larsen wrote , after a game that included 1 . c4 c5 2 . b3 b6 , " in some positions , white has a great advantage , but in most of them it is only temporary . " gm georg soltis wrote in 2008 that white prefers defending against the strong petroff ' s defence ( 1 . e4 e5 2 . nf3 nf6 ) , and then , with 2 . nc3 , the sicilian defence . however , here , white has been unable to find a way to find advantage in the symmetrical opening . . . nc6 3 . g3 g6 4 . bg2 bg7 , or even 4 . nf3 nf6 ( similar to the three knights variation ) 4 . bb5 bb4 0 @ . @ 0 @ - @ @ 0 @ - @ 0 6 . d3 d6 7 . bg5 bg4 8 . nd5 nd4 9 . nxb4 nxb5 , or 10 . ne2 ne7 8 . c3 ba5 9 . ng3 c6 10 . ba4 ng6 11 . d4 d5 , when 7 . exd5 ? ! e4 ! does not suit white . however , some moves can be dangerous to white in that he has to defend himself first . he wrote that it is very difficult for white to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position , since almost every move has its advantages . he even went so far as to say that : 1 . nf3 nf6 2 . g3 g6 3 . bg2 bg7 4 @ . @ 0 @ - @ 0 5 @ - @ 0 5 . d3 d6 ( reinhard – [UNK] , 2nd gm 1963 ) , " ' like it or not , ' white is winning ! however , whatever he does , he will win , and take the easier position and win the better pieces thanks to his extra # ##s ! " however , gm paul keres wrote in chess magazine , " we just don ' t get it ! " in some positions , as the hodgson – arkell and portisch – tal variations seem to me , black will try to attack white as long as he thinks it fair and safe to do so , and only when that appears to be the case . however , a possible symmetrical position is not more ofa disadvantage than an advantage . for example , soltis notes that the exchange french position , after 1 . e4 e6 2 . d4 d5 3 . exd5 exd5 4 . nf3 nf6 " is not ideal . " the same situation , but with white ' s king advancing to e4 , occurs in petroff ' s position after 1 . e4 e5 2 . nf3 nf6 3 . nxe5 d6 4 . nf3 nxe4 5 . d4 d5 . that position has much better results , because black ' s first move ( . . . ne4 ) causes the black king to become a target for white . however , the play can be difficult for the white player for several reasons . he notes that anyone who plays the exchange french , " even if he thinks he is going for a win , carry [ s ] a heavy burden . white has already lost the advantage of the first move , and lost it , whereas black is trying to find ways to regain the advantage . " two notable examples of white winning in the exchange french are m . gurevich – short and tatai – [UNK] . in m . gurevich – [UNK] , a game between two of the world ' s best players , white needed only a draw to qualify for the candidates tournament , while short needed to win . gurevich played well and was defeated by short , who achieved the same result , qualified for the candidates , and then went on to beat black for the world championship . in tatai – [UNK] , the russian im fell victim to black ' s brilliant opening strategy , winning by just two moves . rowson gives the following example of black attacking white from the classical version of the english opening . he writes , " there is something different about black ' s play . he seems to be saying : ' i can copy all your good moves , and as long as you make a good move , i won ' t beat you any more !

" however , chess theorist claude shannon states that it is not possible for a computer to actually do this . in his 1950 paper " designing a machine for playing chess " he writes : with computers it is possible , in principle , to play a chess game and program the machine to do it as follows : all moves in the starting position , other moves , then all moves for the end , etc . , to the end of the game ( in each position ) . the move will occur , by the end of the game , a finite number of times ( by the 100 % moves rule ) . each of these possibilities results in win , loss or draw . by running backwards from the beginning we can determine whether there is a dead end , the game is a draw or is lost . it is easy to see , however , that with the limited processing power available to electronic computers this task is impossible . for most computer games this would be of the order of 100 % moves . the probability remains fairly constant until the game is completely lost as well . . . albert de groot , has averaged the number of legal moves for a finite number of chess games . playing one game for white and playing another for black has identified 103 possibilities . each chess game takes about 100 seconds to that of each player . this is unusual for our time since the machine would start out to lose , then win . however , even with this machine there would be 10120 moves to be calculated from the starting position . a machine running at the rate of one move per second would take about 1090 seconds to calculate the final result ! it is also theoretically possible to " play " chess , determining with probability whether a properly played game should result in a win for white , a draw , or even a loss for black . however , according to some the time frame involved is this far beyond the limits of theoretically feasible technology . hans @ - @ hans bremermann , a professor of mathematics and statistics at the university of california , berkeley , has argued thathis 1965 stated that the " speed , accuracy , and processing power of all the modern computer systems are limited by three major barriers : the mechanical barrier , the physical barrier , and the mathematical barrier . these barriers mean , for example , that no computer , however powerful , will ever be able to solve the entire set of possible playing patterns of the game of chess . " however , bremermann did not dismiss the idea that no computer would ever be able to solve chess . he wrote , " in order to make a computer solve a perfect or near perfect game [ of chess ] it would be necessary either to analyze the game thoroughly . . . or to analyze the game in an efficient way and combine this with a certain amount of mathematical analysis . . . . the theoretical basis of the # ##s , however , is still very much debated . " recent computer advances have not significantly changed that fact . the game of chess was solved in 2007 , and it requires twice the square root of the number of pieces in play . peter schaeffer , the mathematician who led the effort , believed a machine such as quantum computing would be possible before perfect chess could even be done , but he did not rule out the possibility , saying that the one thing he learned from his 20 @ - @ - method of solving chess " is to never forget the advances in computers " . = = = = = " you can win with any black if you are the best player , but it takes time with white .
