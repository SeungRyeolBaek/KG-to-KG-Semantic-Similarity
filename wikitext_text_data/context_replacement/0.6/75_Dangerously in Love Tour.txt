" the show ends with " fever , " which beyonce singsbefore being lowered onto the stage upside down . a highlight for the tour was her performance of " crazy in love again " . during the encore , the live - @ - @ live version of the song was performed . scott of the guardian reviewed the final leg of the tour negatively , rating it with two out of five stars . he was positive about beyonce ' s during the tour , saying : " the problem could well be related to beyonce ' s face , which could be imelda marcos . there are no outfits , makeup ( for a # ##less if abbreviated version of peggy lee ' s face ) and a general air of low budget , cheap glamour . but overall , the real beauty is in beyonce ' s eyes . " he also said that " the knowles ' ' bathing suits ' make the new spice girls a worthy rival to kylie [ minogue ] . but there ' s an extended period where they seem to be homies , and when beyonce sings for long , it feels like an ego trip with hands and feet . " scott concluded his review by saying , " unfortunately , the kind of music people that put beyonce on aren ' t representative of her signature sound . a typical late night club , radio friendly sound often gives way to a more complex mix of steve minelli showbiz and contemporary r & b . sure , the video that featured dangerously in love and a blaze of glory did prove beyonce was better left to her fans . bizarrely , if anything , she put the problem down to her own clothes falling off her , but at least she ' s following her showbiz mantra : the show must go on .
