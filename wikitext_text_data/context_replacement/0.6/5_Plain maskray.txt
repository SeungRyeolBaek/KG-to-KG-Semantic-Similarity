= = maskray = the plain maskray or plain ray ( neotrygon annotata ) is a species of ray in the family noctuidae . it is found in shallow , sandy @ - @ like habitats in western australia . measuring 23 cm ( 8 @ . @ 1 in ) in length , this species has a whip @ - @ shaped , dark brown dorsal fin disc . the long , ring @ - @ shaped tail has distinct black and white stripes and dark spots above and below . there are two rows of scales on the sides and the base of the tail , but otherwise the skin is smooth . although this species has the distinctive whip @ - @ shaped pattern around the body common to its relatives , it is not uniformly patterned like other maskrays . common in australia , the plain maskray feeds primarily on caridean shrimp and small invertebrates , and to a lesser extent on small bony fishes . reproduction is reproductive , with females producing clutches of one or two young that are fed during pregnancy via histotroph ( " sea growth " ) . this species has commercial value and is caught only by reef habitats , which it is thought to be less able to access than other maskrays due to its heavy nature . because it also has a restricted range and low population , the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) has assessed it as near threatened . = = taxonomy and distribution = = the first formal description of the plain maskray was published by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation ( csiro ) scientist john last in a 1987 issue of proceedings of the national museum of victoria . the specific epithet annotatus comes from the latin am ( " plain " ) and notatus ( " marked " ) , and refers to the species ' s appearance . the specimen was a male 8 @ . @ 1 cm ( 8 @ . @ 1 in ) sl , collected off northern australia ; two paratypes were subsequently described . last originally placed the species in the genus rufus , suggesting that it belonged to the " maskray " species group that also included the bluespotted ray ( formerly called kuhlii ) . in 2008 , last and william smith raised the kuhlii group to the rank of a genus , neotrygon , on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis . in a 2012 phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna , the genus maskrayand the ningaloo maskray ( n . ningalooensis ) were found to be the most basal members of neotrygon . the split of the n . annotata species was estimated to have occurred ~ 50 ma . however , the data included in the study split into two genetically distinct populations , suggesting that n . annotata is a distinct species complex . the two distinct populations were estimated to have occurred ~ 1 @ . @ 50 ma ; the latter event was probably the extinction of the two species by climatic erosion . = = = = = the dorsal fin disc of the plain maskray is oval and ring @ - @ shaped with slightly rounded front margins , measuring 4 @ . @ @ – @ @ . @ 5 times longer than wide . the outer margins of the disc are slightly curved and placed at a right angle to the front margin of the disc . the compound eyes are located close together , and behind them are the nostrils . the nostrils are large and have a diamond @ - @ shaped strip of skin between them . the large mouth has deep teeth at the corners and has many small teeth on the inside . small teeth are also present at the corners of the mouth . there are two pairs of gill slits . the dorsal fins are relatively large and rounded . the tail is short , about half the length of the body when extended , and has a rounded and pointed tip due to the two short spines . behind the spines , the tail is longer and has a lower ventral fin fold and a slightly shorter , narrower dorsal fin fold . most of the disc lacks any thorns ; a single row of 0 – , long , widely spaced thorns is present behind the eyes , and a row of 0 – thorns occur behind the eyes . the dorsal fin is dark brown , becoming lighter towards the gill margin ; there is a dark diamond @ - @ @ pattern around the eyes and a row of small black spots behind the eyes . the skin around the eyes has alternating black and white stripes of equal length , edged with white at the tip . the belly is mostly white and the dorsal fin fold is dark brown in color . this species grows to 24 cm ( 9 @ . @ 9 in ) across and 45 cm ( 18 in ) deep . = = distribution and abundance = = the plain maskray inhabit the continental shelf of western australia from the wellesley islands in theto the bismarck gulf of western australia , including the gulf of papua and the timor and arafura islands . there are also reports that its range extends to southern papua new guinea . it is the only known of the three maskray species endemic to the pacific . this species is a bottom @ - @ bodied that prefers areas with sandy sand . it has been recorded from between 12 and 62 m ( 39 and 203 ft ) deep , and tends to be found further away from land than other maskrays throughout its range . = = range and distribution = = the plain maskray generally lives near the bottom of the sandy bottom , rather than diving for food . its diet consists mainly of caridean shrimp and small worms . other bony fishes are also taken , along with the occasional penaeid shrimp and shrimp . larger rays eat a wider variety of invertebrates and have fewer small ##s when compared to smaller rays . this species is parasitized by the bacterium acanthobothrium jonesi . like other rays , the plain maskray is born with the developing embryo carried to adulthood by histotroph ( " breast milk " ) provided by the female . the females have a single mature sperm and pouch , on the underside . litter size is one or two ; the males measure about – ##5 cm ( 6 @ . @ @ – @ @ . @ 6 in ) long . males and females reach sexual maturity at disc sizes of 1 – ##4 cm ( 8 @ . @ 1 – @ @ . @ 8 in ) and 18 – ##4 cm ( 8 @ . @ . – @ @ . @ 7 in ) respectively . the maximum lifespan is estimated to be 8 years for males and 6 years for females . = = recent settlement = = the main economic threat to the plain maskray is illegal fishing by commercial bottom feeding fisheries . in the present day , this is primarily controlled by australia ' s northern territory government , which operates within its range . although this species is dangerous when caught , it is more bottom @ - @ bodied than other maskrays and is more likely to survive fishing with fishing gear . however , this species may also have been negatively impacted by japanese , korean , and korean fishermen that fished extensively in western australia from 1959 to 1990 . these factors , combined with the plain maskray ' s limited range and low commercial success , have resulted in its being consideredconsidered species extinction by the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) . = 2011 – = columbus blue jackets season = the 2011 – = columbus blue jackets season was the team ' s 39th season in the national hockey league ( nhl ) . the blue jackets ' record of -

@ up in the nhl for defenseman history , behind tobias enstrom . the blue jackets came to terms with wisniewski , just an hour prior to the start of free agency , signing him to a six @ - @ up , $ 25 million contract . they also traded 2011 first round draft pick nikita filatov to the ottawa senators for the second @ -

[ [ ] ] the losing streak came to an end three days later with a win over the detroit red wings . during the season , several goals were achieved . ryan wisniewskiin his nhl debut , ryan johansen and ryan murphy scored their first career nhl goals and ryan clitsome led led team @ - @ with two assists . columbus was unable to build any momentum from the start , however , and continued to struggle , resulting in a disappointing – - – losing record , which was the worst start to an nhl season for the team in 20 years . with the team struggling , columbus decided to " shake things up " by making several blockbuster changes . the first move was the acquisition of forward patrick letestu from the pittsburgh penguins . next , they traded defenseman grant bryant to the st . louis blues for nikita nikitin . as the teams slow start continued , there were rumors that head coach mike arniel would be fired and replaced with ken hitchcock . hitchcock had previously led the blue jackets to their first playoff appearance in franchise history and was still under contract with the team up to the end of the season . before any of these rumors came to light , the st . louis blues asked columbus for permission to fire hitchcock , which the blue jackets granted . hitchcock began his teams ' tenure with a disappointing – - – 4 record over his first six games , while columbus had a + – - – points record to begin the season . during the same time period as the aforementioned firing , goaltender brian sanford returned from his shoulder surgery on october 16 . he made his first start of the season against the boston bruins , going for – goals in a shootout . sanford continued his inconsistent play , posting a + – ₎ – pts rating , and @ . @ . goals against average and . 947 save percentage over his next five games . sanford missed six consecutive games before steve nash made his first start . the number of injuries could not have been as high , but prior to the november 23 game , mason was hit in the head by a puck from steve nash during pre @ - @ games and @ - @ game and suffered a concussion . mason returned from his injury after two games , making the start against the vancouver canucks . he allowed only one goal in the game , suffering from concussion in the first period , before being replaced by sanford for just over 20 minutes . vancouver won the game by – goals in a row , snapping a 5 @ - @ . losing streak to the canucks . after the game , arniel stated that sanford was now ranked as the team ' s number one goaltender . however , he missed five of the next six games with the blue jackets giving up – - – goals during that span . = = = january –= = = = with the season approaching , more rumors began to surface . as before , the rumors were about player changes rather than ownership changes . the majority of rumors were that the blue jackets would trade steve nash . while howson stated that he had not given up rick nash in years , other sources also speculated about his options . he stated that if he thought it would suit the team better than he would be willing to honor his all @ - @ - request . howson also stated that he had no intention of trading nash . further rumors came to light when reports leaked to the detroit moines reported that carter was back in columbus and seeking a trade . howson , nash and his agent all stated that a transfer request was being made , and they were unsure where the rumors were coming from . with the trade deadline approaching , rumors picked up about the blue jackets trading nash . rumors circulated that columbus was willing to trade him and that he was " 100 % committed . " at the halfway point of the season , with the blue jackets slipping into double digit play with an 11 – - – - record , last in the nhl , and only two games out of playoff contention , columbus fired arniel . he was replaced by assistant coach mike richards on an interim basis . richards had previously coached the minnesota wild . richards earned his first playoff win for the blue jackets in his first game , a game – overtime win over the phoenix coyotes . the change in ownership did not change the fortunes of the team , as they entered the 2012 @ - @ - game with a record – ##9 – 6 record . after the season , blue jackets ' president john j . mcconnell sent out a letter to fans expressing his view of their situation . he said that action would be taken at the trade deadline , the dispersal draft and free agency to take the team in a new direction . when speaking of the fans , mcconnell said " rebuilding is not a strong enough word " and that he was committed to giving them a team of which they can be proud of . he also thanked them for their support and support , while stating that the team goal was to " play consistently and successfully for the stanley cup . " days later , a 250 @ - @ - protest began outside of the arena . fans were unhappy with the blue jackets ' performance and began asking for change at the arena . the same day the fans protested , it was announced that the fans would boycott the 2013 all @ - @ - game . columbus was without a team for the 2012 all @ - @ star game , as ryanjohansen represented the team as a regular player in the nhl shootout competition . following the playoffs , johansen competed in the allstate radio nhl survivor challenge , a survivor style competition judged by the league . he received only 1 % of the vote and finished fourth . at the playoffs , the blue jackets were on the road against the los angeles kings , and with the score tied late in the game , kings ' defenseman ryan doughty scored with just 0 @ . @ 8 seconds remaining to tie the game . upon receipt of the score clock , was discovered that the clock at staples center stopped at 0 @ . @ 4 seconds for approximately a full minute , which would have resulted in time delay prior to the goal being scored . kings ' general manager vince lombardi stated that the clock was faulty and that the time had been delayed due to the way the clock in @ - @ stopped at odd times . howson stated on the team ' s website that " it was an incredible coincidence that with the kings on the power play at staples center and with a desperate run for our net in the final seconds of the third period of a 60 – point playoff game that the clock stopped for at least a full second , " and that , " either it was a premature stop of the clock or the clock stopped . " nhl executive vice president of hockey operations colin campbell stated that the blue jackets were fine , but that the outcome of the game could not be determined , and that the clock was not checked by the high @ - @ end fans or the locker officials in attendance . to determine the root cause of the clock problem , the nhl launched an investigation , consulting with the clock ' s operators and the staples center officials . two days prior to the nhl trade deadline , columbus announced that , earlier in the month , they would respond to trade rumors for steve nash , but they were not considering pursuing him . howson stated that the deal was open to discuss parties for purchasing the team , including rick nash . speculation was that in exchange for nash the blue jackets would ask for a " wealth of experience , healthy players , high @ - @ nhl , and draft picks . " leading up to the trade deadline , the blue jackets traded antoine vermette to the phoenix coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender ryan mcelhinney . despite being unsigned at the time , the trade of mcelhinney was expected to give columbus the opportunity to trade chris sanford . the following day , on june 28 , columbus traded jeff fisher to the coyotes . in theadditionally , columbus received defenseman chris nash and a fourth @ - @ round draft pick ; the team was given the option of keeping the pick in either 2012 or 2013 . at the time , columbus was unable to come to terms with a trade for nash , but they did make one significant trade ; they traded forward marcus pahlsson to the vancouver canucks in exchange for two fourth @ - @ round draft picks and minor league defenseman brian smith . at the trade deadline , howson revealed that the team had agreed to trade nash at the canucks ' s request . he stated that he had made the trade after being told that the team was going into a rebuilding phase . he also stated that he felt that he " could use a big part of that towards bringing nash back , " and in his opinion " it was the best thing for the fans , the team , and me for [ his ] family .
