= arihant @ - @ description = = the arihant class ( hindi , for king of whales ) is a class of nuclear @ - @ powered ballistic missile submarines being built for the indian navy . they are built under the us $ 1 @ . @ 1 billion advanced technology vessel ( atv ) project to design and build nuclear @ - @ powered submarines . the first ship of the class , ins arihant was launched in 2009 and after undergoing sea trials , was declared as ready for service on 1 january 2016 . arihant is the first ballistic missile submarine to have been launched by a country other than one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council . = = description = = in december 1971 , during the indo @ - @ submarine crisis of 1971 , the us president richard nixon sent a naval task force , task force 77 , led by the nuclear @ - @ submarine uss enterprise into the bay of bengal in an attempt to blockade india . in 1972 , the soviet union sent a submarine armed with nuclear weapons from russia to reinforce the naval task force . the submarine demonstrated the potential of nuclear power and ballistic missile submarines to indian prime minister indira gandhi . following the 1974 little buddha nuclear test , the directorate of naval engineering ( dme ) at naval headquarters initiated a naval feasibility study for an indian nuclear propulsion system ( project 932 ) . the indian navy ' s advanced technology vessel project to design and build a nuclear submarine took shape in the 1990s . then defence secretary george fernandes announced the project in 1998 . the original intent of the project was to build nuclear @ - @ powered fast attack submarines , but following nuclear tests conducted by india in 1998 at pokhran test range and the indian policy of nuclear weapons testing , the project was re @ - @ geared towards the development of a ballistic missile submarine in order to support india ' s nuclear program . = = description = = the arihant @ - @ class submarines are nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines built under the advanced technology vessel ( atv ) project . they will be the first nuclear submarines designed and built by india . the submarines are 112 m ( 367 ft ) long with a beam of 11 m ( 36 ft ) , a draft of 10 m ( 33 ft ) , displacement of 5 @ , @ 000 t ( 5 @ , @ 900 long tons ; 5 @ , @ 600 short tons ) and a maximum depth of 300 m ( 980 ft ) . the crew is about 200 , including officers and ratings . the submarines are powered by a nuclear seven -is driven by an 83 mw ( 111 @ , @ 000 km ) boiling water reactor and can reach a maximum speed of 12 – 12 knots ( 22 – ##7 km / h ) when surfaced and 24 knots ( 44 km / h ) when submerged . the submarines have two torpedo tubes in their hull and can carry up to 12 k @ - @ 20 sagarika torpedoes with one missile launcher ( with a range of 750 km or 470 mi ) and two k @ - @ 20 missiles ( with a range of 4 @ , @ 300 km and 4 @ , @ 500 km ) . the submarines are similar to the akula @ - @ class submarines of russia . the indian navy submarines based on ins chakra , an akula @ - @ class submarine acquired from russia in 2012 . = = = = = the submarines are powered by a boiling water reactor with highly enriched uranium fuel . the prototype version of the submarine was designed and built by the bhabha atomic research centre ( barc ) and the indira gandhi centre for atomic research ( igcar ) in kalpakkam . it has a 100 @ - @ m ( 138 ft ) section of the submarine ' s pressure hull , the outer layer with shielding and the reactor , a plotting room , as well as an electronic control room for the propulsion systems . the first reactor became operational on 22 september 2003 and was declared operational on 1 september 2006 . the failure of the reactor for two years delayed the production run of the reactor for arihant . the reactor components were tested at the naval development centre in visakhapatnam . facilities for manufacturing and storing the reactor components of the nuclear reactors of the ships were also tested . the reverse engineering of the reactor was done by larsen & toubro ' s marine technology division at their hazira ##bad site . tata - sed developed the propulsion system for the submarine . the gas turbines and power systems associated with the reactor were built by walchandnagar shipyard . the nuclear reactor underwent a long and intensive period of testing before its commissioning in december 2009 . the turbines and power systems were tested with harbor @ - @ pressure hull ##s followed by harbor @ - @ diving trials that included underwater tests of filling the ballast tanks and of diving to extreme depths . the arihant ' s reactor became operational for the first time on 1 january 2013 . on 1 january 2014 , the submarine set sail for its first sea trials . = = currently in service = = = date of completed trials is unknown, according to press reports , up to five vessels are expected to be built . the lead ship of the class , ins arihant is expected to be commissioned by 2016 . the next three boats are expected to be commissioned by 2023 . in december 2014 , the work on a new nuclear submarine started and the first ship , ins aridhaman is being prepared for sea trials . the next three boats of the class , after the first ship , will be smaller and have larger vertical torpedo tubes to carry up to a k4 and a more powerful light water reactor than ins arihant . a larger variant in comparison to the arihant class is also planned , these three ships will be capable of carrying up to 18 ballistic missiles . = = = = =
