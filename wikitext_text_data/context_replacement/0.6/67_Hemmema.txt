= hemmema = = hemmema ( from finnish " hameenmaa " , tavastia ) was a type of warship built for the swedish archipelago fleet and the russian archipelago fleet in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . the hemmema was originally designed for use against the russian empire in the u ##s and off the coasts of svealand and finland . it was designed by the famous and influential swedish naval architect fredrik henrik af horn ( 1721 – 1808 ) in collaboration with augustin ehrensvard ( 1710 – 1772 ) , an artillery officer and later commander of the swedish archipelago fleet . the hemmema was a naval vessel for use in the shallow waters and narrow bays that formed the chain of islands and bays extending from the swedish capital of stockholm into the gulf of finland . the hemmema replaced the galley that had made up the bulk of the swedish archipelago fleet until the late @ - @ 18th century . compared to galley , the hemmema had a smaller hull and was slower to sail , but provided better protection for the crew , carried more provisions , was more mobile and carried about three times as many heavy guns . it could be propelled by either sail or steam and was much slower and less expensive than other galley ships , which made it ideal for use in shallow waters . between 1764 and 1809 , sweden built twelve hemmemas . the hemmema was the largest and most heavily armed ship in the swedish navy and participated in the russo @ - @ finnish war of 1788 – [UNK] . oden , the first hemmema , was very large and very similar to the turuma , a swedish type of " galley ship " . russia built twelve hemmemas based on the swedish design between 1808 and 1823 , capturing one of the swedish ships at the battle of sveaborg in 1808 . the russian ships , both swedish and russian , were much larger and much more heavily armed than oden . = = = = = = = peter the great had established a very large and prestigious naval academy in saint petersburg in 1703 . russian naval operations in the baltic began to challenge the authority of sweden , the dominant naval power in the region . swedish territory at that time included territories in southern russia , most of northern finland and all of the baltic sea , a situation based on , and influenced by , the baltic sea trade routes . during the great northern war ( 1700 – 1721 ) , sweden lost all its possessions in the baltic sea and faced repeated defeats in finland and in the bay of islands andand sailed from the gulf of finland to norway . the russians began to build large squadrons of 300 @ - @ armed ships , along with smaller versions of the larger sailing vessels . many of these smaller vessels were very similar to galiots and were replaced with smaller vessels . the finnish war with denmark ( 1741 – [UNK] ) and the swedish victory against russia in the seven years ' war ( 1757 – - ) created the need for the replacement and expansion of the archipelago fleet with more modern vessels . they were used as fast transports for naval personnel , but provided not sufficient @ - @ protection , especially in relation to their small size ; a galley with a 250 @ - @ armed crew , most of whom were sailors , would typically carry only one 4 @ - @ - gun and two 3 @ - @ guns , mounted in the stern . the ships also lacked provisions and poor accommodation for the 300 @ - @ crew , many of whom succumbed to disease as a result of sickness during the winter of 1741 – ##年 . = = = archipelago fleet = = = after the finnish war against sweden in 1743 , the government established a commission to investigate weaknesses in the swedish navy . in 1747 , the commission concluded that the fortifications in southern sweden needed to be improved and strengthened , and that sweden needed to build a strong standing navy . augustin ehrensvard ( 1710 – [UNK] ) , an artillery officer , was the driving force behind these changes . the commission based many of its recommendations and recommendations on his findings . in 1756 , it established the archipelago fleet with the new title armens flotta ( " arm of the sea " ) under the authority of the privy council , krigskollegium , with ehrensvard as its commander . for several decades , the struggle for power between the nobility and the nobility , the dominant social class at the time , and rivalry between army and navy brought many changes to the archipelago fleet . the reduced representation of the nobility in the riksdag ( 1769 – , and the coup d ' etat of king gustav iii in 1772 ended the archipelago fleet ' s existence as an independent branch of the navy . beginning in 1770 , the archipelago fleet merged with the swedish squadron ( finska eskadern ) based at sveaborg . in 1777 , it became the swedish squadron ( svenska eskadern ) , the naval branch based at gothenburg . the swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new naval force and made it a permanent , permanent ,. the new class included members of the military and political elite and enjoyed the support and patronage of king gustav iii , who had established himself as an absolute monarch after the 1772 revolution . after the poor performance of ships in russo – swedish war of 1741 – , and the pomeranian war ( 1757 – 1758 ) , development of frigates was begun . during the pomeranian war , experiments had been conducted with " archipelago frigates " ( skottpramar ) , heavily armed , 12 @ - @ rate , sixth @ - @ rate ships with a shallow draft that carried guns of various sizes . the frigates carried more guns than the ships , but were far too small to be effective . augustin ehrensvard called for armed archipelago frigates that had range , speed , endurance , and comfortable living conditions . he began a long collaboration with captain fredrik henrik chapman ( called " af ##rika " in 1772 ) , and together they developed two new designs : a galley with a 12 @ - @ rate gun and a frigate design , as well as two types of " archipelago frigates " ( skargardsfregatter ) : the smaller udema and pojama , and the larger turuma and hemmema . all these types have been called skargardsfregatter ( archipelago frigates ) in swedish and finnish naval literature , although some authors have called the udema and pojama " archipelago frigates " . chapman had designed the archipelago frigates for service on the southern coast of finland and named them after the finnish islands of uusimaa , pohjanmaa ( osterbotten ) , turunmaa ( aboland ) , and hameenmaa ( tavastia ) . = = = = = the concept of armed archipelago frigates with a single set of sails ( or " sails " ) was not new . the swedish royal navy had used armed " galleasses " since the sixth @ - @ rate period . in the 1660s its predecessor , the dutch navy , used the ships of 12 @ - @ rates with gun shields above and below the gundeck . during the 18th century the russian navy used " shebecks " , smaller versions of the french xebecs , for patrol duties . the xebecs were fast sailers , could be armed if needed and had longer range and greater speed than frigates ; they were also less expensive to build . the russian navy of 1812 and the french navy2 . however , chapman ' s designs for these ships were reminiscent of those designs , especially with respect to the frigates . chapman ' s archipelago frigates had more accommodation for their crew than the frigates they replaced , and up to three times the capacity for stores and provisions . they could operate in the sheltered , shallow waters of skerries in all seasons and in open water in all but the worst weather . they had a longer hull than frigates , but a shorter hull than traditional sailing warships . the new hull design greatly increased the sail frigate ' s range , provided it with greater reconnaissance capabilities , and allowed for more effective fire ##power for naval artillery . = = design and construction = = of the new ships , turumas and hemmemas better fit the definition of " sail frigates " because of their resemblance to the ocean @ - @ sail frigates . the first hemmema , the oden , was built in 1764 . it was 33 . 33 m ( 108 @ . @ 108 ft ) long and 44 @ . @ 2 m ( 13 @ . @ 6 ft ) wide with a beam of 9 @ . @ 8 m ( 9 @ . @ 26 ft ) . it had a wooden hull with no keel , only a single mast , and no upper deck . it had two decks that were square rigged with four sails , like a frigate . the navy soon replaced the sail frigate with the more modern ocean @ - @ sail frigate design . the new design called for two pairs of boats with two men per pair . the men drove their boats from the fire ##ports with the shafts located in the gunports , closer to the hull , which gave the boat more stability . the boats were then mounted on a single mast , presumably to further improve the stability . even so , hemmemas handled poorly when loaded and were unreliable in high seas . they were slower than traditional sailing warships , but much faster than frigates . during the finnish war of 1788 – 1790 , chapman built two hemmemas of a similar design . they were much larger , 16 @ . @ 44 by 11 m ( 146 by 36 ft ) , and the number of guns was increased to 14 pairs . they also fired some of the larger shells , especially when compared with the much smaller ships of the high seas fleet . the naval architect carl fredrik aschling ##e worked with chapman to increase the main armament to 44 @ - @ - 36 @- @ guns and the 12 @ - @ guns , which increased the draft to about 25 mm ( 1 in ) . the use of longitudinal ribs to support the hull allowed the smaller hemmemas to carry guns more effectively , than those of the larger capital ships of the high seas fleet . due to their superior speed and large size , naval historian peter glete has described the hemmemas as " gun - frigates " . the hemmema ' s design was very similar to that of the turuma . the main difference was that the turuma ' s crew sat on the lower deck below the bridge , whereas the hemmema ' s crew sat on the gundeck . the later hemmemas were much larger , more heavily armed , and of a more robust construction . glete has described them as variations of the swedish design , especially when comparing the pre @ - @ r ships . = = = = = hemmemas served in the baltic sea during the years of 1788 – 1790 . they supported amphibious landings and naval operations on the russian coast ##s , while at the same time acting as the @ - @ r ##r ##ers for the naval forces on the russian coast . hemmemas participated in the first and second battles of svensksund . during the first battle in 1789 , one hemmema engaged the smaller turumas , and during the second battle in may 1790 , the hemmemas made up the entire force and provided a large part of the fire . the swedish were building three more hemmemas in the shipyard of the city of sveaborg when it was surrendered to the russians in 1808 , and all three were commissioned into the russian navy . soon after , the russian navy ordered its first 12 @ - @ r ##boats , with the first being completed as early as 1823 . two examples were built in sweden in 1809 , birger jarl and erik segersall . birger jarl died in an accident in 1813 and erik segersall was intended for conversion to a floating artillery battery for coastal defence , but the project was eventually abandoned and the vessel scrapped in 1826 . like the other swedish sailing frigates , the hemmema had both strengths and weaknesses . although it had superior speed compared to others , its defensive capabilities were very limited and while more effective with sails , it was more difficult to maneuver while submerged . the hemmema had the potential to be an effective weapon against artillery , buttheir superior armament and its outgunning them with powerful cannons ##s . in an ideal battle situation , it could cause considerable havoc , but such a weapon was never used in an actual battle , leaving that tactical advantage behind . = = = = = a total of twelve hemmemas were built , six of them for the swedish royal navy and two for the finnish navy . details of the ships are listed below . the twelve hemmemas were all built to the same design , except for the swedish frigate oden , and birger jarl and erik segersall carried more guns than the others . tredrea and sozaev describe oden as a turuma and as a hemmema in 1784 , but both nikula and lars @ - @ otto ##n do not . the twelve vessels were built between 1808 and 1823 and have been described by tredea and sozaev as bodryi @ - @ , " armored frigates " . despite the shortened name " hameenmaa " , the name of the entire class was also passed on to several ships of the 19th century finnish navy .
