@ level in 1960 as second division champions . the following season aston villa became the first club to win the football league title . mercer ' s early retirement from the game in 1964 began a period of slow decline . the most successful club in england was struggling to keep up with expectations in the football world , with villa being relegated for the first time , under manager # ##ov in 1967 . the following season the club asked for the board to resign after they finished 16th in the second division . with mounting debts and villa finishing at the bottom of division two , the board appointed tommy taylor ( the man brought in to replace smith ) , and within months the new board came under intense pressure from fans . after much turmoil , control of the club was taken by the chairman stanley matthews , who then brought in doug wilson as chairman . however , new management could not prevent villa being relegated to the third division for the first time at the end of the 1969 – 70 season. however , villa soon began to improve under the guidance of former club chairman vic crowe . in the 1971 – - season they returned to the first division as champions with a record 100 points . in 1974 , ron saunders was appointed manager . his run of successful @ - @ - - @ - @ flight was successful , with the club winning the league title the following season and , by the end of season 1974 – 1975 , saunders had led them back into the first division and into europe . villa were again among the leaders and saunders continued to build a strong team . this culminated in a second consecutive @ - @ flight league title in 1980 – 1981 . to the surprise of players and fans , saunders resigned midway through the 1981 – - season , after falling out with the board , with villa reaching the quarter finals of the european cup . he was replaced by his former @ - @ flight assistant manager tony barton who led the club to a 1 – 0 victory over bayern munich in the uefa cup final in 1982 courtesy of a john terry goal . the following season villa were crowned european super cup champions , beating barcelona in the final . this was a disappointment , and villa ' s fortunes declined steadily for most of the 1980s , culminating in relegation in 1987 . this was followed by promotion the following season under graham taylor and a second @ -

@ health . after much speculation it was announced the stake was to be bought by american businessman jerry brown , owner of nfl team the cleveland browns . the arrival of the new owner randy jackson and of chairman martin o ' neill marked the beginning of a new era of ownership at villa , and many changes occurred at the club including a new chairman , a new chairmanmanagerial and coaching changes followed the summer of 2007 . the first major defeat of the new manager came in 2010 when villa were beaten 1 – 0 in the league cup final . villa made a surprise visit to wembley later that season losing 1 – 0 to chelsea in the fa cup final . just two weeks before the final game of the 2010 – championship season , o ' neill resigned as manager with immediate effect . the club appointed gerard houllier as his replacement in november 2010 , but he stepped down on 30 june 2011 due to ill @ - @ health . houllier was replaced by birmingham city manager alex mcleish , despite strong protests from fans against his appointment ; this was the first time that a manager had moved away from birmingham to birmingham . mcleish ' s contract was terminated at the end of the 2011 – championship season after villa finished in 14th place , again finishing in the relegation zone . on 1 july 2012 , aston villa announced the appointment of former norwich city manager paul lambert as the replacement for mcleish . on 5 july 2012 , the club announced a net loss of £ ##4 @ . @ 1 million . lambert put the club up for sale on 30 june 2014 , with an estimated loss of £ ##4 million . with lambert back on board , in the 2014 – -
