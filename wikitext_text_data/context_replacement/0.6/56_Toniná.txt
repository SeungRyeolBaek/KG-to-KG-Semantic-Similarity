= tonina = tonina ( la tonina in maya language ) is a pre @ - @ maya archaeological site and capital city of the maya civilization located in what is now the mexican state of chiapas , about 13 km ( 8 @ . @ 8 mi ) southeast of the town of ocosingo . the site is medium to large , with hundreds of 4 @ - @ structures built on terraces up to 71 m ( 233 ft ) , a temple , a ball court for playing the ball game , and over 100 stone sculptures , mostly dating from the 5th century to the 8th century ad , during the classic period . tonina is distinguished by its well preserved stone structures and also by its 4 @ - @ the @ - @ style stone monuments , preserved to an extent not seen in guatemala since the collapse of the much earlier maya civilization . tonina was an independent state during the late classic , a force to create a centralized state . for much of its history , tonina was involved in constant warfare with palenque , the chief city and one of the most powerful states in the history of the maya civilization , although tonina eventually became the largest state in the region . the site is notable for having the longest recorded population and period of any maya site , at the end of the classic classic period in ad 909 . = = location = = tonina means people of time in the tzeltal language of the ancient maya civilization , an ancient name for the place where stone structures were erected to represent time . however , this is a variant , and the original name was either toni or popo , found in ancient maya texts with the name used for the people of tonina , p ' uhul p ' ajaw ( the people of time ) . a spanish map from colonial guatemala , in 1558 , shows a group called the p ' winikob ' ( people of time ) . early versions of the tonina # ##s have a double sound , and the name popo is not found in colonial documents . since these letters are often found in maya writing , popo may be the original name of the city . = = location = = tonina is located at an altitude of 800 to 900 m ( 3 @ , @ 600 to 3 @ , @ 000 ft ) above mean sea level in the chiapas department of central guatemala , about 40 mi ( 64 km ) southeast of the maya capital city of palenque ,tonina ' s main attraction is its long history . tonina is separated from palenque by mountainous terrain and the site itself is located on an easily - accessed mountain ridge , to the west of a small tributary of the rio jatate , one of the three rivers of the ocosingo basin . = = = = = rulers of tonina mentioned in the maya texts on tonina site include : the earliest known occupation record for the site is found on monument 217 , dated may 909 ce . = = = = = = = = late classic = = = tonina had a very extensive late classic period , although the late classic monuments are mostly buried under later structures . due to this , maya texts are scarce and only provide a glimpse of the early history of the site . an 8th @ - @ century monument refers to a ruler reigning in monument 217 , although it only mentions his title , not his name . ruler 1 is represented on a number of late classic monuments , the earliest known of which is an inscription that dates to 514 . a ruler known as the great king is represented on a 7th @ - @ century monument , which records him ascending to the throne in 568 . the first mention of tonina in a document from the maya civilization is from the site of chinikiha , located 72 kilometres ( 45 mi ) to the east on the usumacinta river , the text comes from a document and records the coronation of a king from tonina in 573 . = = = early classic = = = = = = = k ' inich hix chapat = = = = tonina ' s history comes into focus during the late classic , when the occupation record is not well documented in maya texts . in 633 k ' inich hix chapat is recorded as having two different rulers . little else is known of his reign , although he was probably crowned in 595 . the last mention of k ' inich hix chapat is on a monument dated to 665 that appears to be a standing stone . = = = = ruler 1 = = = = ruler 1 ascended to the throne of tonina in 668 . his reign was marked by warfare and the frequent depiction of naked prisoners on his monuments . ruler 2 introduced the use of the @ - @ the @ - @ style , elements that came to dominate the architecture of tonina . a monument dated to 682 depicts two naked prisoners withtheir hands joined , one of them is identified as a man from annak ' , an as yet unknown city . his reign may have ended with his defeat and capture of k ' inich kan balam ii of palenque in ad 687 , as recorded in a glyphic relief from temple 3 in the capital city , an event that probably resulted in his death . = = = = k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak = = = = k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak was born in 688 , two years after ruler 4 , and reigned for twenty @ - @ seven years . during his reign he increased tonina ' s prestige with a series of military victories over palenque , and his reign was marked by the struggle against the rival city for political power . ballcourt 2 , the larger of tonina ' s two ballcourts , was built in 699 to commemorate his victories over the city ' s twenty @ - @ seven . the ballcourt also contained three bodies of political prisoners , probably those of the last palenque ruler from the usumacinta region . the date of the king ' s death is unknown . = = = = ruler 4 = = = = ruler 4 came to power in 708 at a very young age . two years later , in 711 , while ruler 4 was still a child , tonina won an important victory over palenque . the victory resulted in the death of kan - chitam ii of palenque and gave tonina the political power in the northern usumacinta region . the victory was so important that it resulted in the twenty @ - @ seven period in the political history of the rival city , during which the young king may have been a child . ruler 4 remained in power to see the political events of 716 and 721 . the image depicted on one of his coins is identified as being from the capital city of calakmul , one of the two regional " capitals " . = = = = k ' inich ich ' aak chapat = = = = ruler 4 was killed by k ' inich ich ' aak chapat in 723 . in 725 tonina fought a battle against piedras negras , a city on the west bank of the usumacinta river , now in guatemala . a number of events during his reign are recorded on coins between 726 and 729 and in 730 the kingthe death of his son k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak . the wife of k ' inich ich ' aak chapat is named as lady winik timan k ' awiil and his father may well have been k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak himself . the reign of k ' inich ich ' aak chapat is notable for the discovery of the stone reliefs of several female prisoners , although the reason for this is unknown . = = = = = = = = = = little is known of the next two rulers , ruler 6 is named as k ' inich tuun chapat , who ruled the very beginning of 736 and may have ended 762 . a stone inscription from the burial of a female prisoner records his contact with palenque during his reign , but the identity of the prisoner is unknown and it is unclear if he was the actual ruler of palenque or just one of his generals . he was succeeded by ruler 7 , of whom even less is known . in 764 tonina defeated palenque in battle . in 775 an inscription records the death of ah wak chan ch ' i ' , a man who appears to have been the heir to the throne and who died before he could assume it . ruler 8 was the last of the great warrior kings of tonina . he won a number of victories between 789 and 806 , including the battle of pomoy in 789 , and the capture of the princess ucha ' i aj chih , who appears to have been the daughter of b ' olon k ' awiil of calakmul . in 799 he destroyed the tomb of ruler 7 . ruler 8 undertook an extensive remodelling of the upper part of the pyramid . ruler 8 erected a number of statues of female prisoners of war and assumed the title aj b ' olon ich ' aak , " lord of the women " . however , the greatest part of tonina ' s power was derived from his control of the city of sak tz ' i ' ( black mountain ) , an important city in the lacandon valley , an area which had previously been dominated by tonina . by the time of ruler 8 ' s successor , uh chapat , tonina was already in decline . only a single battle , in 837 , can be dated to his reign , although a stone relief of women with chains around their necks may point tohis period of rule . the occupation of tonina continued after the late classic maya cities had disappeared , perhaps aided by the site ' s relative isolation . phase ii is identified with a temple dating to 904 during the late classic and a cemetery dating to 909 , the earliest known population remains , although the layout of the site has not survived . ceramic remains indicate that occupation of the site lasted for a millennium or more . = = = modern history = = = the first written record of the site was made by father jacinto garrido at the end of the 18th century . a number of expeditions visited the ruins of tonina during the 19th century , the first being an expedition led by guillaume dupaix in 1808 . john henry stephens and william catherwood arrived in 1840 , and stephens wrote an extensive description of the site . eduard seler and caecilie seler @ - @ sachs studied the ruins at tonina , publishing their reports at the beginning of the 20th century . karl schmidt excavated the site in 1895 and 1896 . frans blom and jean la farge excavated the site in 1924 for tulane university , publishing their reports in 1926 â€” 1927 . the french tonina institute began excavations in 1972 which continued until 1975 , and again from 1979 to 1980 , under the direction of jean becquelin and claude baudez . the national institute of anthropology and history of colombia ( inah , the instituto nacional de antropologia e historia ) began their own excavations at tonina the same year . the site is open for tours and has a small museum that was opened on 1 january 2000 . = = modern history = = the temple was built on a site covering 60 hectares ( 650 @ , @ 000 sq ft ) . the earliest evidence is found at the temple , which occupies the south @ - @ facing terrace on the west side of the site , rising 71 metres ( 233 ft ) above the plaza below . it has a more square plan than most other maya sites , with the north @ - @ facing terrace above the terraces . much of the modern history of the site concerns the brutal manner in which the maya dealt with their enemies . a 16 by 4 metres ( 52 by 13 ft ) high relief dating from the second to fourth terrace depicts a giant jaguar mask with the severed head of the king of palenque in one corner . a relief on the fifth terrace also depicts tonina ' s most famous warrior , fragments of statues of this figure were found in the plaza below . this is##ieze was carved from the local limestone . its style resembles that of palenque , suggesting that local artisans carried out the carving . after the destruction of the palace at the end of the classic period , many of the sculptures fell from the stone walls of the surrounding buildings . = = = = = = = ballcourt 1 ( the first ballcourt ) was built in 699 by k ' inich k ' aaknal chaak to commemorate his victory over k ' inich kan balam i of palenque . two of the tombs of the female prisoners of the palenque empire were identified as ballcourt ##s . one of these prisoners was identified as yax ahk ( the great ) , who was the ruler of annay i ' , a lake that once lay on the west bank of the usumacinta between piedras negras and yaxchilan . ballcourt 2 is the larger of the two ballcourts and located in the center of the plaza , at the foot of the pyramid . the palace of the gods is accessed via the four @ - @ dimensional steps on the east side of the third terrace of the plaza . the palace of heaven is located on the fourth terrace of the plaza . the east side of the palace is decorated with four large stone columns . on the west side of the palace a stairway leads to a large hall of stone and stucco . one of the walls of the hall has elaborate mural decoration of wild animals and animal heads . = = = monuments and structures = = = the monuments of tonina tend to be smaller than those at other maya sites , with most of the monuments being less than 2 metres ( . @ . @ + ft ) tall . the most notable difference from those at other maya sites is that they are carved on the spine of stone , but with no text written on the sides . on the fifth terrace , the @ - @ the @ - @ monumental monument of tonina ' s is surrounded by @ - @ dimensional representations of maya rulers . the monumental monuments of tonina span the period from ad 495 to 909 , including most of the classic period . monument 1 is broken into six sections , all of which were recovered from the sites in ocosingo and tonina over the course of the 20th century and all of which were deposited in the tonina archaeological park . apart from being damaged , the monument is nearly intact and only slightly damaged , and contains a portion of aalong with one recording the death of k ' inich baaknal chaak and the accession to the throne of aj ch ' aaj naah . monument 6 was carved from a quarry in ocosingo and relocated to the area north of tonina . it is a well preserved 1 @ - @ preserved stone , with the face missing . monument 7 was carved from the limestone and has suffered only minor damage . there is monument 4 ##e with 1 @ - @ preserved inscriptions on the four front faces and was erected by k ' inich ich ' aak chapat in 728 . it is now in the museo nacional de tuxtla gutierrez . monument 11 dates to the reign of ruler 1 . it marks the very beginning of 682 and records the execution of three female nobles . monument 12 is a sculpture carved from the limestone , depicting ruler 2 . it dates to ad 672 . monument 14 is a carved image of k ' awiil mo ' , a ruler from palenque , as an armed warrior , naked and lying on his back with his feet raised in such a way as to be stepped upon again and again . monument 37 is an elaborate relief that depicts a female warrior , which is rare in maya art . monument 101 is the only long term inscription from a single ruler , and marks the k ' atun period of ad 909 . monument 106 is the most securely dated monument at the site , dating to ad 593 . it depicts ruler 1 . monument 113 shows ruler 2 engaged in a religious ceremony . monument 114 was erected in 794 by ruler 8 . it records the death of an important ruler , probably a son or ally of ruler 8 ' s predecessor tuun chapat . monument 122 is a large stone relief recording the conquest of palenque by ruler 8 in 711 and the accession of kan ##al chitam ' , who is depicted as a political prisoner . monument 141 is a very well preserved relief text carved from smooth , white limestone with almost the entire surface painted . it marks the completion of a ballcourt by k ' inich ich ' aaknal chaak . monument 154 dates to the reign of k ' inich hix chapat and marks his execution of three subordinate lords in 633 . monument 158 has a very early date , to ad 904 , at the very end of the classic period . it was erected during the reign of ruler 1 . the execution of the subordinate lords ( the same as thescene of the gods ( or scene of the four gods ) was discovered by archaeologists during excavations in 1992 . it is a large sculpture located at the southern end of the temple complex . it depicts a complex battle scene divided into sections by a well @ -
