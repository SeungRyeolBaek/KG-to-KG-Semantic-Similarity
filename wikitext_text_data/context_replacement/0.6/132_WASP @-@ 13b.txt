= = @ - @ 13b = wasp @ - @ 13b is an extrasolar planet that was discovered in 2008 orbiting the core of the sunlike star wasp @ - @ 13 . the planet has a mass of about twice that of jupiter , and a radius of @ - @ times the radius of jupiter . this low apparent magnitude may be caused by a planet that is of low mass or that is not solid at all . the planet orbits at about 1 % of the distance between the sun and jupiter every 10 days . the planet was observed several times between 2006 and 2009 , at first through the superwasp program and later through the re @ - @ up program . analysis of the radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of wasp @ - @ 13b , which was reported in astronomy news on april 7 , 2009 . a re @ - @ up study published in 2011 examined the potential for orbiting planets such as wasp @ - @ 13b , and re @ - @ examined ( and re @ - @ examined ) its mass , radius , composition , and composition . = = = = = between january 1 , 2006 , and april 7 , 2007 , 3329 observations of the star wasp @ - @ 13 using the superwasp @ - @ up telescope located at roque de los muchachos observatory in the canary islands led to the identification of wasp @ - @ 13 as belonging to a new planetary planet . further re @ - @ up observations were made on february 15 , 2008 using the james webb telescope ( jgt ) in california , which took 1047 images of the star , although the first two images taken were obscured by cloud cover and were lost . using hd 80408 as the host star and with jgt observations , the astronomers studying the planet were able to build a light curve for the new planet . wasp @ - @ 13 was observed between february 10 and 15 , 2008 using the sophie echelle telescope at the haute @ - @ nice observatory in france , measuring the radial velocity of the orbiting body . observations of the fies echelle telescope at the spanish astronomical observatory in the canary islands provided additional astronomical data that determined the age of the planet . analysis of the sophie and fies data was able to provide estimates of the orbiting body ' s composition . the analysis of the orbiting body ' s mass and radial velocity measurements led to its identification as the planet wasp @ - @ 13b . the discovery of wasp @ - @ 13b was reported by the spanish astronomyand published by the european southern observatory on june 5 , 2009 . the resulting paper was published in the journal on june 22 , 2009 . subsequently , between 2009 and 2011 , a team of astronomers studied wasp @ - @ 13b and wasp @ - @ 21b to determine what caused these hot stars to have such high masses . the hires infrared telescope on the hires spacecraft was used to observe the planets . two r ##s and two full orbits were observed during this time , although the detection of the second transit was somewhat delayed because of the cloud cover . the hires observations , along with the jgt observations that were used to study the planet , were able to rule out artifacts such as background noise . the data was then used to re @ - @ define wasp @ - @ 13b ' s parameters , including its age , mass , radius , and density . the team also noted that a limb darkening effect was observed , a finding that may affect future orbital conditions of the planet . = = dwarf planet = = wasp @ - @ 13 is a sunlike r @ - @ type planet located in the leo system . observations made by fies and sophie did not fit the mass , radius , and density parameters ; however , a july 2011 study using the infrared telescope re @ - @ fit those parameters . the planet ' s mass was estimated at 1 @ . @ 09 times the mass of the sun , its radius at 1 @ . @ 559 times that of the sun , and its mass at 1 @ . @ 288 ##8 ' times the sun ' s radius . these parameters were re @ - @ , taking limb darkening into account . the planet ' s metallicity , which was determined by its abundance , was estimated roughly at [ fe / h ] = 3 , similar to that of the sun . additionally , the planet ' s estimated surface temperature is 5826 k , slightly cooler than the sun . wasp @ - @ 13 has an apparent magnitude of 0 @ . @ 13 , making it visible to the naked eye when seen from earth . = = jupiter = = wasp @ - @ 13b is a dwarf planet with an estimated mass that is ( including limb darkening ) 1 @ . @ 477 times that of jupiter and a radius that is 1 @ . @ 389 times jupiter ' s radius . the planet is , in other words , less than half the mass of jupiter , which is more than two times its radius . wasp @ - @ 13b ' s estimated mass ismost likely , due to the presence of a 4 @ - @ mass ratio , compared to the expected absence of a core , according to the same paper . wasp @ - @ 13b , which orbits its parent star at a distance of 0 @ . @ 05362 au , orbits its star once at 0 @ . @ 35298 au . the 2011 study of the planet ranked wasp @ - @ 13b as the fourth highest @ - @ mass extrasolar planet discovered , after wasp @ - @ 7b ; wasp @ - @ 17b ; tres @ - @ 4b ; and wasp @ - @ 5b . wasp @ - @ 13b has an orbital inclination of 0 . 9ยบ , which indicates that it has an 0 @ - @ at that distance from earth .
