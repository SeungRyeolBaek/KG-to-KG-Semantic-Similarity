= sarnia = sarnia is a city in southwestern ontario , canada , and has a 2011 population of canada @ , @ 366 . it is the largest city on lake huron and in lambton county . sarnia is located on the west side of the junction of the upper and lower great lakes where lake huron flows into the st . clair river , which forms the canada @ - @ united states border , directly across from lake huron , canada . the city ' s natural harbour ##s attracted the french explorer la salle , who called the area " the harbour " when he had ships and boats take his 44 tonnes ( 49 short tons ; 42 long tons ) ship " le havre " up the big canada @ - @ tidal channel of the st . clair river on 1 august 1679 . this was the first time anything larger than a canoe or an canada @ - @ type vessel had sailed into lake huron , and la salle ' s voyage was virtually unique in the history of commercial shipping on the great lakes . located in the natural harbour , the sarnia harbour is an important port for lake huron and for ships carrying tons of minerals and petroleum products . the natural harbour and the natural springs that exist in the surrounding mountains , along with the oil discovered at nearby oil springs in 1858 contributed to the rapid development of the oil industry in this area . because oil springs was the first place in canada and north america to drill wells for oil , the knowledge that was gained there led to oil drillers from sarnia around the world teaching local people how to drill for oil . the area of oil and gas plants is called oil springs and is part of downtown sarnia . the city has the highest level of urban air pollution of any canadian city because of its dependence on the oil industry . about 90 % of the organic matter , however , comes from the continental united states . lake huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter ; therefore , this creates sarnia ' s unique continental climate , which makes extreme extremes of heat and cold very rare . in the winter , sarnia experiences the @ - @ effect , because the wind blows off the frozen waters of lake huron and tends to form large clouds all over canada . culturally , sarnia is a significant part of the canadian culture of southwestern ontario . the city ' s youth symphony orchestra is based in the region and has won the best international orchestra award given by the canadian music centre in 2011 . the canadian musicthe use of the globe was for the 2010 filming of driving miss daisy . the largest event that occurs in sarnia is sarnia bayfest , which is a summer music festival that takes place during the summer . in 2013 , they cancelled the event because of financial problems but looked forward in 2015 to merging with the canadian international regatta and creating a new event . = = = = = the name " sarnia " is named for newfoundland , which is a former british island . in 1829 , john colborne , a lieutenant governor of newfoundland , was appointed lieutenant governor of upper canada . in this role , he visited two argentine settlements in 1835 that had been laying waste on the shores of lake superior . one of these , called " the settlement , " consisted only of two houses , 24 stone houses , two log houses , two stone houses , two schools and two churches . the settlers wanted to change the name but were unable to agree on an alternative . the argentine ##s suggested the spanish " buenos aires " and the portuguese " new orleans " . governor john colborne chose new sarnia . on 1 may 1836 , the name was unanimously adopted by a vote of 10 to 1 , and colborne also named the settlement point moore after british naval commander sir john moore . sarnia received the nickname " the white city " on 1 may 1914 because of the visit of canada ' s governor general , h . r . h . the duke of connaught , and his wife , patricia . = = = = = first nations people have lived , worked , and hunted on the lake for at least 1 @ , @ 000 years , as evidenced by archaeological finds on the lake . these people were descended from an alliance of huron , odawa , and potowatami clans , which formed the three fires confederacy , also called the confederation of three fires , in a . d . 796 . these clans worked together with strong ties in both language and culture , creating a strong @ - @ + society where rights and responsibilities were all shared among its members . during the 1600s and 1700s , the three fires confederacy controlled much of the area known as the bay of the great lakes , which was the international border where sarnia is now located . during this time , they had treaties with many of the first nations , including huron , french , and iroquois , as well as the kings of great britain and france . in 1679 , their trading partners , the iroquois , raided la salle and the french in 1679 when they married into the french . thethe national government placed a plaque on the blue water bridge in commemoration of the event , as shown in the photo of the ship . because of this history of the influx of immigrants into the region , the people of the confederacy helped spur the development of north america in the 18th century , as a center of trade and commerce . great britain saw this growth of the population of the region as a source of allies against the french and the iroqouis . the people of the three fires confederacy , however , fought with the british during the seven years ' war and eventually made peace with great britain in the treaty of fort niagara in 1764 . they also fought on the side of the british during the war of 1812 . the three fires confederacy had signed several treaties with the united states prior to 1815 , and finally signed the treaty of springwells in september of that year and ended all hostilities directed against the united states . the grand alliance lasted only until the mid to late 19th century , when more permanent military structures began to emerge . after the war of 1812 , the first settlers in the area were french soldiers loyal to the british crown who came primarily from quebec . they successfully competed with the three fires confederacy , which led to the development of the port . after its establishment , modern sarnia developed throughout the 19th century ; on 1 december 1856 , the residents passed the act to incorporate the city of sarnia and the name of sarnia was officially changed to sarnia on 1 january 1857 . the city established 10 @ , @ 000 lots in six wards . the discovery of large amounts of timber , the discovery of oil at the oil springs in 1858 by # # ##son , and the construction of the canadian northern railway in 1858 and the grand trunk railway in 1859 , fueled sarnia ' s growth . the two railways were finally connected directly to the united states with the construction of the st . clair tunnel under the st . clair river in sarnia in 1890 , creating the grand trunk railway , which was the first railway tunnel ever built under the river . the tunnel was an engineering marvel of its day , built through the use of local materials for construction in a open water environment . it had been formed in 1913 from two railway companies that used the banks of the st . clair river . one of these companies was the railway company of sarnia , which was incorporated in 1870 . by 1 january 1914 , when the residents passed legislation to incorporate the city of sarnia , the city had grown to 20 @ , @ 985 in six wards . sarnia officially becamecanada census taken of 1 july 1914 . sarnia ' s grain elevator , which is the second oldest still operating in canada , was built during the construction of sarnia harbour in 1927 . one hundred years earlier , grain elevators had been an important part of sarnia ' s economy . the grain elevator sits in the harbour , and next to it is the terminal for the large bulk carriers and container ships that are part of the shipping channel that brings goods from all over the world . the channel between toronto and sarnia is one of the world ' s busiest , as evidenced by the shipment of 78 @ , @ 943 @ , @ 900 t ( 78 @ , @ 020 @ , @ 800 short tons ; 78 @ , @ 697 @ , @ 950 short tons ) of grain that has crossed the river ontario in all directions during the years 1993 â€“ 2002 . large inland and coastal vessels , which are known as " salties , " travel up and down the river at the rate of about once every 30 minutes during the shipping season . during this same period , the arthur j . tellier bridge , which was named after the former president of cn in 2004 , was built and began operation in 1995 . it carries 8 @ - @ # # ##cars and is located next to the old bridge , which has been demolished . although there has been no heavy industry in the sarnia area since 1858 , the establishment of dow chemical in 1942 to manufacture synthetic rubber during world war ii was a great success and spurred sarnia ' s development as a major industrial centre . because of sarnia ' s role in this industry , it was on the united states government list of potential nuclear sites as part of the nike @ - @ - nuclear weapons program during the cold war . on 1 january 1991 , sarnia and the nearby city of clearwater were amalgamated into the new city of sarnia @ - @ clearwater . the city was originally intended to become the village of prince albert , although that village ' s residents objected and were not allowed to remain part of the city . on 1 january 1992 , the village reverted to the name sarnia . sarnia ' s population experienced a steady decline from 1961 to 1991 , with a 1991 population of 4 @ , @ 376 . by 2001 the population had declined to around 4 @ , @ 000 . since 2001 sarnia ' s population has been declining steadily , with a 2011 population figure of 4 @ , @ 366 . despite these population declines , the official 2010 census " sarnia @ - @ lamb##ton ' s " website " states : " the nuclear plants are the city ' s main economic activity . in the recent past , many plants have closed , and of those still in operation , increased automation and automation has led to far fewer jobs .
