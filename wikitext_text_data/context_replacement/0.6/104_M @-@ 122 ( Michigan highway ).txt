" both the lack of a crew cabin that greatly reduced the weight at low speeds and the lack of hydraulic systems for the wing and tail leading edge and the wing roots were cited as major problems . at high speeds it was nearly impossible to lower and remove the manually operated vub @ - @ 23 and ns @ - @ 23 gun turrets . the performance of the tu @ - @ 23vibrations when flying rendered the radio in the pilot ' s seat useless and shattered the cockpit windows . turning off the electronic friend or foe ( iff ) system also damaged the electrical system and the radio . new radios had to be installed as the aircraft did not have sufficient electrical power . the tests conducted by the nii vvs included comparisons between the tu @ - @ 12 and the soviet mig @ - @ 23 and ns @ - @ 23 jet fighters which were very important in determining the offensive capability of the fighter , the defensive armament of the fighter and the offensive armament needed for these types of operations . the tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the soviet 12 @ . @ 12 mm ( 6 @ . @ 5 in ) gun and concluded that no soviet fighter aircraft would have a defensive armament like the @ - @ 23 guns that fired at 37 mm or less . the six aircraft used by the soviets were designated the klimov rd @ - @ 12 ##l , the new military version of the nene i , and the production aircraft , used by the vvs for pilot training and testing . the aircraft themselves were not subjected to test flights . one aircraft was used for pilot testing and another , redesignated as the tu @ - @ 12ll , received the new jet engine on a mounting in the nose . = = = = = soviet union soviet air force = = = ( tu @ - @ 12 ) = = data from gunston , tupolev aircraft since 1922 general characteristics crew : one length : 18 @ . @ 43 m ( 141 ft 11 ½ in ) wingspan : 87 @ . @ 86 m ( 282 ft 11 ½ in ) wing area : 12 @ . @ 30 m ( 525 @ . @ 98 ft2 ) empty weight : 8993 kg ( 15 @ , @ 826 lb ) gross weight : 12 @ , @ 720 kg ( 5 @ , @ 657 lb ) powerplant : 2 × 12 @ - @ royce nene i engine , 20 kn ( 6 @ , @ 000 lbf ) for each cylinder cylinder maximum speed : 783 km / h ( 487 mph ) range : 10 @ , @ 600 km ( 12 @ , @ 367 miles ) service ceiling : 15 @ , @ 370 km ( 15 @ , @ 305 miles ) armament 2 × 37 mm 12 @ - @ 23 mm 2 × 12 @ . @ 7 mm berezin ubt @ @ - @ # ##ton @ , @ 000 kg ( 5 @ , @ 1##4 . ) of .
