= = = [UNK] = ceratopia ( / [UNK] / or / [UNK] / ; literally : " armored lizard " ) is a group of large , armored dinosaurs that lived in what is now north america , europe , and asia , during the cretaceous period , although some members lived earlier , during the jurassic . the oldest known species , yinlong downsi , lived between 161 @ . @ 7 and 130 @ . @ 2 million years ago . the oldest known species , like prorsus , became extinct during the late – paleogene extinction event , 66 million years ago . early members of the latter group , such as ##osaurus , were small terrestrial dinosaurs . later members , including ceratopsids like centrosaurus and ##osaurus , were very large , and had large neck vertebrae and fangs all from the eyes . while these horns may have served to protect the entire animal from injury , they might also have been used for camouflage , thermoregulation , the development of the jaw and shoulder teeth or a combination of the two . they ranged in size from 1 meter ( 3 ft ) and 23 kg ( 50 lb ) to over 9 meters ( 30 ft ) and 12 @ , @ 450 kilograms ( 11 @ , @ 000 lb ) . it is by far the largest @ - @ - dinosaur to the general public . it is common for dinosaur species names to end in " - ceratops " , although this is not always the case . one of the earliest known species was ceratops itself , which gave its name to the genus , although it is considered a nomen dubium today . the fossil remains show many distinctive features that are not commonly found in other genera . = = = = = species are easily distinguished by features of the teeth . on the underside of the human lower jaw is the rostral bone , an unusual ( triangular ) bone , unique to them . othniel charles marsh described and named this bone , which appears as a mirror image of the predentary bone in the lower jaw . this bone appears to greatly resemble the growth of plant roots . as with the predentary bone , which forms the base of the lower jaw in modern species , the rostraland have distinctive sharp @ - @ like shape . however , the jugal bones behind the eyes are relatively large and stick out slightly , making the skull look almost triangular when viewed from above . this triangular shape is reinforced in all specimens by the gradual extension of the nasal and squamosal bones of the skull roof , to form the upper jaw . the epoccipital is the bony bone found on the neck of dinosaurs . the term is a synonym , as they are usually identical with the nasal bones . epoccipitals appear as small bones that fuse during the animal ' s life to form the squamosal or the bones that make up the roof of the skull . these traits are structural instead of functional , and may have helped distinguish them . epoccipitals probably were present in all known ceratopsids with the possible exception of zuniceratops . they appear to have been quite divided into short @ - @ shaped ceratopsids ( centrosaurines ) and long @ - @ shaped ceratopsids ( chasmosaurines ) , being round with compressed bases in the former group , and circular with compressed bases in the latter group . under these two groups , different bones would have had different shapes and sizes . in centrosaurines however , like centrosaurus , pachyrhinosaurus , and others , these bones are long and bird - or parrot @ - @ shaped . a short @ - @ shaped example is the genus ##r series of the ##ened epoccipitals on the sides of skulls . when considering the animal ' s morphogenetic origin , they can be described as such . the term epoccipital was coined by american naturalist othniel charles marsh in 1889 . = = field of dinosaurs = = the first dinosaur teeth known to science were discovered during the u . s . geological and biological survey of the area surveyed by the american geologist e . h . hayden . teeth discovered during an 1855 expedition to wyoming were initially assigned to hadrosaurids and placed in the genus ##osaurus . it was not until the early 20th century that any of these were recognized as dinosaur teeth . during one of hayden ' s expeditions in 1872 , william and smith discovered several isolated teeth protruding from a cliff in western montana . the american pale##ontologist arthur charles cope , who organized a team to examine the complete skeleton . he recognized the specimen as a dinosaur , but noted that even though the fossil was a dinosaur , it was different from any kind of dinosaur then known . cope named the new species agathaumas sylvestris , meaning " the ##ly @ - @ horned " . soon after , cope named two other genera that would later come to be known as ceratopsids : polyonax and monoclonius . monoclonius is notable for the number of horned teeth recovered , providing the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and skulls . the monoclonius remains were discovered by cope , assisted by geologist hazelius sternberg , in the summer of 1876 near the missouri river in chouteau county , montana . since the dinosaurs had not been classified previously as a distinct group , he was skeptical about much of the skull material , not just the nasal horn itself , nor the brow horn , as part of the single group . the horn itself was identified as being part of the horn . in 1888 and 1889 , othniel charles marsh described the first fully - horned dinosaurs , ceratops and rex . in 1890 marsh grouped them both as the family cerambycidae and the family tortricidae . this led cope to examine his own classification and to conclude that he , monoclonius , and agathaumas actually constituted a distinct family of horned dinosaurs , which he named agathaumidae in 1891 . he redescribed monoclonius as a horned dinosaur , with a large nasal horn and two brow ones behind the eyes , and a horned skull . = = = = = classification was defined by othniel charles marsh in 1890 to describe dinosaurs with several distinctive features , including horns , a rostral horn , horns with prominent crowns , two neck vertebrae , and a forest @ - @ - skull . marsh considered the group distinct enough to constitute his own classification for it . the name is derived from the greek κερας / kara meaning ' horn ' and οψις / opsis meaning ' ear ' . as late as the 1990s , it was suggested that the name dinosaur was technically incorrect , and that it should replace ceratopia . however , this name , while technically correct , has been used only in " the scientific literature, and the vast majority of authors continue to change ranks . as the iczn does not recognize taxa at the level of genus , this is subject to happen . = = = = = = = white taxonomy , it has traditionally been treated as a clade of the same dinosaur . although this system has largely fallen out of favor among most scientists , some authors have continued to use such a system , although they have disagreed on what the status should be . those who still favor the system of taxonomy have retained the traditional rank of superfamily , while some have advanced to the rank of infraorder . this listing of dinosaur genera , rank and rank underwent further study by john e . holtz , jr . in 2010 . genus albalophosaurus -

@ in phylogenetic analyses , it is generally accepted to include all animals more closely related to dinosaurs than to it . under this definition , the most well known forms are yinlong , from the late jurassic period , along with chaoyangsaurus and the family psittacosauridae , from the early cretaceous period , all of which were discovered in either china and mongolia . the rostral bones and the jugals are still present in some of these animals , meaning that much more forms need to be discovered . the clade neoceratopsia includes all animals more derived than psittacosaurids . another group of neoceratopsians is the coronosauria , which also includes all animals more derived than auroraceratops . coronosaurs share the increased development of the neck vertebrae and the loss of the first two neck vertebrae to form the relatively short skull . within coronosauria , several groups are currently recognized , although the taxonomy of these groups varies greatly from study to study and some groups do not belong to any of them . one group may be called protoceratopsidae and includes asia and its closest relatives , mostly ##osaurus . another group , leptoceratopsidae , includes all north american animals that are more closely related to leptoceratops . the ceratopsoidea includes animals like zuniceratops , which are more closely related to the family ##aurus . thistoday it contains this and all the other north american genera and is further divided into the subfamily centrosaurinae and ceratopsinae ( also known as chasmosaurinae ) . = = = = farke family = = = = = farke and his colleagues in 2014 published a description of a new neoceratopsian , aquilops americanus , in the online @ - @ popular scientific journal nature one . they compared their analysis as well as many other named taxa to produce a consensus analysis . they developed their own phylogenetic , and in it found that all groups of taxa could be included , and that aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could not be a protoceratopsid , leptoceratopsid , or ceratopsid , although any one of these groups would form a close sister relationship with aquilops . their analysis also produced an updated length , for ajkaceratops not only a neoceratopsian but a protoceratopsid . nothing else in the clade exists . = = = = xu / makovicky / chinnery = = = = = xu xing of the chinese institute of geological zoology and geology ( ivpp ) in 2005 , along with michael makovicky , formerly of the american museum of natural history ( amnh ) in new york , and others , published a cladistic analysis of the 2002 analysis of liaoceratops . this analysis was very similar to that published by makovicky in 2001 . makovicky , who now works at the field museum of natural history in chicago , also published this analysis in his 2002 doctoral thesis . xu and his colleagues added yinlong to this analysis in 2006 . brenda chinnery , formerly of the museum of the rockies in helena , montana , first described prenoceratops in 2005 and published a similar analysis . in 2006 , makovicky and john norell of the amnh incorporated chinnery ' s analysis into their analysis and also included yamaceratops , although they were not able to include yinlong . the analysis presented below is a summary of xu , makovicky , and their colleagues ' more recent analyses . chaoyangsaurus was placed in a more basal position than psittacosauridae , although chinnery ' s original analysis placed it in neoceratopsia . proto##ceratopsidae is considered to be the sister group of ceratopsoidea . the genus asiaceratops is included in these studies and was considered to occupy a transitional appearance , either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid , most likely due to the lack of available material . inclusion of asiaceratops from the sister group . makovicky ' s phylogenetic analysis includes ivpp v12722 ( " xuanhuasaurus " ) , a late triassic dinosaur from china that , at the time , was under description , but has since been named as xuanhuaceratops . kulceratops and turanoceratops are considered nomina dubia in this analysis . makovicky considers lamaceratops , magnirostris , and platyceratops to be junior members of bagaceratops , and bainoceratops to be synonymous with them . = = = = you / dodson = = = = = you hailu of beijing ' s chinese academy of natural sciences , was a co @ - @ member with xu and makovicky in 2002 and , in 2003 , you and john dodson from the university of cambridge presented a new analysis . the authors published this study again in 2004 . in 2005 , you and several others , including dodson , worked the auroraceratops and included this new taxon into their analysis . in contrast to the previous analysis , you and dodson found chaoyangsaurus to be the most basal neoceratopsian , more basal than it , while leptoceratopsidae , or protoceratopsidae , is regarded as the sister group of it . this analysis includes auroraceratops , but only the species appear in xu and makovicky ' s analysis , so it is unclear how related the two taxa are . asiaceratops and turanoceratops are also considered nomina dubia and not valid . together with xu zhiming , you named magnirostris in 2003 , but to date has not included it in any of his studies . = = = = = = = = = = = = it appears to have originated in china , as some of the earliest fossils are found there . dinosaur remains , including teeth , which appear to be neoceratopsian , were found in north america from the albian age ( 112 to 110 ma years ago ) , indicatingthat the group had spread to what is now the torres strait by the end of the cretaceous period . nearly all leptoceratopsids crossed north american , apart from udanoceratops , which may represent a late migration event , crossing into asia . ceratopsids and their asian relatives , such as zuniceratops , are found outside of continental north america , and are probably endemic to that continent . the traditional view that ceratopsoids originated in north america was called into question by the 2009 discovery of new fossils of the east dinosaur genus turanoceratops , which identified it as a ceratopsid . it is unknown whether this particular ceratopsids actually originated in asia , or if the turanoceratops originated from north america . = = = body size = = = like almost all other dinosaur groups , bones are the most commonly preserved parts of dinosaur skeletons and many species are known only from fossils . there is a great deal of variation between and even within different species . different growth stages from juvenile to adult are known for ##aurus and others , allowing the study of individual differences among these animals . some sexual variation has been found in some and all ceratopsids . = = = ecological variation = = = ##aurus and bison are the most common species in the late cretaceous formations where they are found . their fossils are far and away the most common dinosaur fossils found in the late cretaceous deposits of the western united states , making up as much as 5 / 6ths of the total dinosaur record in some localities . these findings suggest that the dinosaurs were the dominant species in their environment . many species of dinosaurs , including centrosaurus and its relatives , appear to have been nomadic , living in herds . this is supported by bonebed ##s with the bones of many animals of various sizes . like many cattle species , they would have had a significant impact on their diet , as well as serving as a major food source for them . although they are generally considered primitive , a few researchers , such as darren naish and david witton , have speculated , that at least some species may have been opportunistically nomadic . = = = posture and size = = = the fossils of dinosaurs show them with short , and with @ -
