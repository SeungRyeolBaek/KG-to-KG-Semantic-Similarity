= mycena galericulata = mycena galericulata is a mushroom most commonly known as the fairy cap , the rosy mycena , or the fairy @ - @ or rosy ##cap . the type species of the genus mycena was first described formally in 1772 , but was not considered a mycena until 1821 . it is very variable in color , size , and shape , which makes it very difficult to easily identify in the field . the mushrooms have caps with prominent longitudinal grooves , especially along the base . the cap ' s color ranges from light @ - @ shaped to reddish brown and the shape varies from rounded @ - @ shaped to slightly pointed to cylindrical with an axis . the stem is hollow , white , long and slender , without a stem and it cut deep into the wood on which it grows . the gills are white to pink or pale pink when mature and are marked by prominent rosy @ - @ lines . the caps can reach 2 cm ( 1 @ . @ . in ) in diameter , and have a distinctive odor and taste . the egg print is white and the gills are pink at maturity , which can lead to some confusion with others of the same genus . m . galericulata mushrooms grow mostly in groups on the stem @ - @ in wood of deciduous and evergreen trees from spring to autumn . the species can also be considered edible . it is common and widespread throughout the northern temperate zone of the northern hemisphere , but it has also been reported from europe . = = distribution , distribution , and distribution = = the species was first described formally as helix galericulatus by italian botanist giovanni antonio scopoli in 1772 , and later under this name by elias magnus fries in his 1821 systema mycologicum . that same year , john frederick gray transferred the species to the genus mycena . names for the species include helix conicus named by william smith in 1778 , helix crispus named by johann johann georg karl batsch in 1893 , stereopodium galericulatum by charles henry earle in 1909 , and prunulus galericulatus by william alphonso murrill in 1916 . mycena galericulata is the type species of the genus mycena . it was placed in the mycena of mycena , the infrageneric arrangement of rudolph arnold maas geesteranus . in the revised ( 1947 ) system of classificationa . gray , who placed it in the genus eumycena , section typicae — " a rather variable species of yellow , brown , buff , yellow @ - @ brown , or cinnamon @ - @ brown , mushrooms with small habit and of small to medium size . " the specific epithet galericulata is derived from the latin galer , and means " with a straw cap " . linnaeus called it the " helmetted @ @ - @ mushroom " . it is also known as the " fairy mushroom " , the " rosy mycena " , and the " high @ - @ - - stool " . = = = = = the cap of e . galericulata is initially spherical when young , and later becomes either buff @ - @ brown , with a rounded cap that may reach heights of 0 – ##0 cm ( 0 @ . @ 08 – 0 @ . @ 1 in ) . the cap margin is initially slightly curved upward , but later spreads out , gradually becomes convex , and eventually expands off with half . the surface has deep grooves that extend nearly to the margin , and is rough , not rough . the flesh is light yellow @ - @ brown on the underside , and fades rapidly to a - yellow to pale yellow @ - @ brown . the flesh is thick in the center of the cap and expands nearly to the margin , and is light white , with a wood @ - @ like texture . the odor and taste is mild to moderately sweet ( similar to the taste of fresh cut wood ) , to ##que @ - @ brown . the gills are narrowly attached ( adnexed ) to widely attached or absent . the gill diameter varies from widely to very widely spaced , with about – [UNK] gills on the stem ; there are also three or four pairs of lamellulae ( small gills that do not extend far from the cap margin to the stem ) . the gills are somewhat intervenose ( with many @ - @ rings ) , moderately thick ( 0 – / in ) , white to yellowish brown , sometimes tinged with pale yellow , with wavy edges . the stem is 2 – ##4 cm ( 0 @ . @ 08 – ##0 @ . @ 1 in ) long , and – ##0 cm ( 2 @ . @ 08 – ##0 @ . @ 1 in ) thick , equal in width throughout , and with a silky texture . it is smooth , slightly hollow , and smooth or covered with slight grooves##s , and with a small pseudorrhiza ( a short extension of the stem ) at the base . the cap surface is pale blue @ - @ white on the upper surface , and pale blue @ - @ white below ; the cap is a darker white in age , but does not show brown brown . mycena galericulata has a white egg print . the spores are small , measuring – cm . 4 @ . @ , – ##4 μm , and white — which means they may turn blue @ - @ white to brown when treated with melzer ' s stain . the spores ( the @ - @ - cells ) are two sterigmata , and measure about – cm by 8 – ##0 μm . they may be either three @ - @ spored or four @ - @ spored . there are four small @ - @ cylindrical to cylindrical cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) , that measure about – cm by 7 – ##0 μm ; their bases and the slightly upper gills have small branches that become increasingly large and flattened in age . there are no pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) . the cap margin has a very thin margin , on which is a white hypoderm , while the rest of the surface has loosely arranged mats of hairs , and is a darker @ - @ brown with age . vascular connections are present between the surface of the four @ - @ spored cells . = = = = = = = opinions on the taste of the species vary . one source considers them to have a " mild taste and odor " , and notes that they taste edible when " soaked up in their own juice and then mixed with salt , pepper and pepper . " others describe the species as poisonous , and suggest that they have a " slightly bitter " odor , and with a taste ranging from bitter to sweet . another is " excellent , and highly variable . " at any rate , the species falls into the broad category of edible mycenas that are considered unfit for consumers due to their small size and poor appearance . = = = = = = = = the larger cap ( m . tintinnabulum ) is a western hemisphere species that is slightly larger ( cap diameter up to 1 @ . @ 1 cm ( 1 @ . @ ) . ) across ) andhas a brown cap , and has white gills at the margin . it typically grows from late spring to early winter on the stems of deciduous trees , especially oaks . it has finger @ - @ brown spores that are smaller than m . galericulata , measuring 2 @ . @ . – 2 @ . @ . . 2 @ . @ . – . @ . @ 5 µm . m . maculata has red spots on the cap as it ages ; its spores measure around – ##mm x 0 – @ μm . a similar species is m . inclinata , which can be distinguished by gills with red stains , which can turn bright red with age . it also has long , yellowish , brown gills on the gills . m . parabolica is smaller , and more slender . another mycena that grows in soil on rotting wood is m . americana , but this species has a finger @ - @ shaped cap with a white margin , and a stem that turns finger @ - @ like color when bruised . m . excisa closely resembles m . galericulata , but can be distinguished only by the presence of its smooth and hairy cystidia ( with reddish @ - @ brown projections ) . = = species , distribution and distribution = = mycena galericulata is terrestrial , and grows on rotting hardwood and on logs , logs , rocks , and stones . it may also grow from dead roots , which may give it a skeletal appearance . it usually grows in small groups , sometimes colonies . the fungus fruits from late autumn to early summer . a study of pip @ - @ shaped fungi in a redwood forest in california found that m . galericulata produces several hydrolytic enzymes in the moist and eluvial soil , including β @ - @ glucosidase , β @ - @ xylosidase , α @ - @ glucosidase , butyrate esterase and sulphatase . the enzymes form complexes with bacteria and organic compounds in the soil and break down ( depolymerize ) biopolymers such as lead , hemicellulose , and lead , which contribute to the breakdown of oxygen and nitrogen . the presence of organic particles in the soil affects both the growth and the overall hydrolytic enzyme activity of m . galericulata . mycena galericulata is a very common and widely distributed fungus , foundthroughout the northern temperate zone of the northern hemisphere . outside the united states , it occurs in eastern north america and also along the pacific coast . it has also been found in rivers state , japan . although the species has also been reported from australia , these reports are probably based on misidentifications , and " the records of mycena galericulata are now regarded as invalid " . = = = source by = = = , ah .
