= fastra ii = the fastra ii is a desktop computer used for research . it was developed in early 2009 by the astra ( image - tomographic reconstruction architecture ) group of researchers of the ibbt ( international center for computational biology ) visionlab at the university of antwerp and the belgian company les ##co , in collaboration with asus , a german multinational computer hardware manufacturer , as the successor to the fastra i ( released in 2008 ) . the fastra ii was claimed to be about 10 times faster than the fastra i , which in turn was slightly faster than the 512 @ - @ purpose system . however , because of the lack of gpus in the system , the system has suffered from various problems , including the general inability to operate and maintenance due to the lack of space between the video cards . = = = = = the system was built as a research and development project by the astra group of researchers of the les ##lab at the university of antwerp , belgium , one of the founders being joost batenburg . unlike other desktop computers such as the cray ##jet and the ibm pc , which cost thousands of euros , the fastra ii mainly uses flash memory , costing â‚¬ ##50 @ , @ 000 in 2009 . the fastra ii ' s predecessor , the fastra i , has 4 dual @ - @ gpu geforce 9800 gx2 video cards , for a total of 13 gpus . at that time , the astra group used a motherboard that had four pci express x16 slots with one @ - @ space between each of them . the only other motherboard the astra group could use at that time was the msi k9a2 system , which had four such slots . in 2009 , the asus p6t7 ##2 core motherboard , which the fastra ii uses , was released , which has four pci express x16 slots . the fastra ii has 4 identical dual @ - @ gpu geforce gtx 295 video cards , and a single @ - @ gpu geforce gtx 275 , for a total of 13 gpus . in the fastra ii , the gpus cannot perform tomographic reconstruction . the technology which uses gpus to perform multiple @ - @ purpose computation on this type of computation , instead of one , is called gpgpu , or @ - @ purpose , with multiple processing units . this caused by the lack of space between the video cardsallow those in the fastra ii to leave the front boot window open , so that the video cards can breathe fresh air , lowering the air pressure inside the computer . due to the lack of gpus in the computer , the initial testing was difficult . this is because the motherboard has a 32 bit bios , which only provides about 2 gb of address space for the video cards . therefore , asus decided to give them a new bios that completely eliminated the address space requirements of the gtx 295 video card . the bios @ - @ compatible coreboot was also used . the eight pci express x16 slots of the asus p6t7 motherboard were used for the boot of the fastra ii computer . however , the video cards in the fastra ii are small enough to have 2 gb slots each . to address this problem , the company came up with two pci express cards , and also created a special case which allows the video cards to fit on the motherboard . = = features and features = = like the fastra i , the fastra ii has a lian @ ##b @ - @ p80 armorsuit ##e , which has 2 gb slots . the motherboard of the fastra ii was at that time the only available motherboard that had eight b @ - @ compatible pci express x16 slots . the video cards were originally on 2 gb modules , which were later increased to 8 gb modules , for a total of 10 gb . instead of the 8 full @ - @ gpu video cards , the 8 @ - @ gpu gtx 275 was in the case because , out of all the video cards in the fastra ii , the gtx 275 is the only one the fastra ii ' s bios can fully support . the total number of gpus is 8 . the video cards each have 2 gb of processing power . three of the eight gtx 295 video cards have 2 pcbs , while the other four have only 1 pcb . according to the information on the official website , the fastra ii is faster and more energy efficient than its predecessors , including the fastra i and the tesla c1060 memory card . the chips are based on the fastra ii , the fastra i , a 512 @ - @ b ##boot ( instead of opteron cards ) , an nvidia tesla c1060 memory card , an intel core i7 940 cpu , and even an intel core i7 940 cpu itself . thefastra ii is over three times faster than the fastra i at the same clock rate . although the fastra ii uses less power than the fastra i , it ' s over three times as energy efficient as the fastra i , and over three times as energy efficient as the 512 @ - @ computer itself . the main processors operate at 40 degrees cooler when idle , and at 60 degrees cooler at full load . = = graphics and services = = the operating system is centos , microsoft windows based linux distribution and red hat enterprise linux distribution . the fastra ii had a positive critical reception . amazon . com called it the " world ' s most powerful 512 @ - @ based supercomputer " , describing it as a machine with " so much power in such a small machine . " itech . com called it " the most powerful personal computer " . fastra ii runs on nvidia ' s fast compute infrastructure ( sli ) and is not limited to the number of gpus supported by it and limited by the limitations of the pascal and 512 @ - @ based device drivers . the fastra ii ' s motherboard is designed for imaging , and it is currently being used in europe for medical imaging . it remains to be seen whether a fastra ii nvlink , also equipped with 512 @ - @ based gpus , will be available .
