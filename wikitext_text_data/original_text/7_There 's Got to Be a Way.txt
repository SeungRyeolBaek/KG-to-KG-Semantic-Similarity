Clips of Carey leaning against a wall and sitting on some steps looking on at what is happening are shown .

A gospel choir comes out of one of the buildings as the street becomes more crowded with people of all ages and backgrounds rejoicing and getting along with each other . One of the shops in the background has a neon light outside the entrance which says " Jesus Saves " .
