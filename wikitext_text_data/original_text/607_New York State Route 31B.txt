NY 31B began at an intersection with its parent route , NY 31 , in the Cayuga County village of Weedsport . The highway went eastward , intersecting with NY 34 less than 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 2 km ) later . Much of Weedsport was urbanized , with the highway passing residential homes and businesses as it progressed eastward through the village . The highway intersected with CR 12B before leaving Weedsport and entering the town of Brutus as Brutus Road .

In Brutus , NY 31B continued to the east through the rural town , intersecting CR 136A and passing the Weedsport Rural Cemetery before turning to the southeast . After a short distance , the highway went through an isolated area of homes , where it intersected with CR 14 and CR 15A . NY 31B continued on , intersecting several local highways before crossing into Onondaga County and terminating at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Elbridge .

What became NY 31B was originally designated as NY 293 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 293 was renumbered to NY 31B c . 1933 , allowing the NY 293 designation to be transferred to another highway in Orange County . NY 31B remained unchanged until January 2 , 1980 , when the NY 31B designation was removed .

Ownership and maintenance of NY 31B 's former routing was gradually transferred to the counties it went through , namely Cayuga and Onondaga . The first section to be transferred was the portion within Onondaga County , which was given to the county on April 1 , 1980 , and designated as CR 99 . The Cayuga County section of former NY 31B was transferred to the county one year later on April 1 , 1981 , and designated as CR 31B for the state route that preceded it .
