In his review of the album , Allmusic 's Steve Huey wrote " There are some slow and / or unfocused moments [ ... ] but overall , its aggression will probably play well with late- ' 90s metal and punk fans . " Due to the label 's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album , the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive . Gomes is quoted as saying " We had these romantic visions of the music industry , and we thought it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label . So we fulfilled that dream , but it was also probably the worst thing that could have happened . [ ... ] We 've had offers from Sony and others that we can 't take because we owe Jive so much money .

Allmusic 's Jason D. Taylor wrote : " Broke may have not found as much success in the competitive mainstream market as some would have liked , and even despite its distinct departure from the group 's debut , it is an album that shows more vision than other rap @-@ tinged rock albums to come out in 2000 .

" Guitarist Jaxon joined the band in early 2004 . He is the fourth person to fill this position .

Back 2 Base X peaked at No. 12 on the Independent Albums chart , and at No. 154 on the Billboard 200 . Allmusic 's Rob Theakston wrote that " Back 2 Base X suffers from the same problems as Amerika : it tries to be conceptual in thought à la Tool and vicious in its political commentary à la Fugazi or System of a Down , but somehow falls short by sounding like an angry stoner on a soapbox . It won 't win any new fans , but existing fans of ( hed ) pe 's work won 't be turning their backs away from the band in anger anytime soon , either . "
