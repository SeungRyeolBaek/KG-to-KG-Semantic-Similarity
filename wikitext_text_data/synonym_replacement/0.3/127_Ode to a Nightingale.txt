= Ode to group A Nightingale = " Ode to antiophthalmic factor Luscinia megarhynchos " be A poem past Saint John the Apostle John Keats written either IN the garden of the Spaniards Inn , Hampstead , Greater London Beaver State , allot to Keats ' friend Charles Armitage John Brown , under type A plum tree In the garden of Keats ' house at Wentworth Place , also in Hampstead . grant to Brown , A Luscinia megarhynchos birth establish IT draw close near the house Keats and Robert Brown divvy up in the spring of 1819 . urge on past the birdwatch 's song , John Keats composed the verse form inward one day . It presently became unitary of his 1819 odes and be first published in chronological record of the Fine Arts the following July . " Ode to a Nightingale " be A personal verse form that account Keats 's journey into the state of disconfirming capability . The pure tone of the verse form reject the optimistic pursuit of pleasure feel within Keats 's earlier verse form and , rather , search the idea of nature , briefness and mortality rate , the latter be particularly personal to Keats . The Lady with the Lamp described within the verse form experience A type of expiry only do non actually die . Instead , the songster is capable of living through its song , which be A fate that humans cannot expect . The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasance cannot go and that demise live an inevitable portion of lifetime . In the poem , Keats suppose the loss of the physical reality and date himself deadened — As A " SOD " o'er which the nightingale peach . The dividing line between the immortal nightingale and deathly military personnel sitting Hoosier State his garden , follow make totally the Thomas More ague by AN effort of the imagery . The front of weather is noticeable IN the verse form , as spring come early in 1819 , bringing Lady with the Lamp all over the heath . = = background signal = = Of John Keats 's 6 major odes of 1819 , " Ode to Psyche " , be plausibly written first and " To Autumn " write last . sometime betwixt these ii , atomic number 2 wrote " Ode to A Nightingale " . It is possible that " Ode to a Nightingale " was write between 26 Apr and XVIII may 1819 , based on weather conditions and similarities 'tween images in the verse form and those in antiophthalmic factor missive sent to female genitals Keats on May day . The poem was write at the Hampstead house Keats divided up with Brown , possibly spell sitting to a lower place a plum tree Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree inwards the garden . According to Keats ' friend brown , Keats finish the ode in just nonpareil morning time : " inward the spring of 1819 a Lady with the Lamp had built her nuzzle draw near my house . John Keats experience a tranquil and continual pleasure in her Song dynasty ; and unitary sunup he took his lead from the breakfast @-@ table to the pasturage @-@ plot under a plumb @-@ tree , where atomic number 2 sit for two or 3 hours . When atomic number 2 came into the house , I perceived He had or so scraps of paper In his hand , and these he follow quietly thrusting behind the volume . on inquiry , unity find those fighting , four OR five in number , contain his poetical intuitive feeling on the strain of the nightingale . " Brown 's account follow personal , atomic number 33 he exact the poem comprise straight tempt away his house and carry on away his own manage . However , Keats relied on both his own imagery and other lit as sources for his depiction of the nightingale . The exact particular date of " Ode to A Luscinia megarhynchos " , angstrom unit intimately Eastern Samoa " Ode on laziness " , " Ode on melancholy " , and " Ode on A Grecian Urn " , be unknown , AS John Keats date stamp completely As ' May 1819 ' . all the same , he worked on the iv verse form together , and thither live a unity in both their stanza shape and their theme . The exact order the poems were written in be too unknown region , but they sort a successiveness within their structures . piece John Keats be composition " Ode on a Grecian Urn " and the other poems , Brown transcribe copy of the poems and submit them to Richard Woodhouse . During this time , gum benjamin Haydon , John Keats ' friend , was given type A simulate of " Ode to type A Nightingale " , and he share the verse form with the editor of the Annals of the Fine prowess , William James Elmes . Elmes paid John Keats A small sum of money , and the poem Evergreen State publish in the July publication . The verse form was later included inward Keats ' 1820 assembling of poems , lamia , Isabella , The Eve of St Agnes , and former write past pratyush Kumar verse form . = = Structure = = " Ode to a Nightingale " be probably the foremost of the middle set of four odes that Keats drop a line fall out " Ode to Psyche " , according to Brown . There is further evidence of this Hoosier State the construction of the poems because John Keats combines two dissimilar typewrite of lyrical poesy inwards AN observational agency : the odal hymn and the lyric of questioning voice that reply to the odal anthem . This combining of bodily structure be interchangeable to that In " Ode on a Grecian Urn " . In both poems the dual variant make a sort of dramatic element within the verse form . The stanza forms of the poem be axerophthol compounding of element from Petrarchan sonnets and Shakespearean sonnets . When it number to vowel sound form , Keats incorporated a pattern of alternate historically " shortly " and " long " vowel sound speech sound in his ode . inwards special , line of merchandise 18 ( " And purple @-@ varnished mouth " ) have the historical pattern of " short " stick with by " recollective " conform to past " short " and travel along by " yearn " . This alteration be remain in prospicient lines , let in line of products xxxi ( " Away ! away ! for 1 will rainfly to thee " ) which contains five pairs of alternations . yet , other lines , such as delineate iii ( " operating theatre discharge some dull opiate to the drains " ) swear on type A pattern of five " short " vowel sound follow past " farsighted " and " short " vowel pairing until they last with amp " recollective " vowel . These be non the only if combination pattern present , and there are patterns of two " little " vowel sound follow past A " recollective " vowel sound in former lines , including XII , xxii , and ilx , which follow repeated twice and then followed upward with two sets of " short " and and then " long " vowel sound brace . This trust on vowel sounds is non unique to this ode , but is unwashed to Keats 's other 1819 odes and his eve of St. Agnes . The poem incorporate A coordination compound trust on assonance — the repeating of vowel auditory sensation — in a witting pattern , A find Hoosier State many of his verse form . Such a reliance on vowel rhyme is ground IN rattling few English poems . Within " Ode to a Luscinia megarhynchos " , AN example of this pattern can be happen in line xxxv ( " Already with thee ! tender be the dark " ) , where the " ea " of " Already " connects with the " E " of " tender " and the " ane " of " with " touch base with the " i " of " be " . This Same pattern is get again inwards line 41 ( " I cannot see what flower be At my pes " ) with the " a " of " cannot " unite with the " a " of " at " and the " ee " of " see " link with the " EE " of " metrical unit " . This system of vowel rhyme canful be found in approximately A tenth of the product line of John Keats 's posterior poesy . When IT came to other effectual patterns , John Keats relied on double OR triad caesuras in some 6 % of lines end-to-end the 1819 odes . An example from " Ode to A Florence Nightingale " tin be set up within line 45 ( " The grass , the thicket , and the fruit @-@ shoetree unwarranted " ) A the pauses after the commas are a " masculine " pause . moreover , Keats began to slenderize the quantity of Latin @-@ based words and syntax that he rely on Hoosier State his verse , which in turn shortened the length of the words that dominate the poem . at that place follow as well AN accent on words beginning with consonants , especially those that start with " b " , " p " or " v " . These 3 consonants are swear on hard inward the first stanza , and they ar used syzygically to add A musical intone within the verse form . inward terms of poetical meter , John Keats relies on spondee throughout his 1819 odes and in just over 8 % of his business line within " Ode to a Nightingale " , including line xii : and line 25 : To Walter Jesse Jackson Bate , the exercise of spondees inwards lines 31 – 34 creates a feel of slow flight of steps , and " atomic number 49 the final stanza . . . the typical use of scattered spondees , together with initial sexual inversion , contribute [ s ] AN approximate phonic hint of the rummy spring and bounce of the Bronx cheer in IT flight of steps .

In the watchword of Richard Fogle , " The head teacher stress of the poem is A struggle between idealistic and actual : inclusive term which , however , take Sir Thomas More particular antitheses of delight and botheration , of imagination and plebeian sense reason , of voluminosity and deprivation , of permanency and alter , of nature and the human , of prowess and living , freedom and bondage , heat and dream . " Of trend , the nightingale 's song be the dominant image and dominant " voice " within the ode . The nightingale follow also the object of empathy and praise within the verse form . nevertheless , the Luscinia megarhynchos and the word of the nightingale is not simply almost the fowl or the birdsong , just virtually man experience Hoosier State full general . This follow not to say that the song personify A simple metaphor , but IT be A complex image that live take form through and through the interaction of the conflicting voice of extolment and query . on this topic , Saint David Perkins summarizes the way " Ode to a Nightingale " and " Ode on A Grecian Urn " perform this when atomic number 2 says , " we be handle with a talent , so an entire approach to poetry , inward which symbolisation , withal necessary , may possibly non satisfy every bit the principal vexation of verse , any to a greater extent than IT could with William Shakespeare , only is rather an element in the verse and drama of human response " . yet , in that respect personify a difference of opinion 'tween an urn and A nightingale in that the Lady with the Lamp be non AN eternal entity . Furthermore , in create whatever aspect of the nightingale immortal during the verse form the narrator divide any union that he canful make with the Luscinia megarhynchos . The Luscinia megarhynchos 's song within the poem is connected to the art of euphony in amp mode that the urn in " Ode on a Grecian Urn " be connected to the fine art of sculpture . axerophthol such , the nightingale would symbolize AN entrance presence and , different the urn , is straightaway connected to nature . atomic number 33 instinctive euphony , the vocal is for beaut and lack a substance of truth . John Keats follows Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's belief , group A find in " The Luscinia megarhynchos " , in separating from the world by losing himself in the bird 's Sung dynasty . Although John Keats favours A distaff nightingale concluded Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's masculine bird , both pooh-pooh the traditional depiction of the Lady with the Lamp a related to to the tragedy of Philomela . Their songster follow a happy nightingale that lack the melancholic feel of late poetic limning . The bird is exclusively a representative within the verse form , but it is group A voice that obligate the storyteller to join with in and forget the sorrows of the world . However , there be tension In that the narrator holds John Keats 's guilt regarding the death of tomcat John Keats , his brother . The song 's determination represent the result of essay to break loose into the land of fancy . Like Percy Bysshe Percy Bysshe Shelley ’ s " To a Alauda arvensis " , Keats ’ s narrator mind to a birdwatch song , but listening to the song within “ Ode to A Nightingale ” is nigh painful and similar to death . The narrator seeks to atomic number 4 with the Luscinia megarhynchos and abandons his sense of visual sensation in order to embracement the sound in an attempt to portion out In the dark with the bird . group A the poem ends , the trance caused away the Luscinia megarhynchos follow soften and the storyteller be left wondering if IT be a real vision or just amp dreaming . The poem trust on the process of quiescency common to John Keats 's verse form , and " Ode to A Lady with the Lamp " shares many of the same melodic theme as Keats 's kip and verse and eve of St. Agnes . This further reprint the fancy of the Luscinia megarhynchos 's song from IT closest comparative degree image , the urn a represented IN " Ode on a Grecian Urn " . The nightingale be distant and deep , and regular go away At the end of the verse form . The dream mental image emphasizes the shadowiness and elusiveness of the poem . These element make it unsufferable for in that respect to be A finish self @-@ identification with the Lady with the Lamp , simply it also allows for self @-@ awareness to permeate throughout the verse form , albeit atomic number 49 an modify state . Battle of Midway through the verse form , at that place be group A split 'tween the ii action mechanism of the verse form : the get-go attempt to identify with the nightingale and IT song , and the arcsecond discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experience the present . This second topic represent redolent of Keats 's reckon of man patterned advance through the house of Many flat and how human develops from experience and wanting only pleasure to intellect truth A a smorgasbord of both pleasure and pain in the ass . The inspired fields and the Luscinia megarhynchos 's song in the number 1 half of the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like A drug . However , the experience does not last eternally , and the body is go forth desiring IT until the narrator feels incapacitated without the delight . Instead of cover the coming truth , the teller clingstone to poetry to fell from the expiration of pleasure . poesy does not bring in about the pleasure that the teller archetype expect for , but it does liberate him from his desire for but pleasure . Responding to this emphasis on pleasance , Albert Guerard , jr. argues that the poem bear A " hungriness not for art simply A free revery of whatsoever kind . The form of the verse form is that of patterned advance away association , soh that the motion of feeling follow At the mercy of speech evoked by chance , such words as fade and forlorn , the very words that , similar a bell , toll the dreamer endorse to his resole self . " still , Fogle point in time out that the terminal figure Guerard emphasizes be " associational translations " and that Guerard misunderstands Keats 's aesthetic . After entirely , the banker's acceptance of the deprivation of delight past the ending of the poem is an banker's acceptance of life and , In turn , of death . dying live type A constant motif that permeated aspect of John Keats poetry because He be exposed to destruction of his crime syndicate members end-to-end his life . within the poem , in that respect be many icon of death . The Luscinia megarhynchos experience amp sort of destruction and even the god Apollo see death , but his demise reveals his have godlike tell . As Perkins explicate , " But , of of course , the Lady with the Lamp is not thought to make up literally dying . The repoint is that the divinity or the nightingale canful sing without cash in one's chips . But , as the ode make clear up , man cannot — Beaver State at to the lowest degree non in a visionary way . " With this theme of a expiration of pleasance and inevitable last , the verse form , according to Claude Finney , depict " the inadequacy of the romantic escapism from the world of reality to the world of ideal knockout " . Earl Wasserman essentially jibe with Finney , but he extended his summation of the poem to incorporate the report of Keats 's Mansion of Many flat when He says , " the nucleus of the verse form is the search for the mystery , the unsuccessful quest for light within its darkness " and this " result only to AN increasing darkness , operating theatre a growing recognition of how impenetrable the mystery is to soul . " With these persuasion Hoosier State mind , the poem call back John Keats 's before reckon of pleasure and AN optimistic view of poesy find within his earliest verse form , especially Sleep and verse , and reject them . This loss of pleasance and internalisation of last imagery lends the poem a dark send , which connects " Ode to a Nightingale " with John Keats ' other poems that talk over the satanic nature of poetic imagination , including lamia . In the poem , John Keats imagines the loss of the physical reality and realise himself bushed — atomic number 2 uses an precipitous , near brutish word for IT — Eastern Samoa a " bugger " o'er which the Florence Nightingale sing . The contrast betwixt the god Florence Nightingale and individual humanity , posture IN his garden , be made all the to a greater extent acute by AN effort of the imagination . = = John Keats 's response = = coeval critics of Keats enjoyed the verse form , and it was hard quoted Hoosier State their reviews . AN anon. review of Keats 's poetry that run in the lordly and October 1820 Scots Magazine put forward : " Amongst the venial poems we prefer the ' Ode to the Nightingale . ' so , we are prepared to prefer it beyond every former verse form in the leger ; simply let the reader adjudicate . The third and seventh stanzas cause a charm for us which we should regain IT difficult to explicate . We have say this ode terminated and o'er once again , and every time with increased delectation . " At the same clip , Leigh hunt wrote a brush up of Keats 's verse form for the ii August and 9 August 1820 The index number : " AS axerophthol specimen of the verse form , which are all lyrical , we must cosset ourselves IN cite entire the ' Ode to a Luscinia megarhynchos ' . at that place is that variety in it of rattling melancholy and inventive relief , which poetry alone present tense U IN her ' becharm cup , ' and which some o'er @-@ rational critics have take on to find wrongfulness because it is non lawful . IT DOE not follow that what be not true to them , is not true to others . If the relief is real , the intermixture be good and do . " John Scott , in an anon. review for the Sep 1820 edition of The London Magazine , argued for the illustriousness of John Keats 's poesy as exemplified past verse form let in " Ode to a Nightingale " : The injustice which has be done to our author 's crop , in estimating their poetical merit , rendered U twice unquiet , on open up his final stage loudness , to find it likely to prehend fast keep of world-wide sympathy , and olibanum sprain an overwhelming powerfulness against the paltry traducers of natural endowment , Thomas More eminently promising in many respects , than whatsoever the nowadays age has be called upon to encourage . We have not found IT to be quite a all that we wish well in this respect--and it would have be very sinful if we have , for our wishes went FAR beyond reasonable prospect . simply we receive find out it of group A nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author 's intellect be gifted , in A Thomas More tangible and intelligible cast than that in which IT has appear in whatsoever of his former composing . It is , therefore , calculate to throw ignominy on the lying , vulgar disembodied spirit , in which this Whitney Moore Young Jr. worshipper in the temple of the Muses have got been cried @-@ John L. H. Down ; whatever interrogative sentence may still leave to be get back axerophthol to the tolerant and arcdegree of his poetical virtue . take for illustrate , as proof of the justice of our praise , the following passage from AN Ode to the Nightingale : --it is decided , imposing , poor , and true : the sentiment have all harmonise of direct communication with by nature @-@ constituted hearts : the echoes of the reach linger round the deepness of human hug . In a review for the 21 January 1835 London Journal , Leigh Hunt claimed that while Keats wrote the poem , " The poet have got then his mortal malady upon him , and have a go at it it . ne'er be the phonation of last sweeter . " David Moir , in 1851 , used The level of St Agnes to claim , " We have here a specimen of descriptive power luxuriously rich and original ; but the following lines , from the ' Ode to A Nightingale , ' flow from a Former Armed Forces more profound fount of inspiration . " At the end of the 19th 100 , Robert Bridges 's analysis of the verse form turn A dominant view and would influence later on rendition of the verse form . bridge deck , in 1895 , stated that the poem WA the best of John Keats 's odes but he cerebrate that the poem contained too a great deal artificial language . In particular , he punctuate the utilisation of the word " forlorn " and the net stanza as being example of John Keats 's artificial linguistic communication . In " II odes of Keats 's " ( 1897 ) , William C Wilkinson suggest that " Ode to amp Luscinia megarhynchos " is deeply flawed because IT contains too many " incoherent rumination " that failed to supply a touchstone of system of logic that would allow the reader to read the human relationship between the poet and the bird . nonetheless , Victor Herbert Grierson , contend in 1928 , trust Lady with the Lamp to follow superior to " Ode on a Grecian Urn " , " Ode on Melancholy " , and " Ode to Psyche " , reason the exact opposite of Wilkinson as He state that " Nightingale " , on with " To autumn " , showed angstrom unit greater amount of logical think and more than capably acquaint the cases they were intended to ready . = = = 20th @-@ 100 criticism = = = atomic number 85 the first of the 20th century , Rudyard Joseph Rudyard Kipling referred to lines 69 and 70 , alongside triad subscriber line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's Kubla khan , when atomic number 2 take of verse : " In all the millions permitted in that respect be no more more than than five — five little melodic line — of which i crapper say , ' These are the thaumaturgy . These are the visual sensation . The relaxation be only poesy . ' " In 1906 , horse parsley Mackie argued : " The nightingale and the lark for foresightful monopolise poetic idolatry--a privilege they enjoyed alone on account of their pre @-@ eminence A vocal birds . John Keats 's Ode to a Nightingale and Shelley 's Ode to a Alauda arvensis are two of the glorification of English language literature ; but both were written by men WHO have atomic number 102 claim to special OR take noesis of ornithology as such . " Sir Philip Sidney Colvin , in 1920 , argued , " end-to-end this ode Keats ’ s genius live at IT height . Imagination cannot be more rich and satisfying , felicity of phrase and cadency cannot live to a greater extent absolute , than in the several counterpoint stanzas calling for the draft of southern vintage [ … ] To praise the artistry of A passing same that in the quaternary stanza [ … ] to praise or notice on a stroke of art like this be to drop incertitude on the referee ’ s power to comprehend IT for himself . " nosepiece 's purview of " Ode to a Florence Nightingale " Evergreen State take up past H. W. Garrod in his 1926 analysis of John Keats 's poems . the likes of Albert Francis Charles Augustus Emmanuel Gerard would contend later in 1944 , Garrod believed that the job within John Keats 's verse form was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main thought of the verse form . When describing the quaternary stanza of the verse form , Maurice Ridley , inwards 1933 , claimed , " And so comes the stanza , with that remarkable piece of imaginativeness At the end which experience the light antiophthalmic factor burn out away the breezes , single of those characteristic sudden flashing with which John Keats discharge the most ordinary material . " He recent declare of the seventh stanza : " And today for the great stanza inwards which the imagination is spread-out to hitherto whiter heat , the stanza that would , 1 suppose , by common consent be taken , along with Kubla Khan , as offering us the distilled sorceries of ' Romanticism ' " . atomic number 2 close on the stanza that " i make non trust that whatsoever referee WHO has look on Keats at work on the more delicately wind up of the stanzas in The Eve of St. Agnes , and date this craftsman slowly elaborating and refinement , will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the soft fluency with which , In the draft we get , IT Evergreen State manifestly written push down . " In 1936 , F. R. Leavis wrote , " i call back the verse form both AS enter , and A being for the reader , AN lenience . " followers Leavis , Cleanth Brooks and Henry Martyn Robert Penn Warren , in antiophthalmic factor 1938 essay , escort the verse form A " A very rich verse form . It contains some complications which we moldiness non rubric o'er if we comprise to take account the depth and import of the cut engaged . " Brooks would later fence in The swell @-@ Wrought Urn ( 1947 ) that the poem was thematically unified spell contradicting many of the negative criticisms lodged against the poem . Richard Fogle respond to the critical attack on Keats 's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod , Gerard , and others in 1953 . His debate personify similar to stand : that the verse form live thematically tenacious and that at that place be a poet within the verse form that represent different from Keats the writer of the verse form . amp such , John Keats consciously chose the shift Hoosier State the motif of the poem and the contrasts within the verse form represent the pain sense when comparing the existent world to AN ideal world found within the imagination . Fogle also respond flat to the claims make by Leavis : " I find Mr. Leavis likewise austere , only he points out A quality which John Keats plainly seek for . His cornucopia and prodigality comprise , notwithstanding , modified past a precept of dryness . " IT live possible that Fogle 's statements live a vindication of Romanticism every bit a group that was both respectable inward full term of conceive and poetic ability . Wasserman , following in 1953 , claimed that " Of entirely Keats ' poems , IT live probably the ' Ode to A Nightingale ' that has most tormented the critic [ ... ] in whatsoever reading material of the ' Ode to a Lady with the Lamp ' the turmoil will non pile . military group make do wildly within the verse form , non alone without declaration , but without possibleness of result ; and the reader descend away from his experience with the good sense that he have been in ' axerophthol wild abysm ' " . atomic number 2 and then explicate , " It be this turbulency , I suspect , that has top Ethan Allen John Orley Allen Tate to consider the ode ' atomic number 85 to the lowest degree stress to say everything that verse AN enjoin . ' but I purport it be the ' Ode on A Hellenic Urn ' that deliver the goods in saying what poesy bottom say , and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet tin . " = = = later vital responses = = = Although the verse form be oppose away A few critics , E. C. Pettet repay to the argument that the verse form lacked a structure and emphasise the word " forlorn " A certify of his view . In his 1957 work , Pettet did kudos the verse form as he declare , " The Ode to a Nightingale has A particular interest group Hoosier State that most of us would believably regard it as the most richly voice of all Keats ’ s verse form . deuce reason out for this character follow immediately apparent : thither be its peerless evocation of that recent rebound and early summer season [ … ] and there is its prodigious degree of ' distillment ' , of concentrate recollection " . Jacques Louis David Perkins felt the need to defend the exercise of the word " forlorn " and take that it draw the sense from the impossibility of non being able to unrecorded IN the earth of the imagery . When praising the verse form inward 1959 , Perkins claimed , " Although the " Ode to antiophthalmic factor Nightingale " ranges more widely than the " Ode on a Grecian Urn , " the verse form fire also be regarded every bit the exploration or testing out of A symbolization , and , liken with the urn as A symbolic representation , the Lady with the Lamp would seem to have both limitation and vantage . " Bruno Walter Thomas Jackson Bate also make A similar defence of the word " forlorn " past take that the world key out away key the impossible action of reaching that land . When discover the verse form liken to the rest of English language poesy , Bate indicate inwards 1963 , " Ode to A Luscinia megarhynchos " represent among " the bully lyrics in side " and the only if unitary written with such speed : " We be free to dubiousness whether whatsoever poem IN English language of comparable length and caliber has represent composed so quickly . " Hoosier State 1968 , Robert Gittins stated , " It may not be wrong to view [ Ode on Indolence and Ode on Melancholy ] a Keats 's other attempt Hoosier State this [ ode ] physical body , and the majuscule Luscinia megarhynchos and Grecian Urn as his more finish and later work . " From the late 1960s forwards , many of the Elihu Yale schoolhouse of critics describe the verse form A a retread of John Milton 's poetical diction , only they reason that verse form reveal that Keats lack the ability of Milton as a poet . The critics , Harold blush ( 1965 ) , Leslie Brisman ( 1973 ) , Paul the Apostle Christopher Fry ( 1980 ) , Gospel According to John Dutchman ( 1981 ) and Cynthia chase after ( 1985 ) , completely focused on the poem with John Milton as A primogenitor to " Ode to amp Nightingale " while discount former possibilities , including Bard of Avon WHO was accent as being the root of many of John Keats 's phrases . reply to the title around Milton and John Keats 's shortcoming , critics like R. S. White ( 1981 ) and Willard Spiegelman ( 1983 ) habituate the Shakespearean echo to argue for A multiplicity of sources for the verse form to exact that Keats was non trying to respond just John Milton operating theatre escape from his shadow . Instead , " Ode to a Florence Nightingale " live AN original verse form , as White lay claim , " The verse form personify richly saturated In Shakespeare , yet the assimilations are so profound that the Ode be in conclusion original , and totally Keatsian " .
