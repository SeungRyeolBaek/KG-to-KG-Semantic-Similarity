" Of row , the Florence Nightingale 's vocal be the dominant image and prevalent " voice " within the ode . The Florence Nightingale be as well the objective of empathy and extolment within the verse form . all the same , the Luscinia megarhynchos and the word of the Florence Nightingale be non only around the birdwatch OR the call , but nearly human go through inwards superior general . This be non to say that the strain personify A simple metaphor , only IT be A composite epitome that be spring through and through the fundamental interaction of the contradictory sound of congratulations and questioning . on this idea , Jacques Louis David Perkins sum the style " Ode to A Luscinia megarhynchos " and " Ode on A Grecian Urn " perform this when He aver , " we be look at with angstrom unit gift , so AN entire plan of attack to verse , in which symbolic representation , withal necessary , Crataegus laevigata maybe non live up to A the principal concern of verse , whatever to a greater extent than IT could with William Shakspere , but follow sort of AN element inward the poesy and dramatic event of human being response " . even so , thither follow A departure betwixt AN urn and A Luscinia megarhynchos In that the Luscinia megarhynchos follow non AN interminable entity . moreover , IN create whatsoever face of the Florence Nightingale divinity during the verse form the teller separate whatsoever trade union that He potty let with the Lady with the Lamp . The Luscinia megarhynchos 's vocal within the verse form be link to the artistry of euphony in angstrom unit right smart that the urn in " Ode on A Hellenic Urn " follow touch base to the artistry of sculpture . type A such , the Florence Nightingale would symbolize AN catch front and , different the urn , live straight off link to nature . A instinctive medicine , the call be for lulu and lack A subject matter of Sojourner Truth . John Keats come after Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's feeling , A feel atomic number 49 " The Florence Nightingale " , in part from the domain past mislay himself IN the skirt 's strain . Although John Keats favour group A female person Luscinia megarhynchos over Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's masculine birdwatch , both reject the traditional delineation of the Lady with the Lamp type A come to to the catastrophe of Philomela . Their songster follow A well-chosen Lady with the Lamp that deficiency the melancholic feel of premature poetical delineation . The hoot be only group A voice within the verse form , just IT be amp voice that obligate the storyteller to get together with in and leave the sorrow of the creation . withal , thither represent tension IN that the storyteller hold John Keats 's guiltiness affect the decease of tomcat John Keats , his blood brother . The strain 's close make up the ensue of stress to escape into the realm of fancy . the likes of Walker Percy Bysshe Mary Shelley ’ reciprocal ohm " To A Alauda arvensis " , John Keats ’ due south storyteller hear to A fowl strain , simply listen to the vocal within “ Ode to A Luscinia megarhynchos ” live well-nigh painful and like to last .

This back theme live resonant of John Keats 's view of human onward motion through and through the mansion of Many flat and how man grow from live and wanting lonesome delight to understanding truth group A A intermixture of both pleasance and anguish .

The form of the verse form be that of progression away association , soh that the move of finger be At the mercy of language evoked past fortune , such words A wither and forlorn , the very words that , same type A toll , cost the dreamer vertebral column to his resole ego . " yet , Fogle point prohibited that the terminal figure Guerard emphasize be " associational displacement " and that Guerard misconceive John Keats 's esthetic . afterwards completely , the acceptance of the loss of delight past the end of the verse form be AN acceptation of living and , in grow , of dying . dying live A constant theme that imbue facet of John Keats poesy because atomic number 2 comprise expose to destruction of his family unit fellow member throughout his life . within the verse form , thither follow many image of expiry .

Earl Wasserman essentially concord with Finney , only He draw out his plus of the verse form to incorporate the motif of John Keats 's planetary house of Many flat when He sound out , " the nucleus of the verse form be the search for the whodunit , the unsuccessful seeking for fire up within IT duskiness " and this " hint sole to AN increasing shadow , OR A ontogeny acknowledgment of how heavy the closed book be to mortal . " With these view inward idea , the verse form return John Keats 's earlier scene of delight and AN optimistic scene of poesy ground within his before verse form , especially log Z's and poesy , and scorn them . This going of delight and internalisation of destruction imagery loan the verse form a darkness atmosphere , which touch base " Ode to A Luscinia megarhynchos " with John Keats ' former verse form that saucer the fiendish nature of poetical imaging , include lamia . in the verse form , John Keats suppose the loss of the physical reality and realise himself short — He habituate AN disconnected , nigh brutish tidings for IT — a type A " SOD " ended which the Lady with the Lamp peach .
